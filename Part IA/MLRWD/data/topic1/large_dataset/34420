For anyone looking at Fulci's epic on Amazon or anyone reading mine or the other reviews, buy this DVD.  A story synopsis is really unnecessary here.  I know plenty of people will say that "The Beyond" is Lucio Fulci's best (I admit it's his most polished), but my personal fave from Fulci is "Zombi 2".  Here is a movie where calling the undead a zombie is totally appropriate.  Don't get me wrong, I love Romero's "Dead" trilogy (haven't seen the fourth one yet), but there's something really creepy, disturbing and unsettling about the correctly labeled zombies here.  They are simply the most disgusting, bloated, slobbering, decaying, worm covered bogosities around.  The zombies here move in an unique way, as if they were really re-animated stiffs.  Plus, there's all that moaning going on.

  The similarity between the basic premise between Fulci's & Romero's Zombie films are apparent, but "Zombi 2" was written before "Dawn of the Dead" as "Zombie".  You learn that and much more during the special features with interviews and an incredible 98 minute documentary including interviews with the Italian version of Rob Bottin, Gianetto De Rossi (who did the special make-up FX here as well as many other Italian splatter features).  Interesting note, I thought Gianetto De Rossi & Gino Di Rossi were the same person, guess what, they're not!  Similar names, same profession, go figure!

  This DVD is a must have for anyone who is a horror fan, especially fans of this particular sub-genre.  Great features, the picture and sound are really incredible.  The only negative thing I can say, and it's minor, is the commentary by Ian McCullough.  I have nothing against the guy but his commentary is somewhat lame, he openly admits that his first time watching the movie from start to finish was right there at the commentary session!  He has a couple of interesting anecdotes, but they should have gotten someone like Chas Balun.  I would love to hear that commentary!
