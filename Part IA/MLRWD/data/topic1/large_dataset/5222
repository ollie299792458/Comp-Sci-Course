I really like Scorcese's work, and this is one of my more favorites. In this darkly humorous film he returns to NYC to tell several stories, the primary being that of Nic Cage playing a paramedic determined to quit his  job, but who just can't let go. We see how he spends his nights, amidst the  flotsom and jetsom of NY, saving a few, losing some, and mostly, as he says  "bearing witness" to the injury and death that surrounds  him.
The supporting characters in this film were all strong. From the  confused girl he tries to connect with, to the wild and crazy medics he  works with, to the cynical and depressed doctors he interacts with, even  the suave drug dealer are all fully fleshed out and intriguing. 
This is  not a feel-good movie. It's not a date movie. It's not a chick flick. It's  a movie that will make you think, that will swirl around in your head for a  while and even disturb you a bit. But that can be a good thing, and makes  this movie all the better, in my opinion. Well worth the rental, or  purchase on DVD.
