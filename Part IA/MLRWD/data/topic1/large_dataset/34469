This film had the unenviable task of taking Street Fighter and making it "realistic" for live action audiences.

How many of you are familiar with the actual storyline from the Street Fighter games?  IT'S RIDICULOUS.  The official Capcom Street Fighter story is filled with green mutants, people coming back from the dead, men who wrestle bears, levitating crime lords in bright red clown suits, and two men (that's right TWO) who can stretch their arms and legs a good 10 - 20 feet.

Stuff like this simply cannot be translated to live action very well.  I'm sorry, it just can't.  For this reason, I can respect their decision to approach this movie in a more realistic way, unlike the first live action SF movie featuring Van Damme...rest assured, this movie is much more reasonable than that one.

Once you accept the fact that this is an ADAPTATION of the Street Fighter STORY and not an IMITATION of the GAME, you will probably enjoy this movie much more.

It's your typical action flick.  If you dig those, you can dig this one, too.

Especially if you can appreciate strong female leads, which are too rare in the martial art/action genre.  Kreuk plays Chun as respectable and tough...cute, but not "over-sexified".  A fine balance.

Bison is an enjoyable villain.

Nash is hilarious.  If you don't take him (or yourself) too seriously, you will laugh at him at least once.

And, is that...Crimson Viper?  Hmm...check out the bonus features to find out...

Bottom line:  Don't strain your brain too hard.  It's a martial arts/action film based on the SF franchise.  It's not Gone With the Wind.  It's not Titanic.  Relax people and let yourself enjoy.
