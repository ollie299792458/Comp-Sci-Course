The primary  fear always has been one: the fear of having fear. The movie is a history of this awareness.
We can remember how many times the cinema (as the books...) tries to scare the public by showing the terrified, shocked expressions of the characters which are watching some awful and menacing thing that are coming to them.  Their look is more contagious than the advancing monster.
This happens because we watch an already formed emotion, and it's hard to put ourselves in the situation shown by the movie, it's easier to put ourselves in the emotion of people like us. And if to put ourselves just in our emotion is easier too, what can it happen when we watch just our terror?
The Mark's story  tells all this, when child he was tormented by father, a scientist (but worst father and worst scientist) which had nice time in scaring him in every way.
Even I have felt a bit sadist  the innocent shootings made inside families: who is back the camera always has power, the others are always forced because taken: forced to be easy or to play , this is not important; however that chip of time and life is removed. 
Perhaps there is a true when somebody does not want to been taken or  snapped, because he is in afraid that photograph can thieve the spirit.
This movie is a very good film and shows a deep meditation about cinema and fear.
