Given the monster amount of goodies and special features for the two-disc version of Iron Man, I was pretty eager to purchase the same for Iron Man 2.  But I find myself painfully disappointed.  The full content of extras includes two featurettes (totaling 15 minutes), 5 deleted scenes, and a music video.  Overall, I find the whole of it to be sorely lacking, particularly in comparison to the first one.  The only advantages (for some people) are the commentary by Jon Favreau, and the transferable digital copy.  For myself, if I had known it would be so sparse, I would've saved a few dollars and bought the single-disc edition.

As for the movie itself, I liked it as well as the first.  They both suffer plot and character issues, but succeed because of the charisma of Robert Downey Jr.  Yes, the second one has just a little bit too many characters with just a little bit too much going on, but unlike Dark Knight, it never loses track of its protagonist, still serving at the core of the film, and pushing it along to make it every bit as good as the best of its genre.
