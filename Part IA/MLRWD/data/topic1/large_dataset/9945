There's no use repeating the synopsis, as that's been done wonderfully well by others. But, it's worth saying again what a cinematic masterpiece this film is. I've seen this movie at least 25 times, and it becomes more awe inspiring with each viewing, because the more you see it, the more you want to see it. A five star rating is simply insufficient.

Beautifully acted, marvelously directed, and wonderfully written, "The Song of Bernadette" will thrill and inspire you. If you ever wondered what a real saint looked and acted like, Jennifer Jones' incredible portrayal of Bernadette will demonstrate that to you. The music alone will take you on a journey of wonder. The heartbreaking but beautifully moving ending scene will cause you to look at yourself and the world differently, if only for a few moments.

Like the opening title says: "For those who believe in God, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't believe in God, no explanation is possible." If you are a believer, this film will only strengthen your faith. If you are straddling the fence or just want to be able to believe, after watching this beautiful and fact-based film, you will.
