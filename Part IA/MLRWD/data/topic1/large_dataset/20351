After seeing "The Queen" in theatres and being completely blown away by Helen Mirren's acting ability, I purchased the Elizabeth I DVD without having seen it, and I have to say that I have rarely been so impressed with any miniseries (or movie, or television show for that matter) and that is entirely due to Helen Mirren. This is a beautiful story, extremely well written and directed, and spectacularly acted. As Queen Elizabeth I, the notoriously hot-tempered, passionate, and arrogant woman who ruled England for 45 years, Helen Mirren makes us laugh with her, cry with her, and cower when she is provoked or challenged by someone questioning her authority. According to historical experts on Elizabeth I, this movie, and Helen's performance, come closer to getting at what the Queen was really like as a person than any other film has ever done.

Jeremy Irons and Hugh Dancy are wonderful as well, and Irons in particular, as the sardonic, protective, and smitten Earl of Leicester, the Queen's best friend and only true love. Though he cannot marry her, he stands by her side and (with one notable exception), is entirely honest with her, even when telling the truth is sure to provoke one of the Queen's blind rages.

There is one slight liberty taken with the plot; it is true (and acknowledged by Helen and the writers in the special features on the DVD, as well as in interviews) that Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots never met, and that if they had it would have been done in absolute secrecy; the movie shows them meeting but it is done in secret, so I was able to overlook the fact that in truth, that meeting did not take place.

Seriously, if you like period pieces and you want to see great writing, direction, costumes, and spectacular acting, see this version of Elizabeth I. Helen Mirren alone makes it worth watching, and everyone else in it it fabulous too.
