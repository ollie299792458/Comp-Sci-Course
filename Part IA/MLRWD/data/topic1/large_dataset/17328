I'm not fooling myself into believing that this film is anything more than "First Blood" with a brain.  Substitute Sylvester Stallone with a MUCH MUCH MUCH better actor, Col. Troutman with cinema's other great Tommy Lee. and Brian Denehy's red neck posse with the FBI and a covert Sweeper team and you have "The HUnted".  That said, this is an unbelievably good film.
  Like "First Blood" this movie is all about knives...not nifty ones with blades twelve feet long with handy hollow handels filled with fishing line, sewing kits, portable toasters, an electric blanket, and a nose-hair trimmer..no these are real functional knives.  combat knives wrought from raw steel or a chunk of flint.  Furthermore they are about the men who weild them: The troubled and possibly paranoid trained killer, and the man who trained him.
  DOn't forget the Johnny Cash music.
The opening battle scene is as gritty and distubingly realistic as anything I've seen, and the one-on-one fights are absolutely plausible and true.  No one is being hoisted by a winch, pulled on wires, or being filmed by ninety cameras to provide nifty 360 views...this is BETTER.
 Just when we were on the verge of forhetting what the real world looks like a film like "The Hunted" saves us for an hour or so.
