I used to be addicted to the show, spending whole weekends watching it. However, season 6 (and also season 7) became a HUGE disappointment. Rory could be nicknamed "Boring Rory". Just because her boyfriend's father tell her she doesn't have "it" for journalism she jumps out of school, steals a boat and hides herself in her grandmother's house? Give me a break!!! That's the behaviour we expect from a stupid, spoilt and imature little girl, not at all what she used to be in the 5 previous seasons. And after that, it became really hard to imagine what brilliant, cute and funny Logan could possibly see in her to be in love with her. And, after making a complete fool of herself after stealing the boat and jumping out of school, she refuses to talk to her mother, which proved a heartless behaviour.

The non stopping talking, Lorelai's mark, became just annoying, besides the fact she and Luke have no chemistry, although she and Christopher have plenty.

To make it short, the caracthers lost their personality along the 6th and now 7th season. Even in other shows like Friends, when the plots weren't that funny anymore, the caracthers would have the same essence and their personalities didn't change like the ones in this season 6.

A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
