Amazingly, Vampires Suck does show progress for writers/directors Friedberg and Seltzer.  Unlike Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, and Disaster Movie (all extremely terrible, pointless, and unfunny), this movie is just mostly unfunny.  Also unlike all their previous projects--which would just constantly throw random pop-culture references at the audience--this movie almost manages to stay completely in the Twilight/teen-vampire-romance genre.  And while it has some random moments and incidents who's consequences are erased by the next scene, they are kept to a minimum.

Oh, and the most exiting thing, there's actually a plot! Not just a paper-thin, full-of-holes excuse to bundle together unfunny references and racial stereotypes!  Someone must have actually managed to finally explain to Friedberg and Seltzer what a plot is, and they must have thought "hey, let's try that!" Not only did they try, but they came dangerously close to competently cramming the whole Twilight series into one movie.

Sure, most of the jokes aren't funny, and the ones that are have been around on You Tube for years, but after watching the brain-melting dribble of their previous films, I can't help but applaud their efforts to improve.  It's like their previous films were explosive diarrhea, but this one is a solid bowel movement.  Keep eating your vegetables, boys.
