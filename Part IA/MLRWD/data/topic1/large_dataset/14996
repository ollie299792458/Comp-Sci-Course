I think Papillon is one of the most underated movie of all time. For myself, I need to watch it at least once every year. First of all, look at the director, the guy made Patton and Planet of the apes and I would say that this movie has the tag of it's director, no doubt about it. Examples, the epic quality, the wonderful direction of actors and in my mind the most important quality which gave it the Franklin J. Schaffner stamp and uniqueness : the beautiful and rich colors of the outdoors with the beautiful cinematography. Think about it. what makes Patton and Planet of the apes so special, I would say the richness of the landscapes. Another great quality of the movie is the pace, the tempo is fast and for a 2 and a half hour movie, it's not easy to do. There is great action non stop but not in a "I have to put explosion and special effects as much as possible not to bore my audience" way, more like "I have great actors and great storytelling abilities so I'm gonna treat you with it". I love Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman as actors and here they play beautifully together much like Dustin with Jon Voigt in Midnight Cowboy. McQueen is the central character but he's not taking all the spotlight, he lets the other actors in and that's great directing in my mind. You don't see McQueen the superstar here you see McQueen the actor in a calm and interior performance, almost low-key. This is an action-adventure movie but with a relationship developping between two men which gives it more textures and complexity. So this is a wonderful movie and I recommand anyone to see it, you won't regret it.
