Okay, I am a hardcore Dawson's Creek fan...and yes I have bought this set of DVDs...but for a producer who was very passionate about this series, he didn't really put much into it. Some of the episodes look very grainy and the 100th episode, in the first flashback between Joey and Dawson, they forgot to mix in Dawson's dialogue so you only hear Joey talking, and Dawson's mouth moving, but no sound...all I have to say to Paul Stupin is..wtf? If he cared enough he might have taken the time to do some commentary, perhaps even get the rights to some of the better songs that they played during this season. For instance, the song in "Downtown Crossing"...the one Joeys dad used to sing to her, they cut out Joey humming the song and they replaced it with some other song. Mary Beth Meziarz is an awesome pianist and singer and they should have tried to keep her in the soundtracks. All we have here is the 23 episodes of the 5th season with music changes. Paul Stupin, I beg of you, please do something with Season 6...make buying these DVDs worth while!
