When I first heard of this movie I thought "What an interesting title for a movie" So that was the first thing that intrigued me about this film. The second thing that drew me into it was Gael Garcia Bernal.. I love him!! When I went to go see this in the theater I was amused by the story and compelled by the characters. At the the beginning of the film I thought that the film was only about sex and teenage experiences. But througout the film, you are drawn in and begin to realize just how poignant this story is. This film mixes comedy, drama and romance to show how important it is to make the most out of friendships, love and everyday life. If you can understand spanish that's also an added bonus because you will pick up some things that they miss in the subtitles (mostly swear words, but Diego and Gael make that highly entertaining)This movie incorporates a lot of sex in this story, even I was a little suprised. This movie is very cool and it also has substance!! I highly recommend this!!
