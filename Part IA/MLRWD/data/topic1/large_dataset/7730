Spoilers ahead! 
Sandler's character gets bullied around cause he directs his anger inwards instead of expressing it when appropriate. This is also why he gets anger management treatment. First lesson: anger management is not only about choleric but also about people who are unable to let out their anger and thus are in danger of to freaking out some day.
I think overall the humor was nice and sometimes intelligent. Unfortunately it becomes obvious very soon that the therapy is an elaborate ploy to get Sandler to express his emotions. At first I liked how the movie showed Sandler expressing more and more emotions, letting his anger out but what was subtle in the beginning gets predictable and obvious very soon.
Also I never thought for a second that "Buddy" is really hitting on Sandler's girlfriend or that he tries to steal Sandler's idea for proposing. Talking about Buddy - Jack Nicholson's performance really held the movie together, I really liked his acting in this movie, some funny stuff here.
The supporting characters were nicely done although John Turturro's character and those other two wackos were bothersome. I liked the cat and John McEnroe's cameo a lot btw...
Oh and don't mind the suspense of disbelief, like how the girlfriend pays for this treatment, but when watching comedies, you should always leave your sense for in-movie-realism outside.
What I liked about this movie was that it doesn't rely on creating humor through embarrassment all the time like many other awkward Sandler-flicks do. I really don't like this type of humor.
Unfortunately the ending is totally overdone and disgustingly corny. It really spoiled the movie for me. All in all I give this movie 5 points out of 10 (because of the bad ending).
If you haven't seen the movie yet and like Sandler/Nicholson/Comedies rent the DVD and grab some popcorn, you'll have an entertaining hour and a half. No more, no less.
