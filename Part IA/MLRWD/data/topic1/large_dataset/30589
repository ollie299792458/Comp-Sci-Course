A wormhole--something unproven--not anymore it isn't.  Astronaut John Crichton quickly realizes this when he's sucked down one, and spit out into the middle of an intergalactic space battle between escaping prisoners and the Peacekeepers.  John's module incidentally collides with a Peacekeeper Prowler, whcih turns out to be Bialar Crais' brother, who becomes John's enemy for the rest of season one.  The first episode quickly introduces the characters, and puts a slight emphasis on how that character is going to act through the series.  The premiere definitely should of been made into a two hour to allow for more characterization and more time to do everything.
  The second episode I still wonder why it is episode one.  Not much of anything happens in it.  There's good acting, and Rygel gets a chunk out of Aeryn's arm.  Wasn't a bad episode compared to most series, but for farscape, it's below average.
  The DVD features are descent, with footage not seen in the U.S. and with commentarys on both of the episodes.  A great collection.
