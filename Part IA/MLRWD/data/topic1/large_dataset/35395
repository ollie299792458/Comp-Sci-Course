The Amityville Horror, a film directed by Andrew Douglas, was released in 2005 starring Ryan Reynolds.  A combination of special effects, suspense, and a well written story line help to make this film an instant success in the cinemas.  If its mystery and on the edge of your seat suspense that the viewer craves, then this is the film to see.  After seeing this film once viewers everywhere will be begging for more!

 The film is based on a true story of a family murdered during their sleep by a brother/son, Ronnie DeFeo, who goes insane from spirits living in the house.  These spirits take control of the boy and convince him to commit the murders.  The film then moves on to show a family, a year later, move into the house and experience all the bizarre incidents that occur.  The main character, George Lutz, undergoes psychological changes and in the process is possessed by the same spirits that took over Ronnie.

 Most of the film takes the viewers through the different incidents that occurred to the family, which also makes viewers try to guess the outcome of the plot.  The first time I saw this film, I thought I had all the details figured out to solve the ending of the movie.  So without ruining the end all I will say is that the ending will leave you surprised, it did me!

 I definitely recommend this movie as a good thriller to sit in the dark with a group of friends and have a good scare.  I think the viewers will be pleased with the acting, plot, and organization of this film.  No one will go home disappointed with the surprising ending of The Amityville Horror.
