So these were originally produced by MGM -- you can tell by the lion that roars before all the credits  :)  But ended up belonging to Warners (thank goodness) who knows that there is gold in them there hills.  Saving -- and restoring -- these beautiful cartoons and the history they represent is worth the time, energy and creativity of everyone working on the project.

First, the color is astonishingly brilliant -- even better than the restoration color in the Looney Tunes.

Beyond that is the endless stream of creativity that makes the Droopy cartoons more than kiddie fodder.  This is where Jessica Rabbit was born.  This is where the 20th century technicolor realization of skirt-chasing men as big bad wolves came to life.  Not to mention the reckless abandon of letting the unconscious run wild without a conscious check and balance interveening.

I like to think of Droopy Dog as our own little unconscious representative.  There are not artificial manners or conscious controls on him or any of his cohorts.

And the laughs are still there after all this time.  There's the now standard disclaimer that some of these cartoons may not be politically correct and thus not fit for younger eyes and ears.... but we all know that.  This is Tex Avery of the 1950's, after all.

But historical context aside, these are just great pieces of animation art.  Thanks for saving them and restoring them to their original ccontent, and stunning color and sound.

Beware the later cartoons which are bland and without artistic value, and hold on tight for a look into animation without any hint of political correctness -- lest we forget, it's been a hell of a century.
