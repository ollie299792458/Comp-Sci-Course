While not X-Men comic fans as such, we were expecting some level of continuity and closure from the previous two X-Men movies. Jean's abrupt fate disappointed us, and as we reflected back on the rest of the movie, we realised that it was full of pointless sub-plots and a lack of depth to all the characters. Nothing made us feel for the fate of the mutants before the possibility of a "cure" as the previous movies would have done.

What was the point of introducing Angel? Why wasn't Mystique as astonishingly evil as she was before? Why was Jean so devoid of facial expression? Why not expand on Rogue as a character instead of relegade her to the lines of "well she was in the first two, so I guess she has to be in this one as well, but we sure aren't going to give her any real screen time"?

But the real disappointment was Jean's fate. What a boring way to end all that spectacle. Everything seemed to be pointing to a showdown between her and the "white boy" from Alcatraz. Would his power be enough to neutralize hers? Well ... I guess we'll never know. And we never find out what happened to him after his rescue.

I hope there is not another X-Men movie because we will almost certainly not watch it.
