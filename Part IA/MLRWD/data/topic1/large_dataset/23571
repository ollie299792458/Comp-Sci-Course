Yeah, this flick is pretty gory, but remember that the Event Horizon was supposedly to have gone to "hell and back."  So, I think the gore is well placed to depict the eternal torment of the damned, if you will.  At least the worst of it is contained to a bunch of quick flashes, I think  that freaked me out more than if the camera were to linger over the images.  It seemed more frightening than disgusting...
The F/X are great, except  near the beginning where the junk is floating in zero-G.  That stuff,  especially the wrist-watch, really looks fake.  But the ship is well done.  The round, rotating hallway that leads into the Heart (whatever they call  it) is very cool.
Check this flick if you enjoy space-type stuff or  horror, as there's plenty of both.
One more thing...  What's the scoop  with the entrance and exit sound tracks?  They're both techno, while the  rest of the movie's tracks definately aren't.  I liked the tracks, but what  the heck, it doesn't make sense.
Hm, maybe i'll give it a 3.5.
