TOKYO ZOMBIE is a good film for a zombie collection, but not such a great one for a general collection. Obviously, it's geared towards the zombie fans, but it is geared quite tightly in that direction, and it loses a little bit in this loss of accessibility.

The back claims it the "japanese Shaun of the Dead" which isn't so, since it's humor is not so in-your-face or continuous as that film. The humor comes more in the form of subtle absurdity the whole way through. Granted, it's a funny, tongue-in-cheek movie, but don't expect comedy that will have you roaring all the way through. It's clever and outrageous for sure, but it's more of a rollercoaster between the more subtle and the more outrageous rather than a continous good blend.

There's enough absurdity overall though to lock it into place in my b-movie zombie collection. There's thought put into this movie, a reckless kind of thought, but it's not just a complete rehash of anything. Though comparisons and parody are quite clear throughout the film, it keeps itself original, especially with the twist that our protaganist is an aspiring jujitsu master, which means of course that we have jujitsu being performed on zombies.

The story is a little disjointed, cutting the film in two parts with an animated segue in between, but it's much less disjointed than a lot of asian film I've seen, and you'll never be lost or confused to any of it. There's even a few good twists and a masterful ending tying it all together.

TOKYO zombie is a great original absurd zombie film. The humor's a little off at some point, the story a bit jumpy, but it's great and I'm glad I picked this film up.
