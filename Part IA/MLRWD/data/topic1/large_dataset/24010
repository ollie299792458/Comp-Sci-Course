This film is so magnificent and beautiful, I don't know where to start. Fly Away Home is filled with love, hope, and paints a picture of utter simplicity--if you open your heart to care about all living things, It gives your life a purpose and direction--miracles happen. with love, all things are possible, and this is a true and inspiring story of the power of love and a dream. This story has really touched me, and my mom too. The Father-Daughter connection is so beautiful, I know that that honesty and freedom....is a gift.The father is so loving, and he really loves his daughter--together, they fly away home, and do the impossible: Flying with the 13 geese to a safe habitat. What I like best is that this is a true story--I think that the message of living in the passion of life, trying with all your heart, and believing in your dream, wearing your heart on your sleeve--is truly timeless. anything is possible with love, and only love can accomplish what some see as impossible. The connection between the girl and her dad, and how much she wants to see them fly home--Inspiring, uplifting, and gave me a lot of hope, to dare to dream.
