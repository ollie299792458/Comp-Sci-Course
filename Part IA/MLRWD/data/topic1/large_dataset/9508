One late night, sitting in my dorm, bored out of my head, I get the idea that I should go down the hall and bother my friend and ask for one of her movies. She lets me look at her shelf. I pick out "Escape from LA."
"This doesn't seem to be your kind of movie," I tell her.
"Oh. Its my dad's. I don't know how that got there."
I slink back to my room and pop it into my vcr.
For the next two hours or so, I watch in silent disgust, abject horror, and sheer delight. This movies is absolutely terrible...with the ... sub par acting, the cheesy script, lines, everything and yet...I look back fondly upon this movie as high camp and kitsch. Its just so bad, that its good! Snake as hamily played by Kurt Russel is hilarious and so is the scene with the stupid surfers and how they say "..." all the time...oh and of course lets not forget Snake surfing with a shark, and the ridiculously hilarious gun battles.
Don't take this movies seriously folks. Yeah, I know this movie won't win any awards or what not...but hey its funny.
