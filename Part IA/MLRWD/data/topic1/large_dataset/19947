I don't understand why there is so many bad reviews. Maybe it's the shock of having to read subtitles and listen to an american actor speak Spanish.  Movie goers from other countries have to watch all the movies Hollywood churns out in English with subtitles in their language, so not liking the movie because of that is lame.

 The costume design was really good, the sets where major acting took place was convincing enough to easily follow story line and the transition to the cheap town scene and driving scenes had me laughing, and the intentionally bad film editing was just great if finding bloopers is you thing.  All the actors in the film were good.  The crappy acting was on purpose, well timed, and well spaced.

The highlights of the film are Armando trying to roll a cigarette, sex scene, and the rambling dialogue about the irresponsible behavior of Americans in the bar. It is not a "b" movie although it a parody on Novellas.  I'm glad I disregarded the reviews and rented it, and that it was free because I used the Red Box promo code.
