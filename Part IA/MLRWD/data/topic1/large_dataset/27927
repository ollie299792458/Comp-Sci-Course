Another one of Tornatore's journeys, beutifully filmed and narranted. This time, it's a con man travelling through Sicilly (Tornatorre's birthplace) following the war. As usual, that's the canvas over which Tornatorre paints a critical picture of Italy of the period - full of hope (all towns and village people who want to try out for the movies), satire (the bandits, who also want to pose for the camera) and tragedy (a love story).

Tornatorre remains true to his exceptional skill to weave the beautiful, the profane and the ugly - all with a blend of sarcasm, nostalgia and human understanding.

This is another wonderful of Tornatore's movies - fans of the director will appreciate it subtle beauty, as will the general viewer who is looking for a richly painted canvas of Italian life in the poor south following the war. For the Tornatore fans, I also recommend "Everybody's fine" if you can find it ("Cinema Paradiso", "Malena" and "The Legend of 1900" being the more well known of the director's movies).
