I start off saying I love the horror/sci fi generes. I love the stupid demonic toys movies so this is saying something.If you've seen the Descent with the original ending you know this movie is an impossibility.The Descent is in my top 5 favorite movies you cant get much more pyscological than that. In the first its dark just their lights really gives you the sense that you're with them as they desend further. In the sequel they went to a cave created by disney its that bright, I hope if we ever have to live underground its that bright. The acting is horrible worse than Candyman 3 and we all know how hard that was to watch.The deaths are boring we dont know or care about any characters Shauna McDonald is back I dont know why money I guess SPOILER SPOILER ALERT so is Juno tell me how thats possible.I bought it for a total of 6 bucks one penny is too much if you can get it for free nevermind dont waste your time trust me on this it took me months to find someone to buy it for .50 cents.If you like the descent or Neil Marshalls way of filming I would check out Dog Soldiers really good.
