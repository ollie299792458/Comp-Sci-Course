I first saw this movie back in 1979, and have loved it ever since. Yeah, the usual stuff: a fabulous cast (who can beat Christopher Plummer, James Mason, Donald Sutherland, Sir John Gielgud?), a convincing portrait of late 19th-century London, a haunting and beautiful musical score, excellent direction, etc. -- but unlike so many technically excellent movies, this one has a wonderful story behind it, complex, sophisticated, challenging, sometimes disturbing, but also deeply moving, particularly the final scene in which all is brought to light. I was especially impressed with Christopher Plummer's performance in this movie; possibly his best film role ever.
For years I sought a copy of this movie, only to discover that it had been taken "out of print;" I ended up buying scratchy used copies (through Amazon.com auctions)at high prices. So I was delighted when the DVD came out, and plan to share it now with many friends. For anyone who likes Sherlock Holmes, or who just likes movies, this would be a great gift.
I was a bit disappointed with the technical quality of the DVD -- I expect more and hope that this can be remedied in the future. But the movie itself is so superb that I think anyone can live with this issue.
I would have to include this film among my top ten favorite movies -- and it is arguably at the top of that list.
