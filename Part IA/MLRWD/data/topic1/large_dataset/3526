I had seen bits and pieces of "Johnny Belinda" over the years but just watched it all the way through last night.  And I am so glad that I did.

What a marvelous, stunning movie.  Jane Wyman certainly deserved the Oscar she received for her performance as the girl who was born able to hear but lost her hearing and ability to speak because of an unspecified illness when she was a very young child.  The expressiveness of her face, without ever uttering a word, was a wonder throughout the movie.

Lew Ayres was low-key but just right in his performance as the caring, platonic friend of Belinda's who helped Belinda find her place in a hearing/speaking world. Charles Bickford played her father perfectly.  Agnes Moorehead should have won an Oscar for her portrayal of the crusty aunt with a warm, caring heart.  Jan Sterling played the beautiful secretary/new wife perfectly.  And there couldn't have been better casting for the villainous rapist/murderer than Stephen McNally.

The cinematography was gorgeous with crisp outdoor scenes and authentic small village/farming/milling period scenes.

This has ended up being one of my favorite movies and I am sure I will be watching it many times in the future.
