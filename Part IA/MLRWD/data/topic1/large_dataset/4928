Okay, I'm getting tired of people missing the point of this movie, and the point of it is not to scare you, but merely to entertain you. The movie isn't scary and it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be an artsy parody. The movie starts out with a homely looking guy getting a disease from a wolf - after the credits end we meet our unsuspecting victims, college kids that just finished for the year. These kids will take a journey to the woods, the cabin they go to doesn't even have a road to it!... and immediatly after seeing this you know what's going to happen: You're gonna see breasts, infatuation, drinking and lots of deaths set up in 70's old school horror format. It essentially pays homage too as well as parodies older horror flicks such as House of the Living dead, and the Living Dead. The acting was actually quite good if you bear in mind when watching this movie that the actors are supposed to act cheesily because they are paying homage to horror flicks of the past. My advice to you the viewer is go out and buy this flick, it's so much better than all the other terrible horror movies out right now. Cabin Fever is not scary, but when was the last time you saw a horror movie that was! Atleast this movie is hilarious in intelligent ways aswell as disgusting and grotesque for all you blood lovers out there.
