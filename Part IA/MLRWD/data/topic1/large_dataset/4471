I grew up with this movie. I've long regarded it as one of favourite movies of all time. I eagerly awaited a sequel that never happened, but that's another story.
The Last Starfighter DVD was never released in my region (4), so I always meant to get around to buying a region 1 version. Now, I'm glad I didn't buy the DVD.
When this title was released, it was my deciding factor to break into the Blu-Ray format. Amusingly, I actually ordered The Last Starfighter before I ordered my Blu-Ray Player.
I have a Blu-Ray drive in my computer, so not having a player didn't stop me from watching it.
It has been 2 months since I bought this title on Blu-Ray, I've watched it 4 times since.

Quality:
I have seen this movie HUNDREDS of times on TV & VHS. I know every word & every scene.
I don't claim to know anything about black levels, pq, etc, but I can tell you, this is way beyond the best video quality I could have ever expected to see on this movie.
I'll tell you what I do know... The grain throughout the movie is barely noticeable. I didn't really pick up on any extra details, as I've said I have seen this movie hundreds of times and I've probably already noticed every detail there is to be seen.
What I did notice is how much clearer everything is, how much of the text can be read on various objects, etc.
At the beginning of the movie when Otis exclaims " It's gonna be a sparklin' day..., Sparklin' " That, I think, can also describe exactly what that particular outdoor scene looks like on this Blu-Ray release. (And pretty much all of the other scenes too.)
The CGI looks as fake as ever, but you can expect that. The documentary on the disc tells you that they actually had to engineer the software to CGI up some things that had pretty much never been done before.

All up, A+
A title I am very, very proud to own. And I will no doubt watch it hundreds more times.
