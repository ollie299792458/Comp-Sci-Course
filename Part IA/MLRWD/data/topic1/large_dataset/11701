In the remake of Willy Wonka many things have changed. For instance Johnny Depp puts a new spin on the old Wonka feel. In the last Willy Wonka movie, Gene Wilder seems very cheery all the time and just seems to really like his job. He seems to love the children he serves chocolate to. However the new Wonka seems to be embittered and dislikes conversation. He seems not to care for the kids, or maybe he just doesn't understand them.

I really enjoyed Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka. To me, Willy Wonka is supposed to be this weird recluse who people aren't supposed to like very much. Depp definitely got this image correct. Freddie Highmore also did well; he plays a very good Charlie, who isn't quite as na√Øve as he seemed in the past. Then there is David Kelley who played Grandpa Joe.  He too was very good. But of course, credit surely goes to Tim Burton for showing, and bringing together this new side of Willy Wonka.

This movie is not as dark as it is rumored to be. It is a movie that makes you think even if you are a child.

I never really thought any of this movie was bad. The only slight problem I had with it was the fact that the oompa loompa songs were very difficult to understand and almost too "new age".

I really recommend this movie to people of all ages. It is a new take on a classic movie and an enjoyable one at that.
