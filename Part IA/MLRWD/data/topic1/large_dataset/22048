Watching this most inspiring Golden Globe winning epic movie is sublime. This is the confession of a producer's more or less aging son.  Everyone should submit at least once, for it will sweep you away in scenarios of unparalleled feeling, magnitude, forcefulness, and technical movie making mastery.  Yet, what is most interesting apart from the almost flawless artistry of the project, is its double transformative historical reality.  Then, in its 11th Century context, the struggles between the competing poles of Christianity with its richness and power craven aristocratic advocates versus the evolved, indigenous, Islamic society, cruelly forged the wrenching transformation of Spain and much of Europe. Those fierce battles purged a dual richness of culture whose amputation still haunts and deprives Europe of a great possible ecumenism. We see every day the dogmatic legacy of a millenieum of internicine conflict.  It's emulation is animated her in "El Cid". What is equally dramatic is the role the making of this movie, centuries later, had in transforming the image and economy of Spain again in the 60s when Spain was marketed and perceived in its utter cliche form as a culture of castanets, flamenco gypsies and, bull fighting.  With the making of El Cid, Spain's image changed profoundly.  So powerful was the influence of the movies' production on tourism, commerce, and diplomatic relationships, that the pall of Axis ally that hung over the Franco Regime was virtually erased and again a paradigm shift occurred.  There are so many levels the magnificent Weinstein remastered DVD package offers to a critical viewer.  It is hard not to focus on the artistic brilliance of the all real production and its gargantuan management but, in another viewing, ponder the political influence this project had in its time reveals whole other exercise in critical awareness to move the repeat viewer.
