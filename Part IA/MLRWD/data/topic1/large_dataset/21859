An interesting look at another planets race for space flight.  Not so much a race as a one country attempt as supporting and paying for their race to space.  Given that on this world there is no actual competition such as that of the cold war one can understand how the issue draws a bit more fire from the populace.  Interesting story, fairly well told, very solid animation.  I could have done without the following:
-The bit about moving the launch to near the border of a nation they have been at war with in the past seemed out right stupid.  What king with purse strings who had backed the project would allow that.
-The religion angle was handled clumsily.  They did at least make it a different sort of religion but all religion and no romance makes for boredom.
-The near rape scene and the actual apology on the victims part was painful to watch.  What's with the Japanese and their view of women!  (I know, to this day women are so frequently groped on trains that there is high demand for women only train cars at rush hour.  Of course my friend from Osaka tells me that even if a man gropes you on the train you keep quiet because it is embarrassing to bring such attention to yourself.  You just squirm away through the densely packed car while everyone looks away.)  Despite that, was it really necessary to project that view in the movie?  My wife cringed and now getting her to watch another anime film will be difficult.
I STILL GOTTA GIVE IT THREE STARS AS ITS WORTH WATCHING.
