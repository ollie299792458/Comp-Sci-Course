Okay, you can toss your bootlegs, the greatest Bigfoot Docu-drama of all time is -finally- available again, and in DVD for the first time (legit, anyhow.)  
No, the print isn't fantastic, no it's not in widescreen, but it's THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK, people!  C'mon!  You get to hear a guy wonder if maybe an orangutan was in his sweet potato patch!  You get to listen to another guy who got part of his foot shot off in a freak boating accident!  You get to ponder why so many people in Arkansas seem to be named "Crabtree"!!  
And that way cool SONG!  How many other bigfoot movies have a love-theme for the MONSTER?!!  (And there's another song about...another guy named "Crabtree", but hey...)
In all honesty, I'd have LOVED to have seen this restored and released in widescreen.  However, I share the opinion that a widescreen print of the film may not -exist- now.  At any rate, the DVD is head and shoulders above any VHS copy that's been released to date.  Some of the colors come in like gangbusters at the least expected times, and you can actually see the grain on the tree bark in the darker scenes, so this is the best transfer this film has ever had, without doubt. My biggest complaint is that annoying little white speck about halfway up on the right side of the middle of the picture.  What the heck IS that?
"The Legend of Boggy Creek" is one of my absolute -favorite- films from my childhood.  It has withstood viewing after viewing, it doesn't get old, it's just it's own sorta good, clean FUN.  There's never been anything like it, before or since.
Gotta love that song...
