I give an 'A' for effort for two reasons: 1) while the story idea is not entirely original, there were enough intricacies and differences to make for an entertaining movie and 2) the lead actress was terrific. She starts out as an introverted, repressed target for bullies then, by the end of the movie, she is a dominant powerful force of violent fury...and she pulls it off so well!

As for the overall execution, the pacing was so-so (thus the 'C'). There were parts of the movie that could've been tightened-up, meaning that the scene already made its point but they kind of dragged it out....almost as if the director didn't think the viewer was smart enough to catch it the first time through, so the characters repeat/reiterate the same thing again.

The other facet of average execution was the acting of the supporting cast, especially the two primary male antagonists. I don't know if it is a matter of the rest of the cast being so mediocre or if it was a matter of the lead being so much better, but the disparity between the lead and the supporting cast definitely detracted from an otherwise fun, enjoyable movie.

Despite the pacing and some of the acting, this movie is exactly what one wants (OK, at least me) from a horror movie: some good gore (albeit a little light on this front, too), some good scares, and a good way to spend 90 minutes on a cold, gray afternoon in the midwest.
