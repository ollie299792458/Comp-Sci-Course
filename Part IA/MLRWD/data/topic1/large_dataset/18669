For fans of large-scale destruction sequences a la Independence Day, Deep Impact, etc., this flick has the best ones yet. The tsunami hitting New York has got to be one of the best destruction scenes I've ever seen, easily as good as the tsunami sequence in Deep Impact, maybe better. The wave in this flick isn't as high, but the details in the sequence are much better and the effects are much more advanced.

As for the other aspects of this film like acting, storyline, etc..... who cares? The destruction sequences and special effects ROCK!!!

Okay, truth is the storyline, acting and direction are top-notch, I think. And I don't know where you live but here in Seattle we've had some seriously crazy weather patterns over the last two years and they're just getting crazier every year thanks to global warming. The glaciers are disappearing off the mountains around here, too. The Olympics used to be snow-capped year-round ..... not any more, buddy. Kinda makes you wonder if the events depicted in this film really are just around the proverbial corner.
