taken as a movie in and of itself it is funnier than most stuff i see in the theaters nowadays. that's probably a good summary for how i felt about this movie.

that said... i think this overcapitalizes on the elements that made clerks such a success. same basic plot, same basic dialogue, same characters. there wasn't enough about this movie that made it stand on its own. as expected, plenty of cameos from the usual cast of characters to give the old fans reasons to cheer (much akin to chewbacca making a completely meaningless appearance in the star wars prequel). the thing i wish smith kept that he didn't was starting each section with a title (i.e. jay and silent bob- new & improved).

here's my list of his movies i've seen from best to worst in my opinion:

chasing amy

clerks

mallrats

clerks ii

dogma

jay & silent bob strike back

after all is said and done though the writing is still pretty funny. four stars.
