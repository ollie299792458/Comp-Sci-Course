"Freaky Friday" is the story of a mother and daughter, Tess and Anna, who just can't seem to get along.  The situation is aggravated by Tess's upcoming wedding.  But when Anna and Tess magically switch places and are forced to walk in each other's shoes for a day, they begin to understand each other.
My biggest complaint about this movie is that its writers try much too hard to make it funny, especially in the beginning.  Many jokes fall flat.  The real comical moments come when the actors embellish the script, such as Jake's rendition of "...Baby, One More Time," and Anna's performance at the House of Blues.
Lindsey Lohan is the best she's ever been, and Jamie Lee Curtis is quite good.  Both actors do extremely well when the mother and daughter switch places, particularly Lohan.  Chad Michael Murray is also very enjoyable, not to mention extremely good-looking.
Though it lacks smoothness at times, "Freaky Friday" is a fun movie.  If you're looking for a few laughs, a little romance, and a good cry, this is the movie for you.
