For all of the new funk fans that want to know what Parliament sounded like before George changed over to "solo", buy this DVD! I have a second copy unwrapped and stored away for my Grandchildren to see some day. What can I say, this is in a time when musicians played real instruments, and singers sang. Glen Goins (R.I.P) was "on it" as usual. The grooves were tight. The customes were, well, you know.  Jerome was showing why he was the best.  The horns were at a level, which only they could reach. The stage act was the bomb. The Mothership, ohh The Mothership...I still get goose bumps when George comes out to the intro of Dr. Funkenstein. Sometimes, I catch myself standing up and cheering when he walks down the stairs. What an act they were. What can I say? All true P-Funk fans expect nothing less than the best. For their time, they were the best dam show on earth. The editing on Dr. Funkenstein could have been much better. I would tell everyone to buy it.  A classic if there ever was one.
