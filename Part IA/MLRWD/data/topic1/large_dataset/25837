I cannot vouch for the DVD yet, but for the Season itself I can only my opinion.  I first thought the show was like a fantasy Star Wars (Young guy gets a sword from a wise old mentor after a woman in a white dress asks for help-- but as I watched the show I became more enthralled.  This show has humor and emotion and action enough to staisfy.  I also loved that the season finale made this season stand on its own.  For those unfamiliar with the story, it really could have ended with *SPOILER* the deafeat of Darken Rahl.  Luckily for us fans, it goes on in Season 2 as our little band searches for the Stone of Tears.
This show got me reading the Sword of Truth books-- which might be why I enjoy the show so much.  My advice is to appreciate the books for what they are and appreciate the show for what it is.  No media interpretation of a book has ever been 100% faithful to it's ink and paper counterpart, but in this case I think it's a good thing (can you imagine Richard's training at the hands of Denna o screen?  Yikes!)-- it offers the makers of the show more creative liberty.  And just because the show isn't following Goodkind's books to the letter doesn't mean that all of the important story points won't make themselves known in due time according to what has been set up on the show.
Overall, I love this show and despite what others may think, Season 1 included everything that was absolutely essential in Wizard's First Rule plus quite a bit more than just makes it more fun.  If you want the whole story, there are nearly a dozen lengthy books to satisfy your need :-)
