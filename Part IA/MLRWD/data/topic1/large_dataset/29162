This movie was made over forty years ago, and was not shot for the same aspect ratio used today.  Considering the raw materials they had to work with and the fact this wasn't a remaster, it's surprisingly good.  Expect it to be the exact same quality as the VHS edition most schools have, just on DVD.  I found the picture to be perfectly acceptable once they chopped and zoomed up to ratio after the opening credits , and the sound quality was way better than our school's worn out VHS edition.

As for the acting, you can get that story from any review.  Robards isn't all that great in it.  That said, your standard high school kids don't notice because they're too busy trying to figure out what he's saying to care about how he's saying it.  If you teach advanced students with an appreciation of acting, perhaps the black and white Brando version would work better; otherwise, the fact it's in color makes this one better at holding a class's attention.

Richard Chamberlain, despite his short time on screen, is certainly worth seeing as Octavius.  He's got a grin that perfectly matches the young, super-confident nature of his character.
