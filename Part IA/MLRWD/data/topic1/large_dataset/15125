I saw the film (from my Dad's Collection), in our home theatre. Granted the acting is very good, the production is excellent and the story relevant, there's still something irritating (for me) in the way a young mother, Sally Field, ignores her husband (Beau Bridges) and kids to spend every possible moment , day and night, with a slimy union official (Ron Liebman). They are trying to bring the bring the workers at a Southern Textile Plant into much-needed solidarity and director, Martin Ritt is obviously trying equally as hard to avoid the usual cliches of the hard-hearted, pig-headed, capitalistic boss and the passive severely put-upon workers. Sally Field succeeds more than Ritt does. On the one hand, the textile workers learn how to strike, get better wages and a little employer respect. On the other hand, there's a family crying out for their mother. Music and credits are superb. Sally Field won an Academy Award for her performance.
