Ok, so the sound has never been upgraded but the CD's reproduction of the original print is excellent.  This is one of those films that just completely grabbed me the first time I watched it and THAT must have been forty years ago.  I still remember most of the dialogue and, to my wife's complete surprise, can quote it thirty seconds in advance.  The csst is marvelous and the cinematography is among the best of that era.  It also includes what I believe to be the only truly 'realistic' fight scene (between Peck and Heston) I've ever seen in a western - one where the guys hit each other and actually fall down, then 'pause' before throwing their own; both end up throwing punches while on their knees because they can no longer stand....simply terrific.  Jean Simmons has always been a shining star on the screen but Carol Baker is the one who surprised me.  She's the epitome of a spoiled brat in this film but I know of no one who could have played it more convincingly.  Burl Ives, who received a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his work here has never been better and his son, played by Chuck Connors (The Rifleman for those of you old enough to remember!) is really good in a complex role. Any fan of westerns who has yet to see this should treat themselves soon.
