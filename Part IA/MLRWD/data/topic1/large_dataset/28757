The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was awesome i liked that it took us to these different places!!!!!! First we go to the beautiful and magical Greece and then it takes us to the enchanted Baja Mexico and then to the wildness of North Carolina back to the beautiful and pretty state of Maryland!!!!! When a bunch of young girls buy a pair of jeans that fit each one of them they then exchange their pants and you get to live in their shoes!!!!!!! When we go to Greece the first girl falls in love with a guy that family is fighting with her family!!!!! With the second girl she goes to a soccer camp and she falls in love with her coach,but truly misses her mother and then we go to another girl that is interesting in filming her fellow peers that she learns of a girls illness and changes her attitude on life!!!!! Last but not least with the last girl she goes to see her dad and she discovers that the only thing that he is interested in is his new wife and kids and leaves her out of it!!!!! GO AND RENT THIS CHICK FLICK!!!
