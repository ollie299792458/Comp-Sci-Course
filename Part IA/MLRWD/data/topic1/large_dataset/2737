If you're a fan of gangster movies or the time period, you will most likely enjoy this film. Since this is a 'special edition', most people interested have probably already seen it several times, but if you have'nt it is certainly worth a look. Sean Connery gives the most memorable performance as the grizzled old cop-on-the-beat, although I cant really see that it was more oscar worthy than some of his other work.  Kevin Costner is.....well, Kevin Costner.  Thats not a criticism against him, its just that if you watch all of his movies back to back you realize he is playing the same character in different costumes.  Deniro does'nt have enough screen time to merit all the effort he put into gaining weight and receeding his hairline.

It certainly takes liberties with history.  Frank Nitti was not pushed off the roof. In real life he shot himself in the head in a trainyard while in a drunken depression.  The raid on horseback on the Canadian border never happened.  Elliot Ness never got away from his office much to go on raids.  He also never got much glory for all his work, although he did run for public office later in life.  Al Capone did in fact beat someone's head in with a baseball bat. That part was true.

Aside from these small grievancies, its a very enjoyable movie with good production work and an exciting final confrontation. Violent, but without being more graphic than necessary and easy on the profanity. All in all, a good flick.
