First and foremost Amazon doesn't sell the unedited version of Kite. So, I should say don't bother looking here since the edited version leaves out the huge sex scenes that are, in this anime movie, crucial to the plot and character development but there is a catch to one of the sex scenes as they include an 11-13 year old ,Sawa (the main character). Other than that, I enjoyed this movie, unedited. It has good action with lots of gore, blood, and sex scenes. Another thing I liked about it was the variety of symbolism. Such as Sawa's earrings. One thing I disliked about this movie was the voice dub. The dub could have been better. It seems for hentai shows or movies they always get the mediocre actors. So, all in all, if you are not comfortable with sex scenes, hentai in general, animated cp, or a little more blood and gore. Then invest your money in the edited version. If none of those things bother, then invest your money and time in the unedited version.

If hentai was more like this, then I would gladly watch more.
