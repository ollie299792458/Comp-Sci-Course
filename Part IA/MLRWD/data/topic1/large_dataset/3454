I've been using this DVD for almost a year and I truly love it.  It's perfect if you're just starting out with Pilates.  I knew nothing about Pilates when I first tried it, but found it very accessible.  If you've been doing Pilates for a long time, it will probably seem too easy, but even as I have advanced, I keep going back to this one again and again.  The band that comes with it does allow you to increase the resistance to make it progressively more challenging.  I especially love the upper body segment.  Suzanne is very calm and encouraging.  She pays particular attention to proper position and breathing, which is so important.  Plus, I think she has the best stretch segments of any trainer I have seen.  Instead of rushing through the stretching as an afterthought the way that many trainers do, she takes her time with it and even includes it as a full segment on this DVD.  This workout has helped me achieve my goals, including losing weight and inches as well as improving my flexibility.  You will not be disappointed.
