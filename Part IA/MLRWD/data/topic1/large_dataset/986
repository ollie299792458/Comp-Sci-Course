This is such a wonderful story.Helen Keller as a child,Patty Duke Gives such a performance and Anne Bancroft is splended.From child to adulthood Helen Keller Life history is amazing.We all have to have some sympathy for anyone that has a handicap as she did but how many would seek the education,dedication to help others as she did, courage to visit other countries.She met Presidents(had her picture taken with them)Leaders of other countries welcomed her. This past summer I visited her home in Tuscombia Al.There are plays in June and July. I didn't go to one though(It was Hot).The bleachers are in the back yard,I hear the plays are wonderful.It protrays her as the movie does.You can visit the House and explore each room.I must say I was shocked to see the house,because it looked so big in the movie,and the house next door where Anne took her.The well,buggy,maids house in back. If you haven't been there,Type this up on your net.  Alabama History on Line Email:dpendlot@Archives. state.Al USA.They will send you pamplets and information about everything. Have fun,Marie
