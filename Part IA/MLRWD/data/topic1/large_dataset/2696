The 7th Harry Potter book marks a distinct shift in the series, as Dumbledore is dead, Harry and friends are no longer at Hogwarts, and the world is facing a dark future that only they can prevent. This film captures those shifts beautifully. Harry, Ron and Hermione are grown, and feeling the weight of the world on their shoulders. This is a somber film, so different from the first few, but very powerful. The director used the landscape beautifully in this film to convey the stark, dark feeling of this phase of their quest, and the impact of wearing the 2nd Horcrux. From dreary woods to desolate cliffs and beachsides, the settings are gorgeous, empty, and spooky. The three leads put in their best and subtlest performances to date - no more mugging for the camera. They convey both their deep affections and inner turmoils brilliantly. Dream sequences are gorgeous, and the animated telling of the story of the 3 brothers (the genesis of the deathly hallows of the title) is brilliant. I also loved the scene where Hermione and Harry briefly take off the Horcrux and dance - just a moment of joy before they reshoulder their burden.

My only warning would be that this film will make no sense to someone not familiar with the books or other movies. While some of the past movies have been OK as standalones, this one requires prior knowledge of the story, and very little is offered as explanation for those that don't already know. I'm fine with that - this is the 7th film after all.

Anyway, a wonderful setup for the final film!
