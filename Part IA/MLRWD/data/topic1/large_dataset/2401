What can one say about Gymkata? 
If you want to see the worst action film ever committed to vinyl, you couldn't go wrong here. The plot is a laugher, the acting is worst, and everything else in the film falls somewhere between the two.
However, this film is so bad it will probably become a cult favorite in the years to come. It makes Ed Wood Jr look like Steven Spielberg. Simply put, Gymkata has no equals when it comes to low-rate films. That's why it should be ported to DVD and every person who likes films SHOULD have a copy of this movie. But I feel the distributor should PAY the viewer to take a tape or disc of this film off their hands, instead of the other way around.
Gymkata will make you laugh more than most comedies. The action scenes are predictable, unrealistic, etc...And look for some good flubs, too. Although the characters are supposed to be native to some remote areas of Asia/Europe, the blond antagonist often reveals a strong New York City accent. Hysterical! And watch closely how nervous that same guy looks riding a horse - obviously a first timer.  You will laugh so hard you'll cry.
