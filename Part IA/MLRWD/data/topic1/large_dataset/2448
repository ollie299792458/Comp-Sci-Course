Yes, there was another film called "Dawn of the Dead." Yes, that film was quite good. Perhaps it was even better than this film. But it was not the least bit scary. Sorry, but it's true.

The original film featured actors so wooden they were hard to distinguish from the walking dead, special effects that were laughably primative and a campy Muzak soundtrack straight from the J.C. Penney hit list. In that film, people could safely outmuscle zombies with a weak shove and outrun them at a light jog. There were, for sure, creepy elements to the film. But its endurance and appeal has much more to do with its satirical message than its visceral effect.

This new film is all viscera, both literally and figuratively. These new filmmakers took all that was genuinely creepy about the original picture and focused their efforts on enhancing those elements.

Aren't you convinced you'll be among those lucky few to outlast the Apocalypse? It's because you're special, right? Well, what will you do to justify that calling? Is it enough just to survive?

This film picks up on some very unnerving themes and exploits them quite effectively. I was very impressed.
