First of all I want to thank "Just Anna" (five or so reviews below this one) for pointing out some of her main complaints about this movie having read the book upon which it is based first... I fell in love with this movie (having not read the book) so it is hard for me to imagine the "Lexie" character (Ashley Judd) as a trashy-mannered size 22 mother of four! But the point here is that the main story line, that is, the departure of two people from one another (Novalee and Willy), and watch them go in so very different directions, and to ultimately see how each of their own stories unfold right up until one of them hits rock bottom (Willy) while the other one rises up above difficulties and finds truly happiness (Novalee), is still greatly achieved in the movie. I simply loved Stockard Channing characterization of "Sister Husband". And also, what a pleasant surprise was for me to discover Natalie Portman in a certainly luckier role than the pale Amidala... She simply excelled. All the remaining characters are sweet and warm, the music is great and ultimately the whole final product ends up very enjoyable and fresh. A very beautiful, heart-warming, spirit-lifting, easy-watching, mind-offsteamer sort of movie.
