This film takes you through Beverly Donfrio's life as she gets pregnant at 16, marries, and then tries to live her life with husband and child always in the way.  Drew Barrymore does an excellent job as Beverly, though her accent sometimes gets in the way and distracts.  Brittany Murpy is wonderful as her best friend Fay.....Murpy has been up to a lot lately and getting better and better as she goes.  The child actors that play Beverly's sons, Jason, are absolutely terrific and a joy to watch.  Steve Zahn plays her husband Ray, and he makes this character lovable, yet hateable at the same time, as Ray prevents Beverly from becoming what she truly wants at every turn.  But Beverly's character isn't that lovable at times either, as you see her not being the best mother to Jason.  It's fun to watch the time go by from the '60s to the '80s and how the characters change and grow with the passing years.  James Woods and Lorraine Bracco support the film with their imense talent as Beverly's ever loving and ever present parents.  It's a funny and touching movie at times, heartbreaking at others, but excellent acted throughout by such a fine cast.
