You should know up front that I am favorably prejudiced about this film.  The movie was partially filmed in my college town of Hays, Kansas.  Bob Young, who plays the gas station attendant, was one of my best friends.  Harriet Ketchum, the lady in the store who tells the cashier to give the child her twenty dollar bill back, was my drama teacher for four years.  Dr. Coder, the manager of the store, was a professor on campus.  Other extras were well-known in the Hays community.  I also recognized many of the buidlings and sites shown.  Thus, I liked the film before ever seeing it.

  That aside, the movie is interesting for several reasons.  First, filmed in black and white, it more truly depicts the depressed era of the "dirty 30s" on the Great Plains, when dust storms moved the soil at will.  Second, the development of the relationship between two unlikely characters, Mose and Addie, was well-written, well-directed, and convincingly acted by Ryan and Tatum Oneal.  Madeline Kahn is her usual brilliant self as Trixie Delight.

  Addie learns quickly and even teaches con-man Mose a few new wrinkles in his taking advantage of people.  But Addie, wise for her age, knows when doing so is not appropriate and manages the situation.  Addie does not like Trixie and hatches a plan to get her away from Mose.  On their travels across Kansas and into Missouri, the two meet up with moonshiners, lawmen, and other notable characters.

  It's all good fun.  Even if I didn't have personal reasons for liking it, I would recommend it highly.  It's a film to enjoy over and over again.
