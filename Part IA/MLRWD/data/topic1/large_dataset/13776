Johnny Depp is clearly one of the most eclectic personalities the film industry has seen.  He choses unusual roles and brings a unique presence to each character.  Having said that, i am sad to say i don't recommend this specific film. I think most of us like to believe we are smarter than the 'bad guys'... and even though Depp always takes a contrarian approach to society and characters, i nevertheless felt my need to identify with the victim and overcome the villain was not being sufficiently fed.  Who knows, maybe that's what Depp was striving for, the uncertainty and uncomfortableness of being in such quagmire of absurdities as to leave us (me) feeling angry at the good character, for being so dense.  Christopher Walken turned in an average performance as one of the villains (If he really wants to expand his range he should try playing a vulnerable good guy).  Perhaps that's what's really missing in this film- proper casting.  Walken should have been cast as the hero and Depp as the villain. This 'Real Time' (Pre-'24') Drama really didn't work for me, but it appears to have set the standard for other 'real time' shows.  What makes this film better than '24' is that it's shorter, and you actually DO root for the characters daughter to get rescued.
