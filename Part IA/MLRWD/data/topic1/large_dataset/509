John Irving has become one of the quintessential novelists of the last 20-30 years.  His books possess an inherent American quality that can apply to just about everyone.  This is the fourth movie to be produced that is based on his work.  In my opinion each film is better than the last.  Simon Birch is true to the essence of the characters modeled after those in "A Prayer for Owen Meany".  One of the challenges in watching an adaptation of an Irving novel, is that of many of the scenes in the books being removed, which is uncontrollabe since his novels are so long and rich.  I would definitely recomend all of the adaptations, "Hotel New Hampshire", "World According to Garp", "The Cider House Rules", "Simon Birch", and the newest, "The Door In The Floor".  But as John Irving said in the documentary of "The Door In The Floor", "Just because you've seen the movie, that doesn't mean you have read the novel".  If you do any reading at all, read the novels, but book or film, you won't be sorry.
