I won't give you a description of this movie as you already should know it's premises. Those who say this movies jumps back and forth from one story line to another obviously doesn't understand what the director is trying to get across. This movie is classified as horror, however it also is a mystery and by taking the viewer in different directions keeps them guessing. Everything does come together full circle by the end of this film and all the craziness makes sense. The little girl (Seo-woo eun)who plays Young Ju does a PHENOMENAL job and is very believable. She is reason enough to see this film! Other characters are not as memorable.

On the downside - I wasn't crazy about some of the cliched scenes from former Asian films, particularly from Dark Water - elevator scene and hair coming out of the faucet. Could have been a bit more creative in that aspect. The Ringu conncetion only surfaced in Ji-won's search for dead girls identity.

I don't think I would have called this movie 'Phone' or based it around the annoying calls recieved by Ji-won but the overall concept does work and will hold your attention from beginning to end. This is one Asian film well worth adding to your collection.
