"The ultimate experience in horror and gore" is what Evil Dead claims to be. I would have to agree. While it might have less plot, story, or interesting characters as other horror movies have, it achieves what it claims to be, and does horror and gore better than most movies to date, pulling it off with humor and style.

  The movie is a remarkable achievement for its budget and filmmakers' level of experience. A few college students with an investor-given budget of $375,000 filmed it. They traveled to a cabin in the woods and made a funny, gory, and certainly scary monster movie.

  During the movie, four teens spend the night at a cabin, without a clue of the horrors that await them. When they open the lavishly designed Book of the Dead, the terror is unleashed and evil spirits consume the youths one by one. They become monsters, and taunt the ones who haven't by making themselves human at times.

  The special effects are quite an eye-filler, especially given the cheap animation they used it with. Performances are decent, but the monsters are the real show-stealer. It's easy to see why this was a cult classic from its 1982 to this day.
