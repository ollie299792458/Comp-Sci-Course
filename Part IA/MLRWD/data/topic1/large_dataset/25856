n an unforgettable film, Bette Davis portrays Baby Jane, a drunken, slovenly former child star brilliantly.

Baby Jane Hudson,Bette Davis' character had been an adored child singer and dancer. blond curls, frilly dresses, she is also daddy's favorite.

Her pretty dark haired sister Blanche watched with some envy as Baby Jane sang and curtsied before a wildly applauding audience.

Crawford plays sister Blanche Hudson, a talented actress who achieved enormous success as a talented film star, while sister Jane's former appeal is lost after childhood.

Kindly Blanche refuses offers in film unless Jane is also given a role. Jane's poor acting skills limit her from being in big demand.
The roles are reversed, Jane now envies Blanche.

Tragedy occurs one night in a car crash with the sisters leaving Blanche paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair.

This is where madness and irony set in.

Aging Jane boozes through the days caring for her sister and becoming more and more reckless.

Delusional and demented Jane decides to dust off her career as a ten year old singing sensation. She must practice, it has been at least sixty years since she'd last danced to that role of America's little sweetheart.

Spending money like mad she has original "little girl" costumes made up. She rehearses her old songs and even hires a pianist to accompany her singing. Neglected Blanche, sick and helpless in bed upstairs listens to the singing of Jane and Edwin.

Bette Davis keeps the suspense going as she descends into alcohol and madness and you don't even want to blink an eye in the anticipation of this great film.

Long since, a cult classic and the single movie in which the two mega stars appear together.

Highly recommended thriller.(probably not suited to everyone though)
