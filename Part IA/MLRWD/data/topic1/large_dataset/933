All right, if you're reading this review, you've a good idea about what "Rose Red" is about: A haunted house, a diverse band of investigators, a background story so boring you'll tear your hair out if it continued one minute longer...

King again bumbles his way to the bottom in this blatant theft of "The Haunting of Hill House" -- a vastly superior novel by vastly superior author Shirley Jackson. However, where Jackson approaches the theme with creeping dread, King relies on cheesy special effects, cardboard characters, and their infinite supply of moronic under-reaction (case in point: a flaming apparition shoots from a fireplace amid electric explosions; yet seconds later, the miraculously composed characters are calmly smiling as a baby buggy slowly rolls toward them from nowhere. Huh? Who are these idiots?).

Perhaps the most telling inconsistency in this wretched story is why there's so much importance hinging upon the "discovery" of the paranormal, while ignoring the nonhuman traits of the group itself -- especially when an autistic team member can levitate dominoes, produce Glenn Miller music from flowers, and cause rocks to plummet from empty skies...

Great low-brow camp if you're desperate and bored stupid. If not, skip this ridiculous mess and read Jackson's novel.
