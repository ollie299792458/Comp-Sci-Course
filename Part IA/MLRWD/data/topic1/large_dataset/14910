I have become convinced over the years that Anthony Hopkins could do one of those motivational infomericals and he'd still be creepy.

Here is an inexplicably obscure movie in which Hopkins is a lovelorn puppeteer with a tenuous grasp on reality. By itself, his dwindling sanity provides more chills than most modern horror, because few people can depict madness like Hopkins. Add a leering puppet to that dawning lunacy and, well... This is the kind of movie that makes you want to look over your shoulder every thirty seconds.

I saw it as a young boy and could not sleep that night. I kept imagining I would look up from my pillow and see Fats the dummy grinning from the foot of my bed. I revisited the movie decades later and the creepy crawliness of the film was not diminished. Fats still evokes childish fears and Hopkins is still a master of delivering that kind of unease. It's a lethal combination.

Magic is a movie that should be more frequently discussed in horror circles. If you haven't seen it, it's a must. If you saw it years ago, it's worth a second viewing. You'll still want to look over your shoulder every now and then to be certain Fats isn't behind you with that hideous, wide-eyed grin and some really vile intentions.
