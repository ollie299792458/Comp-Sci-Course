I've just watched this performance again tonight, on a rapidly deteriorating VHS copy from our local library.

I can't understand why it hasn't found its way to DVD yet. The Bayreuth production is directed by Wolfgang Wagner, ably conducted by Horst Stein, and includes some sterling performances from many well-known and well-loved singers , some at the very beginning of their career. It's a Brian Large TV production, so the visuals are impeccable.

This is a traditional production - no dead rabbits. The ritual is formal, elegant and convincing.

Highlights?

A stellar cast, including an extremely young (and already impressive) Siegfried Jerusalem as Parsifal, Matti Salminen as Titurel, Bernd Weikl as Amfortas, playing to the gallery for sympathy, Hans Sotin's magisterial Gurnemanz, Lief Roar's sinister Klingsor, and Eva Randova's outstanding Kundry. Look out for Mari Anne H&auml;ggander as a flower maiden. Enough big names for you?

A performance of the highest quality. Now is the time to release it in a suitable medium.

In the mean time, seek out the VHS copies.
