If you want to feel sad and bad, I guess you should watch this, although it's like watching people fight in Wal-Mart. Drinking and then showing up at your spouse's workplace to continue a family argument is just embarassing to watch. Not long after this, the movie ends with the expected dissolution, and I can't imagine why anyone cried because I felt like, now these two people have a chance to find someone else who might bring them some peace. This is a relationship based on fleeting lust and then a shotgun marriage, and it's not even necessarily his baby, so why did anyone have any expectations they would ever make it? She had a dream of being a doctor; he was content with achieving very little in his life, and each wanted the other to change. There was never any big love story here, so why does anyone feel bad when it ends? It is pretty dreary and tedious.

This is true love, people: accepting the other person as they are, liking them for what they are, and helping them achieve what they dream, even if it is not your dream. This was not that love story.

Sex scenes were not more than you've seen elsewhere, so if you were thinking of renting it for just that, don't bother. By different, I think Hollywood means they didn't glam them up. People are sweaty, grungy, they grunt, they look uncomfortable in uncomfortable positions. They don't have ecstatic expressions on their faces, and they start fighting again right in the middle of trying to do it. So...not erotic.
