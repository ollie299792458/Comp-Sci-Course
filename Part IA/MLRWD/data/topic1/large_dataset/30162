Knockaround Guys is about the son of a mafioso wanting to get into the "business". The opening scene starts off with an intensely violent and unnecessary torturing of a man. The son of the mafioso is only 9 at the time and is told to kill the man. This is the most disturbing parts of the movie. A 9-year-old is asked to kill a human being. How horrible is this? Then, the movie moves ahead to a 20-something Matty who wants to be more than rich. He wants to be powerful and be known as a somebody, not just the son of a mafioso, He wants to BE the mafioso. So he asks his father for a mission. The mission is to transport protection money to a certain location. However, Matty entrusts the money with his friend who is a complete dumba** and he ends up leaving the money at an airport near a small town. This film is not really worth watching unless you are a HUGE Vin Diesel fan. I say this because even though Diesel only has a few decent lines and sequences, they are solid. The ending is completely predictable as is the entire film. I give this 2 stars ONLY because of Vin Diesel's great performance.
