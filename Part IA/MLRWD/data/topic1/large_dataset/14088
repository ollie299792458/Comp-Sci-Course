Ignore the negative reviews, this is a dynamite movie. It is more subtle than your average movie, it builds slowly, and in many places, asks questions at the beginning of the film that are not answered till later in the film. This is a movie that does not hand you all the answers on a silver platter (and this where the negative reviews come from, I think this says more about the reviewer than about the actual film). This is not a movie you can go nipping out at the fridge while you are watching. You have to pay close attention to all the little details, there is nothing placed in there by accident, the tinest little detail can blow up in your face later in the movie.
It is well thought out, script and editing is top notch, acting is on the money (though Harrison Ford strikes me as out of place and not very convincing, I like him as an actor). If you haven't seen this, you have missed out (in my book this is right up there with "Night of the Hunter" and "The Third Man". There is also a good book which has a lot of info on the making of this movie called "The Conversations", which is well worth reading, and has a lot of good info about movie editing.
