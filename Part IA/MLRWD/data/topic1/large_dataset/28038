Summary: This gift set was fantastic! The quality on the movie (watched the Blu-Ray) was flawless in my opinion, and I'm known to be a pretty picky person when it comes to quality! The price was too good to beat for such a great set and I highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed this classic years ago!

I must say, I was at first hesitant when I thought about all the extras that came in the box - I mean what would I need or do with all the items that this set comes with? But I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to see all the extras! The books were very interesting and the postcards were such a clever add in!! The music box was of such great quality and I truly enjoy listening to it. I think that for the high quality Blu-Ray (and DVD), the amount of extras, and the price, you really can't beat this deal!

Seeing this classic on such high quality resolution that I used to watch when I was younger and still sing along to is probably one of the greatest recent memories I hold! I truly recommend this gift set to anyone interested or hesitant upon purchasing!
