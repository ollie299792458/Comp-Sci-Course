If I had to choose a single episode of the classic Doctor Who series to survive into the future, The Talons of Weng-Chiang would be in the top five. In fact, I think all of my top five would come from the Leela adventures. Most if not all the stories during actress Louise Jemeson's tenure as Leela were gripping and even a bit frightening.
Talons is set in Victorian England and everything is done perfectly. A few sets were borrowed from other BBC productions of the day which were also set during this time period. The story is very reminiscent of a good Sherlock Holms story with Leela sharing the Watson role with the character Professor Lightfoot. In addition, there is also a smattering of Dickens in the unforgettable Henry Gordon Jago, theatre owner.
The thing is that this story sets us up for another wonderful tale of the distant future which has yet to be told. Since the new series often visits the 51st Century, it would be fun to to see the rise of the warlord Silas Greel and mabe even the creation of the Peking Homunculus who eventually becomes the evil Mr. Sin!
when watching this and similar episodes of Doctor Who, it's hard to remember that the series was and still is considered children's fare by the BBC. In fact, many British parents wrote the BBC complaining of how scary these episodes were. Their children also wrote in asking that the BBC ignore their parents letters - they loved being scared by the Doctor Who monsters. I certainly know I did.
If you are new to Doctor Who, this is a very good episode to begin your library. Sadly, they have yet to issue The Face Of Evil in which The Doctor first meets Leela (her origin story if you like comic book terminology). I hope they release that one soon as my only copy is an overplayed VHS from the 1980s.
