I once read a great book by Jerzy Kozinski called "the Painted Bird" in which he describes a young boy's horrifying journey through war torn Poland during WWII and the atrocities he saw. In one scene in the book, a man's eyes are plucked out with a spoon and in vivid detail Jerzy describes the eyeball rolling on the floor and a cat playing with the eyeball like it was a ball. The colorful writing added to the horrors that you felt and while it made me sick to think about it, I realized just what evil is out in the and what this little boy endoured. In this movie, you see gore and not much else. The plot about a boy who is caged by his mother b/c he looks at pictures of women and grows up killing and plucking out their eyes could have been good except the whole movie is nothing but one eye after another being plucked out, people having body parts cut off with an axe or impaled. In one scene a girl is force to eat a cell phone and it sticks in her throat.  In another a girl is dropped several floors with a rope attached, hits the floor and dangles there only to have dog lick her blood before a pack of dogs comes and chew at her flesh.  There is no real story and no suspense. I don't recommend even renting this movie, let alone buying it. Save your time and read a good book or watch a classic movie instead.
