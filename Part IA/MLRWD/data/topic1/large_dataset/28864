Yes, this is not Queen.  We all know that.  And you'll miss Freddie nearly every moment through this DVD.  That being said, this was a wonderful concert.  I actually had goosebumps when Brian appeared from behind the curtain.

But something no reviewer has mentioned here.  This is Roger Taylor's finest performance ever.  He has obviously been keeping up on his chops, but the vocals?!?  Wow!!  While Paul (and yes Brian) had to fake a couple of notes that only Freddie could hit, wait till you here "Days"!!!  They should've let Roger sing "The bell that rings..."

My favorite moment wasn't a song, but when Roger introduced us to his best friend.  I think that was the best description of Queen that I've ever heard from any member.

I do have one complaint, just one.  And this one goes out to all you entertainers out there.  We are paying BIG MONEY to see you perform.  Do you know how silly (I'm talking to you Danny Miranda) you look with a "do-rag" on your head???  Heck, even Suave makes you look like you spent a fortune on your hair...
