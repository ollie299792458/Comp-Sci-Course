The western is a genre that is often full of cliches and steroetypes.  What Once Upon a Time in the West does is nothing short of amazing. It takes all those cliches and stereotypes and puts them all a bit askew.  I  don't think I have seen a film that has been better at creating so strong a  mood throughout a film as this one, and without much dialogue. That gives  credit to the excellent direction of this film.  Casting Henry Fonda  against type as the dark, forboding villian is nothing short of brilliant.  He delivers one of his best performances here, being totally believable as  a cold, heartless killer. You actually feel intimidated by this character.  Charles Bronsan, as the mysterious, nameless stranger, who pursues the  bandits with his own agenda, is riveting. Again, this is, without question,  his best performance as well. The opening sequence alone is worth a viewing  of this movie.  It is the greatest opening sequence I've ever seen, rivaled  only by the one from Raiders of the Lost Ark..maybe. It's hard to describe  with any one word. Watch this film and I think you will be hard put to find  another western that comes even close to being this suspenseful, moody, or  entertaining.
