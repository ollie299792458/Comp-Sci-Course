THE TALONS OF WEING CHIANG IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF DR WHO'S BEST STORIES AND THE BBC JUST SPECIALISE IN PRODUCING PERIOD COSTUME DRAMA. WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT SCRIPT BY ROBERT HOLMES WHO DISPLAYS HIS INVENTIVE WRITING AND IMAGINATION COMBINED WITH AN EERIE AND STRANGE ATMOSPHERE. DARK FOGGY STREETS,ALIEN TECHNOLOGY IN THE 19TH CENTURY, ORIENTAL MYSTERY AND SUPERB AND ENERGETIC DIRECTION BY DAVID MALONEY ANOTHER MAN WHO REALLY KNOWS HOW TO MAKE DR WHO LOOK ITS BEST. ITS ENJOYABLE TO SEE THE DOCTOR AND LEELA STROLLING THROUGH THE DARK FOGGY MYSTERIOUS STREETS WHICH HAVE AN AIR OF EVIL IN THEM AND THEN SUDDENLY AN ATTACK BY A GROUP OF CHINAMEN AFTER DISCOVERING THEY ARE CARRYING A DEAD BODY. ONE CAN TELL WHEN THEY ARE WATCHING THE EPISODE THAT IT HAS BEEN HUGELY INSPIRED BY THE FU MANCHU AND SHELOCK HOLMES STORIES AS WE SEE THE DOCTOR DRESSED IN A DEERSTALKER AND A CLOAK WHICH IS TYPICALLY HOLMESIAN AND THE PRESENCE OF A MYSTERIOUS CHINESE MAGICIAN AS SEEN IN THE FU MANCHU FILMS. HANDSOME CABS, AMATEUR SLEUTHS, A MURDEROUS WALKING SINISTER DUMMY, THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE ELEMENTS WHICH MAKES THE STORY SO ENGAGING AND ENJOYABLE. TOM BAKER GIVES AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE AS THE DOCTOR, HERE AS HE POSES AS A POLICE DETECTIVE INVESTIGATING THE CASE OF THE DEAD CAB DRIVER AND THE RAT HAIRS FOUND ON THE BODY AND THE EFFECTS OF OPIUM. THE REST OF THE ASSEMBLED CAST GIVE EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES PARTICULARLY JOHN BENNETT AS THE MYSTERIOUS CHINESE MAGICIAN L'HSEN CHANG, ITS JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT HE ISN'T ACTUALLY CHINESE AND HIS MAKEUP AND PERFORMANCE ARE JUST BREATHTAKING AND OUT OF THIS WORLD. CHRISTOPHER BENJAMIN AND TREVOR BAXTER SHINE AS HENRY GORDON JAGO AND PROFESSOR LITEFOOT THEIR RELATIONSHIP CONTRASTS VERY WELL ALONG WITH THE TEAMING OF CHANG AND WEING CHIANG. I SIMPLY LOVED THE SCENE WHERE LITEFOOT ADDRESSES GREEL AS A FILTHY BOWNDER WHICH WAS HILARIOUS. GREEL IS PORTRAYED VERY WELL BY MICHAEL SPICE WHO IS SIMPLY EERIE, CHILLING AND COMPLETELY MAD. HIS CHARACTER IS EXTREMELY TRAGIC MOST OF THE TIME AND OCCASSIONALLY HILARIOUS AND RUTHLESS AS WELL. THE LOCATIONS AND SETTINGS BLEND IN VERY WELL WITH THE STORY AND MAKE IT MORE ENJOYABLE AND CONVINCING, THE BEAUTIFUL CJ PIPPS THEATRE IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE WHICH WORKS VERY WELL AS THE PALACE THEATRE AND THE MOODY FILTHY SEWERS REALLY HELP TO CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE OF LATE VICTORIAN LONDON. THIS IS A DOCTOR WHO STORY AT ITS BEST WHICH IS HIGHLY DRAMATIC AND ENTERTAINING AND WHICH CAN BE ENJOYED AGAIN AND AGAIN. I ONLY HOPE THAT ONE DAY WE WILL SEE THIS STORY AS A DVD RELEASE.
