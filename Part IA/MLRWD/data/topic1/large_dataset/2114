Because I really enjoyed the book I have put off seeing the movie for some time, concerned that the movie would only disappoint, as is so often the case with the book-to-movie transition.  And now that I've seen the movie I don't think it disappointed, but as is also the often the case in the book-to-movie transition, there was so much great material from the book that just couldn't adapt to the silver screen.

Having said that, there were some great redeeming qualities to the movie.  The acting was superb.  The scenery of England was beautiful.  The re-creations of the scenes of the English military's evacuation from Dunkirk were outstanding.  The storyline of the movie was true to the book, accounting for the major scenes that develop the story.  The screenplay and the director were certainly successful in developing the circumstances of juvenile misunderstanding that led to heartbreak, misplaced justice, elusive love and passion, and ultimately lost life and a lifetime of regret.

As with the book, this movie does not convey joyous occasions, but rather some hard-learned lessons about life for a young girl that will haunt her forever.  Ones for which she will never be able to truly atone, but only pray for forgiveness.
