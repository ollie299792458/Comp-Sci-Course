I found this version refreshing and surprisingly good, despite the odd casting of Richard Gere as Lancelot. I thought he'd be too modern and American for the part, but he does very well with it.
Of course casting Sean Connery was inspired, Julia Ormond, whom I usually dislike, was good here and Ben Cross is perfect as the villianous Malagant.  The supporting cast of knights, courtiers, handmaids and denisons of Leonesse are all good as well.
This version has no Merlyn, no magic or witchcraft, though the Christian elements remain. It is made simpler and free from the usual intellectualized symbolic interpretations, taking the story out of the realm of mysticism and into clear human reality.
The principle characters are well developed, even the sets correspond perfectly to each character, and there is palpable sexual tension between Lancelot and Guinevere.  Also, in this version, Guinevere never actually consumates her relationships with Lancelot or with Arthur, as on their wedding day, she, Arthur and the kmights are called to rescue her homeland of Leonesse. Hence, this is a more idealized love story, but still has great cinematic appeal.
There's wonderfully written dialogue, excellent cinematography and editing, crisp night scenes, beautiful music, intricate costumes (her's - but not so much for the men), lovely sets (though Camelot is rather Hollywood looking) and Malagant's ruin of a black slate rock 'cave castle' is awesome.
My only criticism is how easily Malagant takes over Camelot during the city gathering, since apparently no one thought to guard the city gates.
Still I found it well done and entertaining, for general audiences. I recommend it.
