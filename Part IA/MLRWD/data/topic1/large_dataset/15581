Late one night I happened to be flipping through channels with my boyfriend when we stopped at the Independant Film Channel to watch what we thought would be an amusing French movie (The Lovers on the Bridge). We were not intrigued by the dramatic plot the info box on the tv told us, we were rather drawn into the film by the ridiculous plot it had. "A blind artist falls in love with a homeless man on a bridge in France," sounds like a winner, so we left the channel on even though the movie was partly over. Right away we found ourselves watching the silhouettes of a crazed man and woman frolicking loudly upon a beach at night. Did I mention they were naked? Yes all you saw were their silhouettes, but very obviously we could see the man atleast was naked. After that feast for our eyes, we watched as the rest of the movie dragged on, each scene an obvious attempt to push the main characters further into their desperation/drunkeness/hopelessness/homelessness/artistic loneliness. Each new "twist" in the plot was ridiculously predicatable and made us say, "Are you serious? They actually spent money to make this into a movie?" Finally the "dark" movie ends in what is supposed to be a "happy" ending but really makes the movie seem even worse as it only shows the recklessness of both characters and doesn't resolve the tension between the characters. It's like the writer of the film had an idea to make a dark artistic story but didn't want a tragic ending as most films of the genre do so he decided to abrubtly end the story and carry both characters away happily in a boat to the middle of no where, out of the story and thankfully now, out of my mind.
