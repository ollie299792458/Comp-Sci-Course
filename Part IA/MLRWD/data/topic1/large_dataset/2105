I originally saw this doc. on PBS around '86.  Growing up on the east coast I knew nothing of Harvey Milk and didn't remember even hearing of his and SF Mayor George Moscone's assasinations.  After watching this film for the first time I was quite moved by the true story, the man Harvey Milk and what he stood for.  I wished more Americans could see this documentary to learn of a man important to gay, San Francisco and US history. Since then I have seen this film a few times on PBS and twice on the large screen as restored by the UCLA archive.  One of the times seen in a movie theater setting I was treated to director Rob Epstein being present for a Q&A with the audience.  It was really great to hear some of the backstories on the making of the film directly from the man who won the Oscar for his work on bringing the story to life as a documentary. Fast forward to the recent few months and I found myself  thrilled to know Harvey Milk's story was being brought to the mainstream with the release of Gus Van Sant's 'Milk', impressed to see how Van Sant told the story and more than pleased to see Sean Penn win the Oscar for his AMAZING portrayal of Milk.  'The Times of Harvey Milk' is a MUST SEE to truly appreciate Penn 'becoming' Harvey Milk since many of the scenes in the documentary are depicted word for word  as well as cinematically and, as such, show how Penn captures the essence of H.M. Even though Harvey Milk is no longer alive, he lives on through this film, through 'Milk' and continues to inspire the idea that we are ALL human beings deserving equal rights no matter how different we might be from each other and that the strongest thing that should ultimately bind humanity together is LOVE. Get this movie...watch and enjoy...and pay it forward by sharing its beauty and message with others...
