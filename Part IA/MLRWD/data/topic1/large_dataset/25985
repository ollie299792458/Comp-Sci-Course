Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant.  Being able to glance into the behind stage (and behind closed doors) antics of one of the greatest songwriters of all time is a rare honour (usually reserved for those closest to Dylan).  The performances show Bob at his best, and are simply captivating.  The archived footage of Dylan's performance of "Only a Pawn in Their Game" is rugged and honest...just Bob with his guitar.  Dylan, even now, prooves that all he needs is his voice and his guitar to get his message across.
The behind the scenes footage is the gravy for every true fan.  To be able to see him as a man (interacting with his friends, going through the motions of a busy tour schedule, and seeing the number of people that he felt "responsible" for) is refreshing and lets the viewer feel closer to Dylan.  Especially humourous is the scene that shows Dylan and Joan Baez in a car; Dylan reading a newspaper, and Baez singing yet another one of Dylan's songs (but this time, in a voice almost meant to imitate Bob).  He looks at her, and even though he is wearing sunglasses, one can clearly tell that he is annoyed.  Coincidentally or not, this is one of her last scenes in the film.  One can only imagine being in Dylan's shoes; trying to do something as simple as reading a paper only to be interrupted by his own song being slaughtered before his very eyes.  The many faces of Dylan are shown in this film...including the not so pleasant sides, but to love Bob is to accept ALL of his quirks and changes in mood (including those that see him aggitated and spouting "gibberish" in response to questions).
The true fan will love this film.  Only those people who already dislike Dylan to begin with (who are possibly ignorant of the musical genius, historical relevance, and "ways" of Dylan) run the chance of disliking this documentary...in which case, they really should have no cause to watch it...and are already too biased against Dylan to give an accurate, educated review.
