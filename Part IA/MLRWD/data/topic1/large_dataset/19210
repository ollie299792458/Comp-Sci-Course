We love football in the South, so we love football movies. They're exciting, action-packed and inspiring. And they usually address important character traits beyond teamwork, because who you are on the field, in the heat of battle, is who you are. But Facing the Giants takes it to a whole new level. My son and I wanted to watch it again as soon as it ended. We bought it to take to Canada for friends to see, and one friend had just seen it a few nights earlier because somebody from Montana had taken it up! It's spreading like wildfire. Faith is really put to the test in this story, and not just faith in teammates or the head coach; real faith. The kind you have to dig deep for, even pray for, and then ignore everything your senses are telling you in order to keep. The kind that works. If you've never seen that kind of faith work in real life, like I have many times, then I dare you to watch this movie and not want it - that faith, I mean. And the movie, too!
