It's not too often that a movie comes along that delves into the darker side of addiction as this film does.  From the opening scenes at the funeral to the relationship break-up that occurred while the lead character was in rehab, this tale really causes the viewer to open her eyes and see the world with a fresh perspective.  I found the main love interest to be quite charming, as it is not very often that a man with thick scars on his cheeks is considered to be "attractive."  Yet the movie broke through stereotypes and allowed for his romance with the lead character, although it did end in tragedy after his post break-up suicide.

I was not a fan, however, of the gratuitous depictions of senseless violence, particularly towards the end of the movie.  The lead character's downward spiral into addictive self-destruction was important to the plot, but we did not need to see her repeated attempts at self-mutilation and physical abuse.  I was also highly offended by the shower scene, as I felt that it was tasteless and overly bloody.  Defecation should never be seen in a movie of this rating.

But considering everything, I still think that it can be an enjoyable film for the whole family, provided that your family consists entirely of people over the age of 10.  I watched it with my Grandma.
