Disney and Pixar's "Toy Story" was the first full-length computer animated feature ever, and now it is the first "Walt Disney Gold Collection" video released as of January 11th, 2000. The "Walt Disney Gold Collection" is a group of films that inspire wonder and imagination for a life time, and "Toy Story" fits that description perfectly! 
Have you ever had a favorite toy? Well Andy did. His was Woody, a cowboy doll. But when Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear space man for his birthday, Woody feels cast aside. Woody's jealousey leads him and Buzz lost far away from home. Now they must work together to get home before Andy moves to a new house.
The great thing about the "Walt Disney Gold Collection" is that they include special features weather they are on video or DVD. "Toy Story" has the 1988 Academy AwardÂ®-Winning Animated Short "Tin Toy", "You've Got A Friend In Me" music video as featured on the hit "Toy Story" soundtrack, and a behind the scenes look at the making of "Toy Story." So if you bought the video when it first came out, you may consider buying it again.
