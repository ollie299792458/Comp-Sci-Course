I give it two stars only because there were some decent action sequences. A lot of the reviewers seem to think that because it's the action genre that we should expect to check our brains at the door, but I disagree. I expected the movie to at least tie together somewhat and not be completely insipid. Unfortunately, it had major major plot problems that just irritated me throughout and in fact made it painful to keep watching, because the plot hole destroyed the credibility of the main character. To explain, Lady Croft (man, that got annoying hearing her referred to so formally all throughout the flick) needs to keep the villain from getting two halves of a pyramid to put together, which will enable him to be essentially master of the universe. So what do these filmwriters do? They have Lady Croft find the first piece of the pyramid fairly early on in the film. That should have been the end of the story, because the villain needed both halves to wreak his destruction. At that point, with one half in her possession, she could destroy it and put an end to the whole thing. But no. She has to go after the second half. And there is never any justification for why she would need to do this. Pointless. Had the writers simply given the villain the first piece of the pyramid, this would have come together decently and actually created some drama. They didn't. It didn't work. And I spent the last half of the film cursing the protagonist for being a complete moron.
