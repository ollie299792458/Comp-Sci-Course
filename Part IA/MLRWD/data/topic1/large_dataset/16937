An inspiring movie about a coach who wants his team to win basketball games, but more importantly, to become much more than anyone (including themselves) expects.

A number of times during the movie, Coach Carter asks his player Timo Cruz what his deepest fear is. This movie is worth seeing just to hear Timo's eventual response (a quote from Marianne Williamson):  "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."

Judging from the "yeahs!" and "hallelujahs!" in the audience, they felt the same way.
