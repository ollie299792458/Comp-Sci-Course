Even as a kid, my expectations at the release of ABBA The Movie were tempered by the knowledge that ABBA were good musicians and not great performers. I was lucky enough to attend the Perth concerts where most of the live footage was filmed (I can see myself down the front during Dancing Queen!), and clearly remember what a strangely stiff performance ABBA gave (the movie certainly benefits from the immediacy of onstage filming). The Movie is a valuable artifact of the insane ABBAmania which existed in Australia at the time - mania that was already beginning to subside by the time ABBA finally returned on their world tour a year after they first visited. It's a shame Universal didn't capitalise on this by documenting the reams of media reportage of the time as dvd features. The Movie looks and sounds fantastic, though, especially the concert sequences, and I am amazed how beautiful Frida and Agnetha look, and how perfectly complementary. The "story" is hopeless and obviously done on the fly, but every time ABBA are onscreen the movie powers up. Try to find the limited edition 2-disc set, though, because it contains an excellent, recent reminiscence by Benny, Bjorn and director Lasse Hallstrom, as well as galleries and tv spots; again, not a lot, but certainly better than the single disc version.
