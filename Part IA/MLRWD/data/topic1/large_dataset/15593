I recently purchased Resident Evil: Deluxe Edition from Amazon.com. Having never seen this film before, I realized that I played a gamble with this DVD. However, I think I did alright.

For 11.49, you really can't go wrong. This film features non-stop action, suspense, and a semi-decent plot to go with the flow of the film. Mind you, the plot has the structural integrity of a block of swiss cheese. But, bear in mind that Resident Evil is not a film that was made with the intention of getting nominated for an Academy Award.

Movies of this genre require only 2 things:

1) A beautiful female lead who knows martial arts and can manipulate a 9mm with the finesse of a Parisian street artist (that is a compliment).

2) Lots of on-screen death and destruction. Resident Evil is chock-full of "#2". Zombies are shot at, kicked at, punched at, and even head-butted at one point I think.

Grab the popcorn and Coke. Dim the lights, and turn up the sound. For 12 dollars, I do not think you will be disappointed.

5 solid stars. Not for quality, but for pure entertainment value. Do NOT expect deep, thought-provoking dialogue, and thematic material from this film.

DO expect one hell of a ride....and with Milla driving, you'll definitely be in for a treat!
