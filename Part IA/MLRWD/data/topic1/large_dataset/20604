Romy and Michele's High School Reunion is the most fun movie I have ever seen in my life.  It's a movie to watch more then once and you never get sick of it.  I am a male and just by seeing this movie about these two women, Romy ( Mira Sorvino ) and Michele ( Lisa Kudrow ,) going sarcasm crazy and just having a fun time in life.  
  Romy and Michele weren't losers in high school, but they definitely weren't the popular girls.  They were just there.  The " A " group, made up of a few girls, were the popular group and really made their life hell.  Kristy Masters, I don't know the actresses name, was a total, well, female dog and was mean to Romy and Michele.  Romy and Michele were like best friends and they only did stuff with each other.
  Now it's 10 years later, and the girls are about 27.  They still have their sarcasm and everything, and they live together in California.  Romy bumps into Toby, Janeane Garafolo, at the place she works, the Jaguar Car Dealership.  Toby says how the 10 year reunion is coming up and Romy was puzzled ... she never got an invitation.  So the girls decide to go to the reunion, but one problem ... they want to look successful.  They want to show everyone how good they look, how they act, how proud they are that they live in California while everyone else is stuck in Tuscon, Arizona, where the reunion is.  I will stop here, as I don't want to tell the whole movie.
  Anyways, just see this movie.  It is so excellent ... you will start making sarcasm a part of your language....
