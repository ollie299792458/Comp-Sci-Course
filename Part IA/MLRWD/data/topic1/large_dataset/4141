After the wedding singer,Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are back agin for this hit that would be hard to forget even if you had Lucy's memory.
Here's the plot,the interviews and trailer didn't really help me understand what the plot is about,so here's my go at a better one:
Henry(Adam Sandler) is a marine biologist who dreams that one day the ship that he's been working on really hard could sail around the island of Hawaii.
Until one day he falls in love with a girl at first sight at a diner.Even though he's promised himself he'd only get to know tourists since he won't have to commit himself to one person and enjoyed the quick encounters he has the girl believe he's somebody else completely in,there was something about this girl,Lucy(Drew Barrymore)that really caught his attention.The first day goes smooth but the second day she acts like she's never seen him before..That's when he gets acquainted with  that she has day-long memory,and her father and brother have to pretend it's her father's birthday everyday because that's when she got in the accident that cost her her short term memory...she has found out before and been heartbroken only to wake up the other day without a clue,but Henry isn't willing to give up on her,even when her brother and father tell him to stay away..he uses his knowledge of the previous days to win her love over again everyday.....and maybe there is a solution..
this movie is funny,but really moving also.I recommend it to everyone.
This movie really got my attention and wasn't soon forgotten..it really is a new type of movie,it could really appeal to your taste,you know how variety is really delicious!
