i loved this film for all the reasons why they dont make them like they do today.  this film has atmosphere from the very beginning, there are no smart alecky teens in this one.  there is no pop soundtrack or "feel good" ending. a definate inspiration to those evil dead flicks, but not as gory. this is one film that would never get made today, basically because it shows no compromise in its vision.  the zombies make up is passable, i have seen worse elsewhere.  the soundtrack is a variety of noisy feedback adding to the already brilliant mix of humor and mayhem that finally shows up at the last 30 minutes.  this is a welcome return to a film that many shudder whenever i mention the name, a good sign of a true classic horror film. for a film that was rated pg, it has all the terror that many r rated films fail to deliver, which makes it more worthwhile repeated viewing.  I highly recommend this cult classic for those who take their horror films seriously...and for those looking for a freddy kruger, may i suggest looking elsewhere. a definate halloween treat, buy it dont rent it!
