Ice Cube has really evolved from being the most brutal member of gangsta rap group NWA, to a brutal actor and, now, to a light and funny man. Who knew?

Since his rise to fame as an actor with Boys N The Hood in 1989, Cube has been in hit movies like Friday and The Barbershop and duds like Torque and XXX 2: The Next Level.

Are We There Yet is his latest lightfare road comedy about a man named Nick who wants to prove to the woman, played by Nia Long, he's interested in that he can handle responsibilities by taking her two snot-nosed kids from Oregon to Toronto where she is conducting business just in time to celebrate New Year's with her in his brand new Navigator. The kids do almost everything annoying and disgusting that you can think of: throwing up in the car, locking Nick out and taking the car for a wild spin, and setting Nick's pride and joy on fire!

The film is cute and tolerable considering that it borrows its ideas from past road comedies like Vacation, Planes Trains And Automobiles, and Road Trip. However, kids and even grown ups will laugh at how silly Ice Cube can really be!
