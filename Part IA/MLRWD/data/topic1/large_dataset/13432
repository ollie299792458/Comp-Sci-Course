Singapore theatres are now screening this film and I have view this film at one of the theatre. There are a lot and also intense actions in this movies as one of the scene is the plane fly past the ferry port with tons of blast on the walkway of the port and also there are scene where the knife is twiated and pull out and the other is the use of knife to kill and there are some where using a machine gun to sweep the bad guys when the head is blown off.....very very nice actions so far and the story based is bacially about removing the bad army soldiers where there is a bad guy head in charge of catching one woman blah blah blah.....this film is regarded is one of good title of film. I rated this as a four star.......a recommended purchase for those whom are fans of this DVDfilm/movies when this title is made available for purchasing.

N/B: This film also include actors like Jet Li and even Arnold Schwarzenegger. Dark Age of action fun......
