This film is a frightening WWWIII scenario from the fertile mind of self-described "zen facist" John Milius.  Mr. Milius is not as gung-ho commando as everyone would like you to believe, it's just that there are about 5 actual conservatives in Hollywood and he happens to be one of them.
As scenario's go, it's a nifty one.  Russia and the Warsaw pact take out Europe and NATO dissolves.  Cuban and marxist central American armies use commercial airlines to drop airborne units into the midwestern United States while Russia uses ICBM's to take out key American cities and defense installations.  It is not unrealistic that terrorists or a foreign government could use commercial airliners to launch a sneak attack on our own soil, especially in light of the events of 9-11.
Ron O'Neal, "Priest" of "SUPERFLY" fame, plays the leader of the cuban forces, who faces off against the local high school football team which has taken off to the mountains to use their outdoor skills to form a guerrila army and use hit-and-run tactics to fight back.  O'Neal gave a good performance as a man who has become what he depises, as his character fought wars of resistance in central america.  Now, the tables are turned and he has become the imperialist aggressor.
Milius is actually using "RED DAWN" as a thinly disguised allegory of the benefits of the second amendmend, which does not give Americans the right to bear arms, but the right to use arms to defend land and country.  While personally, I think a rifle/gun is a cowards weapon, who is to say what a person would do in a kill or be killed situation?  The second amendmend is probably the only thing standing in the way of a total takeover of our country.
