Buier Beware! My granddaughter hinted she wanted "Ballet Shoes" the movie for X-Mas. I looked on Amazon and found one site offering a single, new DVD of Ballet Shoes for $5.10 +S&H, then I found this site offering 3-DVDs of Ballet Shoes for $37.50 (now $44.08) and scrolling down the details, it read [FORMAT: Box Set] My thought was that there must be a trimmed version, and a longer version (as sometimes happens with made for TV movies for example.) So I purchased the 3-DVD "Box Set" and gave it to her today (Christmas Morning) and on closer examination, the whole family agreed that these were three identical copies of the same movie. I was silently outraged and embarrassed. I wanted to send them back for a refund, but my granddaughter was so excited about the gift that she tore open one of the sealed containers so we could all watch it together. I decided to let her give the other two copies to two of her friends.
  I returned to this site after that and looked more carefully and found further down on the page, it said [Product Description: Includes 3 Units of: Ballet Slippers (KOC-DV-6545)] but why does it say (FORMAT:Box Set)? I realize I should have read all the information more carefully, but I can't help feeling somewhat deceivede by this seller, and there was no such mention of my 3-DVD dilemma in the reviews I read. I have never encountered any site selling multiple copies of the same movie, and I have purchesed hundreds of DVDs through Amazon. Great movie, bad seller!
