Ever since my childhood, I've held an interest in extreme weather. Not enough to turn it into a career per say, but enough to see the occasional thunderstorm as more than a mere inconvenience. Holding such a view, my slobbering love affair with Twister would seem a forgone conclusion. No lie, I flat-out love the movie and can easily muster multiple viewings in a single day without batting an eyelash. Still, despite being a Twister junkie, there are several things about this movie I can't make excuses for.

While I wouldn't want to change any member of the cast, I think everyone can admit that Bill Paxton is a terrible actor. From classics like "Dorothy, you took her you damn thief!" to "Jo, things go wrong, you can't explain it you can't predict it!" Paxton is extremely wooden at times. As bad and entertaining as that can be, this allows the other members of Jo's storm chasing team (like Philip Seymour Hoffman) to steal some well deserved spot light every once in a while.

Another blessing is how the special effects and action bury a truly predictable love story, a necessary evil that plays out by the numbers. Impressive as the special effects are in general sense, the problems encountered during the shoot can be easily deciphered by the viewer through the movie's myriad of continuity errors. The sidewinder's on the right side of the road, so the rational thing to do would be to turn left at the last intersection? Watch the movie enough and the spotty editing becomes a running gag in and of itself.

All problems aside, if you're looking for movie that shows Mother Nature at her worst, Twister is going to be at the top of your list despite all of its flaws.
