I'm jealous of those who have yet to experience this masterpiece. Having watched all of Fellini's works, this, in my humble opinion, is his magnum opus. It's also one of the greatest films ever made.  What makes this film so transcendent is, of course, the main character Cabiria. Certainly one of the all-time greatest performances, Masina is awe-inspiring.

It's fair to say that no other film creates such a connection between its main character and the audience.  By the time the famous, final seven minutes roll around, we are so utterly in love with Cabiria, and so desperate for her to be happy, that the heartbreak is almost unbearable. If the movie had ended right after this gut wrenching climax, I would have been seething with rage (similar to the way I felt after watching "La Strada," which had all the cruel sorrow but none of the sweet optimism).  Fortunately, Fellini recognized how totally committed and entrenched the audience would be with Cabiria, and he generously (and brilliantly) added a bit of salvation for us.

I can't think of any other film that, in its final minutes, so effortlessly takes the audience from the lowest depth of despair to the highest peak of hope.  One simply cannot forget this movie, this character, and the most emotionally moving/rewarding ending in cinematic history.  I saw this movie twenty years ago, and, to this day, I still desperately want Cabiria to be doing okay.
