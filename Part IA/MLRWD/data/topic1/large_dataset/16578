Could only find the Blu-ray in the stores, so I went on line and found this one which had both CD DVD and Blu-ray so it can be used for years and years even if videos go to just Blu-ray in the future. It was also cheaper on Amazon then in the stores. I only could find it in Toys R Us as Wal-Mart and Target did not have them when I looked. I bought them for a set of grand-daughters and a set of grandsons. The boys were not too excited until they watched it the first time and then they were sold. Those Dwarfs get them everytime. But it is Disney and who can argue with the Master of all animation? He certainly was well ahead of his time and children everywhere are certainly better for it. The Wonderful World of Disney made me want to go to Disneyland, which I have never been able to do. But with Disney's genius, have visited Epcot and Disney World seven times in my life and plan another trip in a couple of years to take all my five grandchildren so they don't have to wait until they are all grown up to go.
