I'm glad I ordered this movie for 48-hour viewing rather than saw it in a theater, because the first time I watched it I was completely bewildered by the over-orchestration and disjointed scenes --- the movie seemed to me more like a collection of vignettes and unexpected flashbacks than a traditionally flowing movie, and I was reminded of the fact that this is the first film by a pair of directors who had previously worked only in the theater. However, even though I didn't watch the movie again all the way through, I re-viewed large sections of it, and found that the more I watched it the more I appreciated the acting and production values.

This is definitely Rob Pattinson's movie - he's in every scene and nearly every frame of the film, and all the other characters are planets orbiting around him. If there are any emotions that he did not get to convey in this movie, I can't think of them, and I would imagine that making this film was a very intense experience for him. He "looks the part" in this period drama, but since his physical appearance is important to the character, there are elegant scenes where he could have used a shave and a shampoo; none of the other men in these scenes have greasy hair and a five-o'clock shadow, and it's an "eeew" factor that distracts from his otherwise amazing face.

I loved the performances by Thurman, Ricci, and Thomas, because even though their characters behaved similarly to each other in the social scenes, they each broke down in a different way that really defined their characters. The other male characters were more ancillary, but also well-cast.

The movie is visually beautiful, although as I mentioned earlier, the background music is way too much (and I'm a classical musician, so if anything, I should have enjoyed all the classically-oriented music). If you like period dramas, I would recommend this movie.
