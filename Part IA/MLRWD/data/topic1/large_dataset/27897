I first watched this movie because of my burgeoning love for the 1920s.  But it soon became my favorite movie (surpassing "Ghostbusters", which had been my favorite since 1984).

The movie (unlike the musical theater production) has absolutely gorgeous costumes and goes into much more detail about the story so that you understand completely what is happening.  Rob Marshall did such an amazing job with this movie - the musical numbers being part of Roxie's imagination was a great touch.

Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C. Reilly were perfect in their roles (as were everyone else!).  I had no idea that most of these people could sing and dance like that!  Listening to the soundtrack gets me every time - those wonderful Kander and Ebb songs are sung so right on!

I also love the Razzle Dazzle edition of the movie because of the awesome special features.  Going behind all the musical numbers and seeing rehearsals for them makes you realize just how much work went into this movie.  And I loved the Chita Rivera and Liza Minelli extras!

This movie is just wonderful - it brings to life the original intent of Maurine Watkins' play with the beloved Kander and Ebb songs and stunning costumes and visuals.
