As soon as I saw the trailer online for Dawn of the Dead, I couldn't wait for it to be released.  We got to the theater and it was so packed that we had to sit on the theater steps LOL.  But even with so many people around me, I didn't feel safe... my eyes were glued to the screen and my stomach was tied in knots during the whole movie--from beginning to end.  (Every now and then I'd have to tear my attention away and look around just to ground myself back into reality.)  When we left the movie, I was still creeped out in the parking lot and when I got home I was scared to get out of my car to go in the house.

I thought it was a good movie.  And plus they played "The Sickness" at the end. :-)

And those weren't dead people in 28 Days Later... they were just sick freaks... LOL. Dawn of the Dead was a little more light-hearted than 28 Days Later too.  At the end of 28 Days Later, you're like, "Ugh that was a gross movie", and you feel dirty for having watched it.  At the end of Dawn of the Dead, you're like, "Man, that was creepy", but you're laughing too.
