A day after viewing this movie, I kept hearing this tune running around in my head.  It was Victor's Theme from this movie. The story is about a reluctant groom practising his vows for his arrainged wedding who accidentally marries a corpse bride. It gets interesting from there, but you should really see the film. It is done as a Musical-Comedy.

The picture on Blu-Ray is excellent. A good movie to test 1080P TV's. The first time I watched it, I couldn't decide if it was done with stop-motion photography or by Computer-Generated Immagery. The motion is so fluid and the effects (I.E. Bride's veil blowing in the wind) so well done that it's hard to believe it was done by stop-motion, or was it? See the special features for the answer. Every time I watch it I find something new. They did some very good optical effects that are normally done in a stage production.

The music is built around Victor's Theme and is delightful. My only complaint is that in a couple of scenes the music briefly overpowers the dialogue. You may hear parts of it in your head after the movie is over.

Trivia: 1. Find the tribute to the innovator of stop-motion photography.

2. Find Rhet Butler's Tagline. There are others if you just look for them.

A great movie for children of all ages (I'm 61). Five stars.
