The characters in "Interview with the Vampire" are a bit overplayed, but the lives and the world portrayed by them are dark, beautiful, and enticing. The characters are quite charismatic and memorable, from the supremely evil Lestat (Tom Cruise), to the melancholy foil of Lestat, Louis (Brad Pitt), a two-hundred year old vampire torn by guilt and remorse. Perhaps the most charismatic and best portrayed character, was Claudia (Kirsten Dunst). She was "born into darkness" at eight years of age, fed on by Louis and turned to darkness by Lestat. Beautiful, dark, intelligent, and sophisticated, Claudia feels none of the regret that Louis does. Indeed, her blood lust is equal to or greater than Lestat's. The lives led by vampires are highly romanticized in "Interview..." They are enticing, their world unbelievably intriguing, yet they are children of darkness, knowing no light, no release from their eternal lonliness, except when they kill. This perhaps, is the ultimate irony. Though not terribly subtle or complex, this movie was extremely well done, and I would recommend it to anyone with a taste for gothic romance or vampire movies.
