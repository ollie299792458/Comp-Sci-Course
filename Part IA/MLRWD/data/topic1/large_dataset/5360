I loved Ghost Ship.

It's probably a good thing that I actually didn't see it for quite a long time: I kept walking by it on video store shelves and seeing it pop up on my amazon list several times, but then dismissed it as one of those B movie knockoff of greater sea-horror movies such as Virus. Well, one day, I turned on the TV, nothing else was on, and so I ended up watching Ghost Ship.

I was pleasantly surprised. I'm a scathing critic of the horror genre, mostly because I was watching the classics from the time I was like, five. Not much shocks or surprises me any more.

However, firstly, the opening was enough to make even me cringe. It caught my attention with that. Then, as the move progressed, it had several clever twists and turns and totally wasn't what I expected at all. The end I WAY didn't see coming, and so that was awesome.

Gabriel Byrne was brilliant in this-I was spoiled on him from End of Days but bitterly disappointed at how hollow his acting seemed in Stigmata. He made up for it here. Urban (of now Star Trek fame) also had a part in this movie, and he's a fantastic actor, too-all in all, if you like being sucked in by a -looks-cheap-but-isn't- kind of horror movie, this is the one to see.
