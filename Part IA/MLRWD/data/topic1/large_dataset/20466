Not the worst film I've ever seen, but very close. Mainly disappointing because it had potential. Guy Pierce, while not his usual great acting self, did modestly well with the role he was given. A John McClain type character who takes and gives punches while also dishing sarcasm and one-liners. The main reason for the failure of this film is attempting to do way too much, while doing nothing well at all. The film's "plot" tries to tie in political espionage, a rescue mission, a prison film, science fiction, a quasi-love story, and a revenge tale all in 90 minutes. There also is a battle in space involving space fighter ships, a pair of disjointed Irish inmate brothers playing the evil hostage takers, and an ozone reentry scene with no protection. After 10 minutes it takes a no dive with Guy Pierce trying his best to make it work. The film should have scraped every special effects portion, which was B camp bad, and stuck with a shoot-em up prison rescue. There was no need for the female lead to be the President's daughter, or have all the underlying subplots (subpoops) going on. This script needed a major overhaul or triple the budget to make the effects seem at all realistic. Too bad to, the idea was cool, but just terribly executed. DO.NOT.VIEW.THIS.FILM.
