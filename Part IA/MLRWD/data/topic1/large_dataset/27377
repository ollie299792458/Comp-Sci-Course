I have seen this movie in bits and peices before, but after watching it a couple of times from start to finish; I was left with an inescapable conclusion: This move is hilarious! Billy Wilder is the master of comic farce. He always had a knack for taking the most preposterous stories and plots (i.e. "Some Like It Hot") and turning them into not only witty, intelligent films, but down right bust-a-gut funny! Even the supporting players like Arlene Francis, I found myself rolling over her performance. From the children to the office workers, there was hardly anyone it this film that did not tickle my funny bone. And of course, the incomprable James Caganey. I could listen to him all day over those Wilder/Diamond one-liners and lengthy monologues! I highly recommend it if you want to laugh for a good 90 minutes. Who could not laugh at those chase scenes through East-West Berlin? Thanks for making this available. As of now, you'd have to purchase the entire Billy Wilder collection (Not that there's anything wrong with that), but I already have a good amount of his films.
