This movie has got to have the most well written animated female  character I've ever seen. A lead character who is not driven by trying to find her prince charming, and constantly whining through out the film. I'm  so miserable! I need this! I want that! "Me, me, me!" but only by  the desperate need to try and save the life of her youngest son.  
Not a  Princess, nor a Buxom blonde bomb shell, who looks more like she should be  on the cover of "Hey, Dude!" magazine then innocently drawing  water from a well in the woods. Nope, it took a tiny brown mouse in a  tattered cloth to bring out THIS kind of sincere, truly caring, and very  believable compassion.
I can't remember how many times I've seen this  film but I always still get teary-eyed every time the scene where Mrs.  Frisby is feeding the broth to Timothy plays. The song and that scene are  just very touching.
If you've never seen this film please see it, and  also try reading the book, it's more in depth as well as quite different  than the movie in many ways, and some will say far better than the movie,  but I recommend them both!
The only thing I would have liked to see is  this movie released on DVD in wide screen format. For that reason I'm  sticking with my old video copy. But in either format this is one to see!
