WOW! I say again WOW! Masamune Shirow's masterpiece "Ghost in the Shell" was orginally manga yet it is even better as an anime. At first I was scepitical about this one, consider the anime "Appleseed",  yet never did I expect it to surpase the manga. Director Mamoru Oshi, whom  directed Patlabor and Patlabor 2, creates a future where what you see is  not always real. In the future humans can connect with the internet through  inplants on the back of their necks. A mysterious hacker known only as the  Puppet Master has begun to hack into people minds creating a false memor in  their brain, thus able to manipulate them like a puppet. Major Kusanagi is  an assassin for a branch of the government known as Section 9. Soon the  major and her team begin a hunt for the mysterious Puppet Master that leads  from hidden agendas and government conspiracies to a scientific discovery  that could redifine humanity. Ghost in the Shell is anime that has given  rise to such films as "The Matrix". The animation is as good if  not better then that of Patlabor 2 and Wing of Honneamise. The voices are  good yet I have heard a better voice cast, such as "Neon Genisis  Evangelion". The musical score like "Patlabor 2" is haunting  yet also tranquil, I highly recomend the soundtrack. Ghost in the Shell  asks all of us one question that will make you think "What does it  mean to be alive?, what does it mean to be human?" This video is worth  every penny you pay. Warning this film contains scenes of intense violence,  nudity, and strong language recommended viewing is for 17 and up.
