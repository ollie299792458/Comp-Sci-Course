This is a very powerful tale based partly on the actual events that happened in Salem back in the 1600s concerning some young girls who started dabbling in the occult and then tried to cover it up and avoid blame by accusing others of bewitching THEM. The story also concerns an unfaithful man (John Proctor) who cheated on his good and modest wife with a calculating and obsessive young hussy played perfectly by the character of Winona Ryder. But he loves his wife and turns away from the hussy, who then takes her revenge. John is publicly made to pay for his private sins, and asked to sign a humiliating confession that will destroy his reputation as it is going to be posted on the church door for all to read. In order to save his life, he signs his name to the confession and gives up his soul to his inquisitors, but the confession is a lie because he was never a witch. In a heart-wrenching scene where he changes his mind, he shrieks: "I sign myself to lies!" and he pleads: "I have given you my soul!... please leave me my good name!" He rips up the signed false confession and seals his doom.
I was very pleased with the sad and moving ending. I hope the viewing public understands the powerful paradox of it--the good true Christian people being falsely accused and hanged for witchcraft while their satanic accusers and evilly misled inquisitors look on along with a mournful, remorseful crowd. The scene at the very end with the Lord's prayer was a poignant touch. I'm glad the director had the courage to give it, as usually Hollywood plays it safe by providing the "happy ending", whether it fits or not. This heart-breaking and haunting ending was much more effective than any contrived happy ending could have been. Brilliant drama!
