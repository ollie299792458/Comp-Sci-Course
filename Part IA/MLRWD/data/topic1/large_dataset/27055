This has to be the best sounding DVD I own. The sound is even better than Roger Waters' In The Flesh DVD, (also worth buying!), which was the best DVD I owned till Hell Freezes Over.
I'm sort of dissapointed now 'cos I feel I've heard the best 5.1 Digital DTS Surround sound on DVD and its not going to get any better for me.
A word of caution though, there is also a version of this concert in PCM Stereo only and the covers of both look too much alike. If you buy this DVD elsewhere be sure to check whether its the 5.1 DTS or the PCM Stereo. This release has both and the stereo mix is also fantastic.
The instruments really do sound ALIVE. I've always heard other people talk about how great a paticular DVD is and how the players are right there with them. Well, I've never been convinced till I heard this concert. Its almost eerie to be so close! A great deal of care seems to have gone into capturing the acoustic quality of the guitars and congas. I have never heard anything like it in my life. And probably never will!
The songs performed on this disc are very well performed. The Eagles seem refreshed and eager to play after their fourteen year vacation. There is a certain atmosphere, (almost a positive aura if you like!), around them. The fact that they are sitting down for most of the selections adds a relaxed feel and really sets the stage. The songs range from a brilliant version of Hotel California and ends with a bonus DTS audio only track of Seven Bridges Road with all five Eagles coming through the five seperate speakers - its mind-blowing.
I can't stress how great this DVD really is - you have to see for yourself. Even if its the last DVD you ever get, which it might 'cos other DVDs won't even come close.
