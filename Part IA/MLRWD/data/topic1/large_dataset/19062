As my on-line moniker suggests, I am a "film addict" and especially love movie musicals.  I've seen this film numerous times on TV, had videotaped it off the air years ago, and am very happy to own this double-disc DVD package.

Being a fan who never can get enough behind-the-scenes "411" on any film that I particularly enjoy, having all the "making of" special features and the 1949 silent version included in the package is wonderful. (I'd seen it before on TCM.)  I do wish that the silent version had been captioned in yellow or another color as you lose the words at the bottom of the screen when they are shown against a white background like the bottom of a costume, a tablecloth, etc.

I could have done without some of Jeanine Basinger's commentary as she repeats herself, and in my opinion could have just stopped talking and let the film's dialogue take over.  I felt as though she must have been paid for every word she uttered, and thought I'd screamed if she used the word "fabulous" one more time! It's also obvious that Leslie Caron was not in the studio with Ms. Basinger and her comments had been recorded at another time - or were lifted from her TCM interview with Robert Osborne and inserted in the commentary audio track. I felt the volume during her comments was too loud, but it's always a plus to have one or more of the original (living) cast members contribute to these packages.

If you enjoyed this film during it's initial theatrical release, or subsequent slightly faded TV viewings, you'll want to own this restored version.  The color red in the sitting room of Gigi and her Grandmother's apartment is truly vibrant and I applaud the restorers of all these precious films coming out of the golden age of movie musicals.
