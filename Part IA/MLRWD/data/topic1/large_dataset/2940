After watching this very well produced two hour film about the moving of a private collection of art worth billions I was struck at just how one sided an arguement was presented.  Boiled down the film maker takes the stance that 'the public doesn't know or care about art' which is why this vast collection should have remained in a small museum that doesn't allow more than a few hundred people in.  The reaction by the fims 'art snobs' when the museum is open to the public is one of open mouth shock, as if vandals were being allowed to deface the paintings.  I would compare it to a small coffee shop that you enjoy going to, if word gets out that they serve good coffee and more people want to frequent this establishment there is that resentment because 'I was here first'.  Unfortunately outside of the artist community people do enjoy and should have the opportunity to view any and all art.  It is this arguement that the film completely overlooks.

Though how the arts movement to a much larger and more public venue is by no means ethical.  Politicians and some very wealthy individuals wanted to make the move happen for their own private benefits.  They do not come out looking very well either at the films conclusion.  Just how the moves took place is open to some speculation but the facts, filings and budgets do make it pretty clear some people wanted this moved and would do anything to get it moved.

All in all an interesting film to watch but one that is limited in its scope.
