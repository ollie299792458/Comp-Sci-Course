I borrowed this DVD from a friend not really knowing what it was about.  At first it was somewhat difficult to acclimate myself to the South African accents, but soon I really got into the story. It's a true story and it really challenged me in my faith.  I recommend it to everyone - even those with no faith!

After I finished watching it, I had questions in my mind about the circumstances surrounding it, and thought to review the beginning of the movie a second time.  It was then that I noticed in the menu there is a documentary included, and so I watched that.  It was marvelous, so encouraging, and it really challenged me!!! so much so, that I decided I would watch it again before I returned the DVD to my friend.  (BTW, it is a rare exception that I ever watch a movie a second time.) Before I had a chance, however, I received an invitation to a get together from a friend from my church which said they were going to watch the Faith Like Potatoes documentary after dinner!  Once again, it was so encouraging and challenging that I decided I needed to have my own copy so I could watch this documentary periodically.

I give the movie 4 stars because the language is somewhat difficult to understand, and the sequences are sometimes a little choppy, but I give the documentary 5 stars!!! (I would give it 10 stars if that were available.)  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD to all.  Be sure to watch the documentary, but watch the movie first.
