This is a series that teaches with heart. It is not the average shoot em up crime show, rather it is a show about  relationships. The focused relationship is between a brainy Math whiz professor, his FBI agent older brother and their widowed father. However, the people in their lives at Cal Sci and FBI are woven into the story in a warm and encouraging way. They come across likeable and very relateable.  That is all appropo since Charlie, the Math Whiz, explains each episode how math relates to everyone and everything while helping his brother to solve cases using algorhythms and equations that explore the details of the crime scenes and criminals.  The main star, in real life, said he was very poor in math in school so he wanted to make sure that non-math types could understand and enjoy the show. I can and I do!! Another plus is that this show is produced by Ridley Scott, the director of great movies like Gladiator and GI Jane. The DVD season contains great special features including clips of the math professor who consults each week on the numb3rs part of the show.
