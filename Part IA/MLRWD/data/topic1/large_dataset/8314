In many ways, this film seemed more realistic and believable than "An Officer and a Gentleman".  I remember a scene in "An Officer and a Gentleman" where Lou Gosset Jr's character has a bare-fisted fight with Richard Gere.  Both of them fight as if they were martial arts experts.  First of all it's highly unlikely that they would know how to fight like that and also both the Sergeant and the Officer candidate would be kicked out of the school for hurting each other like that.  In this film, there is fighting but it's believable in that it's in the boxing ring.  When fighting does happen outside of the ring however there are consequences.  Another thing is that people in leadership roles in the military (particularly for special units and schools) will almost never put pressure on a candidate to give up.  If the candidate can't meet the high standards, it's only a matter of time before he will drop out or be dropped.  In this film Tyrese Gibson's character (the company comander) is at odds with James Franco the plebe, but he doesn't go great lengths to try to get him to quit like is done "An Officer and a Gentleman".  Actually, the company comander gives James Franco's character a big break which made the film for me.
