How can anybody not like this movie?!?!  The main performances are so endearing.  Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair are hilarious comic actresses, and could make even the limpest script (which this is so not!) worth watching.  They are obviously having a great time, and their enthusiasm is contagious.
I bought this DVD out of curiosity and was very pleasantly surprised.  Certainly it's not the grossest gross-out comedy around, and a lot of ground has been covered before.  What makes "The Sweetest Thing" so refreshing is that women are not the mindless, big-breasted props to the jokes - they are smack-bang in the action, re-acting and laughing along with the best of them.  So what if the men are reduced to snivelling stereo-types?  Stereotypes are one of the staples of this genre, and women have suffered more than enough.  It's about time the tables were turned.
A lot of people take movies way too seriously.  Lighten up, relax, let yourself laugh instead of pretending to be appalled.  And when "The P**is Song" comes on, get up and shake your booty.  You'll have a blast!
