It always amazes me that people think that a Shakespeare "purist," a true lover of Shakespeare, won't like any new version. I teach a Shakespeare course, I've studied Shakespeare at Oxford,  I've seen 30 or so productions by the Royal Shakespeare Company, and I've  got news for you. This video is just fine! True Shakespeare buffs are  theater people, not dusty curmudgeons so old they fart dust. I have seen  about 15 versions of AMND, and this certainly holds its own. The setting is  a fantasy world anyway, so putting it in Tuscany does not violate any  "rule." There are some niggling complaints: Kline's Bottom is a  little too sad, and Callista Flockhart is supposed to be playing the ugly  one. She is not convincing. There are many gems as well, Rupert Everett's  lithe,sensuous Oberon foremost among them.  A bit of trivia: one of  Christian Bale's earliest roles was as the boy in Branagh's Henry V, and he  continues to delight. You may watch this video, enjoy it, AND consider  yourself a Shakespearean. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Enjoy.
