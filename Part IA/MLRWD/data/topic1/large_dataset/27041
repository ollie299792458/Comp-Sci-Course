They tried the same formula but it did not have the charm, warmth, or laughs of the first film. This time they even threw in a homeless woman to try and capitalize on America's fascination and empathy for homeless people. It didn't work. The homeless woman character seemed to be full of all sorts of wisdom and brilliance. She was also some kind of "bird lady" who fed pigeons in the park and was almost entirely covered by bird feces. Too bad she didn't use her profound sense of wisdom to understand that being covered in bird poop is unhealthy and disgusting.
Donald Trump makes a cameo in the film and at that point you wonder it was probably done just so they could get a good rate on filming at the Plaza Hotel which Trump owns. Otherwise, why would you include this talentless, buffoon into anything?
Joe Pesci and what's-his-name show up again and just happen to run into "the kid", as my daughter refers to him, on the street. Once again, "the kid" feels the need to defend his turf, this time his turf is the Big Apple, and he devises an elaborate plan to outwit these two morons. Haven't they learned anything by now? 
Anyway, the only plus to this film is the irresistable Culkin and the opportunity to see the cast assemble once again. Otherwise, the storyline, especially the parts involving Tim Curry, are just mind-numbingly stupid. But, hey, my daughter enjoys it so what do I care? But, I think she likes "Home Alone" and "Home Alone 3" better.
