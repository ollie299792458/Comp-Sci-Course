I am a big Upstairs fan. I watched the series in the 70's. I think the most outstanding attribute it has is the clash between the classes of the servants and the masters. The masters feel they can do many things that are considered immoral in that society if they conceal it from the public. Everyone in both classes did their part to maintain the status quo. There were few people in the middle class. The main thing I wish I would have known before purchase is that some of the early episodes are in black and white. This was due to a workers' strike which I fully support. I would have bought it any way however.
The series is a close look at Edwardian times; a short ten year rule. Yet many earlier Victorian morals are still in play. It is a lot like an historical novel in that it depicts the sinking of the British Titanic, the explosion of the German Hindenburg, the sinking of the American ship the Lusitania by the Germans, and WWI in general which affected everyone's life at the time. It was later explained that the "flappers" of the Roaring 20's didn't want to fall in love or be serious in any way because they had seen so many of their friends and lovers killed in the war and knew there was no use in believing in a future. I think perhaps the Viet Nam War explains the behavior of its Flower Children in the 60's.
The acting is superb. The writing well done. There are different writers and directors for different episodes. The commentary done by the actors, writers, directors and a person who envisioned the concept is most interesting. I think valuable for young writers and film makers. All in all it is a most enjoyable series which I have seen twice now and intend to watch a third time before putting it away for a year or so.
