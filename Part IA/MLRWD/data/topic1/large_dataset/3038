This is/was a brave video, and while not sophisticated, is one of the better ones out there. Most of the 'evidence' dates from the 1990's or early 2000's, so is dated already. Most hardcore UFO researchers (me) who have read "Exempt From Disclosure" & "Witness to Roswell" and the Majestic-12 books know that if the Zetas are (what CIA's ex-DCI Richard Helms indicates in "Exempt...") 25,000 yrs ahead of our more advanced human members, we probably live on a 'quarantined' planet because of the human proclivity to kill, steal, harm, pollute and generally have disregard for the Livingness of this Universe. I'm betting Earth is not THE vacation spot of the Milky Way for those EBENS/ET's who have to 'go out' from their planet and police our insignificant pinpoint of dirt in the galaxy. But I digress.
David Sereda's presentation is balanced and civilised, and doesn't exude the impolite contempt I have for the lies/deceptions/distortions (or omissions) by your tax funded gov't agencies. Ever wonder why humans don't colonise the Moon? The Very Wise EBENS won't let us. The unexplained 'things' flying all over these NASA's videos are hilarious, esp. since NASA won't admit They Are Here and are WAY ahead of us in technology. "They" would have fried us long ago if they weren't spiritually advanced, too. The Greatest Coverup in History is unraveling. Stick around.
