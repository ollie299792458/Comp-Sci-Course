I read the book several months ago and loved it, and while the movie is very different from the book, I still really liked it.  Many people have criticized the plot of the movie, but I accepted it because it was so different from the novel that it was basically a different but good story that had similar elements to the novel.  Please consider the movie on its own terms, because it is good in its own right.  Also, people are criticizing the lack of blood and gore in the movie, but I think too much violence would go against the main ideas of the film that Vivian is trying to pull away from that aspect of her history.  She sees the beauty in being a werewolf and withdrawals from the more violent aspects, so since we are seeing the events mainly from her perspective, why is it unusual to see the beauty more than the violence?  Additionally, the film is much more of a love story with supernatural elements than a horror movie, which is not a bad thing, and it fits more with the overall feeling of the original novel.  Ultimately, I recommend the film, but if you have read the book, go into it by looking at the movie as a separate werewolf story.
