The art, passion, direction and exquisite taste which Franco Zeferelli has always displayed in his work is evident in this film version depiction of Verdi's "La Traviata".

The film is truly a visual delight and commanded a variety of emotional responses from my senses, not to mention Zeferell's innovative use candlelight to create the golden, soft and rather mystical "look" on film.

Of course, his "executive" decision to crop many precious minutes from the opera, is a disappointment to many and only he, himself would be able to explain the reasons for the deletion.

I, for one would like to know!

But, no matter, the magic, emotion and beauty of Verdi's music is simply an aural treat notwithstanding the absence of subtitles. I would have loved to see "take-outs" and interviews  included in this DVD; also a brief synopsis for first time opera viewers.

The Metropolitan Orchestra under the baton of James

Levine is nothing short of superb with the "oneness" of the stringed section bringing a sort of "soul" to the work. One cannot help being moved by Levin's direction and interpretation of Verdi's haunting and exuberant themes. If it were not for this supreme Met orchesta, the film would not have the same impact.

While physicaly and undoubtedly suited to the role of Violetta, Theresa Stratas' voice is strident and at times, off key in the first scenes, yet more mellow and convincing in her interpretation from the middle to later scenes. I found her to be a good actress.

Domingo, of course, was in his prime and who can doubt that his singing, and  acting would be anything less than dare I say, perfect for this role of Alfredo.

The American baritone, Cornell MacNeil is well cast as Alfredo's father. A full rich voice.

On the whole, I would strongly recommend this film to those who have not seen a live opera on stage.
