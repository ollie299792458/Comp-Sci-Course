I rarely get the opportunity to go to the movie theaters so I catch a lot of films on DVD or on Cable.

I watched MY DOG SKIP on HBO and it was indeed a rare treat.  I love family films, especially if they are in an older setting that move you and stay with you for a while to come.

MY DOG SKIP is one of such films.  This was not a kids flick, indeed this is a young adult/adult movie narrated by the author of the same book - based on the true story of his dog Skip, now a national bestseller novel.

Willie Morris' parents give him a Jack Russell puppy for this ninth birthday.  He proceeds to bond with is dog, who's precocious and loving manner teaches Willie how to deal with the pressures of being a kid and coming of age in Mississippi in the 1940's.

This film moved me with its depth of emotional intensity and beauty, unlike any I have seen in a long time.  It was beautifully acted, the moments depicting the situations remembered by Willie regarding his escapades with his dog and friends - who loved Skip equally, are one of a kind.  I highly recommend this film to any animal lover and anyone who wants a film that will move and touch them (yes, there are several sad moments - but it is the circle of life) as it is undoubtedly one of the most splendid films I have seen in a long time.
