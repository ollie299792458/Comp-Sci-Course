To all G1 fans who haven't given this show a chance:
This show is fantastic, especially the third season. I dare you to watch just a few episodes of season 2 and 3 and still call it junk. You can't. Despite being based on a toyline (G1 was also, by the way), this series has fabulous character development. It does not reinvent the Generation One Autobots and Decepticons. It is the story of their descendants, the Maximals and Predacons, and it ties back into Generation One without a flaw. All true Generation One fans should enjoy this series because it is a perfect sequel. Beast Wars even features cameos by G1 characters such as Starscream (S1,E21 "Possession"), Ravage (S2,E11-13 "The Agenda"), Optimus Prime (S2, E13 "The Agenda Part 3"; S3,E1 "Optimal Situation"), and the original (Decepticon) Megatron (S3, E10 "Master Blaster"). The character development and plot points of Beast Wars are superior to those of Generation One. It hurts to say it, because I am an original G1 fan also, but it is true. If you still say that you don't like this series after you have watched it, you should ask yourself if it is the Transformers you love, or if it is your childhood memories you love more.
