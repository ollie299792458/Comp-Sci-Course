This movie is disgusting. I am a businessman and I would never
make the type of comments that were made by the businessmen
in this movie.

We just do not say such meaningless words, nor do tycoons need to
employ a spy, the plot was based on that idea, to gain information.
It is not reality.

Businessmen, or tycoons, do not quote military generals for methods
of business. In the movie, an oriental general was quoted on the
strategies of war. War and business are diametrically opposite, the one
relies on voluntary trade, the other relies on force.

What surprised me the most is that there are Americans who have
written positive comments about this movie. Americans, who have gained
a vast benefit from capitalism, are willing to vote for an anti-capitalistic
movie.

This movie is so unromantic, so destructive of good ideas, so uninspiring.
The author did not apply an ounce of imagination, nor did he have an ounce
of knowledge on the subject. When I watched the movie I felt as though I were
listening to uneducated fools, like those who fall into a booby trap,
poorly masquerading as capitalists. Yuk.
