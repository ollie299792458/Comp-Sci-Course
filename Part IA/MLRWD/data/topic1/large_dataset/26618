Been a fan of Sade since Diamond Life, remember being mesmerised by her as a kid only 4 years old and loving the track, YOUR LOVE IS KING and SMOOTH OPERATOR, I had practically given up on the return of SADE, 10 years seemed to long, when she returned it was with full force, and this concert will blow your mind. Sophie Muller her long time collaborator, has taken the live aspect of SADE to oblivion, the opening, Sade appears on stage through a stairway under the stage, absolutely stunning, she starts the show with the incredible song Soilder of Love, she sings all her classic hits, from Paradise, No Ordinary Love, By your Side, plus her incredible tracks from her current Soilder of Love, another favourite is the track LOVE IS GONE, the visuals are stunning, SADE looks stunning, her body still amazing, her band still looks hot, incredible, I wish she came to South Africa, because I know that if she ever comes back it could be another 10 years, I may never see her with my own two eyes live, but this is the next best thing.
