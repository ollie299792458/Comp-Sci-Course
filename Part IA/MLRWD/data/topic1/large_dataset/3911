Well.  It has been said, but I will agree with the other haters: poor execution of a good idea.  The fatal flaw is, sadly, the main character.  I have nothing against the actress, but the character is totally unlike-able, uncouth, dirty-mouthed, and stupid. The accent alone would probably get her shunned in Austen society, let alone the AWFUL HAIR that I wanted to fix the entire series.  She also wanders around without a bonnet throughout - totally unacceptable, and as others noted, kind of odd for a supposed Austen devotee. (and I guess she packed a flat-iron). I suppose the idea was that someone casually tuning in, with no particular knowledge of Austen, can see that she "doesn't belong".  Well that kind of visual cue is unnecessary for probably 90% of the audience and does irreparable damage to the whole premise, if we are actually to believe that a modern person is inhabiting a lifelike version of Regency England.

I did like some character alterations (Wickham's character), although some (like toning down Mrs Bennet's neuroticism) seem possibly due to just being lazy/not understanding the original.

Outside of the main character, I thought all the characters were exceptionally well-cast.  To bad it was wasted on the poor script.

Oh, and the ending was execrable.  I can see why Elizabeth wants to stay in the 2000s, but I can't see either the attraction of Darcy or his for Amanda, and it reveals that this movie (as probably should not have been in doubt) is about as intelligent as your average chick-flick providing wish-fulfilment for the masses.
