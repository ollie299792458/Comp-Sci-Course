Before we begin to compare this classic to any other movie created in the last 10 to 20 years we need to remind ourselves that Driver was made in 1978. Back then if someone used the available technology to create a computer with the power of a common-garden-variety 2005 PC it would have probably dwarfed the Empire State Building! So taking into account that computer generated special effects (and editing) were therefore non existant Driver is an amazing feat. The extremely frustarated cop, Bruce Dern, and the ultimate Mr Cool-as-Ice get away driver, Ryan O'Neal, are brilliant in their battle of wits; god knows how many times the original "How do we know you can drive?" car park scene has been ripped off! Recommended for viewers who are sick of the modern cops-always-win story lines in NYPD, CSI etc because in Driver there are no winners; all the characters have their own diverse personalities but no one has a name. One question remains; with all the crap (that was even crap back then) from the 70's 80's and 90's re released on DVD, where is the Driver DVD? No wonder the pirates and bootleggers are having a picnic on classics like this!
