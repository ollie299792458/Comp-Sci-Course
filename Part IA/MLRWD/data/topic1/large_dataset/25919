For one thing, I'm glad the movie industry is trying to raise interest in the Revolution. After all, it was the most important war we ever fought in, and should be given some screen time. The Patriot was an ok movie...costumes were great, battle scenes, all the visually appealing stuff was...visually appealing. The story was even well told, despite the overly done cliches and some very, VERY big inaccuracies. Yet, the best part of the movie for me, were the supporting characters. Chris Cooper was excellent as Col. Burwell, and personified American leadership at that time...brave, confused and unsure at times, but above all, willing to die for the cause. Tcheky Karyo (probably misspelled it, sorry) was also great as Maj. Villeneuve, and showed just how much the French sacrificed to help the Americans win. Gibson has never been a favorite of mine, and his character was just a little predicatble. The same applies Heath Ledger, who seems to have been cast for eye candy only (Though he does play his part passably).  My two major complaints are the sugar-coating of the Revolution...I think they should have just made Gibson's character into Francis Marion, instead of trying to make him into this peace-loving, family minded farmer. Of course, it would be un-PC to show a Patriot who wasn't a saint, but that's the way things were...it's how we won the war, anyway. I really think they should have spent more time on the actual Revolution, not just Gibson's personal problems.  My second and biggest complaint was the ANNOYING sister-in-law who's sole purpose seems to thrust her heaving bosom into the camera. She had no point, and totally detracted some value from the movie.  But, overall, a good film about the Revolution that will hopefully spurn more
