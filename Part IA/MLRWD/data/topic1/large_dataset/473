Like most of my reviews, I will try to keep this brief.  I say watch it twice because as much as i love low budget movies...I couldn't decide if i loved the movie or thought that it was a waste of my day.  After the first viewing, i didnt get a chance to see the movie again until 3 years later when i got a chance to purchase the special edition(before it became an excrutiatingly high price) i picked it up used from the store that i worked at.  My first point is the awesome soundtrack.  I actually purchased the special edition because of the soundtrack and the packaging. To pay $25 dollars for a soundtrack and a cool case is extreme, but that shows how awesome the sntrk is (as long as you love old-school punk).  But after the second viewing I realized how incredible the movie really was, whether it was a for the simple great humor or the incredible satire that it is.  You may want to rent it before you buy it, but when you realize that you love it...you wont feel that it was wasted money renting it first.
