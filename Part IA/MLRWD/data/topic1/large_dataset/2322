Beautiful, with hypnotic power, "Walkabout" is an altogether surreal story. This is a masterpiece by Nicholas Roeg from the producers of "Clockwork Orange."
An aborigine is on 'walkabout'for his initiation into manhood. He rescues a lost English teen and her young brother (played by the director's enchanting son) who have been abandoned in the Australian desert by their psychotic, suicidal father.
The starkness of their surroundings and necessity of eating fresh kill to survive is contrasted by flashes of 'civilized' behaviour in the cities, and by idyllic scenes which end in tragedy for the splendid native. Jenny Agutter's talent is obvious, as is her beauty,in an electric atmosphere permeated by an evocative score.
The whole production is memorable; the conflicts universal & perhaps never to be resolved. BUT, you don't really want to get lost in paragraph after paragraph telling the whole story, do you? Why should reviewers express their egos and leave NOTHING to the imagination? This is a film  you should not miss; it has staying power.
