What can I say that will add to all of the other reviews?  All I can do is give you my personal perspective when it comes to this classic film.  This film brings back fond memories for me, I have watched it whenever possible over the years, to own it is a real treat.  I just recently received it from a close friend, he ordered it from my Amazon wish list for me.  I will never forget the first time I ever watched it, years ago; the flute song played against an almost silent background was so eerie for my then, 16 year old ears, I absolutely loved it!  True, the many times that I have seen it since have not affected me in the same way, but I still find it wonderful to watch, hoping for the same affect.  I am such a fan of the Sherlock Holmes character, and I don't even care that the Hollywood series of films done by Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce for Fox and Universal studios, were rewritten and composites of the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  I feel Basil Rathbone brings a confidence, and strength to the character; I don't know why they felt Nigel Bruce should play Dr. Watson in such a foolish way, that's Hollywood I suppose.  I don't consider myself a critic, and not an intellect when it comes to movies, but I know what I enjoy.  This is my favorite of the Hollywood made films, another is,  "Dressed to Kill", this film though, is set in the 19th century, and, "Dressed to Kill", is a 20th century story.  I don't see any reason why anyone who loves classic movies, and Sherlock Holmes, wouldn't like this film, it's worth purchasing.
