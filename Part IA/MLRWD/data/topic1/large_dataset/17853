This is a movie about WWI, filmed in English - but made prior to WWII's start, and one of the first to win an Academy Award for BEST FILM. Lew Ayers in a wonderful performance. My Great Great Uncle was in WWI, and NEVER spoke about it. After watching this movie - you get a lot of insight into why. People sleeping days in the trenches standing in the rain. What is really good is how it shows the way Germany got the school "kids" into the war. Even though there were promising students, they were meant to feel bad if they did not fight for their "fatherland". It also helps to show how Hitler took what the Kaiser did a couple steps further, and how out of control it got. Also, how propaganda and press can really destroy a country, and create a war.
I highly recommend this movie - not really violent, but very educational, interesting and a "piece" of history. "we" in the US know more about WWII, but not WWI:this will help to show both and how destroying war is. perhaps if enough of these older movies which were made with people who REALLY DID gp into the military, peace will become more important. The most important is that other countries see it - not only our allies.
