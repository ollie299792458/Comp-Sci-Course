Tom Selleck was born to play in westerns.  I only wish he had done more of them, because he nails it every time.  I've watched this film so much that it was time to add it to my personal movie collection.  It has everything I love in a good western: adventure, comedy, romance, drama and real heart.  The main actors absolutely soar in their performance.  Tom Selleck and Laura San Giacomo have wonderful chemistry together.  I especially appreciated that we are given the opportunity to see the relationship between Matthew/Roy and Crazy Cora develop in a slow and believable way, rather than just implied or rushed like many of today's Hollywood films. I loved the part where she is standing on the porch, watching him ride off.  Alan Rickman with his quiet persona is perfection as the character you love to hate.  The showdown between his character and Selleck's is awesome.  There are some very tough and brutal scenes, but they are not overdone and are softened by the romance and humor sprinkled throughout.  The ending was sheer delight.  Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't say that the music is mesmerizing, while the scenery is breathtaking. I really enjoyed that it took place in the Australian outback.
