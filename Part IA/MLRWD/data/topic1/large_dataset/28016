When this movie first came out, my friends and I saw this movie around 5 times in the theatre.  I was a HUGE Streisand fan.  Just watched it for the first time since then and must say it is still a wonderful movie. Some things are dated but the movie has aged well. The music includes several songs that still sound good and fresh today. The craziness surrounding celebrities was well enacted although it is probably a 100 times worse now for celebrities. Kris Kristofferson perfectly conveyed the heart and soul of JOhn Norman; you feel how lost he is at the beginning of the movie then his love and pride for Esther and understand his decisions to further her career as well as his anguish when he realizes he destroyed his career.  Streisand is an amazing talent...to be able to sing like that...what a gift she has! Her acting isn't as good as I remember.  Don't get me wrong, she is still better than most, but her mannerisms become annoying. She exudes confidence and owns the stage when performing so had trouble accepting her as a struggling singer. But this is a minor point because this is such a good movie.  So my recommendation is to buy the DVD and enjoy it!
