Although I must admit I was a little disappointed with this film, it still goes down as one of the best "robbery" films I ever saw. I suppose I thought there would be more actual robbery involved, but the  "Die Hard" director carefully tries to keep the actual museum  scenes more character driven than big action. And it works! He allows  Brosnan to actually "act" during the robbery, which is rare in  todays action films. What really make the movie however is the on-screen  chemistry of Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan. Russo steals the show playing  out of typecast as an over the top bounty hunter in the art world. Her  prey: Brosnan as a very rich amateur thief who steals not for money, but  for fun. Russo's scenes with Dennis Leary as the police  detective are also  prove her acting abilities, and the fact that this film was incredibly well  cast. As long as you don't begin by thinking you're going to see a  high-pace action film like 'Entrapment", you'll enjoy this film for  the light drama, great acting or fun art-robbery plot that it has.
