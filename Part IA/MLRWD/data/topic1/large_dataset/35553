Fighting corporate greed is a losing battle.  Yes, the music is different, but I didn't buy this set for the authentic music.  I always loved the early Happy Days episodes for the stories themselves.  Yes, the music was an important element of the stories, but not enough for me to boycott Paramount in the futile hope of getting them to care.  As for 'Rock Around the Clock' being replaced by 'Happy Days', how many times do you really need to listen to that intro anyway?  If you miss it that much, pop in Season 1 for the intro, and then take a commercial break and switch to Season 2 for the stories.  While you're at it, download the authentic 50s music from iTunes and play that in the background while watching the episodes.  Either way, the strength of the episodes will carry this set.  It took 2 years to get this released, so I would not count on Paramount spending any more time debating the issue for future re-releases.  Let's get through Season 3 and call it quits anyway.  The show falls apart with Season 4.

As for music rights issues, I also do not understand why it's OK for syndication, but not for DVD releases.  But I'm not going to lose sleep over the issue.  Corporate moguls have crunched the numbers and figured that one out all on their own.
