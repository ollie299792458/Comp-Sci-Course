I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie - but I thought "what the heck, an action movie from the guy who made Chisum and The Wild Geese can't be all that bad." But no. The battle scene (and yes, there's only one battle in the whole movie), when it finally does come in the last twenty minutes of so of this two plus hour movie, is surpisingly dull. The photos I'd seen of extras flying through the air are nowhere to be seen. What you get are too many long-shots of small figures scuttling around amidst too much smoke and dust (which makes it difficult to figure pout who is where and doing what). Now and again we'll go in for a close-up in time to see one of the main actors get killed, but before you know it the Germans have surrendered and William Holden is blahing on about losing too many men (a fact which isn't apparent on the screen). You're probably thinking I'm focussing too much on the action - that there should be more to a movie than this. But let's face it - The Devils Brigade is designed to be an action movie (the characters are all one dimensional and the dialogue between the fueding Canadians and American's is pretty trite stuff, and that, folks, is essentially the plot), so on that level it has to be considered a failure.
