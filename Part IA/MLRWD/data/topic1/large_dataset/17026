No real fan of the animated series would expect a movie to do justice to the whole first season. Shyamalan's effort misses by more than anyone could excuse on the basis of time constraints, limitations of live action effects, or any other imaginable excuse. One might excuse the removal of all humorous elements; they weren't the best parts of the series anyway. But the animated series managed to create an 'epic' feel in each episode; the movie contains less action, less character development, less STORY than any single episode of the series.  The deleted scenes, collectively, actually contained more character development than the movie.

I actually didn't mind that the names of central characters were modified (Ong the Ovvatar, Soaka, Eeroh). But the removal of the racial identity of each of the tribes (except the South Asian Fire Nation) was a serious injury to the feel of the story. The Water Tribe didn't feel like Inuit; the Air Nomads couldn't even be imagined as Tibetan. They just felt like Central Casting clones.

Very good performances of Iroh and Zuko. Not bad of Aang, Sokka, and Katara. Ozai was good in the deleted scenes (he hardly came into the movie itself at all).

I really hope the next two movies will do less violence to the original series. A different director and producer might be a good start.
