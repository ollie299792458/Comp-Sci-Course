Have to say I was totally appalled by the way MGM UA released this classic movie on DVD.  Have the Director's Cut on VHS and it's a completely different experience, fleshing out many scenes which appear abrupt in the edited version, especially between Flaca and Crockett, Bowie and Travis - and relating to Travis himself. The death of The Parson (Hank Warden) which is a very moving scene, does not appear, and the viewer especially misses out on Dimitri Tiomkin's Overture, Entre Acte, Intermission and Exit Music.  Also missing is the birthday sequence, the fight in the Church over gunpowder doesn't make any sense, and Flaca seems to make a very sudden exit.  Even the TV versions run longer than this!
Of course, even with these unacceptable drawbacks, the movie remains Duke's immortal homage to freedom and The Republic.
The DVD also includes a featurette "John Wayne's The Alamo", which will be very interesting to all students of Wayneasia and of this movie in particular.
I would suggest that John Wayne fans and Clubs should petition MGM to release this classic properly as it was meant to be seen, perhaps even with the addition of "Spirit of the Alamo", which Duke also did that year, and give us, the viewing public what we are entitled to - complete versions of all our beloved movies, and not a cut rate edition. Surely the studio could come up with some archival footage re the Premiere of the Picture, maybe even an expanded two disk set - just like they have with other notable Hollywood epics.
 The Director's cut on VHS is the one with five stars
