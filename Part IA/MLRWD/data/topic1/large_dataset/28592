Definitely a mixed bag of emotions in this one! Heart-stopping American roots music set in a mish-mash of minor story lines, most of which detract from the overall quality or merely add stereotypes to a movie that seems that it really wants to contradict those very stereotypes.  First the good stuff.  This is a story loosely based on the life of Olive Dame Campbell came to the mountains and found the treasure of music that make up the very life of these people.  She collected the music while it was still raw and founded the roots of country and folk music.  Her legacy lives on today at the Folk School (http://folkschool.org) in North Carolina.  The movie features the wonderful simple music of the Scottish and Irish ballads ("love songs") handed down from mother to daughter to granddaughter in these mountains.  The acapella voice of Emmy Rossum, operatically trained, with capture your heart immediately and transport you through this musical journey.  Pat Carroll as the mountain matriarch is the perfect match for the grandmother we remember singing to us as children, bringing a non-musical voice but a passion to the songs.  Appearances from Iris Dement and Taj Mahal and others continue to provide the authenticity to the music.
But the story lines, including a lesbian relationship, a stereotypical evil coal mine executive who wants to steal the lands from these people poor in material goods but rich in culture (the movie never says why), moonshine drinking, philandering, arson, etc almost make it painful to watch.  The writer and producer would have served us better by sticking closer to the true facts behind Olive Dame Campbell and the legacy she and her husband gave us in the music and culture of the Southern Appalachians.
Buy the movie for the music.  It is worth the price.
