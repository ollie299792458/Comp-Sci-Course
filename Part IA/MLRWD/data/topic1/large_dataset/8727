This is a great film! I recorded it when it first aired on TNT when I was nine and would watch it every Christmas Eve when I could not sleep. At the beginning when Jim and his mother escape from Pew and the pirates it is now daytime when before on VHS and the initial airing it was filtered down to appear evening. The scene where Mr Arrow is killed is likewise now daytime instead of filtered night. This is listed as 1.33:1 which is how it originally was released on tv and vhs in the details but appears unstretched widescreen. The worst thing about this release is the cover art they should have kept the VHS version this one just looks silly but these are minor details. I must have bought 4 or 5 VHS copies and kept losing them and I do not have a working VHS player so this dvd release is awesome (and has been needed for at least 10 years but better let than never). The performances are amazing especially Heston as Silver and the music by the Chieftains is legendary and haunting it made the island come alive. I bought 3 copies of this just in case it goes out of print and I just might buy 3 more. One of my favorite movies of all time finally available on DVD!
