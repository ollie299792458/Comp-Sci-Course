What a shame that MGM spoiled such a beautiful collection of remastered and restored films -- replete with wonderful extras -- by lack of care.

Start with the packaging. While the box is interestingly - even cleverly -  designed, the plastic slipcase is prone to damage and cracking. I received one with an entire corner missing, making the jagged edges truly Hitchcockian in their inherent danger. I don't mind, as others seem to, the cardboard slipsleeves that hold the discs. Not the best, maybe, but also not serious enough for all the hysteria. Slip the disc in lightly, just enough to hold it in place, and all is well.

Strangely, considering all the interesting tidbits included about each film in the 'notebook', none of the actual film credits (cast, duration, etc.) appear anywhere. This basic information can only be found on the removable sheet which surrounds the plastic slipcase. What are they smoking at MGM?

I, too, have had disc problems on two sets. They may freeze, jump to another chapter, cause player to make noise, or have difficulty loading in.  As I have four different players, I was able to find one to overcome these errors. But this is a serious problem for anyone with a single player. What is surprising is that the price remains so high, even on used sets.

Although seems almost incidental with all the problems, the film transfers are uniformly beautiful and the commentaries are informative, entertaining, and apt.  The Lodger is probably the most beautiful silent film issued on DVD, with full orchestral score and near-pristine transfer.  Amazing.  Perhaps that is why I, and others, keep trying to get a perfect set. I second the motion that MGM re-issue a clean set, make amends to previous purchasers, and restore the reputation that these films - and the care which went into their restoration - warrant.
