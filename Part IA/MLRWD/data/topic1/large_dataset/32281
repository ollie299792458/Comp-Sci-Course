First of all, this is an excellent movie for the visual grandeur of the West.  The story (or should I say stories?) is/are OK, but Debbie Reynolds is the glue that holds the segments together;  she was only 30 years old when this movie was released.  OK, so I like Debbie Reynolds;  shoot me.  Excellent, moving music as well.

Second, when I upgraded to a Blu-ray player, I planned to sell my DVDs as each corresponding Blu-ray disc was released.  When I viewed this Blu-ray release, I decided to keep the old DVD release, just for the stunning comparison.  I first saw this movie in the Cinerama dome in L.A. in 1962, but DVD releases have never done it justice;  the extra-wide three-screen rendition on a non-HD TV lacked resolution (an inherent problem with widescreen movies on 4:3 TVs, and even more so with this movie).

Well, this release contains two screen renditions of the movie.  The first disc is a traditional widescreen version, with MUCH IMPROVED resolution, as you would expect of an HD movie on an HDTV.

The second disc is in what is called "Smilebox" format, where the left-right screens of the Cinerama three-screen view are stretched vertically in such a way as to simulate the Cinerama effect (amazingly, straight lines are preserved!).  Rather than being a gimmick, it is an unexpectedly good effect, best experienced sitting CLOSE to the TV screen (ignore your mother; an LCD screen won't sterilize you if you sit close to it).  Whether you like the effect is personal, and if you don't, you always have the first disc.

If you like epic westerns with good music, this is the release that will make you glad you upgraded to Blu-ray.
