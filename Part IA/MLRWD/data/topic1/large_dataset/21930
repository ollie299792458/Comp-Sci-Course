<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GEFBG2">Detour [1945] [Remastered Edition</a>]One Great Film.One Big Rippoff. A2ZCDS is the kind of chit you find at places like dollar general for a buck or two. I got burned for way more than that when you factor in shipping. Would love to have this (REMASTERED)by a reputable remaster-er. Wal Mart has the Image version for about ten bucks, I hope that will fair better, anyone know if this would be just another of the same? Amazon advertises the Image version but it says Image/ Alpha? I would not touch another Alpha Video product even if it was free. That is like watching a B&W movie with scatched up cheap sunglasses with earplugs. I took my copy of A2ZCDS to trade in and they would not even take it. I asked why and they said the disk was homeade and not the real deal. I hate all these basement/ garage knockoffs and they have the nads to call it remastered? Leason learned-Always read the reviews and the product info , and if you are not familiar with the name of the studio-Steer Clear!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GEFBG2">Detour [1945] [Remastered Edition</a>]
