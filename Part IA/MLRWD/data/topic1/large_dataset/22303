The last time I saw this movie must have been at least 20 years ago, i.e. still during the real Cold War.  I saw it recently again out of curiosity and it's stood up well. How to explain those tens of thousands of U.S. and Soviet nuclear warheads on hair triggers to youngers who have no personal recollections of those times?  If you lived during those times and/or served in the military then, you knew that hair-triggerism was damn real.  When toward the end of the movie the war room screens go wild with their portrayals of the thermonuclear strikes, my blood did run cold.  Yeah it's only a movie but yeah too, the means then were such that it could have happened.

On the lighter side, 20 years ago I knew squat about computers.  DOS was Boss and utterly alien to me; I began to get my feet wet with Windows 3.0 around 1992 at 50 years of age.  It was fun to see in the movie the relatively primitive state of home computers and even mainframes.  Monochrome CRT screens?  Dot-matrix printers?  REAL floppy disks?  Quaint.
