If you like The Dick Van Dyke Show, you simply must get this set. First, the show itself is very funny, well-produced and brilliantly written. All the cast memebers are just perfect for their respective roles, and it's easy to see why this has become one of the all-time classics of television.

Now about the DVDs: First of all, the video quality of this set is excellent. The film masters have obviously been extremely well preserved over the years, and the final results are unbelieveably sharp, with glorious black-and-white tonal range. So sharp you can actually see film grain and the textures of fabrics in clothing and furniture. These transfers are at a whole different level than the blurry, unsteady transfers seen on TV over the years. These unedited shows run over 25 minutes instead of the 22-minute versions seen in reruns. It's also nice to not have any annoying annoucer voice-overs or the even-more-annoying split screen credits often seen on TV. There are insightful interviews with cast and creators of the show, as well as some really nice and varied bonuses like Emmy Award footage, original promo spots, and other nice little surprises, some of which have never been seen before, or haven't been seen since 1961. The menus are stylish and retro, and the whole package is well designed and well executed.

In short, if you love quality TV, do not hesitate to buy this DVD set. I've already ordered season 2 and am looking forward to more seasons coming out. I hope that this series will succed on DVD and we'll see more worthwhile TV classics of this caliber released, like the remaining seasons of the Mary Tyler Moore Show and the Bob Newhart Show.
