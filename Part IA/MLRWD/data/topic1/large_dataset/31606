Rick Goldschmidt was absolutely right the blu ray is just a copy of the last dvd version now placed on blu ray but its still a classic.Rick above anyone else is the ultimate Rankin Bass
information bank,and has done nothing but good things for these people and there productions.This reminds me of a few years back a classic collection of the figures came out and was fantastic but then were taken over by a different company who just mutilated the image of these characters,same thing with this cover on the blu ray,this is not the classic cover everyone remembers which was on the one dvd version years ago,dont these people putting these issues out care about what there doing,why dont they go to someone like Rick or myself and ask what would the public want when we release this blu nray.Well the first thing is commentaries even if from the Rankin bass survivors.rchive video of the original voice performers,andthing that we have not seen.Its a shame Sony could have did great things with this blou ray of this classic but just thyrew it out there just to sell another copy.Hi Rick I still need a few more of your cd collections to make my collection complete.Thanks for everything you have done for these classics.To Billy Mae Richards you might not be recognized by your picture but will always be recognized by your voice.Thankyou for giving me a childhood full of memories that still remain with me today even at my age now.God Bless you forever,your up there with Burl and the other voices now to create magic in heaven.
