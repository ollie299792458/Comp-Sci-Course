There is no better way to view John Carpenter's films in WIDESCREEN and it's no exception with this sequel to Escape from New York! Gratitude definitely has to be given for the DVD's quality as it fully displays all  the shades of blacks [especially those on Snake's coat] in a solid yet  crisp quality that even the Laserdisc version can't match. I also found  this DVD much sharper, with more visible detail in the crouded scenes. To  top it off, this DVD is a fine example of professional solid blacks!  Unfortunately though, its sound is NOT quite as powerful as the  THX-approved version on LD. Scenes where Snake fires his Core Burner, his  cowboy guns and other big explosions, all seem to scream in a lower rumble  when you compare this DVD with the LD. But if I were to choose between  those 2, I'd still pick the DVD version as it has the Theatrical Trailer  [among the coolest ones I've seen], yet there's no need to flip the disc!  For fans, I recommend this version of the film [though I can never stop  thinking there should have been more extra features in it]!
