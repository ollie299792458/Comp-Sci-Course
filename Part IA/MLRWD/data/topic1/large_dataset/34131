After seeing this movie in '71, a year before obtaining my driver's licence, it truly influenced my driving skills and my love for high performance American horse power.  Seeing the movie now almost a hundred  times over, I know the dialog word for word.  This is a cult classic to be  shared with those 70's era Mopar fanatics who too have seen this movie in  it's various cuts at the local driveins. (And attemped to drive just as  fast as Kowalski did after they left the drivein).  Having the sound track  on LP(vinyl) and the movie on VHS, I can revisit my obsession with this  film and sound track when ever I feel the need to reassure myself for need  of controlled speed.  Remember, they used several Challengers during the  filming and you can see some of the different cars throughout the film if  you have a sharp eye.  For those who can fix the frame of the movie just  after Kowalski makes impact and someone is spraying water on the wreckage,  they can see the the car is a white Camaro.  Look at the vent windows on  the door frame.  Challengers did not have these!  For those with a really  sharp eye and a large screen can see the Camaro script on the truck lid  also.  For those newer viewers, sit back and enjoy a pre Dukes of Hazzards  true car chase.  It doesn't get any better than this. (Unless we can get it  on DVD along with a CD version of the excellant music sound track! Hint,  Hint!)
