Lt.Frank Bullitt of the San Francisco Homicide Division,a racing green Mustang GT Fastback,a black Dodge Charger,a now classic chase scene.A trend setting detective story.You could call it the granddaddy of the modern cop movie.("The French Connection" and "Dirty Harry" being the other grandparents.)I first saw "Bullitt" in the theater back in 1973,after seeing "The French Connection" and "Dirty Harry" and I was quite impressed.Then I became a lifelong fan of Steve McQueen.McQueen did many(but not all), of the driving stunts in the flick.The insurance company and studios frown upon the star doing dangerous stunts.

  This was based on a novel called "Mute Witness", and originally took place in Boston.This was a story from the Kennedy era.Because it involves "the Mob",or "the Syndicate" or "the Organization" as it is referred to in the movie.The reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that it's a little dated now.I've owned this since around 1990 on VHS.Now I have it on DVD and it looks terrific,letterboxed and in DOLBY Digital.It won the "Oscar" for Best Film Editing in 1968.It was directed by Peter Yates who is British.He did an admirable job.He was nominated for the "Oscar" for Best Director in 1979 for "Breaking Away" which was a very good comedy/drama.Robert Vaughn,(fresh off the T.V. series "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.",remember Napoleon Solo?),co-stars as Bullitt's antagonist, a D.A. with political ambitions.They first co-starred together as two of "The Magnificent Seven" in 1960.A then unknown Robert Duvall has a co-starring role as a cab driver.Also a then unknown Jacqueline Bisset,who is also British, plays Bullitt's girlfriend.It features a good jazz score by composer Lalo Schifrin.Also fine cinematography by William Fraker.In 2001,The American Film Institute's list of The 100 Greatest American Thrillers of All-Time,"Bullitt" ranked No.36 on that list."The French Connection" and "Dirty Harry" also made the list.

  The extras,are the theater movie trailer and a 15 minute documentary about the making of the flick.The movie was released in the fall of 1968 at around the time The Motion Picture Association of America began the rating system."Bullitt" received a "M" rating,for mature audiences, which was later changed to "GP" then to "PG"."Bullitt" has the distinction of being the first flick to use the word "bull****!".Bullitt used it near the climax of of the movie.The tagline for one of the movie posters read,"There are bad cops,there are good cops,then there's 'Bullitt'.Steve McQueen reportedly said that "Bullitt" was his personal favorite film role.At the time,he was one of the top box-office draws in the world and one of highest paid actors.Along with "The Magnificent Seven","The Great Escape" from 1963, "The Sand Pebbles" and "Nevada Smith" from 1966 and "The Thomas Crown Affair" from 1968 and "The Rievers" from 1969,these were my favorites from the late,great Steve McQueen.
