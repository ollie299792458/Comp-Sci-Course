This is a great DVD for horror and cinema fans alike to add to their collection. First of all it is packed with those great DVD extras that film  fans love: director commentary, trailers, etc. The cover art and the film  itself make this a horror classic even in this updated form. The director,  Herzog, gives an illuminating commentary of the various set pieces and his  actions and most of all what is was like working with Kinski and the  others. GREAT dream-like atmosphere is plentiful. That slow-motion bat  wonderfully creepy....Kinski's AWESOME performance (almost insect-like,  keeping with the notion that the vampire is really an obscene animal more  than a man!) and that haunting, visually amazing ending all make this one  excellent edition to your DVD horror collection. This film deserves a much  higher place in the horror-film hierarchy even though it is a remake it is  the best kind: one that pays homage to the original and has an atmosphere  and individuality all its own.  note: This film also has one of the best  musical scores that I have ever heard. It perfectly matches the surreal and  hauntingly eerie mood of the picture.
