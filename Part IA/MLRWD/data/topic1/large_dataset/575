Okay besides the clich&eacute; premise, this is a pretty good movie for anyone with young children in the house. The effects are good and it will make you laugh. Some people might call this a "girl's" movie, but I freely admit that I enjoyed it too. The story is somewhat of a modernized Cinderella story, complete with an evil stepmother, a charming prince, and a mistreated heroine. The fairy godmother in the classic original is replaced with Leonardo da Vinci--and it works. While there are no magic pumpkins turning into horses and carriages, there is magic and romance.

Ever After also has an all-star cast from Anjelica Huston as the evil stepmother to Drew Barrymore as well, who else but the heroine. Drew Barrymore helps to make this movie what it is. Even down to the most unimportant nuances of the performance, she comes off as brilliant. You can believe she is a peasant in the field as much she is a royal courtier among the nobility of France. The emotion she is able to express is amazingly real. If you haven't seen it yet, and you have girls in the house under the age of 15 or so, you will want to experience this movie with them.
