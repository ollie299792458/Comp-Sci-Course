I agree with the other reviewers that this is thought provoking, yet imperfect.  But compared to the usual sequels and comic books we get these days its pretty interesting.

The story line is nothing more than the "guy who can't remember where he learned to do that" used recently in Bourne Identity.  Then comes the innocent guy forced to defend his family which goes back at least as far as Straw Dogs.

The problem?  First, Cronenberg just can't make a film about the Johnsons, living at 123 Main Street, Anyplace, USA.  The town looks right but sorry to say, hardly anybody in small town Indiana looks like Viggo Mortensen.  And Maria Bello looks like Kelly McGillis minus 20 pounds.  That's fine in Malibu but in Indiana....

Problem #2 is that it isn't possible to accurately portray gun violence and still have an entertaining movie.  So there are brief glimpses of blood and guts but the survivors seem to return to normal functioning almost immediately.

That said, the acting is just fabulous.  Everyone is right on the money, with this difficult material.  Think of Tom Cruise defending his family and then watch how Viggo Mortensen does it.  And of course you can't go wrong with Ed Harris and William Hurt.

As for the sex scene I think guys will get it.  Its about a man watching everything that's good in his life, everything he has built literally slipping from his grasp.  Its not as though it comes out of thin air as some people have suggested.
