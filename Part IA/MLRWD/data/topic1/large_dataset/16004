AP2 is definetly better than the original AP. By now everyone already knows the plot of AP2 and either loves it or hates it so I won't get into describing what the movie is about. I'm going to review the dvd (Collectors Edition, Full Screen) in itself. I have to say that the extras on it are fantastic. I especially loved the commentary by Mena Suvari (Heather), Jason Biggs (Jim) and Thoman Ian Nicholas (Kevin). This is the first time I've ever heard commentary in a movie that I've enjoyed. It's great to hear the actors comment and tease eachother on their work in such a fun, light hearted way. I kept laughing throughout the whole thing. However, the commentary by Eddie Kaye Thomas (Finch) was extremely boring and pointless. It felt like watching a movie in the theater with someone making random comments every 20 minutes. In other words, his commentary was mostly looooong lapses of silence and then he'd say something random. Maybe the problem was that Eddie did the commentary by himself, maybe if they'd put him with another actor it would've been more lively. It would've been nice if they'd put him with Alyson Hannigan (Michelle) and Sean William Scott (Stifler).

 The outakes were hilarious and making of the second pie was even funnier, you can see how much fun the cast had making this together. Great DVD. Get it.
