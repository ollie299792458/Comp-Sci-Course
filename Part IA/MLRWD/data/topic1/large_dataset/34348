Sometimes modern filmmakers get it right.  Tucked in between a number of lackluster efforts, Nicolas Cage did this gem.  It's not as universally well-regarded as it is here, but I'm considered pretty fussy when it comes to giving good ratings, and I'm torn between a 4 or a 5. Perhaps it's got a little to do with my low expectations; I passed on it after its lukewarm reviews and watched it only because of my sister's glowing report.

Mostly, though, it's because it's an excellent, affecting film. It could have been played strictly as the contrivance it was, written by the numbers, but the writers did their job. They did what Josh Whedon and David E. Kelly do so well, which is find and mine the real human emotions that would occur in an otherwise outlandish situation. Brett Ratner, for his part, managed to elicit just the right notes out of Cage and Leoni (who's never looked more ravishing; my god), two actors who do well on their own, but their best with the right director. This is definitely Leoni's best performance, and one of Cage's. There are a few moments that don't ring quite true, but they stand out precisely for that reason: They're the exception, not the rule.

I love being surprised by a movie. This one did it, and was an instant favorite.
