As studio execs continue to milk the cash cow that is the CG animated feature, MONSTER HOUSE is refreshing on two fronts; firstly, we see a departure from cutesy animals/toys in peril, and secondly, it's good!

I would imagine that fellow kids-at-heart who grew up in the eighties with INDIANA JONES and THE GOONIES will feel right at home with D.J., Chowder, and Penny; all characters we've met and identified with before in other movies.  The focus is on story and character interaction, and thankfully there's a complete lack of "Gee!  Look what we can do with computer graphics!"  We're not subjected to nauseating shaky-cam and rapid cuts of other recent kid flicks - this movie looks beautiful, and the animators allow you to appreciate it.  Not surprisingly, the most interesting characters are Nebbercracker and The House.  There's a good story here, ultimately with unexpected warmth and heart.

Is it aimed at the right age group?  That's debatable.  More sensitive kids may find it too scary.  It's loud at times, there's a few in-your-face frights, and the tension builds quickly.  Beyond the genre setting, there are a number of more mature themes present which parents should be aware of, notably alcohol usage and sexual themes when the babysitter and her boyfriend are on-screen.  I could knock off a star for these points given the target audience, but they didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the movie.

I highly recommend MONSTER HOUSE to animation lovers, big kids at heart, and little kids with a big kid to hide behind.
