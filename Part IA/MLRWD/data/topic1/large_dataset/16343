I saw The Prince of Egypt the year it was released, and rewatched a few days ago to freshen my memory of what happened in that particular telling of the exodus of Jews out of Egypt. I am much older now, and still, this movie impresses me. A lot of theatrical boundaries were broken down for the tale of Moses. I don't know about everyone else, but I end up watching The Ten Commamndments almost every year since my birth. Honestly, I think The Prince of Egypt is far more entertaining. Firstly, making the movie a musical possibly was the best way to go. Every song is thoroughly addictive and have their own distinctive style. They are empowering as well. I felt like crying a bit after hearing the closing song, There Could Be Miracles (or whatever the real name of the song is.) I also caught myself singing Playing With The Big Boys. Now, another the reason I like this movie is that one does not have to be religious to apreciate the cinematic experience The Prince of Egypt is. For people who abide by the bible, this is a wholesome movie. Some scenes may be too disturbing for children (the sores, the death, the other pestilence and plagues.) For me, the real money came when I saw the Red Sea sequence. It was so beautiful, I wished I could've been there. The only reason it gets four stars out of five for me, is that the rest of the story was not told. The worsse parts I mean. When Moses and the freed Jews had to wander in the desert for forty years, never reaching the Promised Land. I suppose the movie was to end on a light note, so they left that out. Perhaps it is better that way. We see Moses do his job.
