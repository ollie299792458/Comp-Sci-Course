One night I was flipping through the TV Channels when I came across the Office Space. I had never heard of it before, but I decided to check it out. It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time.
The opening seen is hilarious. Peter (played by Ron Livingston), who is stuck in a traffic jam finds himself making less forward progress than an old man with a walker. That's the kind of day Peter's day seems to begin every day with something going wrong.
From there Peter goes to his job as a computer technological company where he always has issues with the boss and the damn copying machine which never seems to work.
When Peter and his friends are frustrated and upset about work their boss says they must have "a case of the Mondays." Then they go to the shop next door and order coffee and ask the waitress (played by Diedrich Bader), what she would say if someone told you "I think I have the case of the Mondays?" The waitresses reply: HILARIOUS!!!
Michael Bolton, a friend of Peter's, comes up with a "genius" plan to make them millionaires in a matter of a few years while screwing their company.
Overall this is a great hilarious and humorous movie with great acting (especially Peter and Milton) that will make you laugh.
I have seen this movie twice and I love it! This is a great movie rent and watch with your friends or at a party. A Movie you'll want to watch again and again.
Every scene in the movie about Milton's "red stapler" is hilarious.
