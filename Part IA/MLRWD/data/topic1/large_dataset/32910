Yes, the people who fought for freedom in South Africa were called terrorists. The situation in Palestine is very similar to what it looks like in the West Bank part of Israel and archbishop Desmond Tutu would agree with me. And so history shows that the South Africans were right in fighting the oppression they faced and were justified in what they did to achieve it. This movie could have been a little better by showing more parts like the roadblocks the Africans faced and the suffering that segregation caused them. It looked to me like many of the Africans in the movie were not angered by the apartheid system. The main character who I think is a brilliant actor, was too soft. I understand how he forgave the white man in the end, but he was not really hardcore when he was training in the camps.

We are taught in Islam to forgive our enemey if we have the opportunity to stop the fighting, but when the fight is on, we do not use Kid Gloves. That is why all over the globe, you see that Muslims are the most dedicated to the cause of fighting oppression than any other people on Earth. Not to justify the killing of innocents, but who the hell is willing to blow themselves up for their religion. I hope that one day the people of Palestine will not have Israeli tanks and helicopters roaming their neighborhoods and will have the freedom to move around their own country.
