A lot of drama and some really cool action scenes make for an excellent movie.  Ron Howard is a very talented guy and this is one of his earlier breakthroughs.  There's an element of artistic license in the way that Howard depicts the fires and firefighting; he also showed artistic license in his portrayal of mental illness and John Nash's life in A Beautiful Mind.  Other reviewers have criticized the Backdraft script and claimed that the only good things in this movie are the fire sequences, but I disagree.  I think the whole thing is good, and the final "faceoff" scene with Scott Glenn in the massive fire is classic.  The movie has a bit of a 1990s feel, which may date it slightly, but I think that's part of the appeal.  Kurt Russell is the king of cool, and he's perfect for this role.  Another cool movie of his that not that many people know about is Dark Blue, which is about the LAPD and LA riots.
