"The Kid" (Steve McQueen) is the up-and-coming new player in the stud poker world. He travels from game to game, usually with the help of his buddy Shooter (Karl Malden), only to clean out his competition in good form. When Lancey "The Man" Howard comes to town, the Kid and Shooter arrange a high-stakes poker game with some of the best players around to find out who the real king of stud poker is.

There have been a number of solid poker movies throughout the years, with the most recent being the Matt Damon vehicle "Rounders," a film which basically spurred the "poker boom" back in the early 2000s (along with donkey Chris Moneymaker's World Series of Poker win in 2003). One poker flick that's never forgotten in the wide array of films in the subgenre is 'The Cincinnati Kid.' The film features one of Steve McQueen's most legendary performances (in a long list of great roles) and puts him alongside such other great actors like Karl Malden, Rip Torn, and oh-so-sexy Ann-Margret.

One issue that has come along with this film is that it does feature a LOT of poker, but what really works about the poker scenes is that it's more about the characters than the actual game. The dialogue, the staredowns, and everything else at the table works so well that it never, ever gets boring. Away from the table, there are some terrifically formed bonds between the friendship of Shooter & the Kid, along with the Kid's relations with girlfriend Christian (Tuesday Weld) and Melba (Ann-Margret). Including this additional drama helps to round out the film into something entertaining and interesting for all viewers, whether they be poker fans or not.

Overall, while I do, as a poker player and cinema enthusiast, prefer 'Rounders' slightly, 'The Cincinnati Kid' is one of the best films you can find on the subject. It's just a shame that McQueen wasn't around long enough to have a showdown between The Kid and Mike McDermott.

Final Verdict: 9/10.
