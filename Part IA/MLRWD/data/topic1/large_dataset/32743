I watched this film because I am a fan of thrillers, I didn't think I would enjoy it because of Meg Ryan (who I thought was a very one dimensional actor - how wrong was I?) and I also didn't think that Mark Ruffallo was your typical leading man, definatly not someone I would have been attracted to - so I thought well....

The movie was fantastic, Meg Ryan is anything but one dimensional in this film! she showed a depth as an actress that I think we rarely see.  Mark made his character Giovanni, increadibly erotic and sexy - and I was hooked watching to see how this unusual (yet far more realistic than most hollywood love affairs) love affair would progress.  The thriller side of it I found also very enjoyable, I loved the way that the tension is built.  All the characters were either suspects or potential victims, although I knew from the begginning it couldn't be the student, I oscillated around suspecting all the characters at some point.  Jane Campion is a fantastic director, and has handled her debut into film noir with grace and sophistication.  Even the much talked about fellatio scene was well lit and very artistic.  I can't remember the last time I saw a movie, and felt compelled to watch it again immediatly after.  I have seen this movie five times now, and every time I watch it I get something different out of it.  I think it is one of those films that you either love or hate, but it is well worth watching.
