OK, so last year I saw True Grit (the 2010 version). It was excellent. I really enjoyed every bit of the movie (saw it in a theater).

Then when I noticed the 'original' at Red Box, I figured I have to watch that one too!

I know times change, and the 'duke' is supposed to be infallible, but this 1969 version was comparatively awful.

John Wayne was actually quite good as Rooster, but the woman who played the girl was terrible. The girl who played the part in the 2010 movie was superb. The part when she traded horses with the fellow in town, that was superb.

Anyway, I guess if you lived through the late sixties (I was 3) this movie would not be too bad to REWATCH. If you did NOT live through that era, and are expecting anything like we have now you will be SORELY disappointed...

I would buy the 2010 version on BluRay but would not even rent the original (again) on DVD. I'll pass... Now to hear people are saying the BluRay encoding was poor, stay away!
