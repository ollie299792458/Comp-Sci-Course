I enjoyed reading Stan Serafin's review below about this disc.  I suspect a lot of people may not know about this release on DVD, because I was shocked to see that there was only the one review of it.  Then again, maybe some people are steering away from it because they think this won't do justice to the original.  I was pretty young when the original album came out, and I only vaguely remembered a couple of the tunes from it, then I picked up the Rhino remaster of it last year.  After the first complete listen, I realized why this is considered one of the all-time greatest albums - very powerful stuff.  This band that Arthur Lee has put together absolutely nails the music and the spirit of it is dead on.  As recommended in Stan's review, you really should check this out - it is truly great music and a reminder of the great music that was emerging from '67 on.  Just think about it:  Hendrix, The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, The Beatles (expanding greatly), The Stones, Led Zeppelin about to be born ... and Love was every bit as good as their company.
