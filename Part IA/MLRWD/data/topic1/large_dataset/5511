It is not only all about Eve, it is about the theatre world.  Just as the final sequence rounds off our understanding of the real Eve Harrington, it also reveals that there will always be those who reach the top in the theatre world and those who aspire to reach it.  As dialogue-laden and full of quotable quotes as any play, the film rarely provides glimpses of any play performance.  Instead it reveals the back-stage relations between director, producer, writer, actress, their partners, dresser, critic, under-study, etc.  Their world is a comedy/drama in itself.

 Working from a tiny story by Mary Orr, Joseph Mankiewicz wrote, master-minded and directed the film and Daryl F Zanuck produced it.  Their work, and the work of cast members Bette Davis, George Sanders, Anne Baxter, Celeste Holm, Thelma Ritter and Gregory Ratoff is seen at its best here.  In its year (1950) it garnered six Oscars and 14 nominations.  Critics and audiences, ever since, have always rated it amongst their favorite films.
