This anime made me feel young again. I was the sort of odd little kid to whom Middle Earth was quite a real place that I would visit not unfrequently. As such, Record of Lodoss War reminded me of many of my old fantasies. There is something to be said about the animation not being great (but it was, after all drawn something like 15 years ago), and there are several points that are inadvertantly funny (i.e., the extremely large walrus-looking convict growling what sounds to English-speakers oddly like 'Cashew, cashew!"). Also, the plot is fairly too large and unwieldy to fit well into a 13-episode series (they should have either gone with less plot or made a longer series with much more development). But, overall, this series was amazingly FUN to watch (even if it is often fairly impossible to take seriously), especially from the perspective of one who has a quite vivid and rather naive imagination :).

I also should note that I am still one of those nutters who reads The Lord of the Rings annually, and I found all the comparisons people draw between the two to be extremely shallow. What RoLW borrows from Tolkien is largely contextual (i.e., the fact that there are dwarves and elves), but adds its own quite significant changes (i.e., dragons taking on a huge prominance and that fact that dark elves even exist--I can only think of one that Tolkien buried somewhere deep in The Silmrillion). Deedlit certainly bore no relationship to any elves that I can think of out of Tolkein--all that really remains is the fact that they call her a high elf and she has pointy ears. But the biggest point of significance is that RoLW and LotR have NO (NONE WHATSOEVER) thematic similarity. NONE.
