How to describe this film...  Honestly, when I first saw it, I didn't get it.  However, after watching it again, I got it, and then some!  This has to be one of my favorite films of all time, and it is the Cohen's at their best. Fargo is a satire, thriller and comedy all rolled into one fine package.

Plot:  Jerry Lundergaard (portrayed perfectly by William H. Macy) is hard up for cash.  Working at his father in laws car dealership he concocts a scheme to milk both his father in law and GMAC out of a TON of cash.  However, the plan depends on the kidnapping of his wife, to be carried out by two of the most inept kidnappers of all time (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare).  Hot on the trail is Francis McDormand, who received an Oscar for her portrayal of pregnant Sheriff of Brainard.

The directing and cinematography are excellent.  There are some great shots, especially the scene when Jerry is approaching his car in the snow (it is shot from above).  Honestly, this is one of the best directed and best filmed movies I've seen.

The best part of the bonus features is the interview with the Cohens in which they admit this is not really a true story.  The funny part is when they (and Wiliam) describe his reaction to hearing about the fact that this isn't a true story, but they were going to say it was.  Good stuff.

If you are a fan of the Cohens, or are wondering what is so great about them, watch this film.  It should be a part of everyone's collection.
