OK, I have probably seen every TITANIC movie ever made (just ask my long suffering mum and friends) and far and away, A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is still the best!

The black-and-white format gives the film a nice "period feel" to it, and the acting is basically pretty excellent. Yes, there is a bit of a tendency to make Lightoller look better than perhpas he was, but chalk that up to the presence of Mrs. Lightoller as one of the consultants to Kenneth More (there is a nice film clip in the documentary which accompanies the film, one of Mrs. Lightoller chatting with Kenneth More).

Suprisingly, for me, this film packs more of an emotional punch than does Cameron's "Titanic"--especially moving for me is the final scene in which Captain Rostron, when told that the CALIFORNIAN is asking if there is anything that they can do, replies, "No. Tell them nothing. Everthing that was humanly possible has been done". Then the last scene is Lightoller gazing at what is left from the ship. The narrative scrolls down the screen, telling us that "Their sacrifice was not in vain..."

One can only hope so.

By far I consider this the best...and it is certainly my most watched...Titanic film.
