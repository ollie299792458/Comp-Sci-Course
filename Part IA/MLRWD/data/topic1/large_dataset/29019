It's hard to believe that Crosby Stills and Nash would have the audacity to put out another live recording of songs that they've put out before as live recordings . It's obvious the Crosby Stills and Nash have no respect for the American public. It's very clear that Crosby Stills and Nash firmly believe that you can sell the American public just about anything. They clearly have not written a decent song in years which explains why they continue over and over and over again to repackage decent songs that they wrote over 30 years  and clearly try to push down the throat of the music buying public. But there are people out there that will spend money on something as wasteful as this,as  if they feel an obligation to support them.
Yet when you look around the world there is so much one can do with with one's money that's more meaningful than buying something as wasteful as this.
It's clear that Crosby stills and Nash have big egos to maintain and they rely on those around them as well as the music buying public to maintain those big egos. But the question still remains what has success done for them in regards to their lives and  the great songwriting talent that they once had that has now clearly faded away?
