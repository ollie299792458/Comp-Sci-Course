My latest viewing of "They Were Expendable," on the fine DVD transfer I just got, is now colored by the revelation that, contrary to myth, Douglas MacArthur was a demagogue, many of whose acts bordered on treason. In fact, it was partly through his incompetence that the lives of the heroes of this movie became "Expendable". However, at the time of the filming, MacArthur was a hero himself and deserving of the Lincoln-like treatment he's given by Ford. 
If you know Joseph Campbell, you know that a myth is not a lie but a metaphor. John Ford has been unfairly criticized by many for his jingoistic, oversentimental grandiosity. But Ford was a myth-maker, not a documentarian. Myths, like religion, aren't supposed to be "factual," and neither are Ford's. If his product is as the critics describe, then so is the time and place he depicts. The America of Manifest Destiny is indeed jingoistic, oversentimental (to our jaded sensibilities) and grandiose. That's the way it was. If you wish to quibble, do so with the period, not with Ford.
Unless you are bereft of human empathy, you'll see "They Were Expendable" for what it is: a masterful evocation of a time, not so long ago, when men and women rode their fear, despair and courage to Glory.
By the way, this review originally received only 2 out of 5 "helpful" votes.  I suspect, the "unhelpful" votes are from MacArthur acolytes, some of whom indicated to me their displeasure at my disrespect for the Great Man, who ended up being fired and who would have staged a coup d'etat if he thought he could get away with it.  After all, he had the support of many of the armed and dangerous right-wing loonies of the time (and apparently still does).  Thus, when I consider the source, I wear the negative ratings as an honor.
