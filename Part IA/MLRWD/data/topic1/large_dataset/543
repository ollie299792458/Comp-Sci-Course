Hi, I'm not one to rain on any one's parade, but if you watch the movie again, you will notice that Nathan Sr. does not and would not ever hire Leonard Smalls to retrieve little Nathan Jr.

In fact he calls him an "evil man", and suggests that he (Leonard) took Nathan Jr.  He also says to Smalls (in an incredible act of bravery facing that "Warthog from Hell") that Smalls is the one who is about to get his butt kicked and he starts dialing the "Federal B I" right in front of him.  With that, Smalls vanishes from his office.

Nathan further redeems himself from his original nature at the end of the film when H.I. and Ed are returning Nathan Jr., thru yon window by showing love, mercy and understanding to the wayward kidnappers.  He really turned out to be an OK guy after all, especially considering he is still Nathan Arizona, just a lot wiser and older when it comes to appreciating his family, including his wife.

Match this movie up on a Saturday night with "The Big Lebowski" (and a few White Russians) and I'm in Coen Bros heaven!  Soon to be added: "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
