Compare any other long running horror series to the Nightmare series and you'll gain appreciation for it.  I love the Friday movies but they were all same exact movie.  This movie is definitely a creation of the 80's and has a ton of pop culture references to it.  This is also the movie where Freddy fully changed from an evil creepy ghoul to a cool guy you want to root for.  That is something that always takes away the scare factor from additional installments of horror movies.  Much like the Friday series and the Halloween series with this series the audience is much more inclined to root for the iconic villain rather than feel the emotions of the victims.  Robert Englund is the guy that allows the Nightmare movies like this one to separate themselves for the Friday and Halloween movies.  His portrayal of Freddy has always been great, it's the actors that surround him that tend to drag the movies down some.  A lot of the other reviewers are way too critical of this movie, it is a fantasy driven horror franchise after all.  If you accept the fact that Freddy can even exist in these movies than you should be able to except the other aspects.  The Dream Master is a worthy addition to the best horror franchise ever.  Freddy will always be the greatest horror icon.  Here is hoping that the Nightmare on Elmstreet series will be brought back to life, Freddy doesn't need Jason to come back and haunt our dreams.
