There isn't much I can add to the many fine reviews of this underrated film, except this:  when one looks at all the many werewolf movies produced, going back to Lon Cheny, Jr's THE WOLFMAN, the one constant is that lycanthropy is a curse, an unwarranted damnation.  What struck me after watching this film recently is the possibility that the transformation of man (or woman) into wolf can be viewed as a blessing, a gift.  It certainly is for Nicholson's character Will Randall.  Notice he never maims or kills except in self defense (OK, he DID slaughter the innocent deer, but that is a normal event in the animal kingdom).  What he gets out of it is an escape from the treacherous brutality and betrayal of homosapiens and the freedom to make his life what he wants it to become--we get a clue of this early on from his truthful, but tasteless (and funny) remark at the party about the decline of civilization and the triumph of pop and therapeutic culture.  He has no use for the world humanity has unmade, and werewolfism becomes his ticket out of it.  Added to this is the likely possibility that he'll wind up with his new love as an added bonus.  Seems like the perfect happy ending to me!
