This is a fantastic "docu-drama" which captures the essence of the life of Stan "Tookie" Williams, executed by the State of California on December 22, 2005. Williams co-founded the notoriously violent Crips street gang in Los Angeles before eventually being sent to death row over the murders of four people in 1979 (a charge he always denied).

The film, starring Jamie Foxx as Williams, focuses on Tookie's death row experience where he begins to take stock of his negative achievements in life. From there, Tookie embarks on an ambitious project of writing children's books aimed at steering youth clear of gangs. By banking on his street credentials as the world's toughest gangster he catches the attention of youth in a way that parents, teachers and police officers cannot and even brings Crips and Bloods together at peace rallies.

This is a well-acted drama that closely follows real-life events in its study of Tookie's transformation. The film also raises serious questions about Tookie's subsequent execution despite his valiant efforts to right his earlier wrongs, his claim to innocence and his multiple nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. If California would execute this man despite his activism (or because of it...), then who can ever claim to have truly achieved redemption?
