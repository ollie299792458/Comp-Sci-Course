I have heard the Monkees story many times from all sources, and the writers for this made-for-TV movie obviously did their homework. The actors really succeeded in capturing the personalities of the individual Monkees. The resemblance was startling - except for Davy (it took a little more imagination to see this actor as Davy). The events leading up to the rise and fall of the Monkees were fairly accurate, with small details left out.

It was interesting to me, as one of the original teeny-bopper fans, to realize that the Monkees wanted to be appealing to their own peer group, even though it was us screaming little girls who rocketed them to success. We didn't even care that their talent as musicians was minimal.

The Monkees alienated the teeny-boppers as rumors of drug use, illegitimate kids and secret marriages got into the press. That acid-trip of a movie, Head, put the final nail in the coffin. The Monkees pretty much divorced their fan base in order to pursue a "more serious" music career. The result was no fan base, as they had already made their name as a teeny-bopper group, hence their peers wanted nothing to do with them.

The movie ended on a very fictional note. The guys didn't start capitalizing on the Monkees name until decades later. At the time, it was a definite liability to be a former Monkee.
