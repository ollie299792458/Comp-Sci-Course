I was suspicious from the beginning that a film of this import was being slipped onto the blu-ray market with little to no fanfare.  I read the other reviews on Amazon criticizing the transfer from the restored 1994 DVD, and dismissed the manufacturing complaints (blurred, foggy picture around the edges) as probably owing to faulty equipment.  I was foolish. The disc is a mess.

From the moment the credits begin to roll, it is apparent something is not right.  The gorgeous background flowers are grainy and in questionable focus, and there is indeed fog around the edge of the picture in the opening outdoor scenes.  Then the fog follows the action indoors and never leaves.

Every once in a while there is a scene without fog and in crystal clear resolution.  Those moments are dazzling, and it makes you realize what the film might have looked like.  But it is very apparent that not only are there serious transfer issues with the disc, but also serious manufacturing problems as well.

Stay AWAY from this blu-ray, and complain bitterly to CBS for their shoddy work on this less than fair lady!!!
