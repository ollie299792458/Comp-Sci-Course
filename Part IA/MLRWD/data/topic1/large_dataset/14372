OK I realize that most will see this movie as another piece of fluff and to a degree it is. With that said I love this film for that very reason it is pure escapism and holds very little truth, however, the cast is first rate and the scenery is beautiful. I am a casual fan of Julia Stiles who turns in a great performance as Paige Morgan a pre-med student in Wisconsin who hopes to attend the prestigous Johns Hopkins Med School after graduation. Enter Prince Edward of Denmark who is taking a breather from his royal duties to attend Paige's university incognito as Eddie Williams. This role is played magnificently by British actor Luke Mably. He looks, sounds and acts very much like a royal and has the most endearing demeanor thoughout the film. The DVD special edition has great extras like the directors commentary, bloopers, etc. This film is lighthearted, sweet and a refreshing change from the usual fare of violent films that Hollywood continues to crank out. If nothing else see it to discover the talented Mr. Mably.
