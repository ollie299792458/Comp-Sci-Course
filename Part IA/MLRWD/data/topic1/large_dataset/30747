"In the Land of Blood and Honey" provides a multidimensional perspective on the Bosnian War (1992-1995). The main belligerents were the attacking forces of the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat military units that were trying to establish full control of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The victims were Bosnian Muslims. The film provides an excellent insight into the war itself. It is a love story within the context of violent opposing ethnic divisions where love becomes a victim of deeply imbued prejudice. The film might be evaluated from several points of view. First, the film was produced from a female perspective, but it certainly would not be classified as a "chick flick." Second, the film was produced from the perspective of the Muslims and depicted the Serbs as controlling aggressors--providing a propaganda dimension. Third, the film shows how deeply stereotypes are embedded in our unconscious minds and how they manifest themselves in vindictive behavior. Fourth, the film emphasizes one of the aggressor's objectives in the conflict--ethnic cleansing through purposeful sex. If viewed from those perspectives, the film is a welcome addition to films that depict war and the exercise of political power through military effort.
