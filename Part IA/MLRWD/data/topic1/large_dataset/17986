Okay, maybe that's an overstatement, but the first time I watched this movie, I checked it out of the library.  I was a recently divorced single parent of two, struggling with a house note and bills I couldn't pay. On this particular day, I was fighting a bad cold, and feeling generally tired and unhappy.  I took this movie out based only on the "Two Thumbs Up" recommendation of Siskel & Ebert at the bottom of the case.  After viewing this film, I felt energized and full of good humor.  I eventually bought it and have shared it with my mom, sister, kids, friends, and new husband.  They all loved it!  Where do I start? 1. The performances.  Everyone in this movie is wonderful.  They are believable and credible even though the material is completely over the top so much of the time.  I love these people.  2. Then there's the romance.  The main love story is very sweet, but all throughout the film, you feel like romance is literally in the air.  It's also amazing how much sensuality is conveyed without any overt sexuality.  3.  The dancing. I never gave ballroom dancing a thought until I saw this movie.  Now, I love watching it.  4.  The family relationships.  They may seem unbelievable, but that mother is all too familiar to me.  5.  Paul Mercurio--he's hot! Enough said.
This movie is funny, touching, and like nothing I've ever seen before or since.  I can't even compare it to anything else.  I'm happy to see how favorably other people have reviewed it.
