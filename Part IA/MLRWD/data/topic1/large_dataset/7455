It had three times the budget of "The Poseidon Adventure", yet it's less than half as effective. Towering Inferno proved once again that more money, more stars, and more hype don't always account for much when it comes to good filmmaking.  Irwin Allen tried a little too hard here to duplicate the extraordinary, and well deserved success and praise he had with Poseidon.  Unfortunately the result is an overblown, often boring, big-budget mess.  
**SPOILER AHEAD**  The dumbest part, and most shameless Poseidon rip-off comes near the end of the movie with the whole idea of "lets destroy another beautiful room (hosting a gala event) with as much fire, water, and death as possible."  It's The Poseidon Adventure all over again, just 135 floors high this time.  I mean really, how was Irwin Allen ever going to incorporate all those wonderful flooding rooms and corridors of the S.S. Poseidon into a ridiculously tall skyscraper (which we are expected to believe would have been built on top of the San Andreas Fault)?  By blowing up huge zillion gallon capacity water tanks on the roof, and the three floors just below of course! 
The movie is dedicated to "the firefighters of the world" and was intended to pay homage to their heroic efforts.  Unfortunately the film succeeds in doing just the opposite--continually exhibiting just how bumbling, helpless and ineffective they are in a situation like this.
The real action sequences are few and far between, and many of them are so long and drawn out that they hardly induce heart-pounding excitement or suspense.  Most notably a scene in which Bobby Brady and others try to climb down a mangled staircase for what seems like hours.
Towering Inferno is not completely awful, but it certainly can't hold a candle (no pun intended) to the true ruler of the disaster genre, "The Poseidon Adventure".
