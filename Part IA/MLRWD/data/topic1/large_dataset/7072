I really enjoyed this movie but I'm also one of those rare women that likes a good action flick. Beyond the believable blowing stuff up bits, and the scenes all over the world, I was most affected by the idea that the things the characters were doing in the movie are real skills of people walking around among us. I repeatedly found myself saying: "That really happens?!"

I thought it was well-produced and unlike you naysayers, loved that the producer/directors cast real Navy SEALs to portray the characters in the film. I thought the acting was good! It's like you've all never seen an action movie before. The acting may not earn Oscars but the story was made real by the fact that SEALs were the ones doing it.

That scene where the SEALs disappear into the water, then one catches the bad guy as he's shot by a sniper so there isn't a splash in the water? Chills. That's talent, boys.

It actually makes me bummed that I live in San Francisco, where the men are meek and techy. So if any of y'all know some late-20's-30's real men, send 'em my way!
