I wrote this review last year, and one of the things I said was:" I really hope this new release finally brings us fans the complete episode collection (3 seasons)..."
WELL, A YEAR LATER PARAMOUNT HAS REMAINED SILENT ABOUT MAKING THE OTHER SEASONS AVAILABLE.
ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO PARAMOUNT HERE IS THIS: THIS IS NO WAY TO TREAT FAITHFUL FANS OF THIS SERIES. I THINK WE DESERVE MORE THAN SILENCE!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will be waiting this new release of ONE STEP BEYOND with great expectation.First,I really hope this new release finaly brings us fans the complete episode collection (3 seasons), half of them unavailable for a long time.
Second,I do hope we finally get a better quality product,since up until now the image and sound of those episodes available in DVD left much to be desired.

This series is not purely fictional like the TWILIGHT ZONE, and even though I enjoy TZ as pure entertainment,I prefer ONE STEP BEYOND because its producers truly made an effort to document at least some of the episodes as real-life occurrences. The most memorable of these documented episodes is the 2-part presentation about the Dutch psychic Peter Hurkos. And even though the producers took some liberty in dramatizing Hurko's life, they did present the main aspects of this extraordinary life.At the end of episode 2 the real Peter Hurkos is presented by Newland as a special guest, adding a touch of real-life docu-drama to the program. The same was done in a few more episodes (in the story of an invalid lady miraculously saved from a tsunami in Hawaii, the real-life person is also presented by Newland at the end of the program).
 After the Peter Hurkos program I was ready to look-up and read Peter Hurko's autobiography, and a second, more recent biography. For those interested in doing some further and serious research on the paranormal, these episodes do provide some first clues and pinpoint possible avenues of investigation.In this respect, they are superior to the Twilight Zone.

I do hope CBS-Paramount releases ALL SEASONS...Finally!!!!
