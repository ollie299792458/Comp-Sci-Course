Describing the edits made to this film as "butchering" is misleading. We're talking about a few seconds of material in two or three places. As the fascinating documentary in this edition explains, this material had to be variously added and removed to fit into different network time slots over the years. There is no "right" version, and this edition includes all the extra bits as bonus material just to be sure. Yes, Kermit is gone, but to be honest I didn't even notice that because his intro and outro aren't actually a part of the story.

If you already have a copy of this film that you really feel is the definitive version, then I'd recommend keeping that and buying this just for the bonus material -- it's a modest investment for you die-hard fans. However, I bet many of you would end up watching the film from this disc and not even notice.

By the way, if you're a musician and you want to play the songs from the film, you can download a few lead sheets from the Songs page at humpnightthumpers.com. Enjoy!
