This is one of my very favorite Capra movies, somewhere along with "It's a Wonderful Life" and "It Happened One Night", in fact it's a blending of those two films. This film is a real pleasure to watch from top to bottom. It portrays one of the best and most unmanufactured eccentric families ever to exist on screen. Lionel Barrymore steals the show as a grandfather abounding with grace, wisdom, and humor; the patriarch to a crazy clan who've discovered the secret to living a happy life: be yourself and be free, and material things don't matter so much as people do.

This film is full of that joy of life that Capra instills in his work. Like almost all his films it portrays a group of idealistic, independent, and good people in an intensely cynical and embittered world. And like almost all his films the idealists gets battered and bruised along the way, but eventually come out on top. Everything about this film is earnest and sincere, from the hopeful life affirming themes to the sweet romance between graceful and strong Alice (Jean Arthur) and free thinking, rebellious brahmin banker's son Tony (a very young and charming Jimmy Stewart).

The spirit and conflict of the film comes from the clash between Tony's stuck up and snobby aristocratic family and Alice's completly oblivious but adoring freewheeling lower class bohemian one. Tony's folks hate Alice, but Alice's folks love Tony. And Tony and Alice are crazy for each other, although Alice wants approval from his people, and he would love to run off and live in the woods with her tribe. This provides fertile soil for Capra's great ability to render comedy, a soaring social commentary, and also have time for some of those heartwarming, glowing dramatic moments. What you get on the other end is a natural, flowing, glowing, quirky ensemble romance flick with a higher message free of pretense, arrogance, and "fakeness", superbly crafted only the way a true master can.
