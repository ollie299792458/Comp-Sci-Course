I know Wynona Ryder is an acclaimed actress, but she doesn't fit the part. She had no passion in her lines, good lines. Jo's personality in this film adaption is portrayed as selfish and terribly angry most of the time. The character in these woman aren't shown effectively, which causes a disconnect between the viewer and the story. Jo's ambitious side is witnessed very cleary, I will give that credit. Although the relationship between Jo and Beth isn't depicted enough as a caring one and doesn't clarify why Jo is very sad when Beth dies. Also, there is a mistake when Jo writes her novel at the end, it's not named "Little Woman", but "My Beth".
The father isn't played enough as a central part of why the girls have morals and character. The mother (whoever acts her) doesn't act very well as a caring and loving person, rather she says her lines without any emotion.
Although, I will give the reason as to why I rated it two stars instead of one. They showed the reluctance on Amy's part to become friends with Theodore Lawrence, which is understandable because he just broke off with her sister. But they didn't make clear why "Teddy" all of a sudden likes Amy. I would recommend the 1932 version for its portrayal of Jo and the love between her and her sisters and the father's role, although it too doesn't clarify why "Teddy" (or "Laurie") likes Amy all of a sudden.
