"The Odd Couple" TV series lasted for five seasons from 1970 to 1975.  All five seasons are officially available, but none (and I repeat, NONE) of the other releases even come close to this one.

Seasons 2 through 5 were edited severely.  In this season 1 package, you get not only 24 hysterical, uncut episodes, but also many amusing and entertaining bonus features.  The introductions by producer Gary Marshall are virtually useless, but the scene of Tony and Jack performing "The Odd Couple" stage play is priceless.  Also the gag reel, the book tour home movies and the award show footage is fascinating.

Some may say season 1 was the show's weakest season.  While I am inclined to agree, I still had plenty of laughs from episodes like "The Jury Story," "A Taste of Money" and "What Makes Felix Run."  Also, as I stated before, Paramount didn't blow this release the way they blew the others (especially seasons 3 through 5).  If only Time-Life had released the other four seasons, because I'm sure they wouldn't have skimped out like Paramount did, but I don't think there's any chance of that now.

Season 1 of "The Odd Couple" deserves a place in any classic TV fan's collection.  But beware seasons 2 through 5.  This is the only one that is worth forking over money for.
