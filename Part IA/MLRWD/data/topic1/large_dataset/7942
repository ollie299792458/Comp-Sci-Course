Undercover Blues is one of my all time favorite movies.  I have purchased several copies so I can share with friends without having to worry about being without one myself.  If someone needs a good laugh, I loan them a copy.

I am not usually a fan of action movies, but this one is not only an action movie, but a very funny comedy with a bit of romance thrown in.  It should appeal to both men and women.  It is not a chick flick.  I love the relationship between the main characters played by Dennis Quaid and Kathleen Turner.  This movie was my first introduction to Stanley Tucci.  I am amazed at what a fantastic actor he is.  I almost can't recognize him in some of the the ones I have seen him in since this one came out.  His character in this movie is so well done.  The movie wouldn't have been the same without him.

If you have never seen this movie, but enjoy action and a good laugh, I can't recommend another movie higher.  This one is perfect.  I have watched it multiple times over the years and enjoy it every time.  I don't say that about many movies.
