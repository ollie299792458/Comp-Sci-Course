Having just come back home from seeing this in the theatre...I felt I had to say something now before I became too apathetic to even care...In short....Don't waste your time.  This was the "sequel" to Jet Li's incredible Fist of Legend (the remake of Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury), and sadly this time not even the great Donnie Yen can save this movie.

Set sometime after Chen Zhen's exile from Shanghi in the 1920's, Chen Zhen returns under an assumed identity to start a new life as a freedom fighter in the hopes of expelling the Japanese out of China.  Bogged down with a terribly slow plot, uninteresting characters and a stunning lack of fight scenes, this film loses steam after the first 30 minutes.  If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best parts of the movie and scenes that weren't even in the film... which might of actually made it better.  I've spent a life time watching Martial Arts movies...Trust me, this is an epic failure!  I could go on, but it's not even worth the time.  Do yourself a favor and watch Legend of The Wolf or the Ip Man movies and forget you ever came across this one.
