I've read all the reviews form all the "Hard Core " Tom Clancy fans stateing that the movie version is "compromised' not true to the book, blah ,blah blah WELL as the wife of a Military Intel guy who has , how shall I say it, been in and worked in the same buildings that the movie is set in  and after 9/11 got whisked into that world ,the movie is "spot on"!!! I've never read a Tom Clancy book so I'll bow to the knowledge of my "betters" and give them the fact that the movie does not adhere strictly to the book, but who cares? Stop whining and enjoy a GREAT Movie. Yes Ben Affleck is a stretch for the part of Jack Ryan,( well no not really, we're just all used to Harrison Ford) But he puts in a solid performance ( plus he's hot girls)and the supporting actors James Cromwell, Morgan Freeman , Liev Schribner and a rollercoaster -ride of a plot plus the fact that (I know this ) the events in the movie could happen more easily than most of you want to know-makes this a great Sat. night ,popcorn, light the fireplace-kind of movie!
