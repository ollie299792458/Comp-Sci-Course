I have always thought that there is a difference between Star Trek fans (myself and others like me) who simply enjoy watching the TV shows and movies, and the sort of people who confuse it with reality.  The prior reviews pretty much prove I am right.  Any objective analysis of this film leads to the inescapable conclusion that it is awful.  The plot is weak, the characters more clowns than heroes, and the script preachy and unrealistic, even by ST standards. It is a shame to see such a great actor as Patrick Stewart acting like a feminized buffon, but that is essentially how Captain Picard behaves in this piece of tripe.  Worf stumbles through his scenes more confused than anything, and the old "Data goes nuts" theme has been used so much it reeks of decay.  The piece with Troi and Riker in the tub together might have been nice 10 years ago when they were in their prime.  By the time this film was done, though, it reminded me of the scene from "Friends" where the gang sees their neighbor,Ugly Naked Guy, being intimate with his equally ugly girlfriend.  Middle age paunches and wrinkles do not a sultry scene make.  It is almost unbelievable that this film followed "First Contact," which by my estimation was the best ST film ever. I must give it one star because I cannot assign it a lower rating, otherwise it would have a big fat zero next to it.  Trust me on this one - just let it die; just let it die.
