I was a fan of the original Battlestar Galactica from the time the series premiered, and watch the show religiously until the time of its cancellation, and even watched the Galactica 1980 folow-up series, although I was disappointed that Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict (except for one episode), Herb Jefferson and Laurette Spang did not return in that show.  I do enjoy the new BSG on the SCI-FI Channel, but I remain a fan of the original.  This version of the series premiere is the big screen movie which was shown in theaters across North America.  The film tells the story of twelve colonies of humanity on the verge of signing a treaty with their Cylon enemies to bring their thousand year-old war to a close.  But on the eve of the ceremony, the Cylons launch a Pearl Harboresque attack against the Colonial fleet, destroying the Colonial homeworlds and most of their military fleet.  The battlestar Galactica, the lone surviving ship of the Colonial fleet, remains to aid the surviving colonials and begin an epic journey to seek a new home on a far-away legendary planet known as Earth.  Several cast members turn in great performances, especially Lorne Greene as Commander Adama and John Colicos as the traitorous Baltar.  Battlestar Galactica remains one of my favorite science fiction television series in both its new and original forms.  I gladly recommend this movie to any science fiction fan.
