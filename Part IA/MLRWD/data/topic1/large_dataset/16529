The first clue that I should have turned off this movie:  two of the characters in this film were played by actors appearing in "A Walk to Remember."  However, I (regretfully) put aside my intuition and allowed myself to struggle through the awkward puns and transparent acting all for the sake of the haunting beauty of the film.  Looking back, I think I would have enjoyed the movie much more had the mute button been on.
What else, you ask, could bring a rational human being to sit for 102 minutes in front of this pretentious picture?  Well, "what else" was the question I was asking myself up until the very end.  I figured that the movie must redeem itself in the last few frames.  Not so.  In fact, I feel cheated out of story line, character development, emotional depth, truly thoughtful insight (not just gross ambiguity which some might mistake for  deeper meaning), and a feeling of purpose to the film.  Worst film experience of the year, and I see a lot of flicks.
