Rushmore became a cult classic the day it was released, and the Criterion Collection release is an absolute dream come true for fans of this film.  Since enough praise has already been posted about the film, I'll focus on  the extra DVD features. The best  of course is the commentary by Anderson,  Wilson, and Schwartzman. Not the best I've ever heard (that award goes to  Paul Thomas Anderson on Boogie Nights), but Wilson adds wonderful comments  about how so many of the best lines in the film come from his childhood.  That aside, there are wonderful cast interviews, audition tapes (!), still  photos, storyboard comparisons to the film, and storyboard layouts for a  few key scenes. Basically everything you could want and more. The most  charming is the Max Fischer Players performances from the 1999 MTV Movie  Awards. Wonderful!  Also included is a small map by Eric Chase Anderson of  the highlights of the movie. The only complaint I have is that the trailer  seems a bit grainy and muffled. The standand release on dvd seems to have a  better quality trailer. Otherwise, this is proof of how wonderful a dvd can  be, and what makes the future of dvd bright. A great movie packaged with  care. This is a must for any serious collection.
