I don't know if some of are like me, but I love to watch horror movies.  I always have.
But I think there should be 2 categories when you go to the video store.
1 for the horror movies and 1 for the gore movies because they are simply not the same.

I love horror cause they are great and scary, but I just hate gory, they are absolutely disgusting.  They make me sick.  So when I had to watch Wrong turn 4, I said to myself and to my daughter might as well go rent the first 3 movies to get into the story right?
Well first of all these movies are not really horror movies, they are mostly gore movies.
When I watched the first 2 Wrong turn movies I must admit, I liked them, they were kind of bloody but not too much and kind of funny in a way too.  But you have to watch them to know what I mean.  The 3rd movie was good but not as much as the first 2 but still ok.
But now comes the 4th one.
Here is what the story is about:
A bunch of students leave for a weekend of snowmobiling to go up in a cabin of a friend, but they get lost and find refuge up in an abandoned sanitarium.
In 1974, Glenville Sanatorium was the site of a brutal and horrific crime, as three hideously deformed cannibals went on a merciless killing spree.  Today, 18 years later, they will have these new students to prey upon as the medical ward becomes their hunting ground.
So the students have 2 choices, fight back or die.
I tell you some scenes are not for the sensitive.  There is one in particular that I found very hard to watch,
as they are making a fondue with one of the students while he's alive.
If you like those types of movies, then you're in luck, this movie is filled with blood and gore and a lot of suspense.  Apart form the gore I enjoyed Wrong Turn 4.  It has a certain je ne sais quoi.
