I LOVE this movie! It's one of those movies that stirs your emotions, even if you've seen it a hundred times, as I have, and know what to expect, when.

The whole movie sounds a mighty YAWP! It's powerful and captivating. Robin Williams is utterly brilliant (as anyone who has seen any of his work already knows!), but I never knew he had the ability to act in a dramatic role until I saw this movie. I was blown away. John Keating is a commanding yet caring teacher, and we should all be lucky enough to have even one teacher like him in our school careers, who can influence and encourage us so much! Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke deliver riveting performances, and the end is perhaps the most powerful conclusion to a movie that I have ever seen. I cry still, even though I know it's coming. The dramatic twist in the middle really shakes up the emotions, as well.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, you're seriously missing out! Grab your favorite blanket, some popcorn, and maybe even a friend or loved one (though this is one of those movies you don't want people talking all through!), and curl up somewhere comfortable. You're going to get lost in this movie! I know I did!
