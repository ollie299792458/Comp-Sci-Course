Wagner's glorious music, sung and played very well, are worth five stars but I have deducted two for the staging.  Set in the 20th century;  to me, not only does it not work, but it is silly.  No changes have been made to the libretto, and Albrecht is described as a hunch-backed dwarf while we can see him there with nothing visibly wrong with his back, and in height what most Europeans would call medium to tall;  Siegfried is about the same height - is Seigfried a dwarf?  There seems to be no relevance to the Rhine, and the gold is a beautiful young man.  Quite a few of the scenes are quite acceptable to a purist like me, but others which did grip me were spoilt by minor points.  One such is when Wotan is about to put Brunnhilde to sleep - she pops out of the plastic penthouse (pent-tent?) and brings back a suitcase.  The flight of the Valkyries is also good.  Siegfried is a bit too old to be convincing - at first sight he appears to be a middle-aged thug.  Forging Nothung - OK, but how many houses in the middle 20th century had a smithy in the basement?  (But I liked Mime's brewing, floating round the kitchen swigging down white wine, I think four glasses.)  The immolation scene is excitingly well done, even if there is no Rhine to rise up and flood everything (and the "Rhine" maidens are not there to get their gold back).  Recommended if one is not a purist, but if one wants the original mythical setting, avoid it.
