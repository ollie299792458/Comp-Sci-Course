Since the first time I've seen this movie in 1996 and I consider it one of the best movies although the copy that I watched was a VHS censored copy. The first time I watched the full copy was when I bought the DVD special edition of it last year.

The story is so powerful and although it was a typical story about the battle between good and evil but the fighting scenes were the biggest of that time and they were simply amazing. Of course if you try to watch this movie after watching a movie like Matrix. well, you will feel that Braveheart is a kid movie and the tricks in the fighting scenes are so obvious and done poorly. My advice to anyone watching this movie is to enjoy the story line instead of concentrating on the special effects.

Another important point about the movie is that it can't reflect an accurate or even near view of what actually happened to Wallace. Reading a little in history or watching some of the programs about this man's life will make you ask the question 'was this man a hero after all?'. Anyway, the history is as good and as bad as who writes it want it to be. so enjoy the movie and just don't take its events as historical facts.
