I got this as a Christmas present at a Secret Santa giftswap and loved it. When I initially opened up the box my first impressions was: just another movie with Jeniffer Aniston from Friends..possibly boring. After watching it my worries have been completely lifted. This movie tells you about all the things in corporate America they never teach you about in business school: it teaches you how to not work and get promoted, how skipping work is ok, how to outpromote your boss and how to retire stinkin rich even if you are mildly retarded. It's a comedy that brings up front a bunch of guys from a 2000 bank software changeover company, the dreaded 99 going to 00 issue that was happening at the time, and their meaningless day to day jobs. The plot picks up as soon as Jennifer Aniston comes into the scene, a waitress in a dead-end restaurant where everyone is expected to do more than minimum but still receive minimum job satisfaction and respect. The main characther-programmer is so desilusioned with his job that he undergoes work therapy hypnosis with a guy that focuses on getting rid of work worries and inhibitions. Problem is that as the guy was bringing the main characther back the hypnotherapist dies of a heart attack. The programmer is left without a worry of losing his job and surprisingly goes on a winning streak  which will change his life for the better.

You will be surprised of how many things you don't know about corporate America that one little movie can teach you in a funny, intuitive way.
