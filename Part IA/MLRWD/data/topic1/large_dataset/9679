Some of the dystopian films of the 70s seem to have a dreadful relevance today. "Network" and its vulgar, debased media; "Soylent Green" and its greenhouse-effect world; "Nashville" and its celebrity-stalkers and populist politicos. It all seemed so science-fiction then.

So it is with this film, which predicted a world in which, apparently, the nation-states, certainly the Soviet Union, no longer existed, and in which private corporations governed. It's very worth watching, both for the games themselves, a latter-day gladiator contest, and for the acting performances. Although some of the future settings and fashons outside the stadium look a little clunky, the action on the track is still powerful in its portrayal and special effects. This may have been James Caan's best role as the embattled champion, although John Houseman turns in a frightening performance, even better than "The Paper Chase," in my considered opinion. Shane Rimmer, as the team executive, also has a powerful role.

For the cinema buff, this is one part of an outstanding period in American film, in which the country saw its future.
