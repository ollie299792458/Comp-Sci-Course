I see a lot of naysayers on here bashing this movie because it's not Napoleon Dynamite or because it's not like all of Jack Black's other movies. As far as I'm concerned, that's a good thing. Napoleon Dynamite was an okay movie, but it was rather boring at times, and was certainly not something I would want to sit through very often. I appreciate the type of humor the director creates, and I think that both this film and Napoleon Dynamite share similarities in regards to directing style, and a sort of uncomfortable pause for dry humor. I also appreciate that Jack Black has made some popular movies and is an accomplished comedian. None of that really has anything to do with what makes this movie so great however. I think that most people have completely missed the joke in this movie. This movie isn't a comedy. This movie isn't a collection of funny scenes thrown together to make us laugh. This movie IS the joke. The whole thing is what's funny. There is nothing about this that should be taken seriously. I don't understand how anyone can talk about this movie without just bursting into laughter. You can't possibly criticise this movie with any credibility, because to point out something wrong with this movie you would have to be taking some part of it seriously, in which case you have completely missed the whole point of the movie, and have no right to criticise something you have completely misunderstood. This movie is possibly one of the best, most elaborate jokes in the history of making jokes, and for most people, it looks like the joke is on them. For me however, I will be content to sit back and watch what I consider to be one of the most entertaining films of all time. Please don't take this movie seriously, the world needs more laughter, and to stifle this movie would be doing the world a terrible injustice.

Thank you.

And have a nice day.
