In The Rainmaker, Matt Damon plays a first-time lawyer.  He enters the popular, competitive profession with honorable intentions.  His character, Rudy Bailer, says he entered the legal profession to become a respected defender of civil rights.  Coincedentally, his father has a hatred of lawyers.  Rudy confides in the viewer that he "didn't become a lawter to piss [his] father off, it just worked out that way."  Rudy's first case gets him in over his head when his clients sue Great Benefit Insurance, Inc. because they denied a legitimate claim.  His client's son, Billy Ray, has lukemia and the insurance company refused to pay their claim, hoping the insured wouldn't consult a lawter.  The company is obviously in-the-wrong and their corruption comes out during the trial in the dramatic courtroom scenes.  A bittersweet ending follows the case's final verdict, adding a nice twist to the plot.  The movie was interesting and enjoyable to watch.  It has a little something for everyone: suspense, humor, romance, and action.  This movie can be recommended for the majority of movie-going audiences and most will leave satisfied.
