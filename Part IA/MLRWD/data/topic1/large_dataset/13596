...Christianity.  Many Christians I know despise this film. I think it's mainly because The Apostle shows the bitter truth behind the men and women who serve God. This film is not apologetic or remotely reverent; it is brutally honest and actually, when considered closely, quite refreshing.  
  Rovert Duvall, in a role that was destined for him, plays the part of a eccentric preacher who is running from his problems. His problems, and there are many, force him to leave his mega-church and flee from police. His actions - which I won't spoil - are shocking but somewhat justifiable.  
When out of town, the Apostle begins a multi-racial church in the deep south, cutting cross dividing lines while vigorously regaining his passion for the Lord. In it is in these moments, when he confronts his own lusts and fears, that the character of the Apostle shines through in honest, heart-bursting segments. He is a broken man, but still a man of God, just as many of the men and women of the Bible are. Bruised, battered, yet still willing. That's what I loved about this film. It is a true depiction of people who follow Jesus. We have misgivings, tempers, pride and lusts, yet, when it's all said and done, we can still move on. 
There is one segment, when a racist bigot - played handsomely by Billy Bob Thorton -threatens to tear down the mult-racial church. The scene ends with Thorton's exclusionary character on his knees in deep remorse and weeping for forgiveness. It's a beautiful thing to behold.  
This film is ruggedly honest and will make the pious and self-righteous crowd cringe with prudent dissaproval. But hey, those of you who are in touch with reality will probably love this film.  I'm a preacher's kid and I know an honest attempt when I see one. This is it. Enjoy!
