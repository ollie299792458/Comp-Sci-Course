If you are willing to skip the big name singers, this performance will reward you with a delightful opera experience. It is engaging, believable, and very satisfying.

The singers portraying Aida, Radames, and Amneris are extremely good, and give passionate, well-acted performances.  In particular, Adina Aaron as Aida acts and sings wonderfully.  Her performance of "Qui Radames Verra" is as lovely as one could want.  However, all three will give you goosebumps and there are many wonderful moments.  These singers are giving everything and it shows.

The costumes and sets are top notch. And, unlike many live performances the photography and sound are also very good.

As others have noted, this performance does not include the usual triumphal march and dance sequences in Act Two, scenes One and Two.  This is a small price to pay for what it offers.

There is a bonus "Making Of Aida" feature whose only only fault is being about half as long as it ought to be.

This is a gem. Try it.
