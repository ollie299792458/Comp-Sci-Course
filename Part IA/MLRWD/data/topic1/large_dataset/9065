As a liver transplant patient who works for an organ procurement agency, I found that screenwriter/director Bonnie Hunt very acurately captured the essence of donation and transplantation.  The scenes were David Duchovny returns home after the accident were particularly poignant, as was the scene where Minnie Driver's character visits the doctor and makes the comment that since she has been given the "gift of life"  she isn't entitled to having a bad day.  This is right on the money.  Many transplant recipients feel that they should never be unhappy and feel guilty when they are.  This movie accurately shows how normal people, thrust into extraordinary situations, face the issue of donation and transplantation.  My only suggestion would have been to include some of the sobering statistics about donation to increase the tension and doubt about Minnie's character getting a transplant.  The supporting cast is great, Robert Loggia, and  Carroll O'Connor's characters make you want to be a part of their family, to go to their restaurant, and to play a game of poker with them.  Despite some mild profanity, this movie is great for the whole family.
