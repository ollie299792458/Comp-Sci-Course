I wanted to write something really strong about this movie,something that would impress...but the truth is that the movie itself does a pretty good job at impressing without me saying it.It is simply magnific.When i first sow it,i was impressed on how someone could put all this different ingredients in one place and get something that beautiful.It has everything,from comedy,to drama and real life situations.I love the lines that practiclly made history..."you complete me" and "you had me at hello"...And the music...God...I have only respect for Bruce Springsteen and his "Secret Garden".I know there are other movies that touch as must as this one or even more,but i can say holding my hand on my heart that "Jerry Maguire" is ONE of the best movies i've ever seen.Go see it,if you havent done that by now...cry,laugh,and step in every situation once with the characters...and at the end,feel that great feeling going up on yr spin and think "this was a great movie that was worth seeing"...dont belive what i say, just see by yourself.
