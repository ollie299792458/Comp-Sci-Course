For those of us who have seen this play performed on stage, this movie is a massive disappointment.  Then again, it is directed by Elia Kazan, who can never leave excellence alone but is compelled to damage it.  For no understandable reason, Kazan cuts scenes mercilessly, destroys speeches, re-arranges events.  What he does to Williams' extraordinary play is even worse than what Mike Nichols and Taylor/Burton did to Albee's brilliant "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"  Even this film version of the play, which purports to restore what the Hayes Code censors excised from the film, is virtually worthless.  Blanche's escapade with her student, the whole tale of discovering her husband's homosexual relationship with an older friend (to say nothing of his subsequent suicide), Stanley and Stella's raw lust and magnetism for each other, and the rich and vulgar quality of the language of "The Quarter" are all missing.  And what's the point?  But the biggest atrocity occurs at the end of the play.  Instead of the ending Williams' wrote, Kazan changes the whole play by having Stella leave Stanley.  Good grief! Could any action short of having Stella kill Stanley be any more absurd?

See a full-blown stage production rather than buying this film, despite the excellence of the cast.
