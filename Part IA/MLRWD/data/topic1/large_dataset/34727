I am a huge fan of both Bobby Darin and Kevin Spacey, and I don't believe the naysayers and critics who didn't like this film, or thought that it was poorly composed. If you didn't like this movie, then you have no heart, because everyone in the theater when I went to view it was openly wiping tears and commenting on how good it was when the credits rolled.

Spacey won't hesistate to admit that he's not as good as Bobby Darin when it comes to singing, but he is pretty darn close. As a fan of these two guys, even I had some reservations going into the theater, but I was grinning from the very second I heard that familiar opening bass that I adore and didn't stop smiling for the next two hours. I was especially impressed with Spacey's dancing and thought that his transformation into the hippie Darin was so uncanny, it gave me chills. Yes, there are some aspects of Darin's life that had to be cut out, but I enjoyed the movie so much that I forgot about that instantly. I would have liked to have seen a sequence on how Bobby discovered "Mack the Knife" and his insistance on recording it against Dick Clark's advice...it was also THE biggest song of 1959...but I understand time constraints. Kudos to the outstanding supporting cast. This is a must-buy when it's released on DVD and I can't wait to view the extras.
