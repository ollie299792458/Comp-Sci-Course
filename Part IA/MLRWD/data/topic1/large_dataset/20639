This movie is trully outstanding for the following reasons:
1) It is not your typical teen movie, which mostly showcases foul language, sex and violence, it's a profund spiritual movie about love, faith, setting goals for oneself, and most of all good morals and values (Something that is sorely lacking in teen society today)
2) The movie will bring tears to most Carbon-based units eye's, if it dosen't you are trully inhuman and unemotional.
3) The love and devotion that Landon shows to Jamie is trully heartfelt, she changes him in such an incredible way, of course he says he loves her...
4) Guys, this movie can serve as an example of how girls like "The Little things too", the part when Landon brings her to a place where she is in 2 places at once to fullfill one of her things on her list was such a sweet thing to do, Im sure many eyes were tearing at this point...
5) The movie really focuses on themes centered around the book, faith, forgiveness, redemption and the desire to fullfill ones goals and dreams...
6) The music in the movie was perfectly placed. When Landon proposes to Jamie, the Switchfoot version of "Only Hope" comes on.. This is another scene in which you must have your box of tissues ready...
7) I was simply paralyzed by Mandy Moore singing "Only Hope" Her voice was so angelic, that I was simply unable to change the channel when I first saw it on Satellite TV. She is a far better vocalist than Brittney Spears..
8) This move is about love in it's purest form. It forsters itself throughout the movie from a friendship to romantic love between 2 people. The lack of physical intimacy is evident here, it only makes the scenes between West and Moore that much more romantic.
