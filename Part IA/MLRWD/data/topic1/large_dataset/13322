I was very pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon this in the rows of TV DVD shelves at Best Buy several years ago, mind you, I was just really discovering the TV DVD craze at that point. I found the sound quality on this season to be allright, and the images were of decent quality. Admittedly, this show was just beginning to find its way during the first season, the pilot two-parter gets them started with some memorable episodes in there...one just has to laugh at Hannibal Smith's (George Peppard) character and his persistence in getting arrested by the police in ``Pros and Cons'' to break up a prison boxing ring...that clip is repeatedly aired in the show's intro sequence. ``A Small And Deadly War'' is also a good episode as is ``The Out-Of-Towners''. The chaser of the intrepid quartet this season is Colonel Lynch, who gets a whiff of the fugitives but never really gets too close. Decent stunts in this season, but they get better as time goes along as do the stories. A bit of a shame that this is really the only full season with Amy Allen (Melinda Culea), since she is very nice to look at. Enjoy.
