Many people are complaining about the purchase price of this collection of 12 episodes (with 8 episodes on the way).  People are whinning because every season has been 13 episodes in length.  Also, keep in mind that the series is not yet finished; 8 more episodes will debut in 2007.  Season 6 will be 20 episodes total (in case you can't count... 12 + 8 = 20).

Consider the total running time of this collection:  12 episodes at 720 minutes.  This is signifficant...

Here's the breakdown:

Season 1: 680 minutes in 13 episodes
Season 2: 780 minutes in 13 episodes
Season 3: 780 minutes in 13 episodes
Season 4: 800 minutes in 13 episodes
Season 5: 780 Minutes in 13 episodes
Season 6, Part 1: 720 minutes in 12 episodes
Season 6, Part 2: --- Minutes in 8 episodes

Stop complaining about this pricetag on this set!  The price is well worth the cost when you consider the running time!  Season 6, Part 1 was just as good as Seasons 2,3,4, and 5.

The show had me laughing aloud even though I was the only person watching at my home.  The show imroves with age; The Sopranos are here to stay (even IF the series is drawing to a close).

ONE COMPLAINT (bases on my opinion):  Not enough Uncle Junior!  Corado Soprano is one of my favorite characters and we didn't see him enough!  Hopefully, Uncle Junior will play a bigger role in the upcoming year...
