Yeah, this one could almost have been made as a propaganda film by the "military/industrial" complex. Everyone seemed to have the idea back in these days that if you build a base on the Moon, you could control the world. So these guys secretly build a nuclear rocket and attempt to get it launched to the Moon before the half-wit Luddites try to put a stop to it (and you can throw in some fellow-traveler-Commie-rat-pinkos while you are at it). This movie is steely-eyed stuff....not much humor. Oh, we have Woody Woodpecker (yes, Woody Woodpecker) doing his best to educate us about space travel without boring us to death. Let's just say a little seltzer water down the space-pants would have helped. Even Dick Wesson, a pretty funny guy, can't go too crazy in this one...but he does act as a pretty good audience-surrogate; even taking a decent dramatic turn, which left me thinking how much he resembled Humphrey Bogart.

I saw this as a kid and enjoyed it. I particularly remember the beauty of the movie. As I watch it today, I still think it is a pretty movie and considering how little we knew about space flight, not horribly inaccurate.
