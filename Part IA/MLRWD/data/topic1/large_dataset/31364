We all know how awesome this movie is, so I won't go into any detail about that.  Instead, I will just review the Special Edition aspect of this DVD.

Disc 1 allows you to play both the theatrical release of the movie as well as the Special Edition.  You can view each of these versions with or without the commentary, as well as view the deleted scenes by themselves.  The Special Edition also lets you toggle the Special Edition markers that display on screen when you are viewing deleted material.

Disc 2 has a whole bunch of production material, including a fairly long "making-of" featurette featuring interviews with a lot of the people involved in the film.  It also includes pictures, additional footage, and the original script.

The extras really allow you to learn the history of the making of this film, and all of the struggles they went through to complete it.  The extras are very interesting to anyone who is interested in the process of filmmaking and the opinions of the actors and crew who were involved in the process.
