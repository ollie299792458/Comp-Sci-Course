I was extremly happy to get this video and see that it is as good as the reviews are. Most importantly, it's a new video, unlike so many of the pregnancy videos I've bought(and sold in garage sales or ebay). Leisa Hart was the perfect picture of pregnancy. She was beautiful to watch, graceful in her moves, and spunky in her salsa dance...I hope I can move like that when I'm in my last month carrying my lil baby. The other videos I've used just were boring, old, or not well thought out. It was apparent that Hart knew what she was doing. Since she has starred in 25 exercise videos, she knows how to interact on camera, which so many video instructors cannot do. I loved her style and personality, but most importantly i liked doing the exercises. Working out to a video has to be fun or else you'll never do it again, and Hart made this fun by mixing it up with some salsa dance and a yoga toning set that was great for my problem areas, and then her labor tips and the stretching was so good, my body needed it. I loved this, and can't say enough about how good it is to get a quality workout that was made recently...I can't wait to see how see looks in her postnatal video, I bet she'll look great, that little Buns of Steel woman! lol :-)
