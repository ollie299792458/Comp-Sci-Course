This was a very interesting look at how Vogue came up their September issue for 2007.  It was fascinating to see how ideas were conceived and then executed.  As with any documentary, it tends to be bit dry, but I enjoyed watching Anna Wintour interact with her colleagues and also with the world's most famous designers.  I especially enjoyed watching Anna Wintour interact with Grace Coddington, the head of her creative dept.  They don't let their longstanding relationship interfere with their ideas of what should go into those fabulous Vogue pages!

Besides being a fantastic editor-in-chief of the American Vogue, Anna Wintour also appears to be a wonderful mother as well.  We watched as the camera followed her home and interviewed her 21-year old daughter, Bee.  As much as Bee admires her famous mother, she does not want to follow in her footsteps.  Good for her that she has a mind of her own!  All in all, it was a fun DVD to watch with my own daughter, home from her Spring break.
