Wall Street was a film that captured the late 1980s world of finance. It exposed how the rich were getting richer and how they are doing all they could to prevent from getting caught. Years later Oliver Stone, who has kinda been struggling in making a good movie went back to his roots and gave us 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps'

This follow-up is not as great as the first one, but as a person who has a career in finace and knew about what was going on in the economy from 2008 until now it was a great thing to see it all incorporated into this film. The cast is what saves this movie. Michael Douglas gives a great performance returning as Gordon Gecko. Shia LeBouf is great, Josh Brolin is deliciously evil and Carey Mulligan is amazing. I am still waiting to see people finally realize just how great she is.

If you are a fan of the first one chances are you will accept this sequal for what it is. Not as great as the first one, but it still follows the origonal quite well.
