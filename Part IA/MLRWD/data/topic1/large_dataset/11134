This beautiful and sentimentally bittersweet Italian movie about the friendship between a small-town boy fascinated by movies (who grows up to be a famous movie director) and the movie projectionist at the town's Cinema Paradiso is one of my Top-5 favorite movies of all times (the other four are: Casablanca, The English Patient, Doctor Zhivago and The Unbearable Lightness of Being). From the opening scene, a simple shot of a view looking out from a house toward the sea with one of the movie's beautiful theme songs playing, to the last scene which (I garantee) will move you to tears, you are transported to an enchanted world where life was simpler and the only available entertainment in town was at the Cinema Paradiso. You'll enjoy the simplicity of the story, the wonderful actings of the little boy and the movie projectionist, and the beautiful, romantic and bittersweet soundtrack (composed by the great Italian composer Ennio Morricone). What is great about this movie is that it'll make you want to watch it again and again. I'm looking forward to seeing the director's cut which will be released in theaters in May 2002 by Miramax. I hope that the director's cut DVD will be available soon thereafter. A movie not to be missed!
