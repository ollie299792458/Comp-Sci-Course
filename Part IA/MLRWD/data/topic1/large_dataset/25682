Despite Leslie Nielsen's brilliant performance (as always), this movie was a complete disaster from start to finish.  It could have been a gem, too, when you take the off-beat writing style from movies like Airplane and Naked Gun and give it a Halloween twist, but it just didn't happen here.

Pretty much everything that happened was easily predictable, and those that weren't were so outlandishly childish and stupid that they weren't even worth watching.

A few minutes into the movie I was ready to turn it off, but I kept going in hopes of finding something worthwhile.  With the exception of Nielsen, that never happened.  And the ending was absolutely intolerable.

What's disappointing is that I usually like this genre of movies.  I enjoyed Scary Movie and Not Another Teen Movie, and the aformentioned Naked Gun series and Airplane I/II.  This movie?  No.

Others have said that the only value in this movie were the attactive actresses and gratuitous shots of cleavage and legs, and while there's some truth to that, it's certainly not worth 108 minutes of your time.
