From Dusk Till Dawn is a classic combination of two of the best directors of the 90s, Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriquez, to make one of the greatest action/horror films of the decade. With an endless supply of big stars old and new, this film is an amazing display of great filmmaking.

Seth Gecko, played by George Clooney, and his brother Richard, played by Tarrantino, are on the run from the law. They are complete oppisites. Seth likes to make sure everyone gets through everything in one piece and Richard just wants to kill everyone he sees. They are told to meet a client, played by Cheech Marin, at a bar in Mexico. To make sure that they can cross the border without getting busted, they kidnap an unsupecting family of vactioners and force them to drive them to the bar in Mexico. When they get to the bar, they realize something is wrong, and all hell breaks loose.

The film is well directed and very well made. The stellar acting by Tarrantino, Clooney and Harvey Keitel is undeniable. Definately one of the best made horror films, this is a true classic for fans of film.
