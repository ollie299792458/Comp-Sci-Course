This is truly a lovely movie, and it has been a long time since a romantic comedy has been this enjoyable.  This movie may remind you of "When Harry Met Sally" or "Sleepless in Seattle", where the  couples are clearly meant for each other, yet have obstacles they must  overcome. The acting and dialogue are superb! Hugh Grant, a world-famous  actor, is completely convincing as an average bloke, while Julia Roberts  goes by Anna Scott and plays herself, a "heavenly" movie  star.
One review of this movie called it "pure fairy tale."  As  long as you can believe that it is possible for an actress to truly be a  "good person," that she may actually want to live a relatively  "normal" life outside of her acting career and may want to start  a family of her own, then this statement is false.  One specific scene  mentioned as difficult to believe was the initial kiss that takes place  quite soon after they meet.  However, there are two reasons why this scene  is believable.  First, it is quite obvious that she is impressed from the  start with his wit, sensitivity, and honesty, especially compared to the  other men who are falling over themselves when they meet her.  Secondly,  this kiss may be a sort of test.  In a city filled with reporters trying to  get a story and her pictures plastered everywhere, her life has to be  secretive as much as possible.  Perhaps she wanted to see if she would be  reading about the incident in the next day's paper before she allowed  herself to get too close.  She gave him quite the opportunity to brag to  his friends or family, but he does not.
This movie is quite entertaining  to watch the first, second and even fifth time.
