This is by and far the worst movie from a book that I have ever seen. Let us forget that this is a hugely popular hit series in book and movie form as a stand alone film I felt robbed of my money and my time. I will not spoil anything, but understand this, MAJOR plot points are just skipped. If they made the movie for people that read the books and knew what was going on, and didn't really want to see the things happen on the big screen, the succeeded. This huge failure succeeds at making me want to get rid of the entire series it is so horrible. Major scenes were missing, and one major event was made to be so lack-luster, that I actually laughed out loud. When the film was over, my wife even went, "That's it?" Yes dear, that is the end of 2 and 1/2 hours of the worst rendition of a book to film. Now, do not tell me how movies and books differ, I understand that. But to complete omit major story points is completely unforgivable. And, if you are going to give me 150 minutes of film, do not add things that are not in the story and have nothing to do with the series. Actually, one complete waste of celluloid contradicts the series in a 5 minutes fight scene that is, well, not there in the books. The added scene even creates an issue for the next film. I had to explain everything that "really" happened to my wife, who was left completely clueless as to what was going on because this film says nothing about the real story. Just because it says Harry Potter, do not think that the entire world is going to invest their monies into your product. Stephen King made that mistake with his Dark Tower series. Improve these mistakes in the next film, or you will completely lose your audience before the summer of 2011 when the final film is released. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GARBAGE!
