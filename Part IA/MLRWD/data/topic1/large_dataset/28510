Image and sound of this blu-ray are what you'd expect from a blu-ray disc : excellent. There are some some interesting special features, although not a heap of them. But let's get to the heart of the matter : the movie. Sure, it begins like a romantic comedy, and glides very quickly into a veiled social comment, with a distinct comic overtone. Basically, it's "american liberated woman/gold-digger (?)" vs. "traditional english country landlord family". But the family reveals cracks in this pretty picture : the two nubile daughters (especially one) are a little "off". Father (excellent Colin Firth) is nostalgic of his bordello days after WWI (he took his time to go home...) and seems not to care about almost anything. The head of the family is Mrs. Whittaker (Kristin Scott Thomas delivers an amazing performance), who immediately takes a profound (as much as unfounded) dislike at her daughter-in-law Larita, played by Jessica Biel, who gives here a stunning performance. John Whittaker (Ben Barnes), the son who married Larita before his family knew her or could have any say in it, remains a bit childish - and totally not up to the task of defending his marriage -, is very pleased to stay with his new wife in his old room. But, although very patient (and - almost - very agreeable to everybody) Larita stands the situation less and less. From there, things go downhill, even if the film contains still hilarious moments. But, after a while, we're on the brink of tragedy... As telling more about the film would spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it yet, all I can say is : go and get it, and watch it!
