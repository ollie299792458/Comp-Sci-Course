I have owned this one for a few years and still watch it a few times a year due to creativity of the actors, script, and cinematography.  If this movie is known for any single element, it would have to be the hilarious (and catchy) soundtrack.  And like so many great horror-comedies, this movie provides many entertaining and memorable quotes.  The gore is more cheesy than disgusting.  The scares aren't many... being that it doesn't resort to jump scares, the music is funny, and the lead antagonist resembles a young John Lithgow.  This is more comedy and belongs on the shelf next to Shaun of the Dead and Evil Dead II.  Nearly every actor/actress in this movie have gone on to other visible roles.  This movie also has some well utilized cameos that add to the story.  The director was lucky to find such talent to make this low budget, but entertaining movie.  Thankfully, NO CGI!  And unlike most DVDs, the extras are actually interesting and the film with commentary gives great insight into the humorous challenges of making a quality low budget film.
