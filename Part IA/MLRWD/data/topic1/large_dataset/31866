Wes Craven's debut film wasn't bad for a beginner.  It begins innocently enough, with Mary Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) getting ready to go to a concert with her friend.  It's when they want some weed that they get into trouble.
They go up to a dealer who just happens to be someone on the lookout for new victims for two violent murderers who escaped from prison and their female accomplice.
In the apartment, the girls are verbally abused and one of them is raped.  The following day, they are taken to the woods.  It is there that the real "fun" begins for the rapists/murderers and they proceed to intensify their torture of the two women.
After Mary and her friend are murdered (in reverse order), the four killers (three actually, the fourth in the group is the son of one of the murderers and he's so strung out on heroin he can't think straight) seek refuge in a house directly across from the woods.  It turns out to be the house of Mary Collingwood.
When the parents put two and two together, they seek the ultimate revenge and get it.  
For working on such a low budget, Craven did an excellent job with his first film.  The shoddy camera work gives it that extra scary effect (the creators of "The Blair Witch Project" knew a good effect when they saw it).
Even after many times watching it, this still scares the hell out of me.
