I think unsuspecting people should be aware that this series is NO Noah's ARC.  I'm not talking about the stories.  I was very aware of what this series was about before I saw it.  I read all the reviews.  And like Noah's ARC, I was expecting a bunch of unknown actors and low budget production.  However, I LOVED Noah's ARC.  A beautiful series that was truly ended way too soon.  No so much this series.  There should never be a season 2.

I think Noah's ARC writing and direction made it a better series to watch and enjoy.  How do I describe the DL Chronicles?  In one word...AWFUL.  And predictable.  (I guess that was two words.)  And on top of the poor stories (and really bad acting) we were constantly treated to gratuitous nude scenes. I'm not opposed to nude scenes, but there was no point to these.  In one scene there was full frontal nudity.  What?!

Plus the show had a lot of plot holes, which really irritated me.  For example, in the story of Robert, can anyone tell me what the timeframe was?  He met the guy in the store, then online, then at his apartment and then on a few dates.  Next thing I knew... they were professing love for each other.  I couldn't tell if this romance happened in a week or a year.  I kept thinking to myself that if the executive producers/ writers/ directors (who appeared to be the same people, which probably led to most of the problems) &lt;you know, no checks and balances> had eliminated all the nude scenes, maybe we could have been treated to more plot that actually filled in some of the holes.

Either way, I don't think that this would have improved the stories, much.  I understand that this series was pretty popular among the young, gay college crowd.  However, straight women like my friends and myself found it "unwatchable."  View at your own risk.
