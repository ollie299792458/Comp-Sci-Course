I remember being in a dormitory TV room when "Ordinary People" won the Oscar for Best Picture, and the guys screamed and hissed and booed and some stormed out.

And why? I knew immediately that it was because "Raging Bull" had lost.

I'm not deriding "Raging Bull" in any way-- it was a fine film, and the directing/acting was terrific... But I knew very well that depite "Bull"s admitted quality, this room of gorillas were furious and indignant not because they really appreciated the artistry of that film, but they wanted a macho film with lots of scenes of guys beating the hell out of each other to win... Some movie-goers would also vote for "Pulp Fiction" and even "Kill Bill" over, say, "Ordinary People" for Best Picture as the latter has no graphic violence.

It's that simple, and that silly.

The suggestion that this win was one of the greatest travesties in Acadamy award history is--- well, it's just a buncha raging bull.

"Bull" was good, but "Ordinary People"s haunting (there's that word again), finely textured, understated view of a disintegrating middle-class family after the death with which none of them can deal of the in-house golden-boy, is the more affecting film. Some may claim the movie is now "dated" in that so many pictures have followed focusing on or dissecting middle class suburban life, but I've generally found those to be either too 80's-style-self-conscious, and/or too smug, and just quirkily unconnected to reality (and please dont confuse "Terms of Endearment" nor "American Beauty" with "Ordinary People"!)

"People" succeeds through understatement and lack-of-pretense, and from the fact that it was filmed in a now-bygone era in which posturing and political correctness weren't required from the script or the participants.

The Academy got it right.
