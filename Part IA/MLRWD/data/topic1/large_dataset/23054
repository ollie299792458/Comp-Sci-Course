It's always a challenge to view a movie after it's garnered a few Oscars, because of the hype. If I could point one reason as to why this movie was so well received by the Academy, I would say it was the courage and abandon with which it went against the grain of New England (American?) conservatism (it's another conversation as to how such a simple concept of art should seem to innovative to Hollywood).
The symbolism of a house, and the bedroom that separate the people living in it is strong -- they are physically together, but mentally stored away in different compartments... perhaps for good reason. Son Frank (Nick Stahl) is studying to be an architect, and drafts elaborate structures of dream houses in his room. Dad Matt (Tom Wilkinson, who is really the star of the film, despite what everybody says about co-star Sissy Spacek's performance) is a doctor who can't fix what's going wrong with his family this summer. Mom Ruth (Spacek) conducts hymns that doesn't salve her astute perceptions of the world. Yet because the symbolism is so strong, so apparent in every nook and cranny, its overabundance renders it somewhat contrived.
The direction is exemplary, and if nothing else, the performances elevate the film a few notches above what it actually is. After the first tragedy of the movie strikes, the camera splices up scenes that mimick the on-screen relationship fragmentation, and by the time there's an abject role reversal between the parents, you get the feeling that the pieces won't come together again.
