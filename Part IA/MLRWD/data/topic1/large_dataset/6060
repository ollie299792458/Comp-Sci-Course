The DVD was defective -- one side was the wide screen version, the other side was the "box" version, cropped for standard TV.  I have top equipment with wide screen capabililty, but could not play the disk wide screen.  I was able to play the disk in letter box, however.  The documentary itself tells the remarkable story of one of the great heros of the Twentieth Century. Having been wrongfully stripped of his title and banned from boxing during the prime of his career, Ali's task during the "rumble in the jungle" comeback was to take on the undefeated heavy weight champion of the world, a man who had crushed every opponent he had ever faced.  George Foreman was younger by ten years, stronger than Ali, oblivious to pain, and with a punch like the kick of a Johnston County mule.  He feared no man, especially Ali.  Ali's strategy in round one was to attack with a right lead. It worked, to the extent that he tagged Foreman repeatedly with a right lead and was quick enough to employ that strategy w/o getting counterpunched out the ring.  What most people forget is the Foreman was not hurt by Ali's powerful right hand. It just made him angry.  The rest of the film is how Ali changed strategy in mid-fight from right-lead to rope-a-dope, and knocked Foreman out for the only time in his career.  Whenever you feel old and tired and think you have lost your edge against against younger and stronger competition, watch this film.  You will be inspired to win. Like Ali, you can beat the odds.  -- Sam Boxer
