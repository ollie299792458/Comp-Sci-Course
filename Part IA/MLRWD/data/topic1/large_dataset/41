This is a film that keeps your attention throughout, but leaves a bad taste by the end.
The film presents with honesty some of the horrors of Nazism and Communism in Eastern Europe.  But its message at the end, which is not subtle at all, is that all "politics" is bad, that good people should not serve any ideology.  I suppose that's a message that strikes a chord among some jaded Europeans.  It's a message that deflates the movie for those of us who think that democracy and freedom are political ideas worth defending.
The movie also provides a jaded, European view of Jews.  The movie contains some strong scenes about the ugliness of anti-Semitism.  Yet, the movie seems at pains to suggest that Jews were not exactly innocent victims -- there's a major character who converts to Christianity and starts to make ethnic slurs of his own against Jews; there's his son who goes from being an inmate in a concentration camp to working for the secret police and hunting down participants in the "Zionist conspiracy"; there's a protracted scene accusing the Jews of failing to fight back against the Nazis.  It was interesting to watch and try to see where the movie was going with all this.  But in the end, it didn't go anywhere.
