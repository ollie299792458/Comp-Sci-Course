I never felt this film got the commercial exposure at the box office it should have because so many confused it with 'Ghoulies', which had been released the year before.  No Comparison!!.  I've read some of the other reviews and they're all pretty good, so I'll just add some personal trivia.  The house in the movie is in Astoria, Oregon. Thats the same town where they filmed Kindergarden Cops. Some of the scenes on the beach were near Haystack rock in the Cannon Beach, Oregon neighborhood. When Chunk says he saw the Jeep full of bullet holes and calls it an ORV, that was the slang (off road vehicle) before not so off road products were named SUV's.  Reminiscent of The Little Rascals that Spielberg watched when he was in  school, it's an appealing adventure story, a sort of 'Young, Young, Indiana Jones plot". Amazing how Steven Spielberg went from filming a color  silent film of 1965 senior sneak day at Saratoga High School in California to blockbuster mega-mogul film Director, producer et al.  Part of his success was in thinking big.  Although Goonies did not appeal to a broad age group, he didn't cut any corners, spending money on blowing up boats and creating a giant octopus, scenes that hit the cutting room floor.  (but can be viewed on the DVD)  In fact, I think the pirate ship was the largest indoor set ever built>(at that time)  And so Ghoulies faded into history while Goonies speaks to generation after generation, igniting a sense of wonder, speaking to the child in all of us.
