There's just something about him, about his entire sensibility, that "gets" me in every one of his movies, no less so in "Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"; even if not everything "works" comedically or whatever, I always find myself with a large, dippy smile on my face - and a slightly larger heart - afterward. It's his whole artistic "thing", his entire package, the style, the tone, the observations, everything in its interaction with everything else - even if, as I said, not every little thing works in and of itself - that coaxes me into this exotic Albert Brooks land, where everyone looks at everyone else just that extra little bit too long and you can't not laugh. I could just sit and watch his facial-expressions and laugh. His hair makes me laugh. Admittedly, he isn't for all tastes, but I just gel instinctively with what he always seems to be trying to get at: communication, understanding, breaking down barriers, going beyond fear, and in a funny, wry, self-deprecating way. "That Darn Jew", indeed! He's a genius, of a quiet, harmonious, and connective kind, and one of the few celebrity-types whom I'd really like to meet and actually have a conversation with and not just meet to say I've met. You go, Albert!
