Having read many review on how inaccurate this film were, I decided that I'l have a go myself anyway. Being a fervent student of classical civilisation myself, I thought - that wasn't a bad film at all. I agreed that the film is not 100% accurate but not to the point that Attila had conquered the Roman Empire. The film did well to put all historical element together and added some "spice" that would make the film interesting to the general audience.

We all knew that Attila is not a handsome hunk, But try to put yourself in the director and producer perspective. Could you really find an actor of Attila description in the film industry. No, you couldn't even if you wanted to. I you want one you would have to import directly from Mongolia, and I doulbt that the Attila would speak at all during the entire film. Also, it is not economically viable to use any person as such, the film just won't sale. The film-makers are not trying to make a documentary. They are making films, and film suppost to by enjoy as novel, not histoy book.

I doulbt that the legend of King Arthur and his Knights as we know is historically accurate. Nor wizard do play quiddich!! The film "King Arthur" (2004), which base more along the line of historical account, is no better than any other "historical inaccurate" film before it. At the end of the film, my sister who have no interest whatsoever in ancient history asked me for some historical background and asked to borrow some book on the subject of Attila and the Roman Empire. I felt that the film-makers could say "mission accomplished".
