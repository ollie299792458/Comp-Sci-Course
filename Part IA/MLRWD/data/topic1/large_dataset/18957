I admit to being an Elizabeth I addict. I read everything I can on her and will buy a movie sight-unseen just to see how well the cast and screenplay present their material.  This version of the latter years of Elizabeth I does not disappoint.  Helen Mirren provides the feisty, passionate, enigmatic Elizabeth one would expect as she moves through her "Gloriana Regina" years to old age.  Jeremy Irons' portrayal of Robert Dudley has a crusty, arrogant edge - and the two performances compliment each other. The supporting cast is also genuinely fine.

The costumes were gorgeous, the sets opulent, the cast of characters over-

whelming. It is a lavish production.  And that is my major criticism.  There is so much going all the time that the eye and the ear are

frequently in competion with each other to discern what's happening. And

at times I could have sworn I was in Renassaince Italy - not England.

As always, there seems to be no getting away from historical inaccuracies

which makes me a bit crazy!  But it is a sin all of these historical productions share, and to allow them to ruin the entire experience (if

there are no mortal sins) is to overlook all of the positive.

I still find the comparative simplicity of the BBC Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen the best and most refreshing of all the recent Elizabeth productions.
