I had no idea that I was getting a Disney production when I rented Spirited Away. But when you press Play on the DVD you don't get opening credits, but instead John Lasseter - creator of Pixar Studios - laying it on a bit thick about how fortunate you are that Disney has brought you this wonderful film. Thanks, John. Just shut up and let's get on with the show.
It certainly is a wonderful film. It's no surprise that the animation and storyline are fantastic - that's been well documented here. It is surprising that the rest of the experience - the voices and music - are so weak. They are too Western to fit well with the visuals, and I assume that's attributable to the Disney production team. (Another reviewer - "from Seattle, WA USA" - wrote more about this.) The one extra meta-feature that I watched was so self-congratulatory that I couldn't finish it. Yes, we all recognize that we owe the Disney Corporation a huge debt of gratitude for bringing us this masterpiece of animation. I'd like to get ahold of a non-Disnified version, though. Maybe I could give that one the full five star rating.
