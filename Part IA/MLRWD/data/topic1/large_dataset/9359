"Beware the Beast Man.  For he will make a desert of his home and yours."

So says one of the sacred texts of the Apes.  At the end of this movie you will wonder which is the more civilized species.

This is one of the best sci-fi movies of the 60s. It's doing what ancient Greek drama does -- forcing you to rethink the human condition in a larger, more compassionate way.

Charlton Heston gives the performance of his career, with his rather heavy handed personality and his many years of stage training gloriously paying off.  Heston may have been perfectly cast, but he obviously had the savvy to cast aside his ego and make the most of this opportunity by presenting both the heroic and insufferable aspects of his character.

Another standout is Maurice Evans who plays Dr. Zaius, the ape elder.  Evans' character initially appears to typify the worst in bigotry (by blindly dismissing any suggestion that humans have intelligence), but his rigidity in fact masks a very real and unsentimental understanding of mankind:  when asked what Taylor will find in the forbidden zone, as Taylor finally escapes from the captivity of the apes, Dr. Zaius grimly replies, "His destiny."
