There are enough good reviews of the movie here for you to get an idea of whether you want to watch it or not.  For me, the movie was a good time.  Not much new going on from the first 3 in the series, but they had some new deaths which were well done in their own right.

I decided to post this review to inform people of the 3D BluRay version.  The disk itself has both the typical 2D version of the movie, and an Anaglyph 3D version.  For this reason, I have to say, do NOT buy this movie if you are expecting an amazing 3D experience.  Many of the scenes were shot with dominating red or blue hues which play havoc with the Anaglyph (red and blue lenses) 3D format.  Many scenes are more of a headache to watch in 3D than are justified by the addition of 3D.  You will find yourself taking off the glasses and switching to the 2D version of the film within the first 45 minutes.  If you were going to buy this movie based on the 3D experience, your money is better spent elsewhere.  For fans of the previous films, they will not be disappointed.

Soon enough the AVC-3D codec will be released and allow for polarized screens/glasses that don't destroy the colours in the film you are watching.  Until then, 3D Anaglyph blu-ray disks are just novelty, no more.
