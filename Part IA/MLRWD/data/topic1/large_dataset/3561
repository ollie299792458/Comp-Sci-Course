The movie is fantastic and I picked it up for ten bucks cause I love the acting, and how they systematically get their revenge.  Its not in a Stallone or Schwarzenegger Im-going-to-shoot-everyone-dead-who-ticked-me-off kind of way.  They use the court system, mobsters, and corruption to their advantage.

What disappointed me, is that in the theatrical release, they have a short text at the beginning of the movie detailing what a Sleeper is, and some text at then end before the credits roll stating something to the effect that "...the [Court] has no record that such a trial ever took place and no record of sex abuse in the Boys school (yada yada)  Lorenzo Carcaterras stands buy his story."  These texts are left out.

Why???

Was it so controversial that they decided to take it out of the DVD release?  I know that sounds silly to complain, but when you read info like that, it gives the movie more mystery, authenticity, character.  You know this is someone's story who claims its true even if its not.  If someone watched this version, even if they knew about the book, would think the book and movie may be 100% fiction, instead of it being allegedly based off true events.

I dunno...was a little bummed by this as it lacks that punch to it.  But it was nice to watch the fantastic acting, engaging story, and climax to the end.  I am just bummed that this was cut out.
