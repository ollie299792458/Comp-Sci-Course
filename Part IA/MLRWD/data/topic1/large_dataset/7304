Well I must agree with my fellow amazon.com customers this dvd set was great. I got it on sale and was stoked about that. This show is one of the greatest beats any T.V. show made in the last 20 years. I watched this set from start to finish and both seasons are great although season two did recycle a few shows from season one. You will get hours of fun from this set and you can compare and contrast the two "Marilyn's". This show has lots of laughs but it also has the gothic qualities of a universal Horrors film of the 1930's. I got into this show back in 1986 and had not seen some of these episodes since and boy did it take me back to being 12 years old again. My only complaint is why did it take a full week to get my order and why did the customer service reps not have any idea where my order was during that time. They should be trained in geography of the United States.

  Well all in all very happy with the Munsters my favorite T.V. show next to Friday the 13th the series and the Adventures of Brisco County jr.
