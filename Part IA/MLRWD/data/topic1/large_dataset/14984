I love batman don't get me wrong but if u r releasing dvds now days please give people action and a dam good story like the red hood.I waited for this movie for months only to b disappointed with a story pretty much all of us knew,if not we could look it up,i am glad i downloaded this rather buy it and wish i kept my cash,  and the batman voice----lame---beware not worth your cash rent first $$$$$$$$$ in this economy we need our money worth-----rent first--- marvel is ahead in animation and know how to release dvds for adults/teen.mark my word since marvel got the disney deal it will blow dc out the water in animation and how to release dvds---just ask walt disney on how to get the  customers to the stores.we learn about batman first year in batman begins---- who wants to c a story about commissioner gordan??? what is this, $17.99 for gordan begins.

batman begins ---how many dvds r they going to waste on batman beginning,do sum thing new. do any one agree  17.99 for another beginning---wow
