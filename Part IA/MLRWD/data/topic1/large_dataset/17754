I picked up this movie via Redbox last night.  I would have liked to have seen it in the theater, but living in the armpit of Maryland we really don't get too many independent films around here.  I'm sure I'll have no problem securing a ticket for Big Momma's House 3, once that is released.  Welcome to the Rileys is an intense character drama.  A film whose characters ripple through your mind long after the stone has skipped.  James Gandolfini is a warm man with so much love to give, but nowhere to put it.  Melissa Leo gives a strong performance as the emotionally vacant wife, and Kristen Stewart continues to impress.  She ain't no Bella here, and its her fearlessness in continuing to seek out characters like this that will ensure her a long and fruitful career, if that's what she chooses.  I'm giving it four stars because it seems like they had two different endings to choose from and rather than picking one, they went with both.  I won't spoil anything, but lets just say I wish the film had ended five minutes before it did.  There's some magic in wandering through the rest of your life, looking around every corner your see.
