I'm usually not the type to laugh out-loud in a theater, but this movie made me do just that. Ben Stiller is very funny, or maybe just the writing was funny. Either way, you'll get a kick out of it. It's got some pretty out-of-nowhere jokes that really work ' breakdance fighting, the 'walk-off', and the 'Derek Zoolander Center for Kids who Don't Read Good and Want to Do Other Stuff Good Also'. The commercials did give away some of the good jokes (like those I just mentioned), but unlike a lot of movie's I've seen, there are plenty left to merit going to see. 
 Will Ferrell plays the fashion mogul Mugatu ' a great character who's hair sometime out-performs his acting. Owen Wilson is Hansel, Zoolander's competition for Male Model of the Year. I liked him in Meet the Parents and thought he was just as good in this. David Duchovny makes an appearance, but it's just what they show in the commercials. There are cameo appearances by a few other celebrities including Fabio and Lenny Kravitz.
 Well worth the night out.
