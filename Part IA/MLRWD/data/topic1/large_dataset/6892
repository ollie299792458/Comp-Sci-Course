Never before have I looked at cinema the same way since I have watched this movie.  Truly a touching movie that you will stay alive in your mind as one of the best movies ever.  Exceptional performances by Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Connelly.  Marlon Wayans was as expected, but still superb.  His history as playing more of a comedic role in films has effected the way I look at him now because his performance was well done, although of the 4 characters, he had the least lines.  But he proved that he can play a serious role in a movie.
Watching this film has made me more aware of addictions in life.  There are drugs out there that are invisible.  Perhaps dreams are the cause for overdosage.  Throughout the film, Aronofsky presents multiple scenes where the character appears one way (depressed or not as alive) before taking whatever drug, then presents the character in a different way--happier, more lively.  And each time you see this sequence, you see the character's dream slowly fading away.
This film has impacted me more than any other film and is rated my #1 choice.  I recommend this movie to everybody.  This is truly a must see.  After watching it, it will have made a mark somewhere within you.
