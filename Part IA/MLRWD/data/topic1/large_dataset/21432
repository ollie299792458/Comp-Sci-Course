This package is winner if you are an Adele fan!  Clearly this lady is one of the BEST things to come along musically for some time.  Please be aware that she not only sings like a hot, bluesy banshee, she also WRITES a great deal of the best material she's recorded.  She's a force to be reckoned with, and will hopefully be with us for a LONG time!

I was really excited when I purchase the Albert Hall package, very eager to to WATCH this terrifically down-to-earth performer do her magic at a concert that was HUGE for her and with an audience filled with her friends as well as fans BUT...

Unbeknownst to me, there is AN EDITED FOR MATURE LANGUAGE VERSION OF THIS CONCERT!!!  The notation to that effect on the box, is A SMALL LABEL WITH BLACK LETTERING PASTED OVER A BLACK BACKGROUND ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BACK OF THE JEWEL CASE... so it is practically invisible!!  I was REALLY IRKED by this and wanted ALL of Adele, not some cleaned up version!!  SO BEWARE... If clean is what you want, just keep your eye out for that tiny black label... If not....WATCH OUT and be sure you buy what you wanted!

The concert CD and DVD is FANTASTIC, and worth every cent and more of what you will pay for it!!

Can't wait for more from Adele... She's a true gift to music lovers!
