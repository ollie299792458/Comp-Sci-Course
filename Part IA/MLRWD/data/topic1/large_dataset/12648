I loved this series when it originally aired. It provided me with 5 major heroes and surrogate father figures. It also emphasized foreign languages so much, that it inspired me to take every language my high school had to offer: French, Spanish, German. And I would have taken Italian or Arabic given a chance.  Old World War II films with German and other languages did provide inspiration to keep studying after The Rat Patrol went off the air. I am very disappointed that these DVD's did not subtitle the foreign language portions in the original languages and translate underneath. Subtitles that say "Speaking German," "Speaking Spanish," etc. just don't cut it. I don't remember enough to understand the German, and I would dearly love to know what Dietrich and Moffit were actually saying. (I would actually buy them again if this was added in the future.)

Seeing both seasons now after so many years, I am impressed with the quality of acting and the characterizations. They are of high quality. There are lots of historical issues and other things you could nitpick, but this is entertainment, not documentary or biography, and the series is highly enjoyable anyway.

Each episode (mission) is also a morality play in it's own way. Back in those days we Americans identified ourselves as the decent people who did not torture people in interrogations, unlike the evil Germans. How far we have fallen today from that today.

Good entertainment. I loved it at ten, and I love it now.
