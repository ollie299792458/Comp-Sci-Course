This was filmed in the 80's but other than some of the fashions you'd never really know it and that are where I think reviewers here miss the mark. This is not a "typical 80's teen comedy" in the way that phrase is generally understood.  There are no references to pop culture (movies or music) in this film at all.  Many of the songs used in the film are either not from the 80's or, with the exception of the Billy Idol song used, obscure pop tunes.  The soundtrack to this movie is barely noticeable.

There are no decade defining actors or actresses in this film either.  No Anthony Michael Hall no Molly Ringwald et al.  Other than Patrick Dempsey in "Loverboy" I don't remember any of the people in this film in anything else during the 80's.  This movie should never be lumped into the "Sixteen Candles/Breakfast Club/Pretty in Pink" trilogy of sorts.  It's a much different type of movie the most obvious reason being John Hughes did not direct or produce this film.

I originally saw this movie in 1988 on VHS while I was a freshman in HS.  The plot of this movie could easily be set in 1967, 1977, 1997 or 2007.  I may be mistaken but I don't think cliques in High School were an 80's phenomenon that disappeared after 1989.  As far as I know there are still jocks, nerds, and being "cool" in HS is still and always will be defined by who you hang out with.

This movie used the still annoying habit of trying to cast 23 year olds as high school students.  Most of it is obvious but amazingly enough Amanda Peterson, the prettiest girl in school, was really 16 at the time.  Perhaps that is what makes the movie more enjoyable.  If you are looking to watch a teenaged HS comedy that most of us can relate to on one level or another you might like this.  If you want to watch a "decade defining 80's movie" you should look elsewhere.
