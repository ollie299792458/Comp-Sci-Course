First off, I wont get into any debates about who is better, Curly or Shemp. I love them both! With that said it is clear that Curly is acting different in his 10 shorts on vol. 5 due to his failing health, and no fault of his own. He just was'nt himself here.
Then comes Shemp! Almost every one of his shorts is a five star rating. These were some of Shemp's best. I enjoyed all of the volumes so far but seemed to enjoy this set the most, probably because the Shemp shorts were not shown as much as Curly's through the years, and when you see them your reminded how good Shemp really was.
The Stooges seem to have found themselves again with the addition of Shemp. They instantly have a chemistry, and seem to take Shemp right in stride without losing anything. In fact, they turned it up a notch after Curly's final 10 shorts.
Shemp was so good here, that he really should have been the bigger picture on the front cover of this set! However from Sony's standpoint Curly represents the Stooges the best,and they take advantage of that putting Curly in the main picture and Shemp in the hint circle.
I never thought Shemp tried to be like Curly. He was just naturally funny in his own way and that's why I liked him so much.
These appear to be as clear as the first four volumes so bravo and thanks to Sony for a great restoration job.
Ending on a curious note vol.5 does not say REMASTERED IN HIGH DEFINITION as the other volumes do........hmmm.
