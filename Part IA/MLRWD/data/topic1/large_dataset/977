I have been consistantly impressed by the quality of transfers from old films, especially "The Searchers" and "Blazing Saddles".  Anyone who contends that an identical VC-1 transfer looks differently on either of the two HD formats is looking at the world through format skewed glasses.  The same encode looks the same in either format, unless some of the bits are getting lost in the blu ray data transfer because the bandwidth available is SO much greater than the low bitrate VC-1 transfer needs :)

The only disapointment I see in this transfer is that Warner chose to remain constrained by the size limitations of HD-DVD when using the VC-1 transfer for the Blu-Ray release, notice that because there was no space on the HD-DVD version for "extras" the Blu version didn't get extras either.

I can appreciate Warner staying format neutral, but the customer who chooses a technically better format deserves software that takes advantage of that superiority, not software that is simply warmed over and dumbed down to the least common denominator.

All that said, Blazing Saddles is a worthwhile addition to your Blu library.
