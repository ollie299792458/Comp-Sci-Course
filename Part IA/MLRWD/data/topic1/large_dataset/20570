Guillermo del toro's first feature length film Cronos has striking images and nicely lit sets and somewhat devoloped characters but you can care less for them. The film rattles along the corridors of boring because you can care less for the storyline and its premise. I agree that the acting and character devolopmennt is well directed and blocked well by Guillermos detailed direction but it lingers on boredom. Back in the 90's after I had seen Cronos I had the rare prevliage of meeting Guillermo at his film workshop in Guadalajara Mexico just before the kidnapping of his father leading to his imigrating to the U.S. in 1999. Back then he was full of ideas and imagination , a true delight in fancy. A friend was interviewing him for a local magazine and I was doing the stock photos for that interview. After everything was said I pointed out that the film 's ending was vague and confusing. I understand that it is a vamire film but there is begining , middle and ending, as all scripts have and he answered "well I only had a Million Dollars to work with and an American actor-I had to do the best of what I had" I have to admit he has a great memory on horror and its monsters, but a storyline that intrest the audience must have intresting characters. And that monster character lacked that intrest. But dont take my opinion ...see it for yourself.
