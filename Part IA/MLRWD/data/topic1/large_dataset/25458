The secret of the success of both the book and movie, Love Comes Softly lies in the brilliant development of the characters and storyline by the authoress, Janette Oke.  Resulting from her personal love for, and life with God and the wholesomeness which ensues from such a life experience, inspired the godly characters of the principles, Clark Davis and Marty Claridge.  The writers, directors and producers of the movie did a good job keeping the principle characters (Clark and Marty) true to the book.  Although some events in the movie were dissimilar from the book, even those events seemed `in keeping with' the tenor of the book.
 Clark is a patient, honorable, humble, godly man.  Marty's response of humility and teachableness, resulting from her circumstances of sudden widowhood/destitution, was a wise character development - Marty's needyness was beautifully intertwined with the man Clark Davis had become when she became acquainted with him! The principle characters of the book, their lives, the events and the matrix of this endearing book and movie, are all very credible. One cannot be taught (by God) if one is unmalleable (prideful, arrogant, self-sufficient.)  Clark's strong character, leads and sets the tenor of their sweet and tender love story. The beautiful development by Janette Oke of their Christian characters in her book(s), makes both book and movie of the unforgettable quality!  The great aspect of the characters and the storyline is their reality.  Such people exist in contemporary forms in the world today, they just aren't in plentiful supply.  Anyone who humbles themselves before God will learn the secret of living a life with richness, peace and more love than they could ever imagine - the life Clark and Marty Davis exemplify.
