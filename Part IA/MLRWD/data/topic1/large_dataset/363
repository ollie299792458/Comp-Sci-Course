It starts out pretty predictably - Justin Long is out drinking with his funny sidekicks after just having screwed up yet another relationship; Drew Barrymore is a 30-year-old intern and ends up in the same bar.  They meet over a game of Centipede (of which she is the champion) and end up spending the night together.  The catch?  She's leaving in six weeks to finish school clear across the country.  This story is not new, but the two leading characters truly seem to enjoy each other's company, and their anguish when (surprise!) they fall in love and realize six weeks isn't enough is real.

The film tries just a bit too hard to be shocking and unconventional with the language, though the phone sex scene is hilarious.  Garrett's best friends Box and Dan are pretty funny, especially Dan, played by Charlie Day (of whom I am a fan from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia).  Christina Applegate and Jim Gaffigan are inspired as Erin's sister and brother-in-law, Corinne and Phil.  They are the grounded, been-through-all-this-already married couple that are supposed to bring down the young lovers, for whom everything will be different.

Good actors with a believable story and a few necessary rom-com elements thrown in make for overall good watching.
