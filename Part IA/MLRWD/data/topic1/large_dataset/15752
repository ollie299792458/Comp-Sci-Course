This film, you can say, was probably ahead of its time, since that's the way society has turned out to be.  Let's just go for the sex in a  relationship, and that will be great.  We all know its not.  This is what  we see in Carnal Knowledge.  Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel are roommates  in college, and are trying to experience the rite of passage : sex for the  first time.  Garfunkel goes for Candice Bergen, who he never scores with.  Throughout the whole time, though, Nicholson sneakly does with Bergen.  He  really is a ba----- to do that to a friend.  Bergen appears as a good woman  at the beginning, but she really isn't is she after sneakly going with  Nicholson while being with Garfunkel.  But the story gets even more  powerful when they are out of college and Nicholson finds Ann-Margret,  "Bobby".  He goes for her, because of her body, and they're in  bed the first night they meet.  That's trouble right there, since that's  how many live in today's society, having one-night stands.  Nicholson and  Margret live with each other, and eventually get married.  Later, we here  Nicholson say when he's showing a slide of Margret, "That's Bobby, who  conned me into marrying her."  He later went to say he now pays here  alamony.  He should have thought about that before a one-night stand.  Art  Garfunkel marries Bergen, and by the end of the fim when there older, we  see a third partner he has who is young, played by Carol Kane.  Throughout  the film, when director Mike Nichols is switching through different times  in the men's lives, we see a ballerina type figure turning around on the  ice.  It represents what Nicholson and Garfunkel were doing the whole time  we got to know them, playing on "ice", with woman they met.  All  the performances are superb, and particularly, you'll never forget  Nicholson, and even Ann-Margret who sounds like a whore with a heart of  gold, but really isn't.  A masterpiece of a film.
