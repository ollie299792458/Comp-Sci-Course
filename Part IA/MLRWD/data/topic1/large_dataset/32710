BEFORE I SAW THE MOVIE:
I'm going to watching this movie right now... (13:50/5-3-2003)At the end of the Movie I'll rate it. But every movie I saw of 'Steven Spielberg' were rated very good (3-5 stars). 'Harrison Ford' stars as 'Dr. Indiana Jones', 'nd I love 'Harrison'! He was 'Han Solo' in 'Star Wars Episode IV: a New Hope', 'Star Wars Episode V: the Empire Strikes Back' and 'Star Wars Episode VI: the Return of the jedi'! The last 3 Star Wars were the best Movies ever... I wouldn't get it if this will be a bad movie!!! Now I'm going to watch 'Indiana jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark'...
AFTER THE MOVIE:
I aspected more from this movie... I can't give it a 5 star rating, like most of you critics do! I think there was something missing in this movie that other movie (like 'Star Wars') do have! Also when 'Indy' fights.., I think it's so fake!! But, I like it!! A lot... I enjoyed the movie, really I did!! I just thought it would be a beautifull movie, instead of a good movie! Tonight I'm going to see 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', I hope it's better. I think it's going to be better...
