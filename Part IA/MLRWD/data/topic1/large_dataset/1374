After watching this movie with our son, my husband and I entered a debate regarding Dana Carvey's health prior to making this film.  My sweet, forgiving husband swears Carvey, lead-actor and writer on this production, suffered from some kind of brain affliction not too long ago thereby making the headache-inducing Master of Disguise an excusable repercussion of severe head trauma.  There are a few moments throughout the film that warrant small chuckles.  Unfortunately, these are completely ruined by the movies redundancy.  Anything even remotely funny gets repeated so often by the time the audience reaches the brain-numbing conclusion that one begins to feel ashamed for laughing at the gag the first time around.  I suppose, to sum it up in a way that is universal enough for everyone to clearly understand, I'd have to say that Master of Disguise is to PG-rated movies as Gigli is to R-rated movies.  I know my review can't save everyone from making the same terrible mistake I did when I sat down with the family in front of the television.  But, if I can rescue just one person from the same sorry fate I had to endure for 80 eternity-seeming minutes of "Turtle, Turtle," and Brent Spiner's predictable post-laughter flatulence, I'll die a happy critic.
