THE MARK OF ZORRO is a movie that should have been filmed in Technicolor in the first place. Then there's the seemingly national prejudice against colorization, spawned, no doubt, by the awful early efforts. However, like

most innovations, early efforts are crude and can improve only by trial

and error.

"Artistic censors" saw early on that they must stop this evil - and they did. "We must preserve the black and white originals"...apparently these

idiots did not know that only a tape of the film was colorized; the original negative was never touched. Technicolor was used infrequently because it cost triple the money of a black and white film. Money, not aesthetics controlled this aspect of movie-making.

At last, Twentieth Century Fox is correcting some of their past decisions

by colorizing THE MARK OF ZORRO, and a fine job it is. Color lightens the

mood of this costume epic, and gives a warmth to the fine cast. They have

also done a great job of colorizing MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET. (At last, the Thanksgiving Day Parade looks festive.)

"Purists" rejoice! The black and white original can be seen on the same DVD. However, I'll bet you never watch it once you've seen it in color!
