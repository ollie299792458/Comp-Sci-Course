I am of the belief that any movie starring Antonio Banderas with a sword is proabbly going to be better than most movies that don't star Antonio Banderas with a sword (or a guitar case full of guns for that matter).  It is with this notion in mind that "The Legend of Zorro" is a fun film.  The action is very well choreographed and very enjoyable.  Zorro's stunts are breathtaking and far superior to the stunts and swordplay in the very enjoyable "Mask of Zorro" film.  I would even go so far as to say that the majority of the plot in "Legend of Zorro" is also superior to the storyline that takes place in Antonio's first turn as the masked, Zorro.

The sole reason for this film's 3 star rating is Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Actually, that isn't even her fault.  Catherine's character, Elena, is absolutely repulsive in this movie.  She is whiney, she is rude, she is darn-near unbelievably difficult to tolerate.  For lack of a better word, she is absolutely a gigantic b****.  In spite of Elena's best attempts to make this movie no fun at all, Antonio's performance as Zorro and as a father are way fun and very enjoyable.

Buy this movie only if you are a total completist (as I am) and feel the need to own it simply because you own the first.  Otherwise, this movie is probably not worth much more than a one-night rental, and it's honestly all Elena's fault.
