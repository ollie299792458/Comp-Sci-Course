I love this movie! It's not a big budget, pretentious Resident Hollywood Evil, poorly written and un-thought  out plot and story line piece of crap movie. Nor It is a low / no budget, hardly thought out past the first page, unrealistic dialog delivered by goofing friends who thought it would be fun "acting" in a ZOMBIE movie, movie! Dance of the Dead is unpretentious fun with a well thought out and well written script and a great group of actors that have no egos and can really act!
A bunch of high schoolers; the unpopular geeks (but not the really weird "emo / goth" kids), save the day by kicking zombie butt.  What is not to love about this movie? Dare I say that I like this zomidy more than I do Shawn of the dead... it's true! I can't believe it either!
Dance has such a real, unrefined, un-glossy look and feel to it. Like it's a budget movie, but it doesn't know it. And as a viewer, you like the look and don't care cause the story is so damn great and the actors are doing a wonderful acting job and anyway you are sick of all the over done special effects and mega budget Hollywood crap James Cameron and Resident Evil movies, and you wish you were a possessed Linda Blair so you could throw up acid pea soup all over your copy of Night of the Living Dead 3-D, and you thank God you bought it used for very little money!
But anyhow, Diary of the Dead is my favorite George Romero zombie movie, and I refuse to watch any more Resident Evil movies cause they are more about kung-fu action hero grip fighting boss hybrid monsters instead of zombies, so what do I know. Check out Dance of the Dead, it`s full of originality and realism. And if you don't like it, you can always rewatch you bluray of Resident Avatard!
