First off, it is worth seeing/buying this movie just to see the famous Jack Nicholson scene:  "You want the truth?"

On the other hand, the military inadequacies by Reiner and crew and many fold.

As a former USAF Captain who sat on many courts-martial in my six years of active service, I can tell you this was staged for the civilian in a typical civilian court room setting to avoid confusion.  In a REAL court-martial here how it is set up.  First off, the judge is NOT the focus and not "presented to."  It is the board of officers (no less than 7 in a :capital offense" like the one pictured) who are the focal point, with the senior officer in the center, the next senior to his/her right, on so on a so forth.  The "judge," is actually the "Judge Advocate" who sits elevated but on the side, and only rules on matter of procedure, law, evidence etc.  It is the senior officer who conducts the court-martial.  There is no jury as pictured.

I thought this was a very entertaining movie, sad in a way, but I have to say Nicholson's performance was spectacular.
