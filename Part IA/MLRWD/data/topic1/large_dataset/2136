If i had [money] left to my name, i would buy this video and worry about food later... ( not recommended practice for everyone ) 
The film begins on the sad note of Sir Menuhin's passing and infers that an era of virtuosity has ended. The film immediately goes into full gear and switches between vintage footage of great violinists playing the Mendelssohn concerto.... breath taking. 
And it doesn't stop there. Those wishing to see A LOT of great "old" fiddling captured on film ( and then some more ) will not be disappointed. The business of violin playing is introduced in plain words, many virtuosi are given a personal introduction. This is not a "how to play the violin" instruction video for the beginner, but if you already play or you are learning to play, it's like attending several master classes in a row... unbelievable.
I think If you are a music lover, this documentary will help you attach a face to all the recordings you already own. ( including the faces of a few composers/conductors ) If you are a musician, you will get a hint at what makes virtuosity. If you are a violinist, you will be introduced to what makes greatness...
also, watch out for Kogan's left-handed del Gesu of 1733 vintage...
