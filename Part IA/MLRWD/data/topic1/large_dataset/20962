this is probably one of my favorite movies,and one of the few movies ewan macgregor is actually good in (if you dont believe me watch moulin rouge and and those piece of trash star wars movies).

Trainspotting centers around Renton (Ewan MacGregor-Nightwatch,Shallow Grave,Big Fish) Spud (Ewen Bremmer-Black Hawk Down,Acid House,Alien vs. Predator)Sick boy( johnny Lee miller-Dracula 2000, Mansfield Park, Regeneration)Tommy (Kevin Mckidd -bedrooms and hallways, topsy turvey,dad savage)and the amazing Robert Carlyle as Begbie(The Full Monty,The World is Not enough,Formula 51)

  Spud renton and sick boy are heroin junkies who do almost anything to get high, tommy is a weight lifter who videotapes himself and his girlfriend having sex (although Renton steals the tape, his girlfriend flips out when Tommy says he may have returned to the video store), Begbie is a psycho who beats people up for money or for being "doss c**ts", Begbie doesnt do drugs and neither does Tommy at first (later in the story Tommy shoots heroin with Renton, and i can't forget that (to quote the drug dealer Mother superior)Sick boy knows a lot about Sean Connery.

Trainspotting is part drama part black comedy,the funniest parts are when spud drops speed before a job interview and in a drugged up frenzy freaks the crap out of the the interviewers, and when Renton finds out the girl he slept with is a catholic school girl in high school currently.

Overall this is a really good movie it is not an anti drug movie or a pro drug movie, even to call it a drug movie is a cheap way to describe it.

And to correct another reviewer Trainspotting doesnt stand for herioin, there are people who spot trains all the time its all they do do is stand by the tracks and wait for more trains to go by them, the book and movie is called trainspotting because all the junkies do is get high and get high again and again, as Renton explains.

And one more thing why do people say this a pro drug movie, obviously its not, the withdrawal scene alone proves that.
