If you are more inclined to mathematics or sciences you probably will find this adaption of Shakespeare's classic rather strange.  If you are into theater, art or literature analyzation you will love it.

The concept of keeping the same early modern english language and putting it into our times seems absolutely nonsensical, but I found it the oppostie, where in fact it is more clear to understand the language when it is set to something that would appear familair to us.

The actors are actually fantastic, a young Leo and Claire make the perfect teenage Romeo and Juliet who were supposed to be about 14 anyway.  They look as innocent and in love as Shakespeare intended it.  I really liked Claire Danes as Juliet because you were watching Juliet, you weren't watching a famous actress play Juliet, you know?

While Baz Lurmahns direction style canbe a bit eccectric, it certainly isn't as flashy as Moulin Rouge but still, the color and camera shots are sensational.  I'd see this film for the scenery and sets, etc alone.

I think it getsa bad rep because people expect to see a new age Romeo and Juliet.  Ok, wrong.  You will get the same gorgeous language the play MUST be spoken in, but the backround will be modern and colorful, however this always seems strange to some people.

It's an english major's dream because of all the imagery and symbolisim.  I loved it.
