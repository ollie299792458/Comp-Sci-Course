Ok, granted there are a lot of songs performed on this DVD, but many of you still may be wondering why any single concert could possibly take up 2 DVDs. The answer is simply that this is one of the highest quality DVDs you will ever find. Picture quality is amazing and will hold up even on large screens. Sound quality is amazing, and was specificaly worked with to accurately simulate a real concert experience. Hear every nuance of the music as the crowd cheers beind you in a wonderful demonstration of the way surround sound should be used. If you've been to a Nine Inch Nails concert, you will be pleased with how accurately the experience is replicated. If you're a fan but have never been to one of their shows, this DVD is an absolute must. But even if you're only a casual fan, the DVD is worth seeing just to truly realize what DVD is capable of doing. You will not be disappointed. A side note- there are two versions of this DVD, one in DTS surround and one in Dolby Digital. The DTS sounds a bit better, but does not have the multiple angle capabilities which are available on some songs in the Dolby version. Most people will probably not be able to hear the difference, but then again most people probably won't bother with the angles more than once either, so it's really a judgement call. In any case, Enjoy
