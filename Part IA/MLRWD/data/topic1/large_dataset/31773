I LOVED the book "Flowers for Algernon," and while not expecting the movie to quite measure up, I was looking forward seeing the story acted out. I wish I hadn't watched! The acting, in my opinion, was horrible.... I can't believe Cliff Robertson got an Oscar for it! His way of portraying a "retardate" (their word) was by playing on the playground with little children, tongue hanging out, wearing flood pants and a goofy smile. Nowhere in the book did he play on a playground except in his memories of childhood. When he became smart, his clothes fit. When he reverted, suddenly his pants were too short again. Huge details were changed, and not for the better. And the 60's cinematography was God-awful! (And why did everyone have that fakey pseudo-English accent? Did actors in the 60's have to learn that? Americans don't talk like that!) I thought Clair Bloom was downright scary and nothing like the sweet teacher in the book. All in all, I would say stick with the book and pass on this horrible cinematic mistake. I think this movie would be great as a 2004 remake!
