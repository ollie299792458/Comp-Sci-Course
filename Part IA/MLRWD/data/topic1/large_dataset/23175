Who would have thought that the gal who played the ultimate cheesecake role as outer space babe, Barbarella, a few years earlier would be capable of such a magnificent performance as her in the role of alienated prostitute Bree in Klute?  This is an updated noir crime drama the way it should be done but rarely ever is. Visually and compositionally "smart" and sensible, and interesting, never over the top, never draws attention to itself stylistically. Noir-like in its use of natural lighting and locations.  Subdued but effective musical score. No, this film isn't a, "... it was Colonel Mustard in the library with the rope" whodunit. You know, pretty much, who the killer is fairly early on.  It's an excellent, well-written, impeccably photographed and directed character study with some potent performances.  Overshadowed by Fonda, is the mysterious edge of the titular character, played by Donald Sutherland.  What draws him to her? What's the attraction on a psychological level (the physical is obvious)?  Where do they connect?  You know all about Bree in this film, while Klute remains a mystery.  At the films ends you're left wondering what their life will be like, will this last?  Excellent American movie classic that has aged remarkably well.
