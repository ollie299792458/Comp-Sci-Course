This review is not about the film it's about the Blu Ray.  After seeing "King of Kings" 1961 restored to Blu Ray, and the great job that was done on "The Robe" from 1953 no less, as well as plenty of other titles that look pristine, this is total crap.  This Blu Ray does not have film grain, that is DIGITAL NOISE, that the studio didn't bother addressing. I had my DNR and MPEG Noise Reduction set to high for this, and it didn't help.  I'm so sick of trading in my old DVD's to buy Blu Rays, and I end up getting crap like this. I'll bet even the VHS is better than this.  Sometimes they just don't take the time, "Spartacus" 1960, a disappointment. Thankfully they fixed "Gladiator".  Now if they fix this one, we will have to go buy yet another copy. I haven't viewed "The Ten Commandments", but I'm not worried because I've seen the positive reviews.  I don't know what's going on with Fox restoring MGM's Blu Rays but they are hit or miss totally.  "The Manchurian Candidate" 1962 looks great, while "Leaving Las Vegas" is almost as bad if not worse than this disc. I would say be wary from now on when Fox is releasing MGM Blu Rays.
