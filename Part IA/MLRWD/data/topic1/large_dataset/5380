Family holiday gatherings and the joy, and angst, they bring are not new ground for films. In "Nothing Like the Holidays" the family in question are the Chicago-based Rodriguez clan, struggling with all the pathos and love most families have ... If a bit more dramatically (and occasionally comically) for movie purposes.

If you've seen "The Family Stone," "This Christmas" or any one of dozens of other holiday-themed, family pictures, you'll find the plot of "Nothing Like The Holidays" familiar. Siblings, including an Iraq war vet, and their spouses, among them the upscale fish-out-of-water (played by Debra Messing), gather to celebrate Christmas.

The aging parents want to hand down the family business to their children who, surprise, are less than excited about following in their outmoded/old-school footsteps.

This film is occasionally charming, and not a terrible way to spend 90 minutes or so, but it doesn't break new ground and, in fact, simply rehashes (sometimes almost word-for-word) territory covered more skillfully in better films. The actors are capable and the story fairly interesting, but I can't imagine this becoming a classic you'd want to watch again and again with your own family each holiday season.
