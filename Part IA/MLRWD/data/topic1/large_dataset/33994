I've followed and enjoyed Kansas since the mid-70's and have seen them live, perhaps, 11 times at last count - at least once every decade they've been in existence. Two for the Show is the definitive live Kansas experience as it shows them with the original lineup at their best. Of course I like that one because I saw them on that tour in Kansas City and know it is a fantastic recording of the live experience. If only it had been video taped! Since it wasn't, Kansas waited until now to produce a DVD. Yes, the band is 30 years older. No, the voices aren't as powerful as they once were. Yes, one of the monster creative forces is no longer with the band (Kerry Livgren) along with Dave Hope. The energy of the show isn't the same as it once was when you would watch lead vocalist Steve Walsh running around the stage. Yet, this DVD shines in its representation of the band's music. The performance is excellent and anyone who enjoys the music of this band will find it acceptable. If I want to relive the prime of this band I put the vinyl "Two for the Show" on the record player. This is perhaps one of the few chances to watch a video production of the band until old video from the 70's somehow appears.
