I bought this video because I had been going to a tough 6:00 a.m. kickboxing class at the gym which really got me sweating and losing weight.  But it was too early, too crowded, and the choreography was a little too complicated for me to follow that early in the morning.  I wanted something that would make me sweat fast, but that I could do any time at home.  This video pretty much fit the bill, but my complaints are these: The routines are a bit too repetitive and, hence, boring.  While I didn't want anything too choreographed, this goes to the opposite extreme--you do, for example, thirty punches over and over, then 10 side kicks on each side, then thirty seconds of "fast feet", and so on.  Also, what they call "uppercuts" are different from anything I had done in kickboxing class, and they don't do roundhouse punches at all.  The instructor is really goofy and (to me, anyway) kind of annoying. There are a lot of jumping jacks and a lot of jumping rope (without the rope).  In short, this is a brisk calisthenics workout with punches and kicks for good measure (and a ditzy instructor), but if you are expecting a kickboxing workout with interesting and mentally challenging moves, this really isn't it.
