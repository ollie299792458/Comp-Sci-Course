I am a heterosexual female and I love, love, love the "Leather Jacket Love Story."  I just love the opening theme song!  I am excessive compulsive so when I love a movie I watch it literally several times a day.  I love Kyle because he is so cute, sweet, innocent looking and very affectionate and passionate.  I loved most of all about Kyle was that he was sexually responsible.  He was mature to have his own mind and mature enough to ask about Mike's AID's status during their banter at the diner.  In addition, Kyle was mature enough to speak up if he was uncomfortable about something.  I really liked the way Kyle was portrayed.  Mike my goodness was he a beautiful, very manly hunk, and bad boy.  Oh, Mike played his part well.  However, there was also a very sweet and generous side to Mike as well. I loved Mike's facials expressions and especially his "lipid pools" eyes.  This is another reason why I watched the movie repeatedly.  In Mike's eyes, you can see the growing affection he was starting to have for Kyle.  Gay or not a beautiful man is a beautiful man and Mike is a beautiful man.  I also love the girls, all three of them, i.e., Charella, Amanda and Madge!  I am beginning to watch more gay men movies more than heterosexual movies.  The rest of the cast did a great job as well.  When the CD become affordable I will buy one.  It's worth having.  But, $50, $75, etc. is way too pricey!
