The movie, "The Da Vinci Code" is an excellent portrayal of the book.  Even just for the entertainment value, and ignoring the facts that were presented, anyone can appreciate the quality of the movie.  The settings, the characters, the story line, and the actors are excellent.  I recommend this movie for anyone who wants to be entertained and likes mysteries.  Maybe it will lead people to do some researching of their own, if they want the Truth.

Truth cannot be known without all of the facts.  Unfortunately, throughout history certain knowledge has been kept from the populace.  The book "The Da Vinci Code", was based on research of ancient documents and books. A lot of which were not added to the Bible, due to the politics of the times, and thanks to Constantine and his priests. The story was developed based on this research.  Of course, ignorance scorned it, because there are people who never want to wake up.  If only they would see, that what Jesus taught is still valid and that he was one of God's chosen teachers.
