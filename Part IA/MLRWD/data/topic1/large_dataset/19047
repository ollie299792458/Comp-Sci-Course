Totally underated & needs more exposure.  I love weird movies like this and have seen hundreds of horror, psychological thrillers, gore, slasher type films over the years! But this was different than the usual and had a disturbing, psychotic, perverted twist... at the same time you can't take it too seriously, it was somewhat comedic how he behaves and reacts as the movie progresses.  If people rated this poorly they may just not be into movies like this and really shouldn't bother rating...Yes it is a weird movie but its not just "guy makes doll that looks like girl he likes....guy falls in love with girl....guy freaks out on doll and girl".  If that's all you see in the movie and you're not into this kind of stuff then don't bother watching or rating.  But again, if you like disturbing, weird, creative stuff, then you may enjoy this (or at least get a laugh from it). I give 5 stars because it was something original and different than I'm used to seeing, and to pick up the 1 star ratings because you just need to take each movie and determine what the audience is, what the director or writter is aiming to do and see if they achieved their goal...its not really about your personal preference for a type of movie. I usually love horror and a little gore.  This did not show a lot of gore and blood, but it did provide a refreshing, disturbing psychological angle that was def different and something you won't forget. [...]
