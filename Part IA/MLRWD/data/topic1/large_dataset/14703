I cannot believe what I am reading. Most people seem to have loved this film and think it is some sort of beautifully moving adaptation of the books. My thoughts could not be any further from this perception. I absolutely worship the books and have ever since I was a mere 9 year old and read them in true Anne stylee beside the brook in our garden. Her romance and imagination and general love of everything beautiful completely touched me in a way nothing had, or ever has since. So, naturally I bought the videos and couldn't wait to watch them. I so wish I hadn't. They are horrible, uncreative and completely inaccurate. Anne is not the innocent, wispy, natural,laughing darling that we see in the books. She is a serious, stubborn, rude bore and no true Anne lover could ever think that these poor excuses for films were anything but crap. I think the main problem is that the book lets you set free your imagination and gives no boundaries to your exploration. No film can ever do that. If you truly do love Anne please do not watch this; do what she would have wanted and keep it in the imagination!
