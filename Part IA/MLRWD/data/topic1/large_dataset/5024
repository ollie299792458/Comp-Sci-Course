I first saw this movie when it was released. I left Hunter College in NYC and crossed the street to the foreign cinema. In no time, I was hypnotized, interrupted only by the steady stream of people leaving the theater. By the end, I was a solitary captive of the film in an empty auditorium.

Living in the suburbs and raising a family, I still thought of the work and longed to see it again. Mostly I needed--NEEDED--to know where the hotel was and hoped to catch the credits to find out.

At last, nearly 10 years ago, I discovered that it was playing in the Village. Begging a friend to join me, we traveled down, and despite all efforts, arrived shortly after the beginning. Now over 3 decades later, I sat breathlessly watching the movie while again all persons walked out leaving me and my friend, fast asleep and snoring lightly, as the lone witness to the masterpiece. I was crushed that I missed the opening credits.

A thought--I would purchase the video which I now found existed, and when it arrived, I again watched the film which had the credits truncated. What disappointment!

Lincoln Center, a few years ago, again showed the film in a director's retrospective. Finally, a theater-going crowd who, like me, sat spellbound by the film. At last, I had company.

It appears that nowhere is the exact name of the hotel given, nor does Marienbad appear to be a true city. If anyone has sleuthed this out and can tell me where it is, when I finally visit the hotel, I will send back pictures. Thanks for any help.
