I first read Richard Adam's novel when I was 10 years old, and found it hugely engrossing. A serious devourer of books, this was the first that I re-read once I had finished it.
I went to see the movie as a birthday treat when I was 12, and was more than a little disappointed at the omissions - although, to be fair, most of them were not mainstays of the plot, but Blackberry's wonderful tales of El-Ahrairah.
On the whole, the film stays true to the novel, and has some truly inspired interpretations (Fiver's vision). 
As has been said many times, Disney this ain't.
Read the book before watching, and you may share my slight disappointment. Read the book afterwards, and you may find you re-read it too - especially if, like me, you are familiar with the Berkshire countryside.
It must be emphasised that my disappointment is slight - this is a truly great animation suitable for all ages, but not for those of frail dispositions or those easily upset by real life. There is a world of difference between an animated movie and a kid's cartoon, although personally, I think that this movie bridges the gap very well.
For comparison, read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, then go see the movie.
