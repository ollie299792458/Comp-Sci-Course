Personally, I think "Mildred Pierce" should be shown every Mother's Day on network television as a simple reminder of where mis-placed Mother's love will take you.  Joan Crawford found out the hard way in this 1945 noir-soaper cranked out by Jack Warner under the guidance of Michael "Casablanca" Curtiz.  Curtiz was a genious to realize that you have something unique when you figure out how magnificent and wide Joan Crawford's heartbreak can be when she gets to suffer in deep-sleeved Sable. And who could suffer in bathing "key light and shadow" better?  Simply, Curtiz uses his leading lady to perhaps her greatest effect.  Her "Mildred" is the lumber and nails of this production.  On equal acting footing is hissing Ann Blyth squinting like a dangerous, devouring reptile dressed up like a Madame Alexander doll.  Together they chew some of the greatest dialogue ever afforded any actress.  "Mildred Pierce" is a cinematic artichoke with witty, biting and clever layers yielding to a diseased heart of unrequited paternal love.
