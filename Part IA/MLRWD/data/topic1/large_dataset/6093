This South Korean film is a real standout. It ranks up there with just about any high-tier Hollywood film. Great acting from the two leads: Lee Byung-hun, from The Good, The Bad, The Weird and Choi Min-sik (OldBoy). The director also seems to be at the top of his game (Kim Ji-woon, The Good, The Bad, The Weird). On top of that, it's kind of nice to see how he handled this as his American directorial debut, the new Arnold Schwarzenegger comeback film (The Last Stand), is about to be released. The eerie score complements the striking cinematography very well, and it accentuates the raw emotions perfectly. The subtitles even seemed to be done well, something you can't say a lot for foreign films. I never got lost in bad translation. The movie thrilled at all the right times and has some pretty amazing fight/action scenes (one that takes place between three men in a driving taxi was something I found pretty cool). Just a warning though, if you're squeamish, you may be closing your eyes quite a bit. It's gets vividly gory. In my opinion though, very worth the watch, overall.
