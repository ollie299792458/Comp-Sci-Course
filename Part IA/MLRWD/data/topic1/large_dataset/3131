Simply put, if you're into film noir, this is a movie to be revisited, or seen for the first time. No blockbuster actors, but everyone played their part well. A rather gritty movie considering it came out in the mid-50's. If you love nostalgia and are familiar with the LA area, you'll love the scenes shot on location.
  What's always a good quality in any movie is a story you can follow, which you have here. It's the typical noir where a lot of smoking & drinking goes on, yet everyone's dressed up.
  In short, a PI picks up a hitchhiker (Cloris Leechman!) that escaped from an insane asylum. She knows information that everyone's trying to find out. It's all about a box in a gym locker.
  I found it especially interesting, recognizing a lot of the supporting cast (I watched a lot as a kid on Saturdays with dad). I also have a huge interest in Los Angeles past, so seeing the trolly car going up the hill, hotels downtown not there anymore, etc etc, was a big treat.
  If film noir is your thing, don't pass this one up. Great stuff!
