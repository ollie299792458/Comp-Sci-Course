My mother used to talk about this movie when I was younger, and how she loved it.  I finally found it on Amazon, purchased it, and invited her to watch with me.  It has the look and feel of the old war (the Big One)with a slightly different twist--Ginger Rogers is a murderer on Christmas furlough.  Shirley Temple is classic Shirley--neither impressive nor instrumental to the plot--as the teenaged daughter of Ginger's relatives.  Joseph Cotten, suffering from battle fatigue, predictably falls for Ginger, rescuing her from a vicious dog and relying on her image to pull him through a perspiration-packed relapse.  "I'll Be Seeing You" comes off more as a made-for-television movie, but because the people in the movie are major stars, they brighten the screen more than the lackluster plot could ever do.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie, the company, and the quiet one hour and twenty-five minutes spent.  I would recommend it for those who are nostalgic, but I don't believe it would stand up for the younger generation that craves blood, violence and sex on every frame.
