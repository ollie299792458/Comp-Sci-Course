"Jersey Girl" is not very good at all. What the hell was Kevin Smith thinking with this movie? The thing is all over the place.  It's completely unbalanced, and the acting is less than stellar.  Ben Affleck should not have to show any range of emotions in movies.  He should always just be the charming, funny guy.  When he tries to act, it's like watching a foal take her first steps.  The effort is really cute to watch, but the result is just awkward and only resembles real acting in the way that stumbling resembles walking.  No wonder Matt Damon has distanced himself from this ass-clown.

So many horrible mixed messages.  So many horrible montages set to poignant music meant to take the place of actual storytelling and acting.  At least the music is good.  The Cure, Aimee Mann, Ben Folds, etc.  Also least Liv Tyler is cute and engaging.  However, the Affleck/Tyler flashbacks to the horrible "Armageddon" almost negate her energetic performance.  Oh well, at least she took her shirt off.

It would have been a much better movie had they just gone ahead and done the full "Sweeney Todd."  Their production was fabulous (even though it was just one more complete lapse in reality).  Kevin Smith owes me 2 hours of my life back.  Jerk.
