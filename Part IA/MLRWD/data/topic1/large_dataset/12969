This movie was a LOT of fun, from Columbus (Jesse) and Tallahasee (Woody) arguing over the 'Zombie Kill of the Week' to the running gag with Woody's obsession in finding a Twinkie and Columbus' rules for survival. The times Little Rock (Abigail) and Wichita (Emma) duped the guys were a total facepalm with a giggle attached.  I found the scene where the characters trash the gift shop a bit weird, so I'll chalk it up to a psychological tension release. Columbus squirting perfume on Tallahasee still gets me grinning, however. Tallahasee 'meeting' Bill Murray was hysterically funny (to me) and probably the best part of the film.  The most serious moment is when Tallahasee reveals his grief over the death of his son.

Jesse's mildly obsessive, paranoid character was a fair match for Woody's pseudo-tough quirkiness, although his (Jesse's) performance reminded me a little too much of Woody Allen. An awful lot of 'F' bombs, though really not out of character. The 'girl' roles were fun and unpredictable, although Abigail's part seemed more two-dimensional than Emma's.  Good acting overall, and I recommend you watch it more than once.
