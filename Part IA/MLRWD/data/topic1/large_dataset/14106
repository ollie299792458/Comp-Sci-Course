This is the story of three men: Hank (Bill Paxton), Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton), and Lou (Brent Briscoe).  Hank is Jacob's younger brother; Lou is just a friend.  Hank is married and his wife is expecting; Lou is married also; Jacob is single.  The three men go out hunting in the cold Minnesota woods when they happen upon a wrecked plane.  Inside the plane is a gym bag, and inside the gym bag is the American Dream: 4.4 million dollars in cold hard cash!  The men then devise a simple plan to hide the money; however, as greed overcomes the men, the simple plan becomes an evil plot.  As greed claims Hank's wife (Bridget Fonda) as its next victim, the plot continues to lead to corruption after corruption, murder after murder, sin after sin, and--ultimately--extreme tragedy.
Although Siskel and Ebert call this film a "razor-sharp thriller", and although the back of the film's cover describes it like one, IMHO it is not really a thriller.  I personally think this film is more of a drama, especially since it doesn't really have the gripping suspense or the action the way most thrillers do.  But the true beauty of the film lies not in how exciting it can be, but more how haunting and stirring it is in its depiction of good people turned bad.
In fact, this film is very quiet and completely devoid of big explosions, massive gun fights, car chases, or even loud background music.  The musical score and winter scenery are perfect for the mood; cold, bleak, icy, quiet, bitter, and lonely.  It all works really well in conveying its chilling message.  Thornton and Paxton deliver fantastic performances as well.  
My only major complaint is that you can guess the ending from a million miles away.  Nevertheless, this film has quite a story to tell, and it is definitely worth a view.  Warning: it is definitely not a "feel-good" movie, so watch it at your own risk.
