Obviously, I cannot review Season One yet, so I will reminice about a few of my favorite episodes throughout the series run:

1) remember when Rudy was bitten/attacked by a chimpanzee giving Rudy superhuman strength, leading to a fight between he and Steve Austin?  Great episode.

2) when Steve had to battle a robot likeness of Oscar Goldman.  Another great one.  I like when Steve first notices something strange about Oscar.  Oscar is walking on the plush carpet in his office and Steve finds it odd that Oscar's footprints leave such deep carpet impressions.  So, Steve drops a pencil on the floor and Oscar unknowingly walks on it, crushing the pencil into pieces.

3) the first meeting and fight between Steve and Bigfoot.

4) my favorite - Steve has to battle that Venus space probe machine.  I believe it looks like a small silver tank.  It had a grappling hook at the end of that long mechanical arm.  I remember it grabbing Steve by that mechanical arm and throwing him.
