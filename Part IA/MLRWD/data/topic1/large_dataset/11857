I was really excited to watch The Lorax movie with my 2 year-old daughter in hopes it would be as special and timeless as Dr. Seuss' book, The Lorax.... unfortunately, it wasn't.

The animation was good and the story line ok - it was somewhat based on the book after all. However, I personally did not care for the cheesy style of comedy in comparison to other Dr. Seus movies (e.g. Horton Hears a Who - silly but not cheesy). It just wasn't funny to me.  Maybe kids will "get it", but I didn't.

My last critique focuses on the casting. No offense to Danny DeVito - he is a great actor and comedian and I enjoy his characters in other shows and films - but I never, in all my years of reading the Lorax, imagined Danny DeVito's voice as the Lorax.  It just sounds wrong.  I struggled with this the entire film.

Overall, the movie was OK. Not great.  It had a lot to live up to and no doubt fell short. I defnitely won't be purchasing this one, but it was entertaining enough as a one-time rental.
