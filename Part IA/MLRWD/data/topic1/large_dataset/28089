I've seen half a dozen spoof movies of late, sci fi, horror, westerns... All failed to hit the target, including Alien Trespass. Its screenplay was a reasonable facsimile of '50s sci fi, which unfortunately comes across as stilted (i.e., boring) nowadays.  The period costumes, vehicles, etc., were nice touches, but intended ambience was lost because modern cinematography is so advanced compared to what we see in The Blob, for instance. Washing out colors a bit, plus modest use of blur and noise filters would have helped.

The film makers had a strange sense of comedy, spoof or otherwise. Offing a few good old boys was standard fare in the genre, circa 1950s, along with a mouthy teen or two, but not moms and children. Conversely, the way those cops reacted as monster reports kept mounting WAS funny - I think. Mostly they reacted by sitting around and complaining. Eventually the Chief got worked up enough to go get some coffee at a restaurant, where he sat down and complained. Problem here is: was a humorous effect intended? If so, those actors did it with no hint whatever of tongue in cheek.

Parodies must be harder to pull off than might be expected. The last one I remember seeing was Army of Darkness, which was how long ago?
