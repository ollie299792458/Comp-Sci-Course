The premise of this cute and somewhat benign movie is that we should express gratitude to those around us. We should say "thank you more, please" to those we encounter in our everyday lives. A great message that makes one stop and think. I know I have tried to be more gracious in my dealings with others since I watched HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE.

That said, there is not a lot of other things going on in this movie that will probably not stick with you very long. The main character "finds" a little boy on the bus and decides to "keep" him. The boy, Rasheen, is absolutely adorable and he steals every scene he is in just by his facial expressions. I wanted to keep him, too.  Other than that this is just a pleasant, non-offensive movie that is suitable for most audiences. There are a couple of adults-only sections, but they are  few and far between.

I enjoyed HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE while I was  watching it, 3 nights ago, but I am having difficulty recalling many specifics about the movie. It was good but easily forgettable.
