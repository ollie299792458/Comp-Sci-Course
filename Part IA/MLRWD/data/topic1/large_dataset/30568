From the rather lame front cover picture, which was totally expected of a movie like this, I was expecting a lame, boring, and flawed filled movie. Flawed filled as in obvious flaws here and there that would totally annoy me as the viewer with somewhat of a brain.

However, to keep it short, I liked the movie!

I liked how there was a black man as a main character because usually in movies like this or rather movies like these are usually filled with white people as main characters. No racism intended, I'm just being straight forward. It's refreshing to see a black guy play the part. The movie was also pleasing due to the fact that there were lots of action scenes.

However, even though I gave this movie 4 stars due to liking it, it's honestly around a 2-3 stars. The monster fish looks somewhat believable but not completely, but I didn't concentrate too hard on there.

Oh, I really loved the lawyer "ex bf". I sorta disliked him at the beginning but he was actually very funny and I found him entertaining to watch. He became a likable character. I definitely wouldn't expect that kind of woman to live in such an isolated area, she was pretty hott. There were more good looking people in those 4 or so houses than my area in a 2 mile radius most likely.
