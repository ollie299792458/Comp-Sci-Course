OMG!!!! most fantastic movie ever frikin made!!!!!......... ok, now that im done spewing utter nonsense and making all crow fans' stomachs litterally turn and eject themselves from the mouth, let me tell you something.  Tara Reid was the best actor in this movie.  When that happens mankind should be ashamed of its very existence.  SHE ONLY HAD 2 LINES!!  Ed Furlong is a little wussy peice of poop, and the whole devil thing was a joke.  Actually jokes are funny.  I dont even give it credit for that.  Dont get me wrong, i am a huge fan of the crow.  but there is a reason that this movie is not sold in the box set.  that is b/c the actors and acting in this movie, actually deface the value of the plastic used to make this DVD.  honestly, and this maybe coming from left field, but i think you would have seen a better crow movie if it starred oprah as a villan and dr. phil as the hero.  at least old philly poo would stand up to someone and not get the crap kicked out of him by every random character in the movie.  ok, enough said.....OVERVIEW....
movie and everything about it sucks.  the only good thing is the name.  sorry to say but this movie destroys the name and legacy that brandon lee built for the crow.  so if you will excuse me i must go vomit in homage to this movie.
