When this came out, it got a lot of press because it was so much better than people expected. As a biopic, it is somewhere in between a truly inspirational movie and absolute schmaltz. It has a feeling similar to The People vs.  Larry Flynt, and is of a similar quality. As a comedy, it was intermittently funny, although not terribly imaginative. The fun is in learning more about Stern's perspective on his own life, and in seeing his crew play themselves (initially, younger versions of themselves). The element of self-deprecation is kind of original, and makes for some of the movie's best moments, but pseudo-sexy scenes, such as when Stern gives a woman an orgasm by having her sit on a speaker while he makes a raspberry, are played for far more value than they're worth. Also, Stern's initial boss is presented as too much of a stereotype, with too stereotypical comeuppances. Still, this is well worth seeing for anyone who is a Stern fan, and Stern detractors/neutralists will probably get a new perspective.
