The plot to this movie isn't terribly complicated.  It's your basic grandprix storyline.  You have the hero, some villains, other drivers, and the mob trying to fix the results.  What sets it apart is its execution. This film took seven painstaking years to make, and it can be seen in every frame. I cannot overstress the beauty of the animation.

The characters were all likable. I even found myself cheering for the other drivers at certain points. The best performance came from Liam O'Brien portraying Frisby. This role really shows his range. He can go from a sociopathic killer (Gaara from Naruto) to the lovable Nightcrawler in Wolverine and the X-men. He was surprisingly nuanced for a movie that's basically an R-rated Speed Racer in the future.

The world that it set up was very imaginative. Unlike most SciFi futuristic films, humans are not the majority species. In fact there was no single majority species. This left a lot of room for the animators to be creative with aliens that appear on-screen and in the background.  In all the art style was hat Heavy Metal wanted to be and more.

In short, just watch this film. You will not be sorry.
