I'm not going to bother with describing the plot because most other reviews have, but in my own personal opinion I really enjoyed this movie. A lot of people I know would watch 10 minutes of this movie and then take it out of their dvd player, but that's because they're comparing these movies to the hostel's and saw's of today, when really there is no comparison. You need the right mind in order to know how to approach these films, you have to think that this film was done in the early 80's, in a time where the gory slashers were just getting warmed up to the public. Instead of crying over a picture that isn't in HD and was obviously shot 30 years ago, you have to think back to the 80's before everyone was de-sensitized to death with the silly gorefests of today. With that all in mind, this is a really enjoyable slasher. Acting was sub-par but I wasn't expecting any De Niro's in Madman. The suspense was there, the gore was there, the campy theme was there, everything a slasher fan would want in feeling nostalgic. Friday the 13th and Halloween were both better films in my opinion but this is a solid little entry in the decade of the slasher.
