When this movie first came out, I thought it was the greatest comedy I had ever seen.  Indeed it has the rare blend of humor, engaging (if overt) plot, good writing, and a message.  Furthermore, it was the first time that Eddie Murphy moved away from the slapstick crazy man antics that had made him famous, to a more serious toned (cerebral, if you will) humor.  He did it again in an even better film, Boomerang, which did not fare so well with the critics but was also hailed as a masterwork by his true fans who understood that what Murphy had achieved in these two films was a truer, more refined good time than one can get with pratfalls, penis jokes, and funny faces.  I watched these two films years after they were made and they still hold up as very funny, very deep, and thus in my book, very great.  Try watching the Golden Child or Beverly Hills Cop 3 again and you'll see how great these two movies are.  Here are some things to look for if you are watching Coming to America for the first time.  (1) Arsenio as the preacher lusting after the beauty pageant contestants in his sermon: lots of great lines in his monologue, but the best is "Hugh Hefner-a, Larry Flint-a, they can take a picture-a, but only Goddddd-a can make it"--referring to the girls' bikini clad booties.  (2) Eddie Murphy (in make-up) as the Jewish barber shop customer comparing Ali to Marciano.  (3) The Prince and his bathers.  (4) The McDonald's vs McDoogle's jokes.  This film rocks big time.
