What a disappointment. If you think Serpent and the Rainbow is to Haitian Voodoo what the Wicker Man was to modern Wicca, then boy are you in for a big letdown.

In the book, Wade Davis described how he got much more than he bargained for when he decided to go to Haiti in search of the formula for a mysterious powder which turns people into zombies. Davis got his formula, but he also documented the way in which the zombie phenomenon is only a part of a much wider theological perspective within the Voodoo religion. As such, he unraveled the mystery in terms which can make sense to most Americans.

The film delivers none of this. It is more concerned with special effects than being faithful to the book, and it puts the main character in the awkward position of getting stuck in a Third World country during a time of political upheaval. By the way, the villain is portrayed as a warlord who also happens to be a Voodoo priest.

If any true Voodoo practicioners have watched this film, then I think they should feel perfectly justified in feeling much more embarrassed by it than Wiccans are by the Wicker Man.
