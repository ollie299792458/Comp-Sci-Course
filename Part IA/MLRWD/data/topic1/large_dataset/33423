I liked the Elevation DVD from Boston a lot, but this one from Slane Castle had a much more concert-like feel. The sound is better, and the set list is better too. It includes U2 staples "One" and "Pride" which were taken out of the Boston DVD. You definitely feel the energy from the 80,000 fans that were at the Slane show. I like the interactive features on the DVD too. The only songs that I would've liked to see the band do are "Stay(Faraway, So Close)" and "Bad", but other than that, it's a great way to spend two hours. My favorite songs on this DVD are "Sunday Bloody Sunday", "All I Want is You", "Streets", "With or Without You" and "One". I think over all this DVD is better than Boston's, though I liked "Streets" from that one better, and "With or Without You" is not as good as it is in Rattle and Hum (but not many performances are). I also think perhaps the band could've changed the set list even more from the Boston shows. Besides "Stay" and "Bad", they could have included more songs from Pop. I expected this DVD to be very similiar to Boston, but it's got it's own feel to it. I'd definitely recommend it to all U2 fans.
