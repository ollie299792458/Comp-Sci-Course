"Robinson and Higgins move into a roomy British dwelling, unaware that his half brother--and her former lover--is hiding upstairs in a kind of gelatinous/skeletal state; soon the beast is forcing her to lure stray men back to the house so he can replenish himself with their blood."
Just reading cannot describe this movie.  Clive Barker, in his directorial debut, is masterful.  He is a true artist, and he crafts scenes so horrifying and gruesome in this movie, and it's no wonder that Cenobites, namely Pinhead, have become classic horror icons.
Clare Higgins is wonderfully poised in this movie, playing a woman who desires something more than her husband.  So much so, that she starts killing for the bloodied, Hell-escaped Frank, just to be with him.  Ashley Lawrence, in a powerful, breakthrough performance, plays the stepdaughter to Clare's character.
The movie's art keeps it original and fresh.  Scenes of men being torn apart by hooks and metal are truly gruesome, and the Cenobites are images of pure fear and horror.  Torturing humans for fun is a truly terrifying prospect, and it keeps you shivering all the way through, hoping you will never come in contact with that little, gold box...
RECOMMEND? Yes! A true, horror masterpiece.
