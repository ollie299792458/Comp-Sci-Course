As a black man, I do not agree with most of Malcom's militant  views...its was reverse racism in many ways....but you cannot help but appreciate his place in american history...and this movie is undeniably a superb example of a film biopic...Weather you love or hate Macolm you cannot deny this movie as being a masterpiece.....and to the person who said muslims hate white people...Malcom was first a part of the Nation of Islam....which is not exactly the same Islam as it is practived in  its home the middle east....Islamic followers or Muslims are not terrorists and the religion it self is not one of vilence and murderes that hate white people...did you even see the film???....when Macolm went to Mecca to see how Islam was meant to be practiced he converted and began to change his views of white people....This in turn leaded to his assasination... he also discoverd that their are plenty of white followers of the Muslim faith...

SO before you bathe in the pool of ignorance...pick up a book and read about the religion and its teachings...its not a religion that discrimiinates nor does it tell people to go blow up buildings...they follow the 10 commandments just as Jews and chrsitians do...it teaches peace and love.

So please dont take the views of a handful of idiots who "murder in the name of Allah"...which is a complete twisting of the words of the Q'ran as a representation of what the Islamic faith is about...Those people are just crazy and use religion as an excuse, and belive me they are wrong in the eyes of true muslims....

and by the way Iam a christian...but i also have sense enough to respect others beliefs and not blame 9/11 on an entire faith rather than a few crazy idividuals with no cause....I mean look at the KU KLUXX KLAN...they hate ALL non-whites all in the name of christianity and murder in the name of Christ...does that mean all christians are terrorist who hate all non-white...NO..the KKK is a group not similar to the fools who blew up the towers..so single them out not all followers of the religion..

so i say to you...please read, educate yourself before you speak on the matter at hand...
