I really really enjoyed this gay cinderella story. Even though, the rest of America didnt enjoy this movie, because it wasn't released nationally,  but I saw it when it came out in NYC and I absolutely loved it. It's was a  cute satrical look at the coming of age gay girl in many middle americans,  that just dont know that they are. So the main character's mom sends her to  a camp to be straight again. This is where the fun begins. The camp is full  of different characters each portraying some gay stereotype one way or  another. Certain scenes will leave you chuckling to yourself or laughing  out loud. Clea Duvall is always an enjoyable sight, but she has to be  careful before she's type cast. She's already played a few lesbian  characters before. Natasha Lyonne was such a believable, closeted gay  character that you cant help, but laugh at her funny looks of confusion.  Rupal is hilarious and is great as a man as he is in drag and it was good  seeing him without the wig for a change, but the funniest character, Eddie  Cibrian, who plays Rock, a gay guy trying to be masculine for his mother,  Cathy Moriarty who is the head of the camp. It's funny seeing him flip flop  back and forth from being butch to queen. This is definitely a movie worth  checking out and something not to be afraid of watching. It's good  exposure.
