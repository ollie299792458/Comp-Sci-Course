The curse upon the Rolling Stones appears to be that the pinnacle of their musical creativity, from 1968-1974, is overshadowed by Altamont.
The irony, of course, is that while the Stones and some others are to blame for shoddy planning, based more on naivite' than anything else, it was the Hell's Angels who took it upon themselves to beat, intimidate and, finally, murder concert-goers.  As GIMME SHELTER documents, the Angels were asked to sit on the stage, to form a human wall between the crowd and the performers, in exchange for all the beer they could drink.  They took this to mean they were to keep the crowd at bay, using fists, hobnail boots, pool cues, and knives.
In the end it was the Hell's Angels, a group of thugs who had never bought into flower-power and the entire hippy trip, who brought the 60's tumbling to a frightening and embarassing finale'.  
Jagger, like the Dead and Jefferson Airplane before him, seems meak and confused at Altamont, while good ol' Keith Richards attempts to take control of the situation.
JAGGER:  "People! People!  People, people, people, people, people.  People. People!  Awright.  Awright...people!"
RICHARDS:  "If those cats, right there, don't stop beating everybody, we're not playing anymore.  Those cats, right THERE."
Almost forgotten in all the pop-sociological writings about this film is the great, great music.  The Mick Taylor version of the Stones was as powerful as it gets, and they flex some muscle here.  
My only question is, why weren't Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor allowed to speak on camera?  Jagger and Watts speak frequently, Richards speaks occasionally (mostly on stage at Altamont), Taylor is shown only occasionally, and Wyman is seen on screen, I think, one time, in the background on stage.
