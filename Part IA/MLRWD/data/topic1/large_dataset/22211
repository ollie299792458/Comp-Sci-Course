The first part of this video, the warmups and basic movements, are certainly not for a beginner. As a trained TKD/Kenpo practitioner I was running a sweat by the end. I could follow the movements but none of them were really explained. Zhou Xuan Yun has a habit of saying "here I will show you" without actually explaining where to position your body, how to move your arms/chest/legs etc he simply demonstrates the move. It took a lot of rewinding to figure out what was going on. Zhou Xuan Yun also did not appear to be very enthusiastic during the warmup/basics section.
The DVD gets really exciting however when he moves onto the first Wudang form, this is where it really shines. He demonstrates the form slowly and fast and with amazing force, agility and grace. Although the form may look 'light' after you hear his detailed explanations you understand how powerful (and difficult) it really is. For the form alone this DVD is definitely worth the investment. I look forward to the next in the series.
