"Creepshow 2" is a set of three mini series of silly and yet funny stories. First, my personal favourite, being "The Raft" is about four teenagers going swimming out in a lake. There is an oil slick in the water, and it is after them. I found "the raft" to be funny, silly, disgusting and scarey all at the same time. I dont know how people can actually use their great minds to think of the strange things in life. But "The Raft" is a must see episode and it is the first in the "Creepshow 2" video.
Secondly, is "The Indian". I must admit this was my least favourite as it didnt have a real scarey theme to it. It is about two owners of a shop, in a real desserted town, business is doing very badly. They own an antique shop, in it is a big indian statue. Visitors come along and meet the business owners and kill them. The Indian comes to life and seeks revenge. A below average mini series of the "creepshow 2" video. This is why I gave the "Creepshow 2" video a rating of four stars.
Thirdly, is "the Fireman", this one had me laughing cause it was very silly. It has a woman driving around at night, and she accidentally runs a fireman over, she feels bad about it, but speeds off nonetheless. The fireman becomes a living dead and will stop at nothing to ruin this ladies night. You have got to watch this one to figure it out. A Big Laugh, and creepy as well.
All in all, I give "creepshow 2" 4 stars. It is great, I highly recommend anyones viewing. It will have you laughing, scared, and really get you thinking. Thinking what would I do in that situation.
A DEFINITE CLASSIC with just a minor downfall "the indian",
