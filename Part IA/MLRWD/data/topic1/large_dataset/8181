Ghost in the Shell is one of those rare movies that very successfully puts together awesome animation, great music, a solid plot, excellent SCIENCE-fiction, and the very important but often forgotten humanity... extended beyond the human as a unique physical entity. Oshii set the bar quite high in terms of colors, textures, illumination, sequences, and movement of animation. Kenji Kawai's music fits the underlying philosophy of the movie so well that it becomes an integral part of it, making of the Anime an awesome visual and auditive experience. The plot is well developed, with intelligent dialogue, well-defined charactes, and solid foundation on extropy (think cognitive science, pholosophy, nanotecnology, artificial intelligence, psychology, computational neuroscience, and robotics). This movie is cyberpunk at is best. One aspect I absolutely like is it addresses the question of whether or not it is possible for non-human entities to have humanity, particlularly from the philosophical standpoint, and also for an artificial organism to be considered a living organism. I am certain that over time this movie will be considered to be one of movies, if not the one movie, of it genre with most vision towards a very plausible future.
