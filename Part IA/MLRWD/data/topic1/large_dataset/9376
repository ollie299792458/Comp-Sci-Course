Best dramatic role that stretched Carrey to new never before seen levels of acting.
  The story is a road of high & fast lane of L.A. to fear and escape to lost memory and discovery of a life unlived, again loss and choices made at the fork in that road. One is cascaded through lows and highs and highs and lows centered around Carrey's character.
  Carrey becomes the touch stone of living out a life given as a second chance, and how circumstances affect self, family, neighbors and towns. Like the proverbial stone tossed into the pond and the ripples it sends out in response.

  It was great seeing Martin Landau in this role of the old Majestic owner and Carrey's 'father'.

  I have bought this movie as it is worth seeing over and over.
Would highly recommend. (As long as you remember the movie demonizes people like McCarthy--who it turns out was right--searching for Communists in USA of the late 40's and 50's--but leaves out the harm those Communists did to the country of the time. Their may have been those who abused their authority, just as their is now...that is people seeking power some are corrupted. But the Artists and movie making industry joined these groups of Communists largely out of fear of the power they wielded within the hiring for movies or stage. Sad really. Parts of Carrey's character's monologue to the committee could be offered as testimony to many present day committee hearings on the hill in DC--and maybe should be.)
