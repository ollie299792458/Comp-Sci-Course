I was skeptical at first... but something inspired me to purchase this DVD and I'm glad that I did.  Initially, I thought that a silent film wasn't "modern enough" for my tastes, but I was surprised to find that after about 10 minutes into the movie I had forgotten that it was a "silent" picture!

The story told is so powerful, you easily become pulled into the story regardless of absent dialogue.  There are a few title cards, but none are needed at all as these truly talented actors have the extraordinary ability to express intense emotion without words (and without being overdramatic either)!  In addition, the music score expresses all of the emotion you need to comfortably transport you back into this golden era.

The intense contrast in its visual design is so captivating, that you get pulled into the screen and will, no doubt, want to watch it several times to note the artistic details that you may have missed the first time around.  The restoration of this priceless film was absolutely perfect -- no hesitation in my 5-star rating!  Whether you are new to this genre or an old veteran, this should be an essential addition to any collection.
