Van Helsing is a film reminiscient of the old Universal horror films, which in my opinion is a good thing.  This film does not in delve into disturbing psychological horror that was witnessed in Bram Stoker's Dracula.  Fans of that film will probably not enjoy this one.  This film comes across more like a Dracula meets Indiana Jones flick.  Therefore, if you enjoy entertaining films, this one will fulfill your expectations.  Despite the comments made in the other reviews, I differ in my opinion of Richard Roxburgh's Dracula.  I think that he made a stellar performance!  Roxburgh has an amazing presence on film, and he portrays Dracula as a somewhat tragic, and yes, deeply romantic figure.  If anything, the film suffers from too few scenes with Dracula in them, for he is undoubtedly the main attraction in the film.  I must agree, however, with comments made concerning the use of CGI.  When is Hollywood going to learn that when it comes to computer animation, less is MORE.
The castles in the film look great, but several of the other creatures, like the werewolves and Mr. Hyde, do appear a bit fake.  Some of the stunts are extreme and excessive.  However, Roxburgh's character saves the movie by giving the film a deep, brooding villian of epic proportions.
