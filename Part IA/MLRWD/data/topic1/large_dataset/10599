There is a subtlety and a grace to this film that is often dismissed by viewers as being "dull", now that we have witnessed the gore-and-explosion-packed MegaMovies that seem to exemplify the American war experience.  This is regrettable.  Because this is not an American story - it is an Australian (and New Zealander!) one.  When war broke out in Europe, Australia was still a very young, very small, and quite rural country.  It is by necessity, then, that this movie is actually more a human drama set against a backdrop of war.  The movie introduces us to two characters - very different, but with their characteristic Australian "she'll be right" attitudes, both innately likable - and lets us watch as they move from predictable life in Australia into a world turned upside down.  Through their eyes we see the situation the ANZAC troops are in go from bad, to worse, to catastrophic, until the staggering final scene hits us like a punch in the gut.  
`Gallipoli' is unusual because it makes the tragedy of war immediate to the viewer.  It isn't the story of thousands of nameless dead.  It's the death of people you know, which makes it all the more heartbreaking.
