there are over 200 reviews here on this movie.  i have a modest education and average I.Q  so imagine my surprise when not 1 of these knuckleheads get it right?  i dont have issue w/ the reviews that say stuff like..shagg carpet not included....i mean ...its all good.  but some of these brainiac revewers beg the comment "pass the grey poupon"  i mean jesus h christ....i cant even understand what goblydgook they put forth.  so i am going to give you the 1 review that will clear things up. this is a profound movie. it affected me so much that i could nt sleep all night. there is only 1 other movie which depressed me as much. and that was  "schnindlers list."  that movie was really very sad for a reason that few pick up on....the realization by a peoples of not only being "worthless" as a peoples.....but worse yet....being a terrible infection that must be eliminated. the germans did this at GREAT cost. they sacrificed war production to end the jewish race.  that was the depressing focal point of both schindlers list and jakob the liar.  OMEGA man is the same basic premise. when a peoples believe themselves to be a "religion" 1st and foremost....utter destruction is sure to follow. and thats whats going on here. the writer obviously understands this too.  and demonstrates it with heartbreaking realism....surreal yes....but look at JIM JONES. i was around at the time of this movie...but never even heard of it til recently. this movie was a brave attempt to educate the masses as to the dangers of organized religion...and the ease with which your intelligence can be removed. again...to anyone with clear thinking and basic understanding of sociology...this will be time well spent watching this.
