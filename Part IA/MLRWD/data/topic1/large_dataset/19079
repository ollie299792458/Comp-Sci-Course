This movie begins with Bailey, a gas station owner in a sleepy town.  Bailey is a good looking mild tempered man, he is courting a gorgeous girl and it is raising allot of controversy within the small town.  People in the town can't handle the fact that bailey is quiet, doesn't gossip much and is always keeping to himself.  The mysteriousness of bailey creates allot of rumors and much distrust.

 A stranger shows up looking for bailey and that only makes the rumors about him worsen.  He accompanies the stranger, who is actually an old friend to Whit Sterling's, who Bailey used to work for, in order to confront mistakes he made in the past.

 many years before he was hired to find Whit's girlfriend kathy who shot whit and preceded to steel $40,000 from him.  Bailey, who was at the time a detective, tracked Kathy to mexico where he finally met up with her.  Since Kathy is the classic femme fatal, Bailey instantly changed his mind and abandoned his mission, instead him and kathy started to see each other.  They made plans to be together and moved around in order to avoid Whit finding them.  Kathy ends up killing Bailey's ex detective partner and then leaves Bailey.

 Until the reunion with Whit, bailey had heard nothing more of Kathy and had moved on.  Upon arriving to Whit's Bailey finds out that Kathy returned to Whit, he is disgusted as he expresses by saying "You're like a leaf that the wind blows from one gutter to another."  Whit is not angry but just wants the money paid to bailey to be repaid to him in the form of another job.

 I really enjoyed this movie it was easy to follow and had an interesting plot.
