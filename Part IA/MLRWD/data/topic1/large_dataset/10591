Since I didn't see anyone comment on the new DVD out, I figured it'd be worthwhile to say something.

First off, all the special features that were on the original aren't here anymore. Second, the animated scene isn't as good as it could have been, it was good for what it was worth...but, didn't add too much. If they would have fleshed it out a bit more and made some more frames for it, so it moved more fluidly it would have been a bit more enjoyable. However, the deleted scenes added a lot to the movie, the new scenes helped out the story a lot, and fleshed out the film. There wasn't any additional action but there were some nice dark scenes added. They also added in a nice comic cover gallery that includes summaries for story arcs and such, also the packaging is pretty cool as well.

View this the same as the Daredevil director's cut, it really helped out the movie a lot, added more character, and more plot. Except Punisher was a better movie than Daredevil to begin with(IMO). If you're a Punisher fan, buy this, it makes the movie a lot better, but keep the old copy because it had some neat special features that aren't on the new version. Again what it seems like Marvel is doing is it will release the normal version with a ton of special features, then release a Director's Cut with no special features.
