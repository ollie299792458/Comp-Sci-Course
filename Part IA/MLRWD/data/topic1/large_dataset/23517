This is the only movie that I have watched this summer and has impacted me in such a positive way. Being away from Philadelphia has made me realize that I do have some love for the city and I wanted to see a movie that dealt with individuals living ...(read more)in the city of brotherly love. I saw it at blockbuster and rented it. The movie is awesome right from the beginning, where there is a display of different snapshots from the different communities in Philadelphia and Bruce Springsteen's song "Streets of Philadelphia". The movie not only depicts a very accurate picture of the city's atmosphere but also informs its viewers about the gay community in the city, something that I feel is not as present in Philadelphia compared to larger cities like Chicago or New York. The best part of the movie is that the film is based on a true story. The only reason why I did not give the film five stars is due to the fact that most of the movie takes place inside of a courtroom and after a while I became frustrated when the problem would not get resolved. I was also a little confused by the special features. I was not sure if the special features on the individuals protesting outside of the courtroom were real protestors or not. The extra feature made it seem like they were, but I was just confused. I recommend this film to everyone, but I also believe that it will be even more appreciated by those who have lived in the city itself. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington also give great performances.
