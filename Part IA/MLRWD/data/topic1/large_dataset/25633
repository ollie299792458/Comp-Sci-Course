Don't know why, but over the years Barbra S. never moved me much, I mean I know she has a great voice, and she can act, and yes--she has had lots of hits, but she just never got to me.

Then I saw this show on PBS as a fundraiser: One Night Only Barbra Streisand and Quartet at The Village Vanguard September 26,2009 .

She got to me--she got to me big time!

The setting was perfect--Village Vanguard, a famous yet small intimate nightclub where she got her start, and backed by a capable jazz quartet in accompaniment--I could see myself going there--or to such a place. And she was perfect!

I was dazzled by her song styling, swept away by her delicate control, but most of all I was surprised by her acting. As she sang; her face portrayed every word, she was feeling the emotion of that very moment the song portrayed --no it was even more than that-- she was living it--living in that moment. Suddenly--I understood those songs more than ever before and that she had moved me with them.

I wept at several of her sad song renderings. Tears streaming, I sat in amazement in my darkened living room wondering why I had overlooked her before, why I had not really heard her prior to this event. Maybe the small club and darkened room made it more intimate--I could connect, focus on her, and I found myself leaning forward to listen closely and savor every word.

I bought the DVD/CD set and had it shipped to my house intending to view it again and then send it on to my sister as a gift. I could not let it go, and ordered a second set sent direct to her instead.

Buy it--sit in your darkened room, listen, watch, and smile----Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking...
