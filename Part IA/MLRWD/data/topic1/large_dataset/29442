Parents, please be advised that this is NO movie for children!  The first 30 minutes of this movie are magical; what one would expect for "The Nutcracker".  However, the movie takes a cruel political stance with the introduction of the Rat King character.  Clearly as adults we understand that this character was modeled to be "Hitler" and the rat army was none other than the SS.  The Rat King actually quotes Hitler by saying "our reign will last for 1000 years" a direct quote by Nazis.  I find this grotesque, disgusting and completely uncalled for. When a criminal was brought to be judged by the Rat King he was sentenced to "labor" in a smoke camp AKA "concentration camp"!!  This movie should have been called "The Untold Story of White Supremacy" and only belongs in the movie collection of racist, white supremacists.  Please, do not tell me to lighten up; it's just a movie.  Tell that to the 6+ million human beings slaughtered in the Holocaust!!  By the way, I'm not Jewish.....I'm just an educated human being that finds this movie DISGUSTING!!
