Last evening I saw, for the first time, the film version of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead.  I haven't laughed so much in a long, long time, but of course I'm just part of the mob.  Anyway, here is a list of what you get for your nickel in this film:
1) Ayn Rand's heavy handed screen play.
2) Wooden Acting by Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal, and Raymond Massey.
3) A great imitation of Vladimir Lenin in the Ellsworth Toohey character played by actor Robert Douglas.
4)  Patrica Neal as Ice Princess.  Anytime she comes on the screen you will be singing the old Foreigner tune "She's cold as ice.  She's willing to sacrifice our love."
5) A film in black and white, and I mean black and white.  Everything in this story is black and white.
6) Gary Cooper's maniacal little grin right before ravishing the Dominique Francon character played by Patricia Neal.  He even has the grin when he is thinking about ravishing, and possibly raping by the look on the character Howard Roork's face, Dominique.
7) Dominque's husband, Gail Wynand played by Raymond Massey,  pronouncing her name Dominic.  (A little homoeroticism going on here?)
8) Straight lines and lots of them.
9) At the end of the movie a giant phallic symbol looking of a skyscraper and Patricia Neal almost in orgasm as she rides up the construction elevator to meet her new sex partner, Gary Cooper.
10)  Finally, you will find out that all that matters in life is Architecture.  (Maybe, Art Vandalay was right?)

The only reason this movie rates 2 stars is that the direction of this film by King Vidor is actually quite good.  And considering he had to work under that harpy, Ayn Rand, he should have gotten a medal for martyrdom.  The screen play and acting rate ZERO stars.  Well maybe a 1/2 star for comic relief.

Until I saw this movie I thought Ayn Rand and Objec!ivists in general had no sense of humor.  And to think some folks believe anything written by Rand is perfection itself.
