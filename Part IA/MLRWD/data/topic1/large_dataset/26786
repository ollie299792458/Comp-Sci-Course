I've always love this series of films. Even the sequels, which get progressivley less horror orientated, and more amusing, save for Wes Cravens Final Nightmare, which is a masterpiece.
This box set is a must for any real horror fan. The Nightmare Series has become one of the most imitated horror films ever, along with Friday the 13th and Halloween.
The films are all restored beatifully, and the colours and contrasts are fantastic. The sound is excellent too. The only drawback is the censorship, and European viewers will notice a couple of missing clips from murder scenes in one or two of the films. Howeverm the cuts ARE slight, and don't ruin the enjoymant of the film. The bonus special features disk is a must. It's amazing, packed full of extras. Theres an intereactive Freddy game, which is very disturbing. As you progress, more extras are revealed to you. I don't think I've even completed it, yet.
If you're choosing between the Euro version, or the US version, the US version is the Nightmare set to get. You won't be disappointed, and with any luck, you'll wake up screaming with the sheets soaking...
