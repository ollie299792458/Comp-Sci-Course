Once upon a time, I watched the U.S. "The Ring" for the very first time.  Then right after that, I watched the Korean "The Ring Virus" for the very first time.  Well...

Since then, I've gotten the Japanese "Ringu" and watched it a few times.  And today I just watched the Korean "The Ring Virus" again.  This time around, "The Ring Virus" made a bit more sense than the first time I watched, but I still had a bit of trouble following the story--according to this film itself.  Yes, it DOES follow the original Japanese noval MUCH closer then either of the other versions, but there were still times at which I wouldn't have known what was going on if I hadn't seen any of the other films.

People say, "Oooh, the Korean version is the scariest!"  Y'all gotta be kidding me!  This movie didn't so much as give me chills, where as watching the Japanese "Ringu" last night with the commentary on did.  "The Ring Virus" VICTOMS didn't even look frightened when they died.  The budget for "Ringu" couldn't afford grotesquely distorted dummies like they made for "The Ring," but the Japanese actors at least posed like they really had been frightened to death.

Oh, and the Korean "cursed video" was the least interesting of them all.  Its images were more random and irrelevent then the others, and they didn't even show the important details at the moments that should have been most frightening.  (Instead of seeing such when the victoms were first watching the video, we see the details only when the video is being *researched.*)  I'm not sure how the video was presented in the original noval, but I also thought that the on-screen instructions for spreading the curse distracted from the possible terror.

In short, eh, watch "The Ring Virus" if you want to know all the different angles about the story.  But if you really want specifically KOREAN horror at its finest, get "Phone," or "The Wishing Stairs" a.k.a. "A Horror in Highschool 3."
