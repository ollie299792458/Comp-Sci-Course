The Pianist is the true story of a Polish Jewish pianist named Szpielman, who had a bright future ahead of him - until the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939. From that point forward, Szpielman and his family endured the Nazi repression of the Jews and ultimate confinement to the Warsaw ghetto. Upon losing his family to the death camps yet miraculously being himself spared the same fate, Szpielman's struggle turns into one of survival as he attamps to avoid the Nazis and the simultaneous destruction of Warsaw during the Second World War.

 The story is beyond inspirational, there is truly something to be learned from it. A man who literally lost everything, yet in the end still had his dignity and his passion, perhaps the only thing that kept him alive. It is the triumph of a man in the face of great adversity. The movie itself provides a distinct, unique viewpoint of the environment and events in Warsaw during the war, with great pictoral effect as well as accuracy. From an historical standpoint the film is right on the money, and doesn't sacrifice anything. The acting is also superb, particularly with Adrien Brody as Szpielman.

Truly a great film and an amazing story. Highly recommended.
