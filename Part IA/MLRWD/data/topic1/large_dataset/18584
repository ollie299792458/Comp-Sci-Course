Despite the negative reviews I have read on this blog, I & my companions found this a solid little movie. From my observations, the thing most people want when going to this type of movie is for there to emerge a hero (however unlikely at the start)& for that person or group to find some magic way to save earth.

In this movie, the aliens win & even though there is some vestige of the original human left in one of the aliens, it may or may not be enough to withstand the totality of the alien invasion. The ending is very different & does make sense if you do not look at it from a standard perspective.

The action is somewhat claustrophobic as it takes place in one main building---but if this were a real attack, chances are that is exactly what would happen. If an alien life form is smart enough to devise a way to come to our planet bent on destruction, I doubt we (earth) has any way to counteract them or give them chase over an  entire city.

As for the acting...first of all ,even the so called better known names have very few original acting expressions--part of why people go to watch them is simply that they like them & these people are playing heroic parts....the way we would all like to see ourselves when faced with an alien invasion. I found the acting in this film believable---ordinary people caught in a surrealistic situation--panic, little logic, downright terror. That's how many would deal with this. Why do people always feel that bigger names would be so much better...they bring their own baggage to any movie--& without the right director & script --not in a good way.

The movie overall is a fun diversion for a snowy day.
