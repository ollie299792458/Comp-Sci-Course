If you're willing to read subtitles this is an excellent foreign film, set in Taiwan, about the importance of and the tight connection between a person's individual identity and his/her family life in Chinese society and culture.  The work lives, interpersonal lives, and spiritual lives of four main characters are explored and interwoven, with the Sunday dinner table being the terminus at which they all meet and from which we switch characters and depart on the continuing exploration of each person's life.  Each of the main character's lives would be interesting enough for its own full-length movie; so together they keep you thinking and interested from opening to closing credits.  In this masterful cultural portrait of the balanced interplay between life and death, work and love, family and self, food and deprivation, Ang Lee allows us to see and experience the intimate details of a major world culture, which is vastly different from our own in the western world.  The popular theme of traditional Chinese culture being impacted by modern life is addressed in a more realistic, less overdone, manner than in many movies, and the multi-generational presentation of interwoven lives makes it more easily understandable and complete.  This is a movie that will leave you with a warm smile of satisfaction and deeper understanding of what it is to be a person on this planet.
