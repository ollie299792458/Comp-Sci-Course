I'm a major sci fi / fantasy fan.  I've seen and watched them all.  Star Trek, Stargate, Babylon 5, X-Files, etc.  Well, I finally reached the point where i ran out of science fiction to watch on tv.  So i've been scrounging around the bottom like Farscape and Stargate Atlantis.  Surprisingly, this first season is actually watchable.  The dialog is actually decent and not overly fluffy or wise crackish like Farscape.

For a character based sci fi series, you must have good characters.  Andromeda pulls this off pretty well. You got the super good guy Dylan Hunt and his hodge podge crew members.

Tyr Anasazi is just amazingly cool.  His acting is decent at best I suppose but he just pulls off his image so well.  The way he talks is just awesome.  Seriously, you can tell Ronin Dex from Atlantis is blatantly ripped off from Tyr down to the dreadlocks.  Trance is pretty damn cute I have to admit.  Seamus is probably my least favorite character due to his sense of humor.  Almost all the characters are pretty decent though...!

The stories aren't really anything new but most of them do not fail to entertain.  Of course you'll have some duds but right now they're in the minority.  Keep watching and i'm sure they'll increase though.

A few negatives are the atrocious special effects.  Seriously, I do not remember 2001 having such poor computer effects.  They're pretty bad but watchabe I suppose.

All in all, worth watching.  Just don't expect Star Trek: TNG or Babylon 5 quality...  I still think this show is better than Farscape - which is a cult classic.  Less wise cracks!
