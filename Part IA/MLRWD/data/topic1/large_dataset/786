Back in the good old days (well, the 70's and 80's for me) there were a flush of brilliant and genuinly scary made for TV (esp.British TV) ghost/horror films. Many of these were the legendary Ghost Story For Christmas short films, based on the tales of M R James. There was The Signalman, based on the Dickens short story and Whistle And I'll Come To You made for BBC2's Arena. And there were sadly now almost forgotten  classic TV movies such as Dark Night Of The Scarecrow and Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark.
At Christmas 1989, the BBC showed this, The Woman In Black, as their ghostly Yuletide offering. I did not see it at the time. I was informed of it some years later by my best friend at school. He told me how he had seen it on its initial broadcast and had gone to bed on Christmas Eve in tears. How I wanted to see this film. A year later it was rescreened by the BBC on Christmas Eve. I sat up and watched it myself. Turned the lights out. Pulled the armchair up in front of the TV and settled down. It was a nightmarish viewing experience. I was not disapointed. This was, and is still, the most terrifying film I have seen. I was told that the London stage show was scarier. I went to see it. Balderdash! It was a good play but not scary in the least. The only frights came from sudden bursts of ear piercing high pitched screams which made the audience jump out of their seats. That isn't "frightening". Anyone can creep up behind someone and shout "BOO" and give them a moments fright. But The Woman In Black TV movie instills the heart with dread. Horrifying. I would recommend that readers check out The Signalman and A Warning To The Curious both recently released by the BFI. Both are classics.
