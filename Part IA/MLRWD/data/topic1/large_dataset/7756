As a kid, the Batman movie and TV series captivated me as it all seemed so high tech and real.  Watching this movie as an adult gives a new perspective and appreciation.  I find myself laughing at things I didn't as a kid, either because the actors were trying to make you laugh, or because it is so campy and silly.  This is a nostalgic trip back to the 60's when Batman wasn't "dark" like it is in the current movie series.

Picture quality was excellent for a movie of this age on blu ray.  It won't stand up to the latest films in PQ, but for what it is, I was surprised and satisfied.

I think the original movie's soundtrack was mono and they have done a good job of making improvements to it, but it's difficult at best to make a real surround track from a mono source.  It's an improvement over mono, but it's not on par with picture quality.

They've done a great job "modernizing" this film for blu ray.  The bonus features are great and there is an interactive "tour" of the Batmobile that's slick.

Because I grew up with Adam West as Batman, he'll always be Batman to me.  If you remember the movie and series fondly from your youth, then you should add this title to your blu ray collection.
