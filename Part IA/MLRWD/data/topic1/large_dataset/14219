I loved George, I still do. He was highly intelligent, highly spiritual and was NOT interested in commercial pop music charts. He hated touring. He hated the media. He had a wicked sense of humor. With that said,. I watched this entire documentary and keep thinking "where is the candid interviews with stories we have NOT heard?" "Where is the rare video footage  we have NOT all seen? For the most part this has concert and video clips we have ALL seen. That is fairly inexcusable. The rest of the JAPAN  video concert exists  --put a song or two in. There is video from the 1974 tour ..(we got one song here). There is MORE rare Wilbury's rehearsal footage (OK not the greatest quality..still very rare and would have been welcomed). So I felt theis was lacking in having any truly rare video.

As to the interviews --McCartney refused to speak candidly. It is very obvious he was NOT interested in revelaing ANYTHING. He hardly spoke . A few clips. Not much and when pressed about "drugs and women": he refused to even answer. It is Scorces's JOB to get that rare bit of information or story on George we do not already know. How about an interview with his close friends DYLAN (LOL yeah now I am PUSGHING it--I know). I felt it was a GOOD documentary, certainly not 5 stars.
