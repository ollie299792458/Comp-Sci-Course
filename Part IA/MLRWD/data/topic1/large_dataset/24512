this was an amazingly shoot and well lite film the lighting fitted the story line beautifully and even though the story line etched at bits the acting was well done, and you could not work the killer out as every possible nightmare that was shown from the actress indicated someone else, so for some one to say that the killer was obvious is rubbish. the killer didn't really have motive but i have a feeling the well played music through out indicated that he didn't like people who were skilled and talented and didn't try there best or were better than him I'm guessing it was to do with talent but that doesn't really need to be explained as in all fairness i think if u actually watch the movie its the music that interprets why. beautifully composed music as well and not modern day pop punk rock ska metal or anything which would ruin the movie and ud also lose a sense as to what its about. I'm not a Lindsay lohan fan but for this movie to flop is a shame as it was a well chosen cast and this film let lindsay show some more real and raws emotions this is far better than any of her other movies as she actually shows a well acted actress using her talents at her possible best specially the torture scenes they genuinely look real and well played you do in fact get a sense of fear and sympathy for the Aubrey character. the only scene i have doubts in were the whole stigmata story line it needed to explain that a bit more to fully understand why as not everyone understands about stigmata or twin connections but overall this movie is a 9/10. far better than anything i have seen miss lohan in and her best role to date also, if she were to do more of this styled work not aimed for 10 year olds i think she could make a name and be taken as a far more serious actress. see the movie your self and judge it by what you see and not what you've heard about it.
