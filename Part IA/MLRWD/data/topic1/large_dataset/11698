While there is much to praise in the more recent A&E version of 'Pride and Prejudice', this earlier filming with Elizabeth Garvey and David Rintoul has always seemed to us to be the best dramatization of the story. It is far truer to the book and the period than the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle series: Fay Weldon's script is almost unadulterated Austen, with very few alterations (apart from necessary cuts of course) or additions. Elizabeth Garvey is, for me, the quintessential Lizzie, with a fine voice and bearing, a delightfully satirical eye, and an ability to convey deep feeling with little more than the raising of an eyebrow or a tightening of the lips. David Rintoul makes Lizzie's detestation of Darcey early on perfectly understandable, and then allows the character to warm and to win not only Lizzie but the audience as well. The sisters are all excellent, and Mr and Mrs Bennett (Moray Watson and Priscilla Morgan) are superb. Judy Parfitt as Lady Catherine is peerless, and in fact there is no cause for any objection from even the most resolute Austenian. I recommend this version as the definitive one.
