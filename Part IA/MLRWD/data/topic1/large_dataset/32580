It has been a long, long time since I've seen a movie that truly engaged me from beginning to end, leaving me very glad I watched it.  Mrs. Henderson Presents is that movie.  I love Judi Dench, so that was really my biggest reason for renting this to begin with.  I thought she was funny, honest, and very entertaining.  The storyline is very simple: she's a widow, buys a theater because she won't do "typical widow things" like needlepointing, and then offers musicals where some of the girls are naked.  It was done respectfully, artistically, and believably.
  Something that jumped out at me was that there wasn't a terrible villian of any sort.  Sure, there were problems with people and so on, and the bickering between her character and Bob Hoskins was hilarious, but there wasn't some evil force out to destroy anybody.  It shows a lot, in my opinion, when you can have an entire film without a villian.
  I won't ruin it, but her speech at the end of the movie, to all of the soldiers, was moving.  It didn't make me cry, but it seemed so honest and effortless, as if Judi Dench was really saying it and not a character she was playing.  Also, there was just the right amount of joking at the end that had me go from serious to laughing in about five seconds.
  The rest of the cast was wonderful.  Bob Hoskins and all of the ladies at the Windmill...I can't say enough about how great this film was.  I will always love Judi Dench best in her Oscar-winning role as Queen Elizabeth in Shakespeare in Love, but this role was made for her; she's just the right amount of sophistication and realism to play an upper crust English woman in the 1930's...she's amazing.
