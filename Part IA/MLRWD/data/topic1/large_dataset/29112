I have a huge devotion to St. Rita ever since a priest from my parish gave me the book to read I instantly made her my patron Sait. Although the movie is not in line with the book it depicts a Saint Rita that has the same wants and desires that any young woman today wants. This movie opened my eyes to even through dificulty we can all prevail in following Gods will. She had her moment of dispair, but through Gods Grace she came out of it. The book talked more of how pious she was and did not give much detail of her struggles. The book did make it clear that she struggled but left it at that. This movie depicted how her struggle could have looked like. All around the movie depicted her virtues very well, it did not focus on her desire to become a nun early on in her life. It took a real life scenario that most of us face now. I recomend this movie. Don't take it as an actual account of her life there is so much information out there it would be dificult. This is a possible outlook of what her life could have been like, or at least the pain she went through. One thing I had a hard time understanding in the book is why she would have been denied entrance to the convent three times! She had been such a great example through out her whole town. The way this movie depicted her denial to become a nun made sence to me. Hope you enjoy.
