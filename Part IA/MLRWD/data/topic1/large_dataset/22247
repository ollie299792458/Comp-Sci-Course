A Canterbury Tale defies categorization. Is it a comedy about an American in rural England? Is it a noir mystery about a guy who assaults women? Is it a romantic comedy, or a comedy of manners, or a spiritual odyssey? Is it a "why we fight" British WW2 propaganda film?

Yes. It's all these things and more.

The film tells the story of three modern pilgrims in a fictional town near Canterbury. Two of them are on their way to the ancient pilgrimage site, and the third will discover soon that he is destined to make the trip as well. They're brought together by a late-night attack of the "Glue Man", an unknown assailant who assaults young women by throwing glue in their hair and then running off. (think about how putting glue on the hair of pretty young women symbolizes a sexual assault) They decide to solve the mystery of the Glue Man's identity before continuing their voyage to the Cathedral. And in the end, they discover that modern pilgrims may receive a blessing, too.

Because Powell and Pressburger are playing with genre in the early parts of the film, you almost have to watch it twice to really absorb it. The characters and the beautiful rural vistas need time to grow on you. It's not a slow film, but it is a slow build. It all comes together in the end, and it's magical.

Several times in the movie, characters discuss the difference between film and life. Movies are seen as a kind of inferior art form. Powell & Pressburger challenge that attitude. They want to suggest the image of film as cathedral, as gateway to the sacred. Movies can be more, they promise, and they never looked back for the rest of their collaborations. It starts here. . .
