I was lucky enough to have experienced this film in the movie theater when it was first released in the 80's. Back then I didn't know anything about a European version or cut scenes, I simply enjoyed it for what it was, a great fantasy film. I recall seeing it several times and discovering something new each time, it's just one of those movies you never get tired of seeing because the visuals are so stunning. The plot is quite simple, and let's face it, a bit cliched, with the whole "good vs evil" and the stealing (and search) of the magic unicorn horn.

The standout here is the art direction, the movie was entirely filmed on a movie set, yet it doesn't feel like it, the forest really looks like a forest and the demon Darkness' lair feels vast and cavernous. The design for the demon Darkness is one of the all time best make up jobs in cinema history. Even though there is nothing left of actor Tim Curry's face or body he manages to infuse his character with a great deal of expression and personality. The design for the goblin Blix doesn't fare as well because it does look like a rubber mask with little expression other than a scowl. Tom Cruise in one of his early roles offers a rather hammy performance but maybe that's what the character called for. A very young Mia Sara looks like she was born to play the role of a princess because she's just so stunningly beautiful. Her scenes with the demon Darkness are a highlight of this film.

This 2 disc edition really surpasses the previous 1 disc edition by far. For starters, you get the European cut with the Goldsmith score and the US version with the very different Tangerine Dream score. My favorite among the many extars included is the video for Bryan Ferry's song Is Your Love Strong Enough, a great song and a great video. Very reccomended.
