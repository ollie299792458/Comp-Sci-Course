I bought this DVD for my 2-year-old daughter but found myself lost in nostalgic memories of my own childhood, when I watched these as individual tales.  The charming stories of friendship between very different creatures are entertaining, and also nice springboards for discussions with little ones. It's remarkably quiet and old-fashioned compared to many of today's options for children, which I love!  It's pleasant background noise while I get a few things done, but also a DVD I will just as often will sit and watch with my child.
The video itself is the most enjoyable item on the DVD.  The "A Day for Eeyore" is not the "classic" it claims to be, poorly drawn and with a voice-over for Pooh not even reminiscent of the original. The sing-a-long and game are favorites of my daughter as well.
The songs are classics you will be surprised you can sing with.  Be ready to "fast-forward" through the "Heffalumps and Woozles"  if your children are very small.
