I've read the other reviews, a lot of them are calling this film boring. I didn't think it was boring for one second. It was very interesting. I was not even born when this film came out, but I read all the hype about it being the most horrifying film ever made... It definetly was not that. However, it did have it's moments, such as when the woman's tongue was ripped out by the roots. I bought this film because I really like Udo Kier, and he looks really hot in this movie (besides the outfit and hair) that could be why I liked the movie so much actually. The dubbing of the actor's voices is REALLY bad, especially of the children, you can tell it is adult's voices trying to speak in little voices...I wanted to hear Udo's voice, he has a German accent, but they dubbed over that too...But it really was entertaining, and the fact that people used to burn "witches" and this could be close to a true story back in those days makes it even more interesting to me. I am SO glad this doesn't happen now, I would be horrified of being accused of being a witch. I would recommend this movie to anyone that can handle watching torture scenes, and likes horror films.
