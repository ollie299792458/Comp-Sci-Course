I honestly can't speak for the sequels that came after this film, but I can only imagine they don't hold a candle.  FIRST BLOOD is a great story, told incredibly well.  Once this film gets kick started around 10 minutes in, it doesn't let you go.  By far one of Stallone's best performances, on par with his role in COPLAND, not to mention Rocky.

As an action film it's great, as a comment on the times and the stigma attached to Vietnam vets returning from the war, even better.

I didn't watch this film for years just because I assumed it wasn't worth the time.  Once a very good friend of mine forced me to sit down and watch, I couldn't believe I hadn't seen it years prior.

Even if you don't care for Stallone that much, you might reconsider checking him out in this one.  I'm not saying he'll change your mind about a career worth of so-so films, but he might just win you over for life on this film alone.

Now that I've lambasted Sly's career of movie choices, I must back track and say, even though they aren't brilliant on a "good" level the follow are brilliant on a "so-bag-it's-good" level:  COBRA, ROCKY III, and OVER THE TOP.  There are certainly more to choose from, but I rank those as pretty high.

Regardless, FIRST BLOOD is a winner on many levels and shouldn't be dismissed or missed.
