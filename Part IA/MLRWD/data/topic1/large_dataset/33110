This classic London gangland flick was shot in the late '70's and is none the worse for it. Bob Hoskins leads in a role that launched his career (alongside pennies from Heaven -BBC serial) with Helen Mirren shining as his 'Moll' with the smarts. Supporting roles from a cast of very capable British actors help in making the film a top notch production. The film works well, as the protagonist Hoskins try's to piece together what is happening as his world is attacked. Given the films structure the viewer is in the same riole as Hoskins, piecing together information to make sense of events and uncover who is creating merry hell. Without giving away the plot, the involvement of the IRA adds a dimension that lifts the story to a different level from a straight gangster flick. The script is well written and Pacey resulting in a film that bears repeated viewing, indeed a replay helps piece together elements missed previously. I first watched the film over 20 years ago (scary!) and enjoyed it as much now as i did then.
