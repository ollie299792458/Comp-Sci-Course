Ever since seeing him accept the Tony for his adaptation of "La Cage" I have had a tremendous admiration for the sheer creative genius of Harvey Fierstein.  But "Torch song Trilogy" has got to be the icing on the cake; the cream on the top of Mt. Everest; the spark that set off Guy Fawlks Day on the 5th of November in London!

And as if the tale wasn't enough, that fantastic narration by Mr. Fierstein at the end of the film was just by far and away the best "special feature" I have ever had the pleasure of hearing!  (Normally I avoid listening to a narrative over a movie I have only just watched!!)

And although I think the late and great Anne Bankroft was superb as the mother, I confess I would like to have seen Estelle Getty in the performance extolled by the author.

As a totally "square" viewer of this performance, I would hazzard a guess that in another 50 years or so "Torch Song" will have reached the level of film classics.  The death scene of Matthew Broderick in the story was simply devastating!

For sheer entertainment and creative competence, my vote would have to go to Mr. Fierstein.
