This was a well put together micro-budget, indie film. I thought that overall the film making was a step above the writing. The story was a little weak in parts and the ending was a little more bland than I had hoped. There will be obvious comparisons to Zombieland and The Road. I think it is a good mixture of the two, which again is saying allot for an indie. I thought the acting was excellent overall. Nick Damici, Kelly McGillis, and Michael Cerveris were all strong, but I thought the part of Martin was portrayed as a little too naive and innocent for a modern day teenager. The real story here for me was the gritty and dark environments, along with the awesome vampire makeup and effects. I've seen much higher budget movies that don't come off this good. If you are a horror fan, then run out and buy this! It is worth seeing, if not just for the opening scene in the barn with the baby. The Blu-ray has some really good behind the scenes stuff, and the overall picture quality was excellent.
