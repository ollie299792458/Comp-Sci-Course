I never really write reviews for products that I purchase but I felt that I needed to for this one in case anyone encounters the same problems that I did.

First off, let me say that this is a GREAT movie, especially around the holidays (it is a Thanksgiving tradition in my family). It is fun for all ages and this restored version is a HUGE step up from my previous copy which was a very poor quality VHS. I can see what some of the other reviewers are complaining about regarding the lighting and I'm not sure why it wasn't fixed, but overall I still think that this Blu-ray version is a huge step up from previous versions.

So imagine how upset I am when I stick the Blu-ray disc in my player and it doesn't work. The menu loads (slowly), the music plays, but there is no selection animation on the menu and whenever I try to press any of the buttons it freezes and I have to restart the player - rendering the movie completely unplayable. I was ready to send it back (and was quite upset, too, as I was hoping to watch it tomorrow on Thanksgiving) BUT I decided to do a quick firmware update for my Blu-ray player (an LG BD550 in case you are interested) and was surprised to see that it worked! Now, I'm not enough of an electronics expert to tell you WHY it worked, but I will tell you that from what I understand there have been others who have had the same or similar problems playing their disc that were resolved after a quick firmware update. So my advice is this... before you play the movie take a few minutes and update your player. It's usually very simple to do and can save you a lot of trouble!
