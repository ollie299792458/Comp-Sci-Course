This movie, a TV-remake of a B movie, is pathetic.  The underlying concept of a child star being eclipsed by her sister in adulthood is something worth fleshing out.  Stunning successes in childhood followed by a dramatic fall from grace in adulthood is hard to come to terms with.  Jane's basic resentment is understandable, but the movie -- particularly Lynn Redgrave's ridiculous portrayal of a woman that would have been institutionalized and not around to torment her sister makes it embarrassing to watch.  Still, Vanessa Redgrave's portrayal of resignation and desparation -- and forgiveness -- is wonderfully performed.  She is reduced, for much of the movie, to expressing herself through her eyes.  Those incredibly expressive eyes bring to mind her role in "Wetherby."

Although Vanessa Redgrave's character, Blanche, has a British accent (she sounds like Vanessa Redgrave), Lynn Redgrave's character, Jane, has an attempt at an American accent that is hilariously awful.  She moves across several states within one sentence, exaggerating her "r"s, particularly.  This discrepancy is doubly puzzling given that both the characters and the Redgraves are sisters.

The Redgraves and their characters' relationship give this movie tremendous potential, but it is horribly executed.  Only Vanessa Redgrave is saved here.  She did a great job with what and whom she had to work with.
