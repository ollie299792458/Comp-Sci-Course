No wiseguys, no casinos, no boxers, no taxi drivers...but yet it is still New York, this is still a film of man's cruelty to another, and this is still a film by Martin Scorsese.
Villians come in the most beguiling of forms, and in this beautiful film filled with beautiful sets and Oscar-winning costumes, the sinfully innocent face of Winona Ryder is the face of doom for would-be lovers Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pffeifer.  What, no Joe Pesci?  No Harvey Keitel?  Where's Robert De Niro, and more importantly, where are the guns?
Winona Ryder doesn't need any of those usual Scorsese suspects or an automatic to inflict pain, which perhaps makes her the most sinister of all the director's goodfellas.  If you have rebuffed Ryder as just a grown up teen actor, you have obviously never seen this film.  In her Oscar nominated turn, Ryder walks the razor's edge of duality, and you're never quite aware of it until the end.  Clever girl, eh?  My favorite moment?  When she informs husband Day-Lewis about her thoughts on him going on a trip:  "I'm afraid you can't do that, dear," comes the reply with the most lovely smile.
Don't dismiss this film as a love triangle story.  This is just as gritty as any of Martin's films, just with plenty of froufrou (and very well done froufrou at that) to cover it up...isn't that what Victorianism was all about--the Guilded Age?
See it and be astonished!
