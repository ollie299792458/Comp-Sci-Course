First of all let me begin by saying that if I were a fan of Comedies I would have given this a four, but comedies because of their lack of realism are not my forte.

That being said, after viewing the average that this movie has (on Amazon) I was afraid to watch. I watched it however, because the cast seemed stellar enough.

After having watched the film I can honestly say that it was ammusing. There were parts that were meant to be funny and didn't do the trick and the unrealism found in most comedies was rampant but it was done in a very silly manner and the writing was sharp- atleast the way dialoque was used in order to get a smile (sorry not big on comedies) out of people. The acting was also quite good and some of the characters are flatline enough to be believable.

However, I don't think that this film is appropriate for a 13 year old. It is rated PG13 but I wouldn't show it to anyone under 15 and I think it would actually be appropriate for 16+. Some of the jokes have a tad too much perversion and I think that it will take an older crowd to understand them and more importantly understand the gist of it which is to ammuse and possibly shock but not to represent anything in particular.

All in all I would say that it was an hour in a half well spent.

Also, after reading some of the reviews it seems that most people are not impressed by it because of what they expect from Mike Myers. I honestly, don't expect anything in particular from him as I don't, as already mentioned, really have an interest in comedy or comedians. All I can say is that I would spend the time and the couple of dollars to watch a movie like this again. I think it was good work.
