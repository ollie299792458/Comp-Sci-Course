I recently purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIXLUW">Humphrey Bogart - The Signature Collection, Vol. 1 (Casablanca Two-Disc Special Edition / The Treasure of the Sierra Madre Two-Disc Special Edition / They Drive by Night / High Sierra)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIXLVQ">Humphrey Bogart - The Signature Collection, Vol. 2 (The Maltese Falcon Three-Disc Special Edition / Across the Pacific / Action in the North Atlantic / All Through the Night / Passage to Marseille)</a> and the Bogart and Bacall Signature Collection<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFL2Q6">Bogie and Bacall - The Signature Collection (The Big Sleep / Dark Passage / Key Largo / To Have and Have Not)</a>. I have a DVD collection of well over 1000 films. I can honestly state that these DVDs are not "among" the best I have. They Are The Best!!! Evey single one of these films are genuine classics. I feel that Humphrey Bogart is the best actor "ever" in American film. If he was cast in a film that didn't have a really strong cast around him he would simply carry the production on his strong shoulders. He would become whatever character he was supposed to be. Also, I must commend Warner Bros. DVD( or whoever did it) on the remastering of all the films in the collections. They did what is simply the best job of remastering a film that has has ever been performed. And the bonus features! Thay are all just wonderful. I can't give any more platitudes without repeating myself. If you are any kind of a Bogie fan, you must get these collections. You will not regret it for one second. Not one! Do yourself a favor and purchase all of them. They are the "Best!" Papa Larry H.
