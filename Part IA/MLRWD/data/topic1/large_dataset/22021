Doris Day is an American original; talented so far beyond today's stars it almost embarasses me to younger than her generation. This movie is a perfect illustration of all that Hollywood once was and could be with  people like Day on the scene.
Calamity is western girl raised all her  life as a boy. She takes great pride in her abilities to ride, shoot, and  wrangle with the best of men. Chief among those men is a relatively well  mannered "Wild Bill Hickock" who Calamity pals and wrestles with  like any couple of guys would.
But the appearance of a pretty and  feminine actress in town causes Calamity Jane to wrestle with a greater  force, her womanhood. Eventually, faced with her true natural yearnings,  Calamity puts her boyish facade away for good.
The movie is charming,  funny, delightful... a movie (rare these days) that can be enjoyed by all  family members. The songs are excellent and show us why Howard Keel and  Doris Day were two of the most talented and respected singers in show  business history. Day's awesome yet relatively gruff voice through out the  picture is replaced by a sweet melodic Doris in her of singing 'Secret  Love', the movie's musical climax.
This is a highly recommended picture  that can and will be watched over and over and over again.
