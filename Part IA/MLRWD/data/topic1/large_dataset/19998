This movie is a riot, I highly recommend it.

There are lots of funny scenes and great dialogue.  The film has really bizarre characters, which will appeal to and hold the attention of your most finicky movie watchers.  I think there are very few people who won't like this.  The over analyzing and sensitive types might not connect to the characters in the beginning of the film, or even feel concerned they're watching a disturbing movie.  By half way through, even they'll be on board, as the film has a great message and the "sinister" characters are beyond lovable, they're irresistible.

This is great for the whole family.  Of course really young viewers may need a hand held in a few parts.  With the luxury of the home theater, you could pause it, and let the youngsters have a break or something explained.  I would say most 5+, will really enjoy this, and not find it unsettling.  There's enough explosions and kiddie style drama to entertain the middle school brother as well.

So great to find a film that is entertaining for young and old alike, and leaves the audience with a good feeling.  Far too rare, as too many feel good movies leave you bored or with a sickly sweet feeling.  This movie does neither, you feel good because it was a well made movie with a great story line, original, funny, and has a great message.

I hope other film makers really watch this film, and take the hint... this is the style of movie people give 5 stars to.  This is what audiences like.  Now make more, duh!
