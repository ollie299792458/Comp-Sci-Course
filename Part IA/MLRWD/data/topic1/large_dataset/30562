I defy you to watch this and not have shivers run down your spine.  It strikes the perfect balance of letting you know what was going on in the world at that time and what was going on at a small rink in Lake Placid, NY.

In my opinion what really 'makes' the video is the fact that it includes interviews with some of the Russian players.  Getting their insights and what their team psyche was throughout that game and the Games themselves was fascinating to me.

I remember hearing that the U.S.A. had pulled the upset just minutes before taking the floor for a high school basketball game and having goosebumps during pre-game drills just thinking about it.  Anything seemed possible that night.  Even though I could barely touch the rim, I decided to try and dunk on a breakaway.  I took off and half way up I realized it was true--I could barely touch the rim.  I came down in a heap, felt the ball hit my head and then watched as it slowly rolled out of bounds.  Coach took me out immediately and I never saw the light of the game again.  Do I believe in miracles???  Sometimes.
