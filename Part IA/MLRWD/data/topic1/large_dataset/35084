I was expecting more on the passion, fire, and actual art of drum solo dancing. Instead, there were mostly basic movements and little of the true technique one would associate with this climactic portion of a dancer's routine. Some of the steps were well executed like the pelvic lock and the choo-choo. Others had me sadly disappointed that people will buy this and think the hip drop or head circle were lazily executed or expressionless as these. Ignore the advice and demonstration of a hip drop being "...like sitting in a chair". It is sharper, like hammering a nail or striking a match! If you think it's like sitting in a chair, then just sit down and stop dancing altogether. I won't even get into how poorly isolated the movements were. Sonia may eventually be good with time, experience, and a willingness to be expressive, but she dances like an intermediate student. Where were the exciting travel steps or emotions a drum solo needs? Merely glancing at the drummer or the hips is not "connecting" with the drummer, audience, or oneself that this dance is known for. I have seen kindergarteners do the Hokey Pokey (and shake it all around) with MUCH more fire! Amar Gamal or Tamalyn Dallal should have been chosen of the "Superstars" to teach this video, which is sad proof that we are still fixated on youth, color, or politics to get to the top. Bellydancing takes more than cute costumes or moguls to be truly artistic. See Raqia Hassan, Deana, or Issam on this video for true form, artistry, and the beauty of this dance and its music. The free cd and the tiny clips of these real artists make this not a total waste of money.
