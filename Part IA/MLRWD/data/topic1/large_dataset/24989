If the second half of this movie had been able to duplicate the action and fun of the first 45 minutes of this movie, it would be one of the greatest action films ever made.
But, well, they didn't.
The movie starts out going full speed (literally) while introducing you to Jason Statham's character--a detail-obsessed courier who delivers packages for bad guys. His reputation is built on his 3 guiding principles: Do not renegotiate/change the deal; no names; and don't look in the package. Of course, he winds up breaking his own rules which puts him and the human "package" in mortal danger.
Fighting his own instincts, he gets involved with trying to help the woman. The movie gets sort of predictable from this point on, with the standard love scene/kidnapping/show down with the main enemy.
What saves this movie is Jason Statham, and the lack of cheesy one-liners. Jason's moves are extremely good, and there are some scenes when he looks almost Jackie Chan-like (almost).
Overall, it's much better than average, but not without its flaws. One last thing--the techno sound pulsing through the movie is not the U.S. soundtrack for the movie. If you want the music from the movie, you have to go to www.Amazon.com's UK site.
