I have seen this movie four or five times, and each time I see it the baseball parts get better, but the rest of the story gets worse.  The baseball parts in this movie may have been some of the best baseball scenes I have ever seen. The storyline of his career is perfect, and the score really tops it of very well. Costner, or Billy Chapel in the movie, comes off as a very likeable character on the team; you see him interact with teamates current or past and you see him as a very sentimental leader. The Chapel of the personal life is not so likeable. He is grouchy and not a very understanding guy; he does a lot of things that come off obnoxious. This is one of the reasons that the personal parts of his story are not so great when you watch them. But, they all fit together to make you feel for Billy Chapel at the end, which is one of the best endings of any sports movies ever. The flashback method works very well in this film. Overall, I have to recommend this movie, if not only for the baseball aspects.
