I understand that with a movie of this nature, where the good vs evil dynamic will come into question; as it converges upon those who must have faith regardless of which side they stand on, that the characters aren't going to be very developed and the story might have a few holes. The majority of them are expendable, hardly likable, easily will-broken or insane, etc... The ones that are more pivotal are still (unfortunately) not very likable. The location is depressing and desolate. I'm not exactly backing the baby will save the world scenario in this particular movie either. You wanna see it done better, see The Seventh Sign. The plot is simple: stay in the crappy, run down, diner until the baby is prematurely born while swarms of seemingly crazed, possessed people/creatures attempt to invade it, sky plunges into darkness, madness ensues, and oh we have an archangel armed to the teeth with automatic weapons who chopped his wings back in LA. Why didn't he just fall at the diner? Oh right, silly me, copious amounts of guns that do little to nothing to the hoards of things converging on the stronghold. People die along the way. There is plenty of useless dialogue that is used as an attempt to beguile you to the characters, but it doesn't.
