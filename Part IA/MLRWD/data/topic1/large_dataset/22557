Wow!  This was a most impressive film! People before me have written so eloquently about this film and I will not even try to attempt to try.  Read them to get a more in-depth summary of this film

I have mostly watched the American classics (silents through the 50's) and have recently expanded my movie universe to French/Japanese classics.  What an eye opening experience so far.

This movie is long but it didn't seem long at all. Great character development...incredible scenes.  The story was awesome and so moving.  I was literally stunned at the ending.  Such a non-Hollywood way of doing it.  This movie was so enchanting that I was so sad that the movie had to end.  THAT is a sign of a great movie or book.  Another trait is when you know you can't live without seeing/reading this movie/book again in your life.

This movie is best when it is in French with legible subtitles.  Criterion did a fine job and the commentary seemed really good from what little snatches I heard.  I really think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen...and I've seen a lot.

It might take a little while to warm up to this movie.  Have an open mind and you will be in for a treat as you approach the half hour mark!  Take a risk...buy it.  I really think you will love it!
