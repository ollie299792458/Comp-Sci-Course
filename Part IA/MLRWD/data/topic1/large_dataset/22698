I liked this movie very much. It was fascinating to watch the character development, especially Gary Spargo (Mathew Goode) as he manipulated Chris (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to gain his trust.  Both actors seemed to be at the top of their game.

My focus was primarily on Chris, though, because of his brain injury. His frontal lobes were injured in a car accident.  My mom has Frontal Lobe Dementia and their behaviors are very much alike.  I gained more understanding of her illness in several scenes.

People often tell me they don't see anything wrong with my mom, yet many characters seemed to recognize how odd Chris's behaviors was. In real life I would think it due to their respective ages. People seem to expect older people to be forgetful and will overlook lots of bizarre behavior because granny's getting a bit dotty.  Yet if a young man acted the same way, most people would know there's something wrong.  I realize it's a movie and scripted so others recognize Chris's problems.

This is a great vehicle to learn about FTD (Frontal Temporal Lobe Dementia.)
