Not as good as the first two in the series but it is just wonderful to watch. The casting is perfect! Loved the
actors who played Lucy, Edmund and King Caspian from the first two movies and loved the new character of Eustace.
I missed seeing all the Pevensie children---all the actors are just perfect for their parts and they just make the movies so
enjoyable.  I think all three movies have been so underated!!!! They have been overshadowed by all the Harry Potter films
and all the other stories that may contain more dark and dramatic effects!!!! But I think all three of these Narnia films
deserve much more attention that they get from the media. This film is alittle different than the first two----there are
some parts that are silly or not necessary to the film but all in all it is still an amazing story!!! I never had the
honor of reading the Narnia books so I have nothing to compare it to but from what reviews I've read people complain
about not being the same as the books! I don't think I've ever seen a movie made from a book that was exactly the same as
the book! Sometimes they are better than the book because you see it visually and not have the think about what it
would look like--like when your reading a book. I don't think they will be filming another one of the books---it's time has
ended and people want something more violent and dark---------these generations do not understand the messages in these books---and do not appreciate this kind of fantasy stories of Narnia. I love them!!!!!!
