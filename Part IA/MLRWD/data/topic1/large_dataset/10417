Since I was a kid I had heard about this famous movie. As a child and teenager it was sort of a forbidden fruit. Now I finally had time to rent it and see for myself " the passion, the romance...." etc. I would hardly call a several second embrace in the waves a towering romantic story.  The lines of the lovers are stilted and corny and I find it hard to believe the story of an affair that begins with only one pathetic glance.
Pruett was a man of morals. Of that there can be no doubt. If the movie was about anything, if was about standing up for what you believe is right. It was also a story about the abuse of power in the Army. Those were its strong points.
My curiousity is now satisfied. I suppose that for the 50's that scene in the surf might have been scandalous and that the conversation was a product of a stiffer form of society. Nevertheless, I rate it as just so so. Definitely not a romance by today's standards. The best scenes came at the end, when everyone rallied to the attack on Pearl Harbor.
