Other reviewers have done a fine job of describing the major plot points and the pros and cons of this film.  I myself had some trouble with it for the first 15 minutes, it seemed to ramble, but I stayed with it because I admire Spike Lee's work.  I was also mesmerized by Terence Blanchard's score.  And it proved to be worth the hang.  First consider that it was adapted from a pre-9/11 novel that is New York City to its core.  Then consider that it's set in a post-9/11 New York City. Finally, consider that Benioff took his original story and adapted it to post-9/11 and then look beneath the surface of the story for the real story that is actually being told from this framework.  (The song over the closing credits should make it clear to the viewer, if it wasn't already.)  Benioff has written some sequences that made me hold my breath - the man is one of the best writers and slam poets out there.  The cinematography is all New York, both gritty and gorgeous, light and more light, and the key characters are all well-defined.  Edward Norton gives an underrated award-winning performance, and Brian Cox's supporting work was just as good.  Then Spike Lee takes all of this, with his some very good editors, and makes this joint unforgettable.  In 25 years, this movie will be regarded as a 9/11-era classic, and one of the finest memorials to a wounded and healing city that any movie director could make.  And, yes, go back and look at the rambling beginning and some of the other slower-paced portions of the film on a second screening, as I did, and you, too, will probably understand that they are actually there for a very good reason.
I love Spike Lee's Joints, and this is my favorite so far.  Don't expect an escapist good time, this is a thinking film, but, if you're a movie buff like me, it will make you think and feel things about New York and 9/11 that you maybe didn't realize you thought or felt.  Highly recommended.  Thank you Spike!
