This just could be the worst batman movie to date, or the best depending all on the audience member who you are. On the bad side, it does not follow the dark near sadist comic version at all, if you are like me who like the first two films, and like the dark evil inner conflicton of love or hate between batman. the movie is not for you. On the other hand, if you were a somewhat fan of the television serious from the sixties, and loved the campiness, and adult oriented humour and like your batman playful and bright. the movie IS for you. George clooney handles a horrible script ok, an adam west of the times, actually the script was written by AKIVA GOLDSMAN yes that akiva goldsman, luckily he shaped up on writing. The film follows the exact same script as batman forever, and that doesn't make any sense. All the actors are horrible, the chemisrty between the villains is horrible, and the batmobile shockingly doesn't even remind me of batman, and Since when is batgirl related to alfred? This is just my review.
  bottom line, if you like the tv series see it.
if your like me and like a dark hardened batman avoid it at all costs.
