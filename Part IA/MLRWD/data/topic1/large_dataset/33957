Lou Diamond Phillips plays the legendary 1950s rock and roll pioneer Ritchie Valens in this musical biopic.  Lou Diamond Phillips gives a wonderful performance of a the singer who turned a new generation onto the influential Chicano rock music that inspired other Tex-Mex rock artists such as Los Lobos who preformed the title song, Santana, Los Lonely Boys and countless others.  He was successful at a time when there were very few Latinos in the American Rock/Pop scene...  He is considered the first Latino ever to successfully crossover into Rock mainstream.

Ritchies' musical talents were encouraged by his mother and brother, although his brother would become envious and jealous as he rose to fame.  Rosana De Soto plays his loving mother who is supportive of her sons' musical aspirations.  His older brother, Bob was a malicious ex-con, who loved his brother but he was jealous of the attention his mother gave to him.  Esai Morales gives a very good performance as his unhappy, alcoholic brother who grows extremely bitter as Ritchie rises to stardom.

The soundtrack also includes songs sung by Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, and Jackie Wilson.  If you enjoy late 50's movies, you will like this movie that is suitable for the entire family.  I'd like to see a remake where they include a music CD of all the songs he made popular during his short eight-month career.
