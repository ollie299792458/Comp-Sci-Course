I was never that big of a Beatles fan, chalk that up to timing and/or whatever, I appreciate their music and vast contributions to society........but that left me in the category of never having seen "Yellow Submarine" in my youth.  The review, however, of the DVD in the last issue of Film Comment made me take note and a chance on it.  Boy am I happy that I did, not only is it one of the most truly creative and inspiring animation films of all time but an absolutely terrific film to share with the family, in my case wife and five year old son.  Kids are already familiar with the submarine, blue meanies and oddly enough all of the beatles due to books that now circulate in pre-school, my son knew more going into it than I ever did!  And that's a real joy, we all watched the first time in awe and as of now, it's a DVD that has circulated on our screen multiple times without ever losing that magic.  The remastered release also comes with some nifty fan stuff in the DVD package, nothing that I'm apt to hold too sacred but great additions nevertheless.
