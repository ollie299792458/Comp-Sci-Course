Bad, bad movie. I give it an extra star for some wonderful stylistic touches by Fincher (the old home movie with the piano music in the beginning is absolutely wonderful), but the further into the movie you get,  the worse it is. What begins as a stylish and interesting film degenerates  into a lackluster adventure/mystery, with the entrance of Debra Unger's  character marking a turn for the worse. The dialogue suddenly becomes  trite, and the actions of the characters no longer seem believable, even in  the suspended context of the film's own reality. The stylistic moments  begin to seem out of place. And THEN, in the last half-hour ... lord ...  rarely have I seen such incompetant film-making. There are a lot of  "surprising revelations," but most of them are not so much  surprising as they are forced-feeling, over-the-top, and just generally not  very clever. And the ending is absolutely God Awful. Unquestionably the  dumbest "climax" to a film I have ever seen. Aside from the fact  that you could poke about 2 billion holes in it, it's just aesthetically  stupid and dramatically unbelievable. David Fincher's worst film to date.
