Typically, I tend to not enjoy Spielberg movies as he often is so over the top with his sentimental messages that the heart of his film is marred unnecessarily.  That isn't the case with Munich, that is, until the end.  What makes the majority of this film work is Speilberg doing what he does best: telling a story.  It's a long movie but he presents it in a lean manner, seemingly trimming off the fat and allowing us to easily follow his lead.  Eric Bana is fine as the lead who shows us a character who is as straight forward with his killing as he is with his love for his family; he portrays his role with a great dichotomy in his performance.
But, as others have mentioned, the end trails off into that recognizable Spielbergian prose and the depth of what preceeds it is compromised.  Showing the twin towers in the background as Bana and Geoffrey Rush discuss the killings is more distracting than thought provoking.  It doesn't make sense to accost the viewer with two separate stories. I understand the point he is making about terrorism but when you do such a great job of telling a particular tale and then sidetrack into something else, it's hard not to feel a little duped and on the receiving end of some goofy and condescending lecture.  Spielberg should trust his audience and allow them to make this connection themselves instead of bashing them over the head with it.  This has always been Spielberg's downfall as a film maker and I hope he can tell a straight-forward story with no sentimental trajectory one day.  Also, the scene at the end with Bana making love to his wife is one of the most melodramatic and cheesy scenes I've seen in recent memory.  I won't go into detail about the scene but it's completely out of place and further derails what Spielberg took so long to cement.
Munich is certainly worth seeing and ranks among his finest films, just make sure you can stomach a disappointing and cliched ending.
