<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001N44BW0">Body of Lies (Full-Screen Edition)</a>  This is an unflinching look at the undercover work by Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the Middle East during the Iraq war.  Leo once again shows he is an incredible actor and one that seems to be overlooked.  Though the movie follows DiCaprio's character throughout the Middle East in search of a certain Al Qaeda leader which eventually leads to a violent meeting between the two in an "undisclosed" area there is also a side story for his character.  This side story involves a possible love interest and if he reeally wants to continue working for the CIA.
  The movie is slow moving at times but you're always watching the screen because of Leo.  You also get to see Russell Crowe shine once again, although his character may not be the most well-liked character as Leonardo's CIA boss.
  I recommend this movie.  It's not the typical Hollywood film that tends to become preachy.  As Russell Crowe's voice-over at the beginning of the film states, "The question of should we be there or not is irrelevant.  The fact is, we're there now and how do we get out?"  That's as preachy as the film gets.
