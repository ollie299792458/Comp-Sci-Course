This may be my favorite movie of all time.  OK, it's not perfect, but what is?  It's such a fascinating story.  The transfers look great on my 51" HDTV, and the sound is fine given the film's age.  Over the years, I have bought a CLV Criterion LD, another version on LD that is a terrible transfer, the standard DVD, and now the Blu-Ray.  I have one complaint.  I don't like any of Spielberg's cuts.  I believe this would be a better movie if EVERY scene was present except the entry into the ship, which is a meaningless light show and which Spielberg was forced to do against his better judgment.  Why not offer a version with all the cuts present and allow the owner to deselect the unwanted ones?  The CAV Criterion LD offered that feature a quarter-century ago but at a $130 premium.  The nature of the cuts is such that the movie should still flow well.  Hence, four stars instead of five.

Is there a fourth version of this film?  When I saw it at the theater in January 1978, I remember seeing the power plant AND the ship-in-the-desert scene AND the Wyoming scene with the future "Apollo Creed," which appear together in none of these versions.  When I bought the Criterion version, I remember being disappointed at not seeing them.  However, Spielberg insists he didn't film the ship-in-the-desert scene until later, so I suppose he knows his own history.

The extras disc is fascinating in that you see actors whose principle work fell to the cutting room floor.  You also get to witness some very bad movie making that fortunately never saw the light of day except here.  Yet, the cut scenes involving Roy in the field before his first contact, bad as they are, make his subsequent firing easier to understand.  Nothing in any version explains why the power company was so eager to fire him.

In any case, buy and enjoy.
