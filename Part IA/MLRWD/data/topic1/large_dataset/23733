Pay no heed to the heathens who would dare to say this series is anything but the best.  If you love anime, and you love beautifully done anime then this is definitely the series for you.
This series ranks right along with Tenchi Muyo as being a very creative, very well drawn and beautiful series.  It is also hilarious!  The jokes are great and timed perfectly.  Although I must caution that the content of the series is definitely of a PG-13 to R rating, don't buy this for your kids if you aren't cool with that.
The basic plot of this series (if you have never seen it before I am trying to write this so not too much of anything is given away) is a group of ordinary people from Shinanomi High School in Japan get transported to a far and distant world called El Hazard.  Upon arrival we find a young boy who gets thrust into the "hero" spot of the series, and his teacher, who is sort of a cross between comic relief, and a sidekick.  Then there is his rival, and evil bastard of a high school student who happens to hate the "hero," so he teams up with the Bugrum, a group of large humanoid bugs that can talk.  And we find a few more people get sucked into the world as well, as an added bonus they all get super powers upon entering the world.  The teacher becomes super fast and strong, and the evil bastard gets the power to communicate with the Bugrum and so on.
The world is in the middle of a power struggle between the Bugrum, and the alliance of nations against them.  We also learn that these nations have had wars with each other and everyone else frequently in the past, and have developed some pretty nasty weapons, including a demon or two.
Over all this is a great series, and one most any anime fan will love to own,  enjoy!
