That's the question you'll be asking yourself after viewing Max Shreck's performance as the titular character in Nosferatu. A film once nearly lost to us, Nosferatu is perhaps the film that best represents the creepiness and terror of Stoker's Dracula. Murnau successfully utilizes all the tools and techniques at his disposal to create a film thick with atmosphere. What he is unable to do with dialogue, he does with clever special effects and effectively framed shots and sequences.
This DVD presentation of the film is very good. It offers two musical soundtracks. The first is a simple organ meant to show how the audience would have experienced the film 80 years ago. The second is a modern orchestral composition that I feel better serves the film. It has a haunting, gothic feel to it that fits the action on-screen like a glove. There is also a commentary track by noted film historian Lokke Heiss. While Heiss is clearly a very learned scholar, he is one dull commentator. Honestly, I have an appreciation of silent film but his droning on without the benefit of a musical backdrop nearly put me to sleep. Heiss also narrates a much shorter featurette on the present-day sites of the film that is a little easier to swallow.
I urge you if you are either a film enthusiast or a fan of the horror genre to pick up this well done presentations of one of the best films ever (silent or otherwise).
