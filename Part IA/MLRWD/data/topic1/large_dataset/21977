I know there are people who thought this was a dumb story line but the movie is great with wonderful clean humor. There are just not many funny comedies that are funny without the crude humor these days but this one got a lot of laughs from me because you do find these people in the real world. They are the annoying ones that we wonder why?? It's funny to have this whole array of people in the comedy that can make you laugh and cry. I saw this movie once and thought yeah it's okay. It's when you watch it a second time when you realize OMG that is hilarious. It's one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time with a feel good ending.

I like the blu-ray verison with the so many extra features like deleted and alternate scenes. I know there are some scenes I wish they included in the original movie. The gag reels were great. The Hollywood Dish interview I could have lived without. The host woman was annoying and crude. I did not care for her interview style. But everything else is great on blu-ray. The red boots really shine in HD. So give the movie a try and just sit back and forget all the negative reviews. Just enjoy the movie as a movie. It's not a school project, movies are just suppose to be enjoyed and not over analyzed.
