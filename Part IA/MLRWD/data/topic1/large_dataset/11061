Finally, one of the all time greatest movies is out on DVD!  The digital anamorphic picture is excellent as is the newly remastered Dolby digital 5:1 sound.  BUT THE DVD "BONUS" FEATURES ARE WEAK!!!  There is no commentary from the director or anyone in the movie, no alternate scenes or outakes, not even a original trailer for the movie!!!  The only "bonus" material included are the "Production Notes" which are printed on a sheet of paper inside the DVD packaging and 3 trailers for Groundhog Day, Hook and one other movie that have nothing to do with Tootsie!!!!  Also included is a cheesy filmography for Hoffman, Lange, Murry and Pollak.
This DVD was in production at Columbia Tristar for a number of years... besides the excellent video and sound transfers - WHAT THE HECK TOOK THEM SO LONG!?!?  For a film that was recently ranked as #2 as one of the funniest films of all time, it sure got a shabby treatment upon its DVD re-release.
In short, buy this DVD for the excellent sound and video quality...  not for any DVD supplemental material.  It is 5 Star movie, but a 2 Star DVD release.
