This is one of those movies that you look twice at while at the video store in the horror section. You decide to give it a watch and hope it's worth the 1.99 rental price. But what you get is much,much more.
This movie is a rare treat for horror fans. The atmosphere of the movie is great.....from the get-go you feel as though is it early fall and the carnival is back in town with all the characters you can imagine....and some you cannot!
Highly recommended for those who like a movie with an actual 'feel' to it. The suspense is good and you get a pretty good look at the carnival(you actually see a magic show,palm reader,etc.) and along with a little humor this film will hold your interest from the start.
If you like this movie then you might want to check out Tourist Trap. It is another one of those overlooked rentals from the past that deserve another look. 
A special thanks to Goodtimes for making these films available and at a great price. I would like to see a trailer on here if nothing else and I am sure others would agree.
