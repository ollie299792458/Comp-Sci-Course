A great film. Its very entertaining and a joy. Mary was born in India and her parents never thought about her. They always cared for themselves. Her parents soon passed away because of a fire so she was sent to her aunts house. It was different at the mansion that her aunt had. It was strange to her. One night Mary heard a boy crying and she followed the sound. The boy always talked about that he was going to die soon just like his father. He couldn't walk and was always in bed. They became friends but then Mary met Dicken and that kind of split up the relationship of Mary and the one boy that she met before. Mary found a secret garden and told Dicken about it. They started growing plants and flowers in the garden. After a while the flowers and plants started blooming and it was the most beautiful garden you would have ever seen. They decided to take the boy to the garden and they tought him how to walk. In the garden there would be animals running around. The three of them would always hang out in the garden. Mary says if you look in a cirtain way, the whole world is as if it were a garden. This is really spose to be a VHS.
