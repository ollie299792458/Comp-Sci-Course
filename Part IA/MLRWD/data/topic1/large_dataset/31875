This is an under-rated, truly excellent film and I urge all to see it! One of my favorites of all-time! In addition to having such qualities as great acting, directing, and screenplay, THE FAMILY MAN teaches a beautiful and true message about life -- that money and material wealth do not give true happiness, but other things in life, like the love of a family, do.  Nicholas Cage's happily-rich character thinks he has it all, until an angel gives him a glimpse of what his life would have been like had he taken another path..and gives him a taste of everything that he's been missing out on in life..the happiness from a  not-rich loving family that is so much greater than what he got out of his big bucks before. The ending is one of the most moving, significant parts of the whole film. I urge you to see it and really think about the message that it gives people about life as you watch it. In addition to having all of this and being moving it is also very funny. Hopefully it will gain more appreciation (which it deserves) and one day become a classic! Kudos to everyone who worked on this wise &amp; intelligent film! Many ages can enjoy this film..I'm 16 and love it. See it!
