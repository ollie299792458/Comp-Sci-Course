After consecutively watching two movies from Mexico (Amores Perros and Dona Herlinda & Her Son), I eagerly awaited for Alfonso Cuaron's Y Tu Mama Tambien.  I was not disappointed.  The Mexican film industry has definitely arrived.  This is one gem of a film that deserves all the critical acclaim it has been receiving in film festivals around the world.  
You can classify this movie as you wish - road movie, coming-of-age tale, may-december interludes, study of a woman in mid-life crisis, sex-starved youth meets lonely woman longing for love and affection  - but no matter what the tag is, it remains a masterpiece of modern cinema.
The three main leads (Gael Garcia Bernal, Diego Luna, and the amazing Maribel Verdu) all deliver knockout performances that led me to a rollercoaster of emotions culminating in two realizations: 1) that life is too short to waste and 2) that life's lessons come to you in the most unexpected situations.  Sure, there is sex dotted generously in this 2-hour film, but they are quickly outshadowed by everything else.
While I originally saw Y Tu Mama Tambien during the film festival in Venice, I was fortunate enough to buy a DVD copy of this movie in Hongkong (foreign movies in this format are released much earlier here) and add it to my growing collection of must-see movies.
Watch this one or buy/rent the DVD, you won't be disappointed.
