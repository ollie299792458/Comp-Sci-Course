I have just ordered this thing after watching it on YouTube. The movie is icky & stupid. The riffs are comedic gold! Poor Joel's botched "plastic surgery"-via-Bots is wizz-your-pants-and-burst-your-sides LAFFS! Also the philiosophical musings on Hell give great chuckles & the sight of Robots taking showers (to wash off one YUCKY B-Flick) & Joel "Pork-O-Rina" (WHOONK! WHOONK! WHOOOONNNNKK!!!) is worth the price of the DVD alone. I can't wait to see it!....IN EEGAH!: SEE...The pith-helmeted creepy anthropologist Dad! GASP...at his lovely 30-Something-Teenage Daughter (who's a bit 'too close for comfort'...don't think about it)! SHUDDER...at the sunburnt Garbage-Pail Kid under the unfortunate delusion that he's Elvis (but looks more like a young Mickey Rooney)! MARVEL...in horror, disgust & pity at the 7 foot tall Caveman (who's strangely the best character in the flick) who keeps his mummified, man-jerkied loved ones around...Ed Gein-style! YES! SEE "EEGAH!" AND YOU'LL NEED A SHOWER!...SEE "EEGAH!" AND WON'T EAT FOR A WEEK!...Keep it around during Lent or whilst dieting & PICTURE THE VISION OF EEGAH GETTING SHAVED AND SCHLOBBERING UP THE HAIRY SHAVING CREAM when you're tempted to eat that cream pie! Yes! It's Hillarious! It's Gross! It's EEGAH!...Right on MST3K....The way it SHOULD BE SEEN!!!......Oh don't forget Joel's facejob..............and Watch Out For Snakes!.......................
