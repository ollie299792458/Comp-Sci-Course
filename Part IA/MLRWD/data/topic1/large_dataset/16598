Wow. I cannot believe that there are any 1 star ratings for this, but alas, some people are the kind of "different" that is not fantastic.

Granted this may not be your kids' cup of chocolate milk - especially if they are the same kids that like mindless trash like Power Rangers.

The Fantastic Mr. Fox is for all ages and it is the perfect package of imagination, wit, whimsy, and heart. Yes, the story is simple, but it's the execution that elevates it into something special.

To call the graphics poor is a great insult especially when it is very clear that the intent was not to reiterate the same artistic style that defines a majority of 3d animation today. The look is rustic, slightly messy, warm, and frankly refreshing. The artist in me appreciates it in every way. The music too, beautifully compliments the movie and is emotionally complex.

The movie explores topics like individuality, responsibility and consequences, and most importantly, compassion for family and friends. I love how they managed to juggle in all those wonderful bits around a story about food and survival (as a foodie, I can certainly understand the drive to attain fresh tasties lol)!

I can honestly say there are no faults to be found. It is liquid gold.
