This story is that the teacher Mr.Keating comes to Welton.The students obey the teachers or their parents until they heard Mr.Keating.Because the way that he teaches is different from the way that other teacher teach.It doesn't proceed with the way that he teaches as mentioned in text book.I like the way that he teaches.Because that was uniqe and there is no formality. Dead Poet Society the students gradually find their own way .In case of Neil, he wants to be an actor,but his father opposes his dream. He chose suicide.Because he always insists on his father's opinion and not thought to say his thoughts completely.Mr.Nolan blames for what happens on Neil.Because he thinks Mr.Keating makes Neil organize Dead Poet Society.Mr.Nolan wants the students to sign.He feels responsibility with himself and is kicked out of school by their signature.In the end,they stand on the desk to show their feeling and respect and say to him"Oh,captain,my captain!!"As for me that scene was left in the impression most.If all are signing,I may do,too.Because I'm scared of being kicked out of school.I think that it isn't my opinion.I learned to say that it was important to introduce my true opinion from this film.
