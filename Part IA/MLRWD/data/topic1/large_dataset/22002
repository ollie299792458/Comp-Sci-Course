Let's face it.  Anyone even looking at buying this movie is very likely either already a Weird Al fan, or looking for a comedy that is not quite... normal.  UHF fits both bills nicely.  Like most of Al's work, it's not a continuous rotfl fest, but it does pack some serious lol action.  But I want to address those who already own an older copy of this movie.

Why buy this DVD version if you've already got the VHS, or Laser Disc (yeah, I'm a LD loser)?  The extra features.  I've seen this movie many times, but listening to Al (and his guests') commentary made it a new experience again.  He either has a remarkable memory or is incredibly anal about keeping track of information, because he knows the story behind every actor, prop and set in the movie.  Mostly funny, but there are also a few touching moments.

I particularly enjoyed his out-takes.  Unlike most DVD deleted footage, he partially narrates his, explaining why scenes got cut, and sometimes fast-forwarding through bits that are too slow.  And the price makes it worth having a copy that's easier to handle than a Laser Disc, or a VHS tape, for that matter.  I'm not a big Easter Egg hunter, so I only tracked down a couple.  Cute stuff, but nothing to write home about.

Al, if you're reading this: Don't you think it's time to make another movie?  I promise I'll go see it, and even make my wife go along.
