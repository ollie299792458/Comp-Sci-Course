Holy crap.
First of all, I've loved the original GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS since I was a kid.  It was the first Godzilla movie I ever saw, and I've been a big Godzilla fan and collector ever since.
Then, one day, I find out that the version of the film that I'd known and loved for years is actually not the original version; rather, a re-edit for American audiences.  And since every person I've ever spoken or been in contact with has told me that the Japanese version is infinately better, I couldn't wait to see it...unfortunately, I had to wait anyway, because finding it on video/DVD was damn near impossible for a very, very long time.
Finally, a deluxe edition of this movie was released on DVD for the film's 50th anniversary.  I eagerly popped the DVD in my player as soon as it came in the mail.  As the final credits rolled at the end of the film, I could only say one thing.
Holy crap.
First of all, let me just say that GOJIRA is way, WAY WAY WAY WAY better than GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS.  The Japanese original version is a lot more dramatic, tense, and most of all, scary.  It's a somber and serious movie about the horrors of nuclear weapons testing, with many levels of darkness and complexity that most giant monster movies from the era lack.
Aside from the movies, the DVD is awesome.  Both versions of the film, the Japanese and the American, are featured on seperate discs, both with individual special features and and commentaries.  The DVD package also comes with a booklet containing a short essay about the history of the film, written by Steve Ryfle.
Overall, if you love or even just like Godzilla or giant monster movies, or if you've never seen the original Japanese version, or even if you're just interested in film history, this DVD is definately worth picking up.
