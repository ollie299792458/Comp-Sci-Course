This is one of my favorite movies.  It is long, but yet when watching it, it does'nt feel like it.  The way Ann and her daughters feel about the husband and father.  It must be like heaven on earth, to be loved so much.  One of the scenes that I like so much, is when Joseph Cotton (Uncle Tony) shows them the poster he made an encruting poster for the Waves!  It's Ann and he has her showing a lot of leg.  And though of course he really is'nt, says he was surprised they turned it down and then they shipped him out. As for Monty Wooley he as always is great.  Jane and Bridget become like granddaughter to him, and Ann no doubt like a daughter. When she gets that telegram informing that her husband Tim is missing in action, well it really gets to one's heart.  The aftermath, showing their reaction to the news, well just reread the sentence about being loved so much.  What a jem of a husband and father he must be.  Also I like the way Hattie McDonnel as the maid(too bad that prejudice at the time prevented her from having the career she deserved) is treated by the family.  They don't talk down to her, and she is treated with true love yet that and respect.  At Jane's graduration, she is invited and sits with the family. Even if Tim was there, she would still be invited and still be sitting with the family.  The only reason not after all, is that they are allowed only so many tickets for the students to give for family and friends to attend.  And when Ann finds out that the young boy Jonney is killed very soon after talking to them, you feel such sadness too.  And at the end when after she opens the gift that Tim had brought for her, well a person would have to have a heart of stone, not to be moved just a little.  She receivies a phone call informing her that Tim is alive and well.  A person who does'nt have a heart of stone, can't help but be moved.  I recommend this movie to others. I can't praise it enough.
