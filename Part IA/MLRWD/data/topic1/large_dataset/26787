A young drifter breaks into homes, but steals nothing except the heart of a verbally, physically,mentally, and to some extent sexually abused wealthy housewife. When he breaks into her mansion, he does not know she is there. When she finds him  instead of calling the police she runs away with him after the drifter beats up her husband with a 3 Iron golf club. They break in homes together, but steal nothing except their own hearts and the silence between these lovers simply speaks volumes. When they break into the home of an elderly deceased man, his son comes to the apartment and finds them and calls the police. The young man is sent to prison, but the young woman is returned to her own personal prison--the loneliness of her own home. Her husband tries to make up for his past ways while the prisoner plots his escape. Usually foreign films do not guarantee a happy ending, but I must say that I was content with this ending.The DVD that I received was already set to English subtitles, but you won't need many subtitles to truely enjoy this movie.
