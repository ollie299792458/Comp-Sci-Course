The Santa Clause (1994) was an incredible movie for the entire family.  It made you cry, laugh, and most importantly believe again.  I was somewhat worried to find out there would be a sequel to one of my all time favorite Christmas movies.  I figured there was no way to meet the standards The Santa Clause had set forth.  I happily discovered I was quite mistaken.
 Both The Santa Clause and The Santa Clause 2 presented Scott Calvin (a.k.a Santa Claus) with some hefty, real life problems.  In the sequel, Calvin is introduced to such issues as marriage and the juvenile delinquency of his only son. However, the overall tone of it remained light and happy, whereas the first movie's issues brought about sadness and pity. 
 Who would have known a man as powerful as Santa could lose his magic?  Returning home to help his needy son also meant Santa's magic was not of an unlimited supply.  Santa is unable to return to the North Pole if his magic has run out.  What is a man to do when he is unable to use all his power to save his loved ones and himself?  
 Upon watching this film you will definately realize Santa is not the only mythical leading (wo)man with problems!  Helping out with the joyous tone of the movie were an array of silly characters, such as Chet the trainee reindeer and the toy Santa, who overtook the North Pole with his Nazi-like rules. The movie also introduced some childhood fantasy characters such as the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny. I could relate more to this movie with the presence of charcters from my own childhood. 
 Not only did this movie leave me with a tummy ache from all the laughter, and a warm heart, but it also reinstated my belief in fairytales.  "Seeing isn't believing.  Believing is seeing"
