Even though Carnival of Souls was industrial and educational

film maker Herk Harvey's lone entry into the commercial film

market, he managed to prove that a small budget could produce a

film that would somehow stand the test of time with a storyline that keeps you watching, without the gore, violence and overdone special effects of today's films.

This DVD is unique that it offers both the original Black and White version as well as a Colorized version, plus Mike Nelson's (of MST3K) optional commentary.

Candace Hilligoss gives a good performance as Mary Henry, a very bewildered and confused young lady who finally learns what her

ultimate fate is.

Others players in the film include Frances Feist as Mrs. Thomas, the landlady who seems to have a case of the weird herself, and who tosses off one of the film's most memorable lines. Sidney

Berger as John Linden, the next door neighbor who also happens

to be the resident letch.

Adding much to the film were the many scenes shot at Saltair,

the then abandoned and damaged amusement park on the shore of the Great Salt Lake. Not only was Saltair, the inspiration for Herk

Harvey's film, and an integral part of it, but was and still is

a place that is worthy of a documentary film of it's own due to

it's strange history.

If you have never seen Carnival of Souls, get this DVD, it will

be worth every penny.
