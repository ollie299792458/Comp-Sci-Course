In my honest opinion,Gremlins 2:The New Batch,is a brilliant sequel to the original Gremlins.It's also the perfect  example of how a sequel should be done.We once again have a brilliantly  written story that's very tight.The Gremlins are back,this time taking over  a Manhattan SkyScraper.There much deadlier and nastier than in Gremlins  1.They drink mutagenic chemcals that cause them to mutate into very nasty  creatures.They transform into mutant spiders,Gargoyles,and one even gets an  ability to talk.The Gremlins once again employ some weaponry,including  chainsaws,machine guns,and dental drills.The special F/X are absolutely  spectacular.The Gremlin F/X are awesome,and the mechanical F/X themselves  are great.The music is magnificent, and the film NEVER gets boring.Director  Dante is even more experienced and stronger here,giving the film an very  well made and hard worked feel to it.There are plenty of in jokes and  gags,so expect to be in stitches throughout the entire thing.  Overall,Gremlins 2:The New Batch is an excellent and HIGHLY entertaining  follow up to Gremlins 1.It's also the perfect example of how a sequel  should be done.Buy it now!
Rated PG-13 for some menacing violence and  brief language.
