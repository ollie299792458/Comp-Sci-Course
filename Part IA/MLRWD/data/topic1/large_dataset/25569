This is the movie that you could say started it all. Definitely a good movie for Kevin Smith fans and just a fun movie to watch. Especially if you plan on watching the other films, which have interlacing themes/stories and references. Gives you a "small town" coincidental feeling.

It is filmed all in black and white, almost if it was seen through the security camera. It's a neat effect that plays well for the theme of the movie. The basic premise is that the two main characters are Clerks at a convenience store and the next door Video rental. The encounters with different patrons and of course the weed peddling Jay and Silent Bob are hilarious. The story as it unfolds is both smart and vulgar, and has several reoccurring themes that you can catch as you go through the story. There are a lot of fast exchanges of dialogue that you'll have to pay attention to, which all comes to a bunch of hard-hitting revelations and conclusions for most of the main-characters.
Kevin Smith enjoys displaying both the intelligent and vulgar/fart/genetalia joke sides in his films. Whether debating hardcore midget p0rn, the Star Wars movies, smoking, or delving into what every clerk has to go through on a daily basis, it'll be delivered in it's own style.

And if you enjoy Clerks:
Definitely recommend watching: Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Clerks II.
