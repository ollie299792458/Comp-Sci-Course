Riding in Cars With Boys, is a great movie directed by Penny Marshall.  Drew Barrymore plays the main character, Beverly Donofrio.  She is a very spunky little girl who is dying to grow up.  James Wood plays Beverly's conservative but loving father and the town's police chief.
When she finally is old enough, she falls for a popular jock that has no interest in her.  She is devastated and heart broken over this that she falls for the next guy she meets.  Her involvement with him lands her pregnant.  Trying to make the right choice she decides to have the baby.  Her family then insists that she marry the guy.  She doesn't want to marry him and has a very miserable wedding.
Beverly is then a very unhappy teenage mother with a drug-addicted husband who blames her baby boy for the terrible life that she has.  The story shows the happy, terrible and disappointing times in their lives.  This movie is based on what happens when you make the right and the wrong choices.  It shows how the different relationships in your life can influence the choices that you make.
 I feel this is a great drama-comedy to watch, especially to all the young girls who are just dying to grow up.
