"Barabbas" is certainly not your average Roman epic; viewers should't expect the usual ending of the protagonist living happily ever after somewhere in the lovely countryside.  No, this is quite different, a film dealing with human doubt and brutality as well as Christian hope.  The plot is dark throughout which honestly seems to add more realism to the film.  The acting is good and many scenes are memorable such as Christ's crucifixion (partly filmed during a real solar eclipse), the stoning scene, the first gladiator fight, and the Great Fire of 64 A.D.  Perhaps the most haunting visual shot is the forrest of crosses near the picture's conclusion.
Quinn does a good job at protraying the protagonist, one unusual because of his dark nature.  The last lines Barabbas speaks are somewhat ambigous and can be interpred in different ways.  Palance gives a sinister performance as a sadistic gladiator that ranks right up there with his performance as hired killer Jack Wilson in "Shane."
Overall, I enjoyed the picture.  There are some historical inaccuracies such as the way Roman helments are depicted and the fact the Flavian Ampitheatre hadn't been constructed yet (neither flaw takes much from the film).  The musical score was well done.  Finally, viewers considering purchasing the film should remember it is dark and fairly violent.
