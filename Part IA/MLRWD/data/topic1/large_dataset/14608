I just recently got "hell of the living dead" or what i know the movie better as "night of the zombies" and i was scared of the quality of the movie but i was truly surprised when i got it.  I remember watching this movie when i was younger for my father had it on VHS but the quality was so terrible it was hard to tell what was going on.  But after watching the movie and seeing the condition it was in i was so happy and so glad i bought the movie.  The quality looked like they took their time remastering the movie.  I don't really need to give the plot since so many others have gave there summary of the movie.  All you need to know is that the movie has a fairly loss story line that strings together for a pretty dark ending.  If you are like me and love Blood and guts, also T&A this is your movie there is very few boring moments in the movie every 5 to 10 minutes there's a zombie munching on someone and gunfire going off.  This movie also has some comedic moments to it where one of the soldiers dress's in a tutu and begins singing "singing in the rain" with a surprise at the end. Might i also add FINALLY! and I MEAN FINALLY YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT KEEPS REPEATING SHOOT THEM IN THE HEAD and doesn't keep shooting them in the stomach and chest hoping to kill them.  Also as my title refers to there are moments in this movie where its so gruesome that if your eating you have to stop or turn the tv off cause it finally gets to you.  This movie is not for the screamish but is a good movie to sit down and watch when you have a date with you or having nothing better to do during the weekend.

I'm also surprised with the special features this DVD carries
-Trailer: which seems to be almost remastered unlock other old movies i bought where they have remastered the movie but not the trailer i give them credit for doing it here.

-Bruno Mattei Featurette: I 9 minute mini movie with Bruno talking about Both "Hell of the living dead" and "Rats" and talking about what inspired him and what he liked and hated about each movie.

-Poster & still Gallery: not bad little special feature showing the original movie posters that came out for it

5/5 in my book truly a guilty pleasure lets hope we keep seeing the Italian horror movies keep coming out and not fade into history and forgotten.

Lets remember the other movies that started the zombie craze besides for "George A Romero" movies.
