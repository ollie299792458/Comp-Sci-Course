When THE CHANGELING first came out in 1979 I had no interest in seeing it. "Just another cheesy haunted house movie with no thrills" I was thinking but I was totally wrong. I finally was able to view it years later on HBO and it made every hair on my body stand up! Visually it isn't scary but the symbolisms have a psychological effect on the psyche (e.g. a ball drops down the staircase, George C. Scott picks it up and brings it to a bridge far away and deposits the ball into the water, to his surprise when he arrives back home the same ball drops down from the staricase again). This by far is the best haunted house movie set in a large mansion in the woods outside of Seattle but actually may be in British Columbia. There's something about the Northwest, rain, and classical music that creates the perfect setting for a haunting.

A young boy by the name of Joseph Carmichael is robbed of his future empire and murdered by his own father due to his handicap and returns to possess the mansion he once lived in. George C. Scott stars as John Russell, a music professor/composer who recently lost his wife and daughter in a horrible automobile accident and takes residence in the mansion. He forms a bond with the ghostly experiences of the boy and unravels the mysteries of what took place. The mood is eeirly haunting from start to finish, a true classic for the living, the dead, and the undead.
