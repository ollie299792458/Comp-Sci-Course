I had waited a long time, years, for a sequel to Highlander to come it. Sitting in the theater with my friends rather than catching the season premier of Star Trek as I recall, we could hardly wait for the show to start. The place was packed, and as the movie progressed, we all remained hopeful, despite the fact it was not good at all. Unfortunately the movie sunk deeper and deeper into a cesspool of stupid plot ideas, and stupider characters. Finally, as we endured the lines, "Remember Highlander, remember, the planet Zeist" someone in the audience started laughing, and soon the whole audience erupted in laughter, and from that point on, jokes were constantly made as everyone laughed at the film, so in the long run, I guess we had a good time, despite being subjected to what was quite possibly the WORST sequel ever to a great movie.

  Along with rewriting the original Highlander movie with the stupid planet "Zeist" idea, it felt as if a couple hyper teens had come up with the plot after staying up way too late eating candy and drinking soda. I could imagine this conversation: Kid #1 "Wasn't it cool when the Kirgan in Highlander stuck out his tongue to the nuns?" Kid #2 replies "Yeah, that was awesome, why don't we make TWO characters who stick out their tongues all the time now! And even better, lets have them ride flying skateboards!" Kid #1 "Awesome dude! And remember how cool and dark Batman was? Lets see if they want to sell us parts of their set, and we can have it dark most of the time with steam rising and everything" Kid #2 "Rock on!"

  I could go on and on, but what's the point? This movie stunk, the plot stunk, the characters stunk, and the scenery stunk, but the fact that it was the sequel to such a GREAT movie makes it even more disappointing.
