ok look, i think that this is one great movie and that it deserves alot more credit than people are giving it. yah i know alot of you are saying 'why should i? it looks like it was taken from the perspective of an old mans veiw on how teens work.' beeeeeep....wrong answer. if you dont have anything nice to say, why say it at all? i mean yes, you can show many expressions such as annoyance and irratation. so what? do you want a cookie? i think that the smart alec who decided to write all those things like 'this is the stupidest movie i have ever seen' are probably either 40 years old or have no life what so ever. i mean people write these reviews mainly to show appreciation for something they enjoyed not to criticize everything thats not to their liking. i think its an excellent movie and if you dont like it im sorry and hope you can find a movie that YOU like and can appreciate as much as i appreciate this. so please, whoever agrees with me should write a statement too. thank you. 
and p.s i am much younger than many of the other people who wrote the negative reviews and my statement came out alot more articulate and debatable than theirs.
