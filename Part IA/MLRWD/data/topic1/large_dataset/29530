First time I watched this, the thing I liked the most was Robert Duvall's brilliant performance of surf-lover colonel Bill Kilgore. Then when I saw he was gone I was expecting his return throughout the film...never happened, but the film got pretty interesting...that's when I realized why it was called a masterpiece.

I was thrilled for what I saw and Brando hadn't even appeared yet...the helicopter attack with the Wagner classical music is one of the most beautifully filmed scenes I've seen.

Then when Marlon Brando appeared as crazed Walter E. Kurtz...what a twist for the story that started as a normal war movie with amazing helcopter attacks and turned into primitive men leadered by Marlon Brando...that was one hell of a ride.

If you want to experience 3 1/2 hours of some brilliant cinematography, great helicopter attacks, the amazing Marlon Brando with his face painted green and especially Robert Duvall giving cinema one of the coolest movie characters ever...watch this.
