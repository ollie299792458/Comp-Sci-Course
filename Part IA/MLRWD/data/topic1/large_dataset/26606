Let me start by disagreeing with the Amazon staff review calling this movie "propaganda". I googled the person that wrote the review and found quiet a few going by that name.  I did find one that may be the guy, but I had to join facebook to find out.  No thanks "Facebook!"

I was a very scared child when Nam became a possibility. I, and all my friends, knew that it was a very good possibility that we would go and fight a war and also possibly die. Yes, then you were drafted.

Today, as then, I am proud to be an American and am willing, without hesitation, to fight to keep us free.  Vets of WWII are often called the "greatest generation" but I have to add, vets of Nam are just as brave and did the job they were asked to do without all the crying of today's military. It's time our weak country stops belittling our brave young men that are willing to die so that we have the right to complain. This stands true to the brave young men and women that also have died in Iraq and Afghanistan.

So, without a doubt, this is a great movie that deserves watching.
