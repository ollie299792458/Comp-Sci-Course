Tim Burton's second take on Batman is more gothic and more brooding than the first. While Burton has a great eye for visuals, he lacks in telling a story, but spends too much time developing characters (there has to be a balance) and allowing screen writers to focus on quick one liners instead of good, solid dialogue (Waters). Keaton pulls Batman off nicely and is the bright spot in this movie. The chemistry between him and Michael Gough (Alfred) works well once again. Michelle Pfeiffer is good as the Catwoman and while most people didn't like Danny Devito's Penguin, I find it an interesting take and more threatening than the previous incarnations. The movie should have one villain, but instead, has three and we get a choppy plot and Batman in once again neglected. Burton claims this was intential, to keep Batman dark and mysterious - that it does do, but a Batman story is still much better (see Batman Begins). Christopher Walken is Max Scheck, another villain, who tried to kill the Catwoman, twice, and betrays the Penguin, and to boot, this character adds nothing to the film but another psyche to deal with.

Burton's film starts off well enough, but soon turns into a bore. By the middle of the film, Batman returns, but is once again neglected. The end is as much about the Catwoman and the end of the film is lackluster to say the least. Still, one admires Burton's attempt and Keaton's performance. Danny Elfman's score is once again outstanding.

The extras are once again great.  They added the promo "The Bat, the Cat, and the Penguin" that was hosted by Robert Urich in June 92.  Part III "Shadaws of the Bat" continues where the other special additions leave off.  I can honestly say the special editions are more entertaining than the movie, and after watching them, I found the movie more enjoyable.
