I see everyone comparing this film to "Dead Poets Society", and I don't really see the connection.  The entire message of "Dead Poets Society" is centered around the notion of resisting conformity, conformity that was everywhere in the 1950's.  "The Emperor's Club" has a message that I believe is much deeper and more profound; that is, morality, virtue and honor cannot be taught.  Rather, these attributes are either inherent in an individual or they are not.  The great philosophical minds (Socrates, Plato, etc) of history clearly understood this and it is this question that Mr. Hundert grapples with as he attempts to guide and mold students into fine, upstanding members of society who share the the same characteristics as the ancient Greeks.  The brilliance of this movie (and Kline's performance as a teacher) is that the film is able to convey the importance and necessity of character and virtue without having to rely on sappiness and sentimentality a la "Dead Poets Society" or "Mr. Hollands Opus".  Instead, the viewew is treated to an in-depth character study of a teacher who goes through both triumphs and pains in his quest to instill in his students the values of the great ancient minds.

My favorite scene in the movie is when Mr. Hundert confronts a Senator (the father of a spoiled brat who also happens to be a trouble maker) and the Senator plainly asks him what is the "good" of what Mr. Hundert is trying to teach. Needless to say, the teacher is at an existential crossroads.  How can this Senator (of all people) not recognize the importance of the ancient Greeks and Romans, whom are very Constitution and concept of Democracy are based around?  The performace given by Kline during this scene should have warranted him an Oscar.

Simply put, see this film if you're tired of the mainstream, commercial, special-effects-ridden, crap that has been polluting the movie theatres of late.
