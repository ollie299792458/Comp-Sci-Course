Do the Right Thing, a Spike Lee joint, takes you into the heart of Bedford - Stuyvesant, Brooklyn on a sweltering summer day.  Most of the entire film takes place over just one day.  Though one day is a short amount of time, many issues arise. The issues, mostly rooted from racial conflict, are humorous but at the same time provocative and heartfelt.
 The main character, Pookie played by director Spike Lee, works as a pizza delivery guy for Sal's Famous Pizzeria.  Sal's Pizzeria is owned by a white man who runs the business with his two sons.  Pookie, a young African American male with a girlfriend and a young son, is often the guy the neighborhood people go to for advice or to rant about whatever.  After a young man gets upset about the absence of African Americans on the wall at Sal's Pizzeria, he lets Pookie hear it.  When an attempted boycott of the pizzeria fails, the young man and his friend, Radio Rahim, confront Sal.  Soon after, a riot breaks out which results in the death of Radio Rahim and Sal's Pizzeria going up in flames.
 While the movie lacks direction and plot through the majority of the film, its goal is to take the racial conflict of Bedstuy and broadcast it to the audience, many of which who were probably unaware of the severity and volume of the issue.  By doing this affectively, the film was granted the prestige of being "culturally significant" by the United States Library of Congress.  Do the Right Thing is humorous while also being culturally informative.  It gives insight that appears real and significant, which can easily be appreciated by any viewer.
