I saw the Stones live in Edmonton, Alberta in 1994. I was lucky enough to be in the 23rd row. What a blast. The next time I saw them was on this DVD. Boy, has the music suffered. My daughter asked me why all the songs sounded the same. Sympathy for the Devil had Mick trying to do the "who who" vocals and they came out more as "whee whee". Well, and what can you say about Keith? He tried hard and came up short.The numerous closeups did't help either. Mick tried continuously to bring up the level of the crowd to that wonderful point when the band and audience become one organic whole, and he almost succeeded with Brown Sugar. But then it died.

I can't accept a music DVD with poor sound and that's what this one had. Poor, very poor. Poor to the point that I had to strain to indentify the songs. I'd like to blame it on the DVD producer but they had all the technology there to capture what the band pumped out. So what happened?

The audience at a rock concert is suppose to get into the music, to sing the lyrics at the top of their lungs, to sweat and be tranformed. This audience was more frightened about getting run over by the umpteen moving cameras that had usurped the good seats in the front row.Stuffing a lot of young, beautiful people in the front row didn't help one bit either. Their reaction to the music looked, and probably was just a show.

Save your money and buy U2's Rattle and Hum.
