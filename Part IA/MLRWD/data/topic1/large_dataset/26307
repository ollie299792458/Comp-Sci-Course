This, along with Q. Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction'once again lit the blue touch paper in the 'Violence in the Movies' debate. Is this film worth all the hype? - YES it is, but not for it's violence but for the sheer audacious movie making that Oliver Stone had once again shown. Out has gone a lot of Quentin's snappy and witty dialogue, although the QT trademark is there, but the showmanship of OS is at the forefront.  This is what Q. Tarantino would and could not have acheived - a mad, bad and altogether out of body movie which debates that society and the media should be more accountable for their actions in the depiction of violence that is all around us. This is a complete cop out and should be ignored at the outset. Take this movie with a large pinch of salt and sit back and marvel at the splicing of different filmstocks 35mm Super 8 and also the fusing of cartoons in some areas. Plot, there is no plot, Mickey &amp; Malory Knox ( Woody Harrelson / Juliette Lewis) kill and they enjoy it they have no morals, scruples and no compunction in doing what they do! Superb performances from all concerned above and also Robert Downey Jnr., Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Sizemore. This disc is nothing short of brilliant as it has superb missing/deleted scenes, alternative ending and one of the best audio commentaries fom Mr. Stone himself into the sights and insights of the film.  Good / Bad? You decide, although it's not easy watching... you have been warned.
