This movie was limited theatrical release so I never got the chance to see it on the big screen, but I anxiously awaited the dvd release and I must say for me it was well worth the wait.  The actors did a good job; the acting wasn't overdone or cheesy like alot of horror flicks nowadays... very natural... they just did what was necessary to convey the mood. I fell in love with [the two main characters] by the end, and what I really loved about them was watching the evolution of their interpersonal dynamic. Again, nothing there was overdone; it seemed pretty natural that they'd evolve the way they did. As for the plot of the film, I feel WIND CHILL did a pretty good job of tying all the little details together (i.e. foreshawdowing etc.), keeping you in suspense, and keeping the viewer captivated ...by the end everything seemed to fall into place in terms of the plot, the characters, and their purpose for existing in this film.. Really impressed overall. Good Supernatural tale. I'd recommend to any thriller lover!
