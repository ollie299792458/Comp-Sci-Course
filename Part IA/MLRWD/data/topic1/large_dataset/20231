A truly odd movie, "Kiss Me Stupid" is half masterpiece and half mess. The video version opens with the credits in widescreen, behind which we see Dean Martin in concert in Vegas, casually interrupting Gershwin's  lovely "S'wonderful" to make lewd and unfunny jokes. You can feel  Wilder's deep disgust seeping through the crisp black and white images. And  yet he does the same thing he's chastising Dino for: though his story is a  lovely portrait of people finding each other despite society's hypocrisy,  he fouls his own movie with smutty jokes, leering, and crude overemphasis.  Part of the problem is the substitution of Ray Walston for Peter Sellers;  the latter might have made it a sweeter and more moving film, but Walston  is helplessly grating and obnoxious. However, Kim Novak gives a memorable  performance -- not as great as the one she gave in "Strangers When We  Meet," but she's touching and funny as the whore longing for  domesticity. As for Dino, the joke's on him, but as usual he couldn't care  less.
