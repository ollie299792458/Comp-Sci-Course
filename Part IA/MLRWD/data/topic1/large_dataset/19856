The mid-70s produced a few notable films that might be categorized as a sub-genre known as 'Strange Happenings in New York City'. The most timeless, of course, was Taxi Driver. Then there was The Sentinel, a goofy but creepy adpatation of a popular novel dealing with the gates of hell opening in a Manhattan brownstone. This leaves us with Larry Cohen's God Told Me To. It's a mix of a few iconic elements: the guilt-ridden Catholic cop with an ex-wife and a girlfriend on the side, a series of shootings by average 'he was such a nice boy' citizens who were controlled by an inner 'god told me to' voice. Oh, I forgot to mention the insemination by aliens, a few decades before, which sets this whole thing in motion.

The film itself is a solid, three star B-movie. It's not the most polished affair, with distracting subplots and a few cheesy effects, although the sepia-toned flashbacks are a nice touch.  What lifts this package into four-star territory is the excellent transfer by Blue Underground, and the Larry Cohen commentary. The film's influences and its legacy become clear. Cohen was the creator of the late 60s alien invasion show The Invaders. What he did here was replace that show's nice guy alien hunter Roy Thinnes with a more hard-boiled Tony Lo Bianco, upping the ante with some strong Catholic mysticism, throwing in city officials who were complicit in the alien plot.  These are ingredients that the X-Files wove together 20 years later (although Cohen refers to X-Files creator Chris Carter as 'Chris Cooper' throughout his commentary).

For the casual viewer, this movie will be seen wanting in several elements, but for those interested in the germination of supernatural and sci-fi elements that became mainstream by the mid-90s, this package is a strong buy.
