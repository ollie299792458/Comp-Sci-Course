Ok. So I am not quite sure what this final movie was supposed to do. I wouldn't lie, I did enjoy it. But as to answering questions left unresolved in season 4, it just made everything a whole lot more questionable. So we know how Michael is supposed to die based on us watching all the previous seasons, so when he finally dies in season 4, it is natural to assume that it is from his current condition. But then we are introduced to a whole new scenario of which although plausible and entertaining, it really did not need to be added. Especially since Sarah and her son are not even pretending to be on the run anymore, when really they should be based on the events of the movie. I could continue with more loopholes but do not want to give any spoilers. Maybe I just did not get all the connections of the movie to the final season and need to watch the movie again, but in my opinion the movie not only left a few questions unanswered from season 4, it also introduced some new ones which did not get resolved. So basically, the show could have easily done without the Final Break but was great for the fans to have that last hoorah!!!!!
