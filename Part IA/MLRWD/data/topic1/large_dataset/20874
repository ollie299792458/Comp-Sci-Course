My 6-year-old daughter and I saw this for the first time on HBO. I frankly would not have expected her to love this film as much as she does. I would have thought it too dark, weird and spooky for her, and I still think if she'd seen it for the first time on the big screen it would have frightened her. But now, she wants to watch it practically every day. Go figure. Most of her 1st-grade classmates thought it was too scary. I think it helped that we saw a "making of" featurette before we saw the film, so she was prepared for the dark turns of the plot as well as reminded that everything was animated from puppets.

But if your child can handle this film, it's a true masterpiece. The artistry is amazing -- I believe the scene where Coraline first encounters the other-worldly garden belongs in the recordbooks as one of the greatest animated sequences ever. The voice talent is flawless; I wouldn't have thought to cast Dakota Fanning as Coraline, but she ends up fitting perfectly.

I especially like the messages this film gets across. Some reviewers have taken away negative "messages" that, frankly, make no sense from someone who's actually seen the film. For me, in addition to the "careful what you wish for" tagline, the film demonstrates for kids that 1) having real parents who love you is more important than getting constant attention 24/7, 2) if something looks too good to be true it probably is, and 3) escapism can be fun but hiding from the real world is dangerous. It's this anti-escapism message that I find to be particularly valuable, as well as extremely rare in any Hollywood film, let alone a children's film.

Now if only the Coraline dolls weren't so ridiculously expensive and difficult to find. Of all the throwaway films that get merchandised to death, it's a shame no major toy company picked up the license for this film.
