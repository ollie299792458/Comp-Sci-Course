L'Auberge Espagnole is a story of life, not of shoot them up kill the bad guy type at all.  I love this film, its about life, love and friendship, and taking off or not; doing what you really want to do, not what society dictates, love life, and absorb the experiences of every one you meet and experience into your own personality.  I've watched this film about 20 times so far and I still catch something new.
Romain Duris -Xavier-(Le Divorce) does a great job as the student from France finding out who he is in life.  The rest of the international exchange students (the program is called Erasmus) add so much to the film, you will find yourself wanting to see it again and again.  Life in Europe, the fun, culture and music lets you enjoy the experience as it you are there. (I even bought the sound track) 
Cristina Brondo (the Spanish student from Tarragona) is absolutely beautiful in this as she adds the sanity to the group.
Audrey Tautou -Martine- plays Xavier's frustrated girlfriend in France, that seems to nag Xavier back to the past, but Xavier works that out (see the film).
Kevin Bishop -William- Plays the obnoxious brother of Wendy, from the UK, and his attitude really pisses off the group as he stays visiting with his sister for a bit.  His explanation of the fly's mating ritual is really funny, and by his sacrificing himself for his sister gets him the respect of the group.  So you have to appreciate everyone, since we all have qualities that make up a complete loving human race.
This is the best flick I've seen since Run Lola Run and Amelie, although Audrey Tautou plays a very different part in this film.
So what are you waiting for?  Get the Film!!
