I really meant to give it 3 1/2.
Well when I first went to the video  store to rent the movie, I didn't expect it to be a classic because I've  read some of the reviews and they were mostly negative. Maybe was because  of the subject matter of the film or the twist and turns some people might  of find it disturbing. But when I finished watching this film, it was  really interesting and really had enjoyed it.
First I have to say that  this movie the most original I've seen. It has a lot of subjects to discuss  about. To, sexual seduction, power, control, and sexual politics. And the  film really great cinematography.
The story in itself wasn't that moving,  but I have to say that some scenes were quite funny, shocking, and  interesting. But the main reason to watch the film is for the lead actors,  especially Winslet. Kate Winslet (Ruth) mesmerized me like never before.  She once left me in doubt after seeing Titanic (who some who don't  recognize the lead actress, is the one who played Rose in Titanic), but now  she proved to me that she's one of the best actors of our time. And for  Harvey Keitel (PJ), he was ok for being a screen veteran. But the story  here is really Winslet, she was so engagingly gorgeous that she stoled  every scene she was on. She truly was overlooked by the Academy this  year.
The film itself was average. It was somewhat shocking, but  sometimes the screenplay was lacking. At times we couldn't really see what  was into the minds of Ruth and PJ.
But I really only recommend this film  within the peformances itself.
