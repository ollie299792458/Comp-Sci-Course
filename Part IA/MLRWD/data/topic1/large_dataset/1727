Nicholson is at his best in this gloomy but superb depiction of an aging/retiring police officer who cannot escape the promise he made to the parents of a brutally murdered little girl. Unwilling to leave the job to the slipshod young upstarts looking to move the crime to the "solved" list, Jerry antagonizes his former colleagues as he continues to investigate the crime post-retirement, despite the apparent confession and suicide of a retarded Native American. His obsession combines with his relationship with a battered single mother and her young daughter, and his resulting lapses in judgment lead to near tragedy for all, true tragedy for Jerry. Nicholson avoids the "over the top" stuff he is well-known (and loved) for, delivering a Jerry Black who is simultaneously depressed, hopeful, obsessed, and loving, all at a time most men hope will be their "golden years." The juxtaposition of the splendorous, pristine Sierras in the background and the seedy, violent "civilization" Jerry moves through make for a sincere and accurate depiction of much of the modern American West. The performances are uniformly excellent, right down to the young boy who discovers the murdered girl in the opening scene. The final scene is so thought-provoking as to make the viewer question whether the "resolution" is real or merely Jerry's attempt to rationalize what went "wrong." I can't stop thinking about this movie.
