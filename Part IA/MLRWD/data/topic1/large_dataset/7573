I have yet to see this DVD, but I did get the chance to see La Nouba live last June 03. La Nouba is by far the best live show I have ever seen in my life.  Every single second was awe-inspiring. The performers amazing talent and skill just grabs your attention and you can't peel your eyes away from them. Every single one of the acts are amazing.  I particularly loved Diabolos and Arial Ballet in Silk.  Arial Ballet In Silk just had this feel of romanticism that I loved.  Diabolos was my favorite , though.  Those little girls had so much talent and grace and everyone in the theatre gave them a standing O!

 From the minute the first acts came out, I remember realizing that I wouldn't leave feeling like the same person I did coming in....And I was right.  After seeing it live, you leave with this feeling of being a new person. So much adrenaline is rushing through your body and you just feel rejuvinated with not a care in the world.

I can't wait to get this DVD.  It'll be a wonderful way to remember the fun I had on one of the best (and most inspiring) nights of my life. I recommend this to anyone.  I would recommend going to see this show live as well though to get the whole expirence.  It's hard to explain the feeling it gives you, but you won't be the same person afterward, I assure you.  It's been over a year later and that feeling has yet to wear off.
