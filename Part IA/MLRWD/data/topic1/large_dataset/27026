Love this movie, just not the Deluxe edition of the DVD.  I have watched this movie so many times--probably a hundred.  I can quote lines from it at will.  I used to have a coworker who loved it as much as me and we would banter around some of the lines as we passed by each other's desks at work!  What a fun movie!  Sadly, when I moved two years ago, I decided I had watched it enough and donated my copy to the library.  Recently when I learned the news that Nora Ephron had passed away, I wanted to watch the bonus features of the original DVD again to hear her talk about the Upper West Side one more time. I regretted giving my copy away. Moving sometimes makes one do really silly things!  When I went to buy a new copy and learned there was a new Deluxe Edition, I bought that instead, thinking it would be even better!  I was wrong.  The Bonus Feature on the Deluxe Edition is not very good and the discussion of the movie between Tom Hanks, Nora Ephron, and Meg Ryan leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion.  It does have a good feature called, "You've Got Charisma" which talks about other screen characters from the 40s and 50s who have on screen charisma.  If you want to own this DVD, I recommend getting a copy of the original DVD because of the great Nora Ephron in the Bonus Features describing the Upper West Side!  You'll be glad you did.
