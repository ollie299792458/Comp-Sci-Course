Both the previous reviews seem right on target.  This movie is a cherished treasure of American film during a major cultural transition.  Seen today, without context, some of my students couldn't understand the satire.  The blur between news and junk has become so obscured, they didn't see the big deal.  The intelligent--or, rather, I should say--the informed students understood what was so funny about a radical communist demanding--nearly to the point of gunfire--a percentage of the residual runs.  Amazingly well-acted, this script is for fairly intelligent people.  No, this movie is not a geek-fest for just the smart people, but the smarter you are, the more you'll be able to get the jokes.  Of late, the only film since "Goodfellas" to match the morbid, smart humor of "Network" would be "American Beauty."
[Well, Solondz's "Happiness," is nearly as good, and, possibly Burton's "Mars Attacks" or "Ed Wood."  I'm not sure, off-hand, if they're before or after "Goodfellas."]
PS:  The only reason I give the DVD 4, instead of 5, stars is because, while the film is a masterpiece, the DVD needs further features and a crisp re-mastering for it really to live up to the quality of the source material.  Basically, the movie's a must-see that was hastily thrown onto DVD without the extra care such a masterpiece deserves.  Where's Lumet's commentary?  Dunaway's?  Anyone's?  Where are the neat historical tie-ins that could make such a movie understandable to an un-informed audience?  Mmmm...?
