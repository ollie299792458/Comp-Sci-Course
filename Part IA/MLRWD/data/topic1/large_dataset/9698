From PILLOW TALK: Brad Allen (Rock Hudson) sings to his clueless and entirely-too-willing date "You are my inspiration...(memory lapse followed by relief as he remembers her name)..., Marie."

Brilliant script, great direction, perfect pacing and VERY witty split-screen work.  All the acting is inspired, too - lead and supporting both.

But, what I REALLY want to say is that the music in that film and the other two in this collection is just fabulous - and I mean beyond the songs.  Maybe the best comedy scoring I've ever heard outside of the outrageously exaggerated stuff that Carl Stalling did for the WB cartoons from the 1930s through the late 50s.  Frank DeVol does a running musical commentary on the lunatic activity on the screen and, without fail, heightens the comedic effect.  I don't know anyone better at this.  The legendary film composers are not legendary because of their work in comedies.  Jerry Goldsmith did some memorable comedy scores.  One of his best was THE TROUBLE WITH ANGELS (1966) and I see on IMDB that DeVol assisted with that one.  How fitting!  John Williams has done a few - I think first of HOME ALONE.  Andre Previn (GIGI, IRMA LA DOUCE, MY FAIR LADY) was very good.  Mancini was known for comedies but not really for comedic writing.  I think Devol might be the best ever and he not only did all three films in this collection, but also THE THRILL OF IT ALL and THE GLASS-BOTTOM BOAT, too.  There's a real Doris Day connection here.

All three films are presented widescreen (rather than in that disgraceful pan-and-scan butchering).  A real value!
