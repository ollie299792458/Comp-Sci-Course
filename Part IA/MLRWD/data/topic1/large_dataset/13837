Platoon, it records a story in the Vietnam War. Chris Taylor a young American soldier who is the main character of the movie, had arrived South Vietnam with his comrades. In the battlefield, it shows audiences a real battle life. Although the condition in the battlefront was bad, Taylor learned to fit in battle life, and he became an experienced soldier on the battlefront. In the scene when Taylor's leader Elias Grodin was killed by Viet soldiers, Taylor figured out Robert Barnes was the real murderer of Elias, and this scene is the cover of this movie. As the movie moves on, Taylor continued to fight with Viet soldiers and once, Taylor's company was losing because of the huge number of enemies. After bombing on the whole area, most of the soldiers died. Taylor was one of the survivals, and he found Barnes in the jungle. In the anger, he killed Barnes as what Barnes did to Elias. By the way, the newer version of Platoon has a better effect on the movie, even though it's still the same one. This movie is very compelling; it'll bring you to the world of war, a cruel, brutal and apathetic world. Again, welcome to the world of war!
