Although they do a good job of accurately telling the Vince Papale story (Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinear turn in good performances), it starts out pretty good but ends abruptly. Although it stays pretty close to the actual story, about a down and out bartender who only played one year of college football trying out for, and making the Philadelphia Eagles, it leaves a few facts out: In the movie, Vince was completely out of work and had only been staying in shape by playing football on the weekends with his friends. Newly-hired Dick Vermeil (Kinnear)holds open tryouts and is impressed with Papale's speed. He invites him to training camp, and as in all sports hero movies, he overcomes incredible obstacles and makes the team and plays for 3 seasons. In reality, Papale was not out of work; he still had his teaching job. And he was playing in a minor football league, not just with his friends on weekends, so he was in good shape when he tried out. Also, Vermeil gave him a separate tryout, not with the rest of the wannabees. But the spirit is there, and I'm a sucker for underdog movies. My only complaint is they didn't show too much of Papale's actual career. They cut the movie off abruptly, when Papale scores his first pro touchdown; then they roll the end credits. When they cut to the credits, I said, "That's it? No details about the 3 years he played with the Eagles?" I wanted to see more. Still, stories like this can't help but insprire. Also, the soundtrack is very good, for somebody who can remember the 70s. It will have you cheering and leaving the theater in a good mood. Very good, but not great; still, it's worth the cost.
