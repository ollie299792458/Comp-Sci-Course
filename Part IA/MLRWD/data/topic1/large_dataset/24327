I must admit that I did not begin watching "Futurama" until the summer of 2004 when my sister and I saw the shows airing on [adult swim] on the Cartoon Network. We soon became engulfed in the show and soon after became obsessed! "Futurama" is a brilliant show with fantastic characters, clever pop-culture references, unforgettable humor, and much much more! We LOVE "Futurama" so much that we immediately ran out to the store and bought all 4 seasons on DVD. My sister and I eat, sleep, drink, dream, breathe, and live "Futurama." We are constantly quoting lines from the show back and forth to each other, can not go even one day without watching an episode, and are even currently creating our own "Futurama" comic.

Like my sister and I, there are so many other new Futurama fans because of the airing of the old shows on [adult swim], and I thank Cartoon Network for that! Even though I own all 4 DVD sets, I still watch the episodes on Cartoon Network every night to keep the ratings up in the hopes that FOX will bring the show back on the air with new episodes! I, like so may other Futurama fans, am dying to see Fry and Leela finally get together! The last episode was so bittersweet and sad! I want to see what happens afterward with Leela and Fry's relationship. I have way too many favorite episodes to list, but I would have to say that I think the best episode is "The Sting." I cry every time I watch it, and I love how each progessive episode in the series (especially in Season 4) showed Fry and Leela growing closer and closer together.

In closing I leave with a plea to 20th Century FOX -- Please, please bring back "Futurama"! It's such a wonderful show and not like any other out there. In the final words from Leela in the last episode, "I want to see how it ends."
