This is one of the worst attempts at comedy in a long time. This film is supposed to be a comedy, the only joke is that you spent your money to witness one of the worst attempts at making an already dimwitted VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards skit (like SNL) into a actual motion picture. If you do not like someone, force them to watch this piece of garbage from beginning to end. This "wanna-be" Austin Powers of a flick gets worse as time goes by there is only one "male-supermodel gag" that goes on for the entire film. Zoolander is a jab at the world of male supermodels (Derek Zoolander  Ben Stiller) which is funny for the first five minuets, after that, the gag, the story, and the acting go down in a huge ball of flames. The story writer (ben Stiller) wrote and directed, which eventually becomes offensive to the viewer! The writers make it easy to turn a fashion world foo-foo into unfunny celluloid poo-poo. Ben Stiller (There's Something About Mary, Meet the Parents) does a horrible performance, toward the middle of this "stinker" I felt sorry for him. Will Ferrell is funny for about 3 seconds, then the joke is on him for rest of the movie, instead of Ferrell being entertaining, he made me feel creepy. There are some celebrity cameos in this film to try to fool the viewer into thinking this movie was worthy of of your time and money. I could not wait for this movie to end! Out of 5 stars, I'll give it a 1 (lowest score).
