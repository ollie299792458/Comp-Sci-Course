Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas is about Mickey and his friends, having some problems and then problem solved. The movie contains couple of little stories just like the first movie.  have seen the first movie of the "Upon a Christmas" movies, and thought that it was pretty good, not good, but just okay-good. So I decided to get it and watch it with my brother, who is two years old. I think that this movie really changes the tradition of Mickey Mouse movies. The computer-animated Mickey and friends are really cool, but the problem is that the plot, and story is just, not so interesting, like the first movie. The whole movie is not so entertaining and just bored me off. The good thing about this movie, and the one thing that stands out is be good all the time, and show some Christmas spirit. Yes, is very educational, but is just educational in a Barney way. I don't know about the kids' opinion, because afterall, I am fifteen, and thing that the movie is just bit too kiddy. Anyway, my brother didn't really like it that much either, but I guess that I have to recommend it to the kids, because I think that it might teach them something about Christmas.
