I would advise anyone with an interest in Greek history to actually see the film before making up their mind about it. Despite very mixed reviews, this film delivers on all levels, if you go into it with the proper expectations. This is not a direct adaptation of Homer's Iliad; far from it, in fact. Yet, the heart of Homer is still embedded within. Troy takes the story of the Iliad and looks at it as more of a historical epic, rather than a mythological fairy tale. It's probably closer to what actually happened at Troy, and in turn, it makes for a very personal and moving story.

  The acting is great, and the direction is brilliant. Eric Bana steals the show as Hector and Bloom and Pitt do a satisfactory job as Achilles and Paris. Perhaps the best acting job was turned in by Sean Bean though, as the cunning Odysseus. I was amazed by his performance and would love to him star in an adaptation of "The Odyssey". Peter O'Toole rounds out a powerful supporting cast and theres already pre-oscar buzz surrounding his role as the noble King Priam. If true fans of Homer hesitate to see this movie, they should for the one scene alone where Priam visits Achilles in his tent.

  WIthout giving anymore away, I simply plead with you to give it a chance. Go in open minded and you won't come out dissapointed.
