I like the movie, but anyone who buys the current release (gold stripe at top, "Special Collector's Edition") deserves a little fair warning, which I didn't get.

The DVD offers 5.1 and "DTS Surround" in English, and stereo French.  The big disappointment is that you can't get great sound unless you have one of those exact setups.  Putting the 5.1 option through a high-quality 2-channel stereo, the lower half of the audio spectrum (tenor to bass, if you will) is thin and stilted.  Listening for the wide variety of subtle bass background and sound effects which we all expect in HRO, it sounds odd.  I assume some frequencies are stripped from the left and right channels and sent to the subwoofer -- if you have one.

A big thumbs-down to whoever decided to omit a regular stereo track.  My speakers are quite capable of reproducing all but the very lowest frequencies.  Not having a fancy surround setup shouldn't deprive you of significant chunks of the soundtrack.

Movie Comment: I hadn't seen HRO for several years, and only a couple of times since it was in theaters.  So it was a thoroughly pleasant experience to find HRO just as riveting now as it was the first time around. Too many action movies substitute (and indiscriminate viewers mistake) frenzy for drama.  HRO doesn't lose sight of the underlying motivations in the course of thrilling us with conflict and adventure -- but instead relies on them to make the production more compelling.
