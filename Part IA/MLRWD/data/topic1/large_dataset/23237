I've been a big Robert B. Parker fan from the beginning. Knowing that Susan Silverman was the character that his fans loved to hate, I think RPB created Jenn to absorb all of that animus and to insure that the Jesse Stone character remains highly conflicted.
I couldn't really go with the the tv series until it finally occurred to me that Tom Selleck et al., in the spirit of RBP, are keeping to the Philip Marlowe tradition of the noir detective novel. The constant back-and-forth of comparing the book to the tv series obscured the main theme of the tv series, which is interesting in itself. The Tom Selleck character, being overqualified for the job and to keep himself off the bottle, constantly stirs up trouble beyond what is called for in a small police force. Paradise, a commute community near Boston, is at the edge of the criminal world. Previously either the cops and town council members were involved in the crimes (money laundering, the drug trade), or the police force was not sophisticated enough to deal with what would, in reality, be FBI cases.
Despite audience dismay at the above issues, the producers are keeping to their own artistic vision. This makes sense in the long run since no one was better at what he did than RBP and RBP would be the last to discourage this.
