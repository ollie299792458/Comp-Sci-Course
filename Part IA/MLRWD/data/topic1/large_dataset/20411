"Out of the Past" has all the biggies: money, murder, double crossing and then the inevitable revenge, and especially the femme fatale.  The plot is tight and interesting but a little opaque at times.  Essentially you see the plot through Mitchum's character, so things that aren't all that clear to him aren't all that clear to you, though the overall plot line hangs together well if you give the movie the benefit of the doubt on the characters' motivations.

The movie is also well acted, though that's easier when portraying strong guys who don't show much emotion, as all of the main male characters do (or don't).  Mitchum's dry delivery serves him well and Douglas is all smiles and sociopathy as the gambler/nemesis. Douglas' gunsel is also well played: the quintessential second banana smart enough to get away with murder but who knows deep down, he's not smart enough to be #1. The femme fatale is a tougher role and Greer does well, though her motivations are never really clear: she's an odd mix of sentiment and sociopath, an independent risk taker and co-dependent victim.

The film is very noir, as a good film noir should be.  All of the main characters screw up mightily and (SPOILER) in the end they all die for their mistakes.  Even in the final shot of the movie the last great gesture is a hurtful lie told for a greater good. A perfect movie? No, but a good one both as a stand-alone flick and as an important milestone in film noir development.
