"Frenzy", made in 1972, marks the 54th and and second to the last film of the great Alfred Hitchcock's career. Made in an era where films were becoming increasingly violent, explicit in voyeuristic camera angles and views, language, and story themes containing sexual innuendo, Frenzy fit in perfectly and had equal or lesser effect to Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece "Psycho."  This film stars a totally unknown British cast with extraordinarily uncanny acting ability.  Headed by Jon Finch, "Frenzy" moves at a much quicker pace than other Hitchcock films.  I think that it was due to the subject matter and material which the film was based upon.  This film features one of Hitchcock's favorite themes which places in innocent man on the run from the law because of someone else's wrongful doings.  Earlier Hitchcock films that contain this theme that are highly recommended are, "Saboteur" and "North By Northwest."  Jon Finch plays as Richard Blaney who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and is accused of being the notorious necktie murderer who has been stocking and raping women and leaving their bodies to be discovered in very odd and public places, always out in the open.  Finch's costars are Barry Foster, Anna Massey, Alec McCowen, and Vivien Merchant.  McCowen and Merchant are fabulous together as a police inspector and his wife in some of Hitchcock's distinctive humor and themes connected to food.  McCowen, coming home from a long day at work to the most inedible foods on the face of the earth.  Barry Foster also creates some memorable scenes with his brilliant and hardy British acting style.  The DVD contains a documentary containing interviews with, Finch, Massey, Foster, and the screenplay writer Anthony Schaffer.  Along with the amusing and classic trailer to the film in which Hitchcock is seen floating on the Thames River in London.  Hitchcock's best with some more of his technical genius.  A real winner!!!
