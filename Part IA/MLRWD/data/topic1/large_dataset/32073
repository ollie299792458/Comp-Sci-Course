Like everyone else here, I love this show. Not as in "I love Italian food"; I mean I REALLY love it, and it has become something very special in my DVD collection. So, apart from everything nice other people have said about this show, what is it that makes it so loveable to me? I think it is the huge, warm heart that beats beneath its whacky, cartoon-like surface, the spirituality almost, the uplifting message that shines through in every episode, without there actually BEING a message. This show is about someone who decides to start doing the right thing and even though he goes about it so clumsily, the reward for his goodness always comes (albeit often from a very unexpected angle)and thus it inspires viewers who have any sort of life left in them to do the same. There seem to be some similarities to the Coen Brothers' "Raising Arizona", with the white-trash theme, the colourful, sun drenched exterior shots, the general off-beat look and feel of the show. And like that wonderful film, the main characters may do stupid, dum, crazy and illegal things, but they still have a base goodness to them. Oh, and did I mention the show is hysterically funny, amazingly original - with almost no episode ending the way you'd expect- and has a killer cast? Just start watching if you aren't already. And if, like me, you live in Holland, don't wait for the networks to finally give us this gem on tv - get the Box set and have the greatest sitcom marathon ever.
