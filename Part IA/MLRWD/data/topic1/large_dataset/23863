This film was not quite what I was expecting - perhaps I have been spoiled by the fabulous recent works of Hayao Miyazaki, the complex computer animated creations like The Incredibles, or something inventive like The Triplets of Belleville. Visually, Kirikou and the Sorceress is a little spartan - perhaps intentionally, to echo the sparsness of the African landscape that is the setting of this story. What we do see is well drawn and the African-inspired decorative style is maintained well, with diffrent characters having their own colour schemes.

Kirikou is a classic fairytale hero - confident, resourceful, and with a big heart. He can already speak in his mother's womb, he contrives his premature birth, and barely pauses for breath thereafter. He is motivated by love for his family and a desire to help his village after all the men go to fight the Sorceress and are not seen again. When he is trapped underground he is only briefly dismayed, then quickly back to work digging a tunnel to safety. When he has the chance for revenge he is merciful.

The film is set in Africa and the African accents on the English language track do much to support the atmosphere, however it is a French/Belgian production based on research rather than any personal experience so I can't be sure how authentic the detail is.

Other reviewers have noted that the children are drawn naked and the women bare breasted. Families who can get beyond this will find this film very satisfying.

There are a few extras on the DVD, and fairly low-tech like the movie.
