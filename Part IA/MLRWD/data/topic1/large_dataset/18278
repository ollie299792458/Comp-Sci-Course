(possible Spoilers)

I have an unfortunate bias when it comes to this movie...because unlike the screenwriters I READ the book.  Now the movie, though a massacre of the printed horror novel, was not the worst movie in history.  And was NOT A RIPOFF OF ALIENS!! It had some tense and edgy scenes, not the least of which was the utter destruction of Special Weapons And Tactics team.

The Acting is passable but rather melodramatic.  The casting is decent when you find you can exuse the fact that they eliminated key characters from the script.

But not only are key characters missing as before mentioned but the charm of the book did not crossover to the movie.  But this is not a review of the book or comparison of the book to the movie.  In all fairness this movie is worth seeing if you have exhausted all better movies.  If you can think or find a few movies that aren't quite as cliched into the "Unexplained and bizzare monster from some abstruse origin rampages on hapless people but then is destroyed by a jar of fromaldehyde." section by all means watch them first.

In conclusion I give this movie 2 stars because it does not rate three.  If you are one of those people with time on their hands and has a hide thick enough for a bad 90s B movie then avail yourself!

P.S.  Read the book!  It's not the same story as the movie!
