Wow incredible the first season of ER is finally coming to DVD with all of the special features that will be incredible to see.  The episode entitled Love Labors Lost is a very heartfelt episode. To me the fact that you have a great episode just focusing on one doctor trying his best to deliver a baby and is unsuccessful delivering and doing the surgery and saving the baby.  Then losing the mother in the end that was the saddest part of the episode.  Another episode is The Gift that ended the first half of the season is really good but is also sad in the fact that they had a patient coming in with brain damage and is brain dead.  They came in to harvest his organs and she did not want to have them harvest his organs.  But anyways the first season of ER was awesome because the fact that they won over Chicago Hope the first season was very good and they have been on ever since.  Chicago Hope was the only hospital show to get cancelled and not be shown again because the fact it kind of stunk were as ER every week they had a new and exciting episode and they brought in new cast member.  This year they brought back and original cast member Sherry Stringfield to reprise her role as Doctor Susan Lewis.  That was a very good move for NBC to bring her back because she and Anthony Edwards were the only two cast members to be on their for a while till Anthony Edwards character of Doctor Mark Greene was killed off in 2002 of brain cancer.  This is a must have collecters edition DVD for anyone go buy it because they will be flying off the shelves in the ladder part of August.
