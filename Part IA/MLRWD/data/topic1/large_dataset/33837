Take away all the hype about race and bigotry and in the end you have an intense little movie about two messed up people and the love that changes their lives and saves them.  It features remarkable performances by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry who of course won the Oscar. 
Billy Bob Thornton's character is unhappy in his job as a prison guard, unhappy as a son to revolting father, and unhappy as a father to a messed up son. Leticia is a woman who's had a hard life. Her husband was just executed for murder, she's too fond of sipping on liquor miniatures and she's failed as a mother to her deeply unhappy son. 
Any discussion about Monster's Ball eventually gets to the sex scene. Yes, it's raw. There's no romantic lighting or sex scene music. There's no attempt to make the actors look glamorous. It's just two sad people going at it in an attempt to forget their lives for a bit. It's the most unerotic sex scene you've ever seen in a movie and to tell the truth, it could've been a lot shorter or skipped altogether. 
The movie has a couple of other flaws. Every human obstacle to the couple's relationship is conveniently done away with. Leticia's husband and son die. Hank's son dies and he packs his bigoted, foul mouthed father off to a black owned nursing home. In real life things don't work out this way and that was the films major hype point: it's supposed raw reality. 
Nonster's Ball is not as controversial or as great as the media makes it seem but it is a good movie. It's not something I'd want to watch every week but I'm glad I bought it.
