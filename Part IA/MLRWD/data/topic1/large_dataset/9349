I first caught this show in it's final season...in late night reruns.  And, goodness gracious, I was floored by the quality and consistency of the show.  So, when these DVDs went on sale, I had to have them.  And...I was speechless.  Absolutely fabulous.  Easily one of the greatest comedies of all time, and on the short list of best family shows of any kind.

Particularly fantastic was the episode "Smunday."  They easily blew through 3 or 4 plot twists, and at the climax of the episode I was literally gasping from horror, laughter and shock.  Hilarious!  Also, the sight gags on this show are funny, slightly exaggeratedly (hence the humor) and always with a touch of tenderness that highlights why family relationships are complex and unique and beautiful, even when their shameless and dysfunctional.  I think the episode "Malcolm Babysits" highlights this nicely, when Malcolm in babysitting for the "ideal" family, while his family is their own neighborhood's live Jerry Springer show, while camping in a trailer while their house is getting fumigated.  Sure, we know the moral is that there is no place like home, but the lesson isn't forced and is very entertaining.  Far from didactic, you barely notice between the humor.  And the young cast together are astonishingly good actors.  Muniz, in particular, handles his duplicitous "real-life" versus talking to the camera with a fluidity that I think most adults wouldn't be able to sell.

The extras are very enlightening as well with the voice-over commentary (although Frankie Mu&ntilde;iz in real life is a long-winded gasbag).  I also thought the Spanish dubbing (which I happen to speak) was well done also.

I could go on and on.  It was worth every cent I spent on it.  I just ache for the other seasons.
