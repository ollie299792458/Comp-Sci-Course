This is one of my all time favorite films. I remember it when it was first released and still regard it highly as a brilliant piece of cinematic art. Even though I was glad to have the chance again to see it on the big screen, I wasn't all that thrilled with some of the additions. Even though I loved seeing the additional footage, I thought the subliminals and the added musical score took away from the uniqueness of the film. The ascetic way that Friedkin originally presented the film was one of the main reasons the film was so incredible and effective. The lack of musical score, and then when it was used, its esoteric nature, was one of the factors that gave the film it's disturbing nature. The film didn't need a musical score to inhance the effect of the film like so many other films. The absence of it left you alone, naked, and raw as you witness the horror that was taking place on the screen. It was like you were in the house with them. And the subliminals were cheap. Some reviewers of the original felt that the scene where Chris goes up to the attic and the candle flares up was cheap effect, unworthy of the film. I felt the subliminals were even worse. So unnecessary. I agree with Friedkin and feel the original film is just fine and I don't think that the ending leaves one with a negative feeling. Evil is evil and even though the exorcism was a success, there still is going to be residual from the events that had transpired. This film is an incredible piece of work and is one of the top 10 films ever made, regardless of what AFI may think. Bravo!
