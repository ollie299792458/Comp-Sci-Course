I admit I have a special affinity with this film and therefore would probably offer a slighty biased review, it was made the same year my home was built. But the glaring fact is it is still a cracking film and superbly acted. It is a cracking pursuit film and mark's out what was to become Hitchcock's definitive style, paranoid pursuits, dhastidly spy plots and the scapegoated do gooder. I won't spell out the plot because if you don't know the 39 steps then you must have been living under a rock! This film is the first and best version, the 1950's version is credible but the 70's version is weak and pointless.

 Donat is cracking and it is such a shame he was taken away from us so soon, he died of an asthma attack in the 50's making "The Inn of the Sixth Happiness", with Ingrid Bergman.

 Carrol proves to be the first in a long line of Hithcock's cool blondes, she is feisty and forthright which although common now was unheard of in her time, woman usually played whimpering damsel's in distress so she really broke the mould.

 Again, after a brief flirtation in a Bob Hope film during the war years, she dissappeared from the silver screen.

 Carrol's Sister was killed in the London Blitz, after which she became a Nurse and she returned only to the London Stage after the WW2. This is a cracking film, the accents are terrible plummy and frightfully, awfully British, which kind of adds to it's appeal; it speaks as much of a lost Britain as it does of espionage. There is also a brief appearance by Peggy Ashcroft (Later "Dame") as a young, terrified, Scottish Crofters wife. EXCELLENT viewing!
