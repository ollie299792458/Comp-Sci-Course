Now that I have your attention, yeah...probably the top 5 worst movies ever! Like the other people that wrote reviews I saw the cover and thought it looked interesting. Being a zombie movie fan I picked it up. Yeah...I honestly thought it was a Chapelle Show skit and he was going to be playing a funny zombie Tyrone Bigums or something. Actually...no that would be insulting the quality of his show. Unlike the cover these aren't the traditional "undead" zombies we all know and love. These are the old voodoo zombies that have mystical $1.99 Spencer's gifts fake knives that, I'm guessing, welt the victim to death (I'm sure some of you've been hit by one of the fake knives and let me tell you it hurts, I couldn't imagine have voodoo zombies barely hitting me with them repeatedly). Then to add insult to injury after they kill you they eat their lunches, (that they obviously had in their pockets or in a brown bag) on your tummy. I would recommend this to people who are blind...and deaf, or someone who doesn't have a TV or DVD player and is in need of a door stop...or frisbee...or maybe a coaster for drinks...

This movie makes the low budget zombie movie "Meat Market" look like Steven Spielburg made it.
