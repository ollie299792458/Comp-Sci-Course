It's not a great movie, certainly, but Hell Ride has one important thing going for it - it's hard not to like it, despite its faults.

Here's the "plot" (such as it is): Pistolero (Larry Bishop) is the president of the Victors motorcycle gang, on a quest for vengeance against the leaders of a rival gang who are trying to muscle into his territory and who, 30 years ago, killed the woman he loved. He is joined in his quest by fellow Victors the Gent (Michael Madsen), Comanche (Eric Balfour) and Dennis Hopper, as they ride across the southwest seeking their enemies and rooting out traitors.

This movie is basically everything you'd expect from a "Grindhouse"-style picture produced by, you guessed it, the Weinsteins and Quentin Tarantino - lots of violence, some witty dialogue, and self-conscious Z-grade schlockiness. And it has certainly earned it's "R" rating, to be sure. However, the film - which, admittedly, is pretty hard to follow, and there is no plot at all to speak of, really - never loses its sense of crowd-pleasing fun. You are drawn into the camaraderie of the three leads and Larry Bishop, who also wrote, produced, and directed this film, does a good job at least of keeping the action moving. If you are looking for a downright fun, "B" movie flick, Hell Ride is the film for you.
