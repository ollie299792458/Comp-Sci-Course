I was expecting this to be B-Movie cheese, but this turned out to be a really good movie. Well, except for the rushed ending. It took it's time to set up the story and the plot. It was actually 45 minutes in before our protagonist actually captures the co-star of the film, the not-really-evil vampire, Tatiana. That's good, because it really fleshes out the plot, characters and the story. Like, we get to see Harry try to call the police and reach out for help several times before having to capture Tatiana himself as a very last resort. In most movies, the director or writer won't care enough to explain any of that. I wish we could've gotten to see how Tatiana was turned, but it's okay. There are other enjoyable characters in it too, such as the dispicable co-worker Javier, the supportive Paul Rudd look-alike co-worker and the Vietnam vet who lost his legs to a 90 pound vampire woman in the jungle during the war and spends his remaining years tracking them down online. All in all, this isn't a horror movie, but it is a good story, and everything was enjoyable to watch, up until the rushed, "we didn't have enough time to properly flesh out the ending" ending.
