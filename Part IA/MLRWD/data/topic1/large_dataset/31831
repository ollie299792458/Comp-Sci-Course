This is a dramatized Hollywood film, not a documentary. It was chosen as the manliest movie of all time in "The Big Damn Book of Sheer Manliness," but has much more to recommend it, of course. Much has already been written praising the screenplay, direction, and acting talents involved, particulary those of Olivier, Ustinov, and Laughton. I have no quibble with any of that. It does have a few flaws, however. Without going so far as to call it a 'noble failure,' one can point to elements that could have been handled better. In some scenes the background, ostensibly outdoors, is obviously and inexplicably a stage set, contrasting jarringly with the real outdoor shots seen throughout most of the film. The casting of Tony Curtis as Antoninus and John Gavin as Julius Caesar was a mistake. Curiously, these two characters are not in the Howard Fast novel, but were added for the film. Both actors were certainly chosen for their looks; speaking their lines doesn't seem to have been their strong point. With Gavin I'm constantly expecting him to trip over his tongue, forcing him to start over. And the score by Alex North, although some reviewers say good things about it, just doesn't work for me. Most of the time it has a contemporary Hollywood feel and does nothing to evoke the ancient world. (The 'Love Theme,' incidentally, has been recorded numerous times by jazz musicians like Bill Evans and Yusef Lateef.) Only the segments stripped down to trumpets and snare drums -- the martial music -- really succeed. At any rate, the film's virtues outweigh its faults, and is a remarkable achievement, coming out when it did, unlike almost anything which had gone before. It's worth many viewings. (BL, Tucker, GA)
