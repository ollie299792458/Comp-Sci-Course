Then that happened, then that happened, then that happened.... Anyone with a passable knowledge of Castro and the Cuban Revolution will realize that "Fidel" is little more than a dramatic chronicle of the most familiar episodes of Castro's life. The film is nearly a clich&eacute;. Add that the film is a three hours plus long and the acting is mediocre at best, the resulting sense of chore viewers experience is predictable.
Yet with all the time the movie allots itself (and sentences the viewer to), time, in places, is oddly prioritized. The Cuban missile crisis was a blip in history apparently.
Oh, there's more. There is the dissonance in film's perspective about Castro himself. The film doesn't suggest that Castro is a multifaceted, complicated character. Rather, the film takes a sudden and unpredictable shift in its point of view. Actually, the shift resembles a conversion. Castro goes from a visionary and precocious revolutionary leader to--presto!--the failed tyrant we know from the news and White House press briefings. I'm sure the conversion saved the film from the charge of pro-Castro ... that is all too familiar when anything the least bit laudatory about Castro or post-revolutionary Cuba is depicted. But, then, that's how propaganda works here.
