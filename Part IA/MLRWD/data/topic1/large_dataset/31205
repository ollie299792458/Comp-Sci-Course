Any of those who would dismiss this movie for its allegedly senseless violence or because they feel it's a pale imitation of Pulp Fiction simply do not understand Mexican culture.  Violence, verbal or physical, proliferates in Mexican culture; I think many of the reviewers (mostly overly sensitive gringos, I would gather) who are uncomfortable with this movie would probably be equally uncomfortable with the Mexican view of life inherited from the Spaniards--i.e., the fatalism, the grim resignation to the frequent ugliness and brutality of life, and a sort of crude vivacity.  Pienso que estas personas que no les gusta M&eacute;xico no tienen cojones.  But then again, most people want illusion not reality at the movies, which brings up the next point.  
As for the Pulp Fiction charge, this movie bears about as much relation to that movie as Picasso, in his early, rough stage, does to Andy Warhol's soup cans.  In Amores Perros, the violence, and, hence, the feeling, is real; in Pulp Fiction, it's trendy posing.  We cringe at the gore and we giggle at the jokes, then we forget the whole pop culture souffl&eacute; Tarantino has served up.  The people in Amores Perros are blood and guts--crude, yes, and occassionally ugly, but there's no doubt they're the real thing.  Quentin Tarantino has never delved this deeply.
I give this movie four stars instead of five because it's still at times subject to a youthful impetuousness that fits the first story beautifully but not the other two.  It's not quite great, but it's still mighty impressive.  And the middle story about the model losing her leg and enduring a romantic crisis with her lover is in the end rather tiresome--it's undeniably felt by the actors, but it seems like tawdry bourgeois angst or an episode from a melodramatic telenovela next to the urban blight and horrors of the first and third stories.
