My wife and I have been on a Scarlett Johansson kick lately. We can't seem to get enough of this beguiling, talented actress.

Starting with Lost in Translation (a bona fide classic), we searched IMDB for other movies Scarlett has appeared in. We located a few others (The Girl With the Pearl Earring and A Love Song For Bobby Long) at a local rental store and watched them both.

In Love Song, Scarlett is as sensual and alluring as Blanche Debois. She sizzles. Yet, she does so with an innocence that belies her raging sensuality. In the end, her performance is one that nearly steals every scene -- even if she's pictured in the background, casually smoking a cigarette or glancing off in the distance, or even listening to the other characters in the frame.

The story had enough plot twists to keep us guessing. Yet, at the same time, it seemed totally predictable. Go figure.

What surprised us most is John Travolta's performance. Hardly one of our favorite actors, Travolta (as the titular character) turned in a performance that I didn't think him capable of. He looked and acted seedy, like -- as Scarlett's character referred to him -- a "dirty old man." He wasn't dashing. There was nothing glamorous about him. In fact, there was very little to like about him. He was an old, gray-haired, sloppy drunkard.

Another actor who surprised us was Gabriel Macht who played Bobby's protege. He seemed to reveal as many emotions with just a pained or quizzical look on his face as most actors can by emoting all over the place. He was the perfect counterpoint to Bobby's flamboyance -- a quiet fellow alcoholic who knew better but didn't see a reason to quit.

His reason, as well as Bobby's, appears in the form of Scarlett Johansson's character. Typical plot twist. Yet, an atypical rendering elevated by performances that were mesmerizing.

This is a movie I'm sure we'll want to buy.

I recommend A Love Song for Bobby Long.
