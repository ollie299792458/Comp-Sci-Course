After seeing all of Kevin Smith's other movies, Clerks was the last one I saw. And I admit, I thought that it would be pretty outdated and probably not AS funny as his other movies (especially the humor from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, his latest and last of his Jersey Trilogy) mainly on the purpose that it's black and white, and seems old and all...but I was wrong. Clerks stands out as one of the funniest comedies available still today, and Kevin Smith's humor hasn't changed a bit, just evolved. Clerks is best compared with "Office Space" by Mike Judge (the guy who created Beavis and Butt-Head) for it's accuracy for portraying working employees. We follow Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran, who's also in many of Kevin Smith's other movies) and his day at the convience store as a clerk working on his day off. And there's Randal Graves, his next door working buddy who constantly shows up next to Dante behind the couter and they both pursue the meaning of life and more. And of course right around the corner we have Jay and Silent Bob, a couple of known drug dealers who constantly show up here and there in this flick, but more limited than in other Kevin Smith movies (for those who love the two heroic icons).
Clerks is a simple, insanely low-budget comedy that focuses on something that we all look for in a movie: smart dialogue. The way that Kevin Smith writes the dialogue in between his characters are pure original and genious, and Clerks is no exception.
So if you are looking for a graphically enhanced and special-effects filled flick, turn away from Clerks as far as you can, but if you like a good movie with excellent dialogue (although filled with extreme profanity and humor), Clerks is an ideal choice. It's a slacker and funny comedy.
