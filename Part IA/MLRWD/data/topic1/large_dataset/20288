I just received this collection series this week from my father for Christmas and I must admit, I was really worried from reading all the negative reviews on how some of the discs were scratched, skipping, etc. but right now I have seen a few episodes and there is absolutely nothing wrong with my particular set! I am SO happy to have this in my collection and my boyfriend is now super jealous b/c he's one of the biggest Friends fans ever. Now we can enjoy watching all the discs together. My only complaint was that I thought it would be all ten seasons in the ten boxes but instead it's set up in six boxes w/ each "friend" on the front. Friends is one of my favorite shows ever and I know I can always rely on this TV show when I am having a bad day and need a laugh. And the fact that my dad got it for a good price for only [...] w/ free shipping (right now it's [...]). The booklet is really colorful and really nice and organized and has all the episodes listed out. Any big Friends fan will really appreciate this when they don't have the individual boxed seasons and want to rewatch them or watch them for the first time and it's a perfect holiday gift for them. Enjoy!

EDIT // two years later, I let my friend borrow two boxes (there are six total). I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THE INDIVIDUAL SEASONS as you can just order one season if you lose it. in my case, it's a lot more complicated because I have lost the discs/boxes (3 and 4), and not the seasons, so there is no way for me to buy JUST the boxes that I lost. I would have to re-purchase the entire set all over again. Darn it.
