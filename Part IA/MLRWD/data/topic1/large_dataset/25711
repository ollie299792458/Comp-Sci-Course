I always liked Steve martin and Queen latifah...now that's the girl. I was reading how the movie isn't so great. But I expected less and got more.

You have steve martin a uptight lawyer who has been having a great time e-mailing a woman he thinks is a white female with a great job. oh god when he meets her, he's sooo dissapointed (cause its latifah).

Now what she wants is for him to help her clear her record (she just got out of prison). Now her world starts to slowly merge into his and it becomes funny. The best is Eugene Levy, that man should have had more screen time, he was the best, 5 stars. everytime he saw latifah his eyes would light up and he would try and say something sexy.

They showed the difference between the black and white world and how both sides see each other. but this is a stero typical comparsion. It was funny though because it's true.

then there was the money and education difference, which they didn't dig deep on.

I like how they made latifah smart and together.

Overall this was a fun watch.
