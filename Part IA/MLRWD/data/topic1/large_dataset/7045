It really does. You know, I noticed a small thing: the higher the rating given to this film - the more typos you will find in the review. A two-star will have a few small ones here and there, but nothing beyond "i  before e" or interchangeable suffices. A three-star may miss some  minor nouns and/or articles. I noticed a four-star state that "it  freaked my out". A five-star reviewer stated "goo" in the  review field - nothing more, just those three letters. How's that for brain  damage.
Now, to the actual film. It was horrid. Take it away and burn it.  Mere contemplation of handling that vile tape gives me skin rash. You know  something else? I don't remember the plot. I watched the thing three days  ago. &lt;hint, hint&gt;
How many characters does it take to make a film  horrible. By MKA's count, a LOT. This is basically what the movie does -  getting out as many characters as possible. It doesn't matter that none of  them ever get to say much, it does not matter that they have no  personalities, just make them come out. I don't care how: make them jump  out of walls, fall from ceilings, crawl out of dreams.
I just never  thought that Final Showdowns in MK heaven were turn-based. Turn-base makes  them look like they are just exchanging atacks. It should have never been  made into a turn-based combat... &lt;whisper, whisper&gt; IT WASN'T!
