This film was recommended to me by amazon.com because of my previous purchases of movies concerning the Vietnam War.  Every previous film that I have purchased gave the view of the war from the perspective of the American men who fought there.  This is the first film that I have seen that truly showed the side of the story from a Vietnamese viewpoint.

It is a gut wrenching saga of one young girl who grows into womenhood in a war torn country.  In the beginning of the film little is mentioned by how much harm the French caused in Vietnam.  Very little is said about the harm that the Chinese and Japanese caused either.  But both are mentioned in the film.

This young girl lives in a village that has stood for 1000's of years and has been victimized by so many wars.  Her village is then torn between supporting the Viet Cong and the South Vietnamese and American governments and their troops.  Her village is torn apart as well as her family.

Not to go to far into the plot or divulge to much information, I can only say that this movie touched my heart like no other.  I would have to rate it right up there with some of the best films I have ever seen.  It is well worth the effort to purchase and view.  I will see this film over and over.

Thank you, amazon.com, for recommending this film to me.
