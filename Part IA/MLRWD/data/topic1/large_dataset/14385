I received my DVD in the mail yesterday and promptly sat down to watch it. It was so compelling and I was so moved by the film, based loosely on the story of the writer and director, that I am certain that I will watch it many times more.  I can see how some might find this film corny and perhaps even silly. I think you have to believe in the underlying premise of the film (in soul mates/twin souls concept) in order to really enjoy the film. I must also say that I have never been a fan of Nicole Conn's; I thought Clare of the Moon was just poorly made and the acting left a lot to be desired.  The acting in Elena Undone, on the other hand, is top notch. The two actresses really portrayed every emotion of these characters brilliantly. It doesn't hurt that both actresses are also very beautiful!  I have watched tons of lesbian and gay cinema and this movie is certainly now in my top 5 (along with films like When Night is Falling and I Can't Think Straight). Kudos to the filmmakers and the cast of this film!!
