****(see 2nd paragraph)***Believe me, this has NOTHING to do with the actual movie. Casablanca is by far one of my favorite movies and I love it more the more I watch it. However, I just purchased it (for the second time in about a week) from FRONT ROW ENTERTAINMENT LLC, fulfilled by Amamzon. Both times I received it, there was a terrible gash on the back of the case that went all the way into the hard plastic of the case, a problem that had been "coincidentally" covered by extra stickers on the wrapping. The first time I got the movie, I was appalled and, while I only paid $7.something for it, I wasn't going to accept a hideous case. I sent it back and gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered it again for relatively the same price...and ultimately the same result. I just received the case about an hour ago and I can tell you that I am FURIOUS with this company. My assumption is that someone took a knife to the back of the case and cut it all to hell by accident and therefore resolved to cover up their mistake. Well I'm not going to pay for this atrocity. I am sending it back ASAP and getting my money back. I am NEVER ordering from this company again. I'll take my chances buying Casablanca elsewhere, even if that does mean I have to pay more money. For such an amazing movie, it deserves to be encased in a practically perfect case. I'll reserve judgement on other companies on Amazon selling this movie. As for those who don't care about the case of a movie, feel free to order from FRONT ROW ENTERTAINMENT LLC, just be prepared for a mangled case. I honestly hate to write a review so terrible in relation to this movie. But I paid good money expecting a pristine, undamaged case and I received a pathetically covered up gash instead. Twice. Take my advice please, don't waste your money on this company, it may be cheap, but believe me, it looks cheaper.
****UPDATE!*** I decided to give it one more try considering it was from a different company and it was coming by a different shipper. Same exact damage! What fresh hell is this? Absolutely dumbfounded. In fact, the damage is WORSE from this one! I got this one from what I believe is PONOS and fulfilled through Amazon. I now have reason to believe that the common link is Amazon, and therefore, I believe all cases fulfilled through Amazon are damaged, if I'm wrong I'm wrong, but considering this is the 3rd time this has happened, I feel it is only fair to update my review and now go after Goliath itself! DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON WHATSOEVER. I don't care if it's from a different selling company, amazon fulfills it. Save your money and go out to your local Walmart or Target, chances are they'll have it in the 5 dollar bin so it's a better buy elsewhere. Shame on you, Amazon!
