Huge fan of the Underworld with the 1st (dominant vampires) and 3rd (dominant lycans) being my favorites.  The 2nd was a disappointment to me as it killed off Corvinas and his two sons (one bitten by bat and the other by wolf).  This 4th installment is dead last imo.  The futuristic story line that has Selene and her child venturing into a world where Vampire and Lycan are hunted by humans is boring.  The made up - unknown city where a giant lab and their workers control the population through vaccinations is very similar to Resident Evil.  Although, isn't it the same story line in a lot of D list movies.  This installment is nothing more than images thrown together with fight scenes, very little dialogue, Lycan heads exploding with gunfire, and a lot of fog/mist.  There apparently isn't much daylight in this pharmaceutically controlled futuristic city.  For some reason, they are unwilling to let go of the character, Michael.  Note: he was horrible in the second installment and having his offspring run around doesn't do anything for this storyline.  With the elders gone, the Vampires underground, and Lycans looking like oversized rats this movie failed.  A story as old as time:  Vampire against Lycan and humans seeking protection from the Vampires.  It shouldn't have changed.
