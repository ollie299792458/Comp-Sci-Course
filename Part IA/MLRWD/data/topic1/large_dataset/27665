Lots of other reviewers have already described the plot, music, and performers in this excellent classic, so I won't re-invent the wheel here.  My 4-star rating is directed more at the technical aspects of this particular DVD edition.  
To begin with, it comes on a single disk, with the movie on one side and the extra material on the other.  The disk itself is plain (i.e., no graphics) and the titles are in teeny-tiny print around the hole in the middle -- print so tiny that I cannot read it without my bifocals.  A minor complaint, perhaps, but highly relevant to the senior generation to which my wife and I belong -- the very same generation that is a big part of the market for this movie.  Frankly, this format strikes me as a cheap-out -- and why do that with such an important classic?  Especially since the list price for this DVD is $19.98, i.e. it's not exactly a "bargain" edition. 
I would have preferred two separate disks -- even if they cost a bit more -- with different graphics on each.  So, I'm docking this edition a star for it's inconvenient format, and I certainly hope this one-disk idea does not become common, heaven forbid.
On the plus side, the many interesting "extras" include a very nice background piece, narrated by director Norman Jewison, explaining the history of Jews under the Russian Tzar, the "Pale of Settlement," the pattern of village life, the various social strata, etc., such as portrayed in the film.  This is especially useful for showing "Fiddler" to gentile groups who might not even be aware that the characters are Jewish.  (REALLY!  I have actually met people who thought of Tevye and friends as generic "Russians" and had no idea that the movie was about Jews, even though the opening number, "Tradition," features shots of Hebrew texts and synagogue art.  Then again, maybe people don't know the difference between the Hebrew and Cyrillic alphabets?)
