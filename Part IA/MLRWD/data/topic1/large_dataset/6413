I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is a very good sequel to I Know What You Did Last Summer. (Duh) Anyway . . .
Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) has moved away from South Port and is trying to forget what happened last summer when a fisherman killed two of her friends and attacked her and her high school sweetheart Ray (Freddie Prinze Jnr). When her and her best friend Carla (Brandy) win a contest to the Bahamas Julie, Carla, Carla's boyfriend Tye (Mekhi Phifer) and a boy with an extreme crush on Julie named Will (Matthew Settle) head off to the sunny island. But when they get there they not only discover it is storm season but find out the whole trip has been a hoax and the angry fisherman is also on the island determind to finish off his job.
This film is better than the first because there is more action and definitely more gore. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jnr return from the first film which is excellent because they have a very good on screen chemistry. The only thing I didn't like is the ending. I would be happy if they made a third film to explain it but they haven't have they. Was it a dream like the first film's ending or was it actually real? Did poor Julie really get massacred under her bed while the credits rolled? All in all I think it's a really good movie but I wish the ending was definite and that they made a third film starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jnr and Brandy!
