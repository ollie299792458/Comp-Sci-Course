What is interesting about all the reviews here is that they are all from ardent fans of Leonard Cohen. Each message (and score from 1 to 5) has a little different justification, some appreciative of the honor given LC by the performers on this DVD, others, disappointed at the musical out-come.

Depending on how you count, this is the 2, 3 or 4th tribute album. "I'm Your Fan" was a punk interpretation of LC. "Take This Longing" performed by Peter Astor was like taking a bandage off old wound and finding it still pink and sore. Bono had already performed on "Tower of Song". He's eerie and emotive flight on Hallelujah still troubles me. On this new tribute, watching Antony or Beth Orton struggle to maintain control under the power of the music was probably worth the purchase price of the DVD.

I think we've discovered over the years its not easy to perform a Leonard Cohen song. His songs aren't easy to reinterpret; he brings too much intelligence to them. How many bad "Suzannes" are there out there? Some songs though, like "Bird on a Wire" have become signature pieces of other artists - like Willy Nelson.

Part of the success of this DVD is its sense of musical continuity. Julie Christensen and Perla Batalla perform back-up on many of the songs adding a familiar sound and perhaps even much needed insight to the performer on how to get the best of this difficult music. Their duo on "Anthem" is taking something that is more concept than song and turning into a riveting and breathless moment of celebration.

In the interviews which accompany the concert, LC tells his story without regret or apology. From frivolous youth in Greece, to the hard search on Mt Baldy, to resignation and acceptance that comes with age. He ends with a quote from the Gita. I think if you are a fan of Leonard Cohen, you will want to see this movie.
