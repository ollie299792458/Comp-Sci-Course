'This Boy's Life' is, said one critic is, "The best coming-of-age movie since 'Stand By Me' (another great movie), and he is right. The film clearly tells the story of a boy growing up in the '60's with his single mother, and they're just trying to get by. Life is hard for them, obviously. So Toby "Jack" (performed brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio) promises himself he'll do good in school, "make straight-arrow friends", and "keep his nose clean". Then comes Dewight.

  As soon as Dewight joins the family, Toby begins to rebel. He makes friends that he has a habit of smoking, cursing, and talking bad with. His grades slip and he is constantly getting in trouble. He hates his life and can't seem to settle down.

  If this sounds like just another drama about some kid to you, well, it's not. You just have to watch the picture to see. The dvd isn't in the greatest shape (the picture is a little fuzzy and the only extras are the trailer and a brief filmography for some of the people involved in the movie) so I would suggest catching it on tv sometime. Overall, I would give it four stars. A must-see movie!
