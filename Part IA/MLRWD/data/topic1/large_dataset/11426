The film is one of the best in its class.  I had watched both the films and DVD more than 10 times because I enjoyed the acting performance of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Froster.
The film and the whole story are so well defined, and it leads us to an imagination that we are almost part of the FBI investigation and it leads the audiences to try to track the killer(s) down with Hannibal Lecter, the wonderful physcho criminal in this film.
As a whole, I personally feel this film should be the best thriller in 90s. It definitely scores 5 stars.
I just love it.  I had ordered one in last March but the DVD does not have any English subtitle in it so that I order this again with English subtitle.
I just want to share this original but not forgeting its 2nd series, 'Hannibal' which is also a classic in this catagory because the story is so well-organised and reasonable which lead the audiences to another frigthening situation and reflect Dr Lecter's true face. The film is well written and planned, the audiences do not know what will happen next with the unexpected act of Dr H.Lecter.
