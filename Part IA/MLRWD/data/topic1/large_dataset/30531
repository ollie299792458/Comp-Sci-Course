I just got my copy of Riki-oh yesterday, and couldn't wait to see it. After such a build up about the movie I have to admit I was not that impressed.  Yes it's funny, and yes it's gross, but I have seen much worse. Maybe I'm desensitized, but is the scene of Riki tying his arm tendons any more gross than the chick in Evil Dead biting off her own hand? I found Dead Alive much more gory, and as for weird, check out Wolfen Ninja with Pearl Cheung. Now that's a weird movie! Don't get me wrong this movie is worth watching, and adding to your collection (if u like this sort of stuff). I would recommend it. Also am I wrong or was that Kuo Chui in the role of "Andrew"? It looked just like him, but I didn't see his name in the credits.  Why is the movie called Riki-oh when the characters name is Riki-ho?  And why was one of the characters in the prison played by a woman?  Want laughs? Check out the death of Rikis girlfriend, and the obnoxious warden's son who acts like a toddler. How exactly does Riki stop bullets with his bare chest?  Why is he so strong?  If he grew up in an orphanage how does he even know who his uncle is?  Could the assistant wardens hook for a hand be any bigger? What are those pills he keeps hidden in his fake eyeball?  Am I trying to make too much sense out of a senseless movie?  No, just kidding around. Four stars check this one out.
