Rarely does a movie have nearly too many characters and push three hours . . but then again, some of the finest films to grace the screen have such qualities.  And Sunshine is one of these films.  
Sunshine's strength does not lie primarily, as one might think at first glance, in its unflinching portrayal of the defining trials and tribulations of Jewish Hungary throughout of the 20th Century. Rather, the film convinces with its portrayal of universal human yearnings that, for all their variances and inflections through time, resonate in a single, achingly human voice, just as Ralph Fiennes himself plays the protagonist from each of the three generations of the family depicted in the film.
I was surprised to learn that some think that this movie seeks to propound such asinine positions as 'Jews should not assimilate,' or that the language of 'freedom' or 'security' should be embraced, or discarded.  While Sunshine's tale is grounded in the legacy of a people historically marginalized, it behooves us to appreciate not only the unique character of the persons and culture portrayed, but also of the undeniable similarity of the same to all those who may but watch their actions on a screen.  
Rarely have such eternal themes such as love, sex, ambition, justice, and compassion been illuminated in so vast a manner, and yet, simulaneously, with such coherence and vibrance.  Sunshine is not a film to be missed, but rather, one to be cherished.
