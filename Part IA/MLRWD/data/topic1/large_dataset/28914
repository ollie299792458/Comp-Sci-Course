Whew.  I love this movie even more than the original Escape From New York.  Both are great works of speculative urban action (did I just make that phrase up?) with tense, clock-racing suspense.  It is true that Escape From L.A is more a rewritting of Escape From New York but if it wasn't then it wouldn't be called Escape From L.A.  They would have titled it Snake's Vacation or something.  Many people just got too attached to the original that they couldn't enjoy the film for what it is.  I don't quite consider this movie a sequel.  The Escape duology is, to me, more like a couple of stand-alone films that take place in different dimensions.  I believe the reason it took so long to make this film is they wanted to wait until it was the year depicted in Escape From New York (1997).  it make sense when you think about it.  I do agree, however, that the surfing scene is pretty lame looking but understandably so.  Bruce Campbell as a wonderful cameo appearance as the Surgeon general.  I still love to watch the DVD of Evil Dead II where Bruce recounts his work with Kurt Russel on this film.  I was hoping that this DVD would have a Russel commentary on it so I might have heard him speak of Bruce in the same manner.  Alas they skipped on special features.  The best part of the movie was the ending.  The ultimate revenge of Snake for all the crappy jobs he's been forced into taking for the greater "good."  I loved it very much.  "Welcome to the Human race."  Good-bye, folks!
