As you may or may not know from my other reviews, I love films, pure and simple. Regardless of the subject matter, a good film is a good film. This happens to be a great film in the horror genre. It still astounds me that this film is PG, because if this film was released today, I am sure it would be hard R or NC-17 for intensity. If the MPAA can grill Wes Craven for making Scream too intense, this film will redefine the word for you. This film, I feel might just be the scariest film of all time. There are alot of great horror films out there and a lot of crap, but this film dares to get under your skin in the ways Something Wicked This Way Comes does or The Watcher in the Woods. The mood regresses you into a child state and a child's point of view towards horror and subconsiously we are forced to relive our own nightmares while viewing this film. It begins unforgetably and epicly with the Star Spangled Banner and contines bit after bit building suspense and humanity within the characters and us that by the time the film erupts in a frenzy of terror, we are drained and tired and scared to the bone. Closets devour children so do trees. Clowns attack and drag you under the bed. In the bathroom at night, a feeling comes over you and you feel the need to rip your face off. Demons jumping out of the closet, fathers being told to threaten to hit their children, maggots, dwarf women, etc--image after image is so frightening and yet clouded in a suburben neighborhood trying to lend credence that this is normal. At night in the dark, this film starts strobing on the walls with the flickering tv and puts one in a mood that makes you realize how tame so many of todays horror films are. This film was PG, so was Gremlins and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom--all were oversaw by Spielberg and all were reasons the PG 13 now exists, though by today's standards these films would be R if not NC-17. What terrible times we live in.
