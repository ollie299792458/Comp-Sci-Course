Is this a story about a traumatized horse, a physically and emotionally scarred teenaged girl, or a taboo romance between the rugged Montana rancher who "talks" to horses and the girl's (much married!) mom?  Answer:  It's all three!  I found this movie engaging, right from the  beginning.  I was totally caught up in the story, wondering what was going  to happen next; yet due to the superb acting and fascinating interplay of  personalities, even MORE caught up in it the second time around!  Yes,  there is a definite parallel in plot to The Bridges Of Madison County,  (should she stay with her husband, or risk everything to explore the  undeniable passion she feels with this other man, and while we're at it, is  it possible to love two men at once)?  Although some might deem this a  "woman's" movie, my husband grudgingly admitted to enjoying it.  (And no, one does NOT have to be "into horses" to get  "into" this movie)!  A beautifully enduring addition, to any  movie collection!
