How excited my daughter and I were to sit down and watch this! We love old movies. We love scary movies. We love artsy movies. I loved Robert Mitchum in Cape Fear. Reading all the positive reviews how could this miss??? Oh but it did.

 Suffice to say this is no Cape Fear. There was no simmering menace in Mitchum's performance, he mostly just came off as silly and bumbling. The adult performances were mostly overwrought, even for the time and considering acting styles have changed over the years. The only thing this film has going for it is some really good cinematography in places, memorably Willa under the water.

My daughter wondered how many times one person could fall. I  wondered if the director was off to the side telling Mitchum to try to act like Frankenstein as he chased the children....seriously who really chases someone holding their arms out like that? They could rename this Night of the Bumbler and market it as a comedy- we were certainly laughing.

Now I know there may be people commenting on my review blasting me and claiming I don't get it, which is just one more puzzling thing about this movie. After watching it I decided to check and see if there were any negative reviews. Many of the one star reviewers were attacked with a viciousness I usually only see in political book reviews. I noticed that the five star reviewers were not attacked and told they were stupid and didn't get it. Why is this?
Maybe I don't get it. Perhaps the German expressionism is just over my head. But, like STD's, speeding tickets, lice, and MRSA, there are some things most people try not to get. :)
