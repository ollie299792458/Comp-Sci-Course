This is classic John Wayne and Howard Hawks.  If you love John Wayne movies you'll love this one.  Now personally I enjoyed El Dorado better than this one and sure they are basically the same movie, but they are different enough that you can watch them both and enjoy them for different reasons.

In Rio Bravo, unlike El dorado, Wayne is the sheriff and he is definitely the law.  This is a powerful man that knows his job.  Dean Martin is his drunken deputy, Dude, who fell apart over a woman we never meet.  Part of the fun and drama of this movie is Martin becoming the man he used to be while he and Wayne keep guard over the murderous Joe Burdette played by a smug Claude Akins, while dodging bullets and threats from Nathan Burdette (Joe's wiser brother) played by John Russell.

Along for laughs (and there's plenty) are Walter Brennan playing the old crippled jail hand Stumpy and Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez as the hotel owner.  Of course there's the love interest for Wayne as well, and although done ok, it really isn't the reason to keep watching this movie over and over again.

Rio Bravo isn't Wayne's best movie, but it is one of my favorites and one I can continue to watch year after year.
