Caves of Androzani was a high point for Doctor Who in many ways. First and foremost, it marked the peak of the series audience viewing and appreciation figures for the next five years - it was all downhill from here. More importantly, it was arguably the last ambitious and creative story that would be broadcast before the series degenerated into pantomime. The stark contrast between the gripping, emotional story in this episode and the sheer lunacy of Colin Baker's premier, The Twin Dilemma is impossible to ignore. 
The scripting, pacing, and performances in this episode are simply brilliant. Peter Davison turns out the best performance of his time, skillfully balancing the Doctor's struggle for his own life with his unwavering impulse to protect the innocent. Superior production values and direction create gritty, edge-of- your seat drama throughout.
With the obligatory extras and the excellent remastering courtesy of The Doctor Who Restoration Team, Caves of Androzani is a five star disc all around. If you can only buy one episode from Peter Davison's era as the Doctor, this should be it.
