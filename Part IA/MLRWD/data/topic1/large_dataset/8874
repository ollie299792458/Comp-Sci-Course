Ok..so this movie isn't at all historically accurate. As the "outraged" Navajo woman stated, there was a HUGE age difference between the real Pocahontas and John Smith. If you read the biography of Pocahontas, you can find out the truths and untruths behind this Disney movie. The fact is, knowing Disney was going to do this movie should have let people know that it would be sugar coated and somewhat stereotypical. Explaining to a young child why a 40 year old would even be attracted to a 12 year old would be difficult. The basis of the story: John Smith and company arriving in Virginia in 1607 to find gold and then meeting with the Powhatan tribe, is there. Children can learn the disturbing treatment the Native Americans recieved later on in junior high and high school.  Disney does however let children know the value of talking out differences and seeing beyond color and outward differences to find what life and love are truly about. Not to be completely cliche, but, if nothing else, this movie does show children that it's what's inside that counts.
If you want to see a historically correct portrayal of Pocahontas and John Smith...don't watch a Disney movie.
