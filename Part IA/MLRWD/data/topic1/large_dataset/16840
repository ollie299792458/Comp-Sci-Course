Ive had a chance finally to view the film at home, in australia, after having to get a DVD (region 2)from britain.Luckily it plays on my Laptop.
This is a really underrated film about world within worlds. An existential film noir where the gumshoe is a scientist, and the secret to be uncovered is really astonishing.
I was surprised by the very Dickian story of a  scientist creating a virtual reality system, murdered for knowing too much, and sends the hero off on a similar voyage of discovery; a mysterious woman, a dogged police detective...
What is our world also wasnt real?
Like and unlike the excellent Matrix and Dark City, this film makes a very diffent statement about what our world is what reality is. It seems to lie between the two, but there is no superhero self discovery...this makes the film more relatable.
There are issues with the film in that the dead scientist fears he may be killed...but by whom? And how does he come to learn the true nature of his world...Perhaps he does so thru creating his own simulated world, and finally connects the dots.
and why does the older scientist have a pronouced german accent if he had lived his youth in Los Angeles? HMMM
Well acted and produced wih excellent production design, and a surprisingly charming love story. The actors are terrific as is the music and pacing. and the end song Erase Rewind has a canny poignancy.
The actors were chosen for being able to play different characters.
