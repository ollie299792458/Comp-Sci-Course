Based on a skit that was never hugely popular, in and out of the theatres in a sneeze, and did I mention it's from SNL Studios? 
Despite having three solid strikes seemingly against it, Ladies' Man may well be SNL's sleeper success, a genuinely funny film that actually stands up under multiple re-viewings.  
Meadows never breaks character as the lisping 70s lover man, who manages to leave men envious, and women asking "how does he get girls with those awful lines," particularly when Meadows' so-bad-he's-good character is placed in contrast to Billy Dee Williams, essentially playing himself, cool and oh so fly.
The plot is short and sweet, held together fairly well, although the ending is, admittedly, Hollywood manufactured claptrap that irritates but doesn't ruin the film.  
The supporting cast is superb, which gives Meadows a few moments to take a breather, and also doesn't leave one character to carry the entire film.
Not a good first date movie, but a good third date movie.
