Fantastic, brilliant picture!

This movie is well worth your time. The acting is impeccable, everyone delivers to the fullest. The cinematography is beautiful and compelling. The costumes are jaw-droppingly fabulous. This film is a delight to watch.

Really the only complaint, and others have made it here, is that there is a bit of a lack of chemistry between Deronda (as played by Hugh Dancy) and Miss Lapidoh (as played by Jodhi May). They both play their parts brilliantly, but you almost find yourself pulling more for Mrs. Grandcourt simply because there is a crisp romantic tension between she and Deronda, whereas you always know that Deronda admires Lapidoh, but the chemistry isn't so palpable.

Really, I would give this 4.5 stars out of 5, but you're not allowed to, thus the 4 out of 5. Again, if you like Austen adaptations, or BBC period pieces you will not be disappointed by this. It's marvelous.

By the way, my title, about Zionists enjoying the piece is intended as Monty Python-esque tongue-in-cheek, so I hope I don't offend anyone.
