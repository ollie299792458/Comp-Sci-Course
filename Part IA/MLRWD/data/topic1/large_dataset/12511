WARNING: I have watched the first two 1 hour episodes of Life After People which begun airing on the History Channel April 2009.  The season is slated for a total of 10 hour long (including commercials) episodes, but this DVD is only 90 minutes.  So I'm guessing you only get 2 episodes, which is a shame, as I would gladly buy the entire season based on my experience so far.  However, knowing that, on to the review:

The premise is that some disease wipes humans completely off the planet, and the film begins 1 day after humans are gone.  This leaves you on your own to ponder how this extermination could happen, and how likely it is.  There was a fascinating book I heard about through the Daily Show/Colbert on this topic, but the cool thing about this History Channel special is that you get to visually experience what no human being would be able to see--dams crushing after the force of billions of gallons of water overwhelmed them, buildings collapsing after their steel rusted, animals escaping and running free, etc.  Several experts were interviewed and they filmed on location in several interesting spots such as a deserted island in Japan that was once the most populous spot in the world, where you can see how the saltwater has attacked the large buildings and plants attacked roadways.  It makes one think how quickly evidence of man would be removed.  I hope the entire boxed set is released at a future date!
