Actually, I give this 3 1/2 stars. I'm a big Mifune/Kurosawa fan, but the extremely slow start of this movie really took it down a notch or two.  I thought the expository monologue in the beginning was rather dissapointing.  I would have expected Kurosawa to just "show" that happening rather than have it explained to you.  Also, the sequence with Murakami (Mifune) walking through the rough parts of post-WWII Tokyo was a bit longer than it had to be.  The footage was very interesting, but it just seemed to slow the pace of the movie down to a crawl.

However, once Murakami picks up the trail of his stolen firearm, the pace pf the movie picks up as well. You could feel the atmosphere of sweltering heat as Murakami and Sato (Shimura) make their way through the investigation. It's also interesting how Sato has a black-and-white view of the criminal mind whereas Murakami can see the shades of grey. For Murakami, not all criminals are "just bad people", sometimes they're just average folks pushed to the edge by harsh circumstances. Both Murakami and the man he is pursuing have had similar experiences, yet both men made completely different choices when they found themselves at a crossroads. This is a fascinating story about despair, choices, and consequence. Any Mifune/Kurosawa collaboration is worth checking out. While this one doesn't measure up to others quite as well, it's still worth a look.

Lastly, Criterion did an excellent job with this movie: great transfer, good subtitles, commentary, a 32 minute documentary, and great interactive menus all brought to you in a very handsome package.  A great buy for those who want more bang for their buck in their DVDs.
