Yeah, yeah, Brosnan went on to work in The Movies.

But the show Remington Steele, arguably, only made it to television in the first place because of the accomplished work of Stephanie Zimbalist. She was the "name" when the series began.

That is why I tuned in. To see Stephanie at work.

She already had quite a resume of fine TV roles, I was glad to see her get a series.

And I watched every ep, and delighted in her character. And as time went by, the skinny guy:}, with the odd accent and great hair began to grow on me. Together, they were so very watchable.

Then the chemistry began to work. The writing. The timing.

Everything about that show worked. Adding Doris Roberts was a

stroke of genius. Kudos to the writers that brought her to the show. Laura Holt's wardrobe changes, the tweaking of the second season, all the fine tuning that went on really jazzed the series up.

We will never know for sure what off-screen enmity passed between

the two main players.

Neither Stephanie or Pierce ever let it intrude into their onscreen roles.

Well, that is until those last, was it 6 eps they and we were forced to endure&lt;ugh>. Ghastly.

Leaving Stephanie Zimbalist, the Star of the show, off the cover is a grievous insult to true admirers of the show.

Whoever, ultimately, made that decision,I give you a loud and obnoxious rasberry!

But, we can't expect the "money people" to care

about what made the series work.

I'll buy it with only Pierce on the cover because I know

much of the contents were made memorable because of

Stephanie. Her beauty, her intelligence, her outstanding talent that gave us a truly engaging portrayal of Laura Holt.
