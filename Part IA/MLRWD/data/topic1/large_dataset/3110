Some acting's bad, but besides that "Belly" is an everyday crime film, only with alot of style and alot of truthfulness.  DMX and Nas star as Tommy and Sincere(a modern day Butch and Sundance as Sincere puts it).  They are thugs who rob night clubs.  Then Tommy finds out about this new kind of drug, hooks up with his Jamaican druglord friend Lennox(one of the coolest performances), and builds an empire in Nebraska.  Everything's cool until Knowledge(rapper Power) gets locked up and starts screwing Tommy's business up.  He recruits Shameek(Method Man) to hunt them down and kill them.  At the same time, Sincere starts to reconsider his lifestyle.  
This isn't the greatest crime drama ever, but it is cool.  DMX gives an outstanding performance.  Nas' Sincere seemed a little dreamy at times, but his role still works.  T-Boz outacts Nas because of the scene when Method Man breaks into her house and she freaks him out when she pulls a gun on him.  Method Man gives an alright performance, but his role was too small.  Taral Hicks plays Tommy's girl Kiesha, who in the end symbolizes woman power as she fights off Method Man.  
As for the movie, there are alot of memorable scenes, the most being the opening nightclub robbery.  Neon lights, glowing eyes, and quick getaways.
This is probably the biggest Hip-Hop cult movie.  For these being debut actors and a debut movie director, this movie's amazing.  The best is that most of the same things that we found wrong with this film, Hype(the director) found himself.  It would've been better if it hadn't been edited so much(Hype says in the commentary that the movie was like 3 hours originally).  The last stand of Lennox is a little like the last stand of Tony Montana in Scarface, but it is more realistic and stylish.  Anyways, good performances, great directing, awesome cult classic.  
Cop this!
