As a long time fan of the old series, I was leery of a "new" updated movie. However I was quite surprised by the treatment

given to S&H. This movie treats the old show with respect, while

giving a new spin on the buddy cop formula. Starsky & Hutch work

together for the first time. However they WORK together, instead

of the tired old bickering that is usually protrayed in these movies.Stiller and Wilson bring a new life to these beloved characters that while new, also invokes the old series.

Snoop Dogg is great as Huggy Bear, infusing him with a more realistic approach as the street informent. Rather than the old

comedic approach by Antonio Fargas, from the old TV series.

Any fan of the old show should enjoy this movie quite a lot.

Yes, there is a lot to laugh at. But fans of the old show will

enjoy many viewings spotting little inside jokes to the old show

to which this movie is inspired by. I enjoyed this movie greatly

and have seen it a few times. It never fails to make me laugh,

and I hope they make a sequel. And yes, the car looks GREAT!!.
