Like all the others mentioning the film's unintentional hilarity, I have to compliment Herzog on making such a dryly humorous work.  Treadwell had no business out there among the bears, and obviously had unplugged himself from reality long before his untimely demise.  I honestly think he was trying to work up a demo tape for a "Crocodile Hunter" type of program, with his over-the-top proclamations and such (suggesting the fishermen threatened to kill him the following year, f.ex.), and might have made the error into buying into the B.S. he was selling to others.  It's tempting to bring up Darwin when discussing a subject like this, but that's best left for the viewer to judge.  One last thing: another reviewer mentioned there were no actors in this film, apart from Timothy Treadwell.  This isn't so.  The fellow with the salt-and-pepper hair and apparent nose-job was a small-time actor friend of Tim's, and he seemed to be acting during his interview segments.  Perhaps that's unfair to suggest, but it seemed that his statements were contrived by his wording and the way he delivered them.  He was only moments away from shaking his fists at the heavens in outrage, which is something that few Joe Sixpacks have ever done or will ever think about doing.  The end result was a film about what happens when those that deal in fantasy have a head-on with reality and the tragedy that ensues.  There are no real lessons learned by Treadwell's death and nothing is gained by this film, in that if someone doesn't understand the dangers involved in undertakings such as Tim's, that is a person that is probably destined for an early death, anyway (playing chicken with trains, rattlesnake handling, playing with matches at the gas pump, or whatever).
