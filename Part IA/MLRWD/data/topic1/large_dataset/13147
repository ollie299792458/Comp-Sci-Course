As noted below, color correction and image adjustments are as good as it gets. In most scenes it's hard to see the frame joins. Occasionally there is a weird camera movement or screen action to bring it to your attention, but mostly it's hard to see.

Disc 1 - The documentary is excellent and the transfer is something like 2:78.1- very wide. The image joins are also more noticeable here than on Disc 2.

Disc 2 - SmileBox edition that simulates the Cinerama screen is curved and larger on the sides than the middle. A little odd at first, but once I moved a bit closer to the screen it really came alive. About as near as you can get to the theatre experience. Very cool!!

After seeing clips of "2001: A Space Odyssey" in the SmileBox format in the documentary I want this title released that way, too. Even though it was not shot in 'true 3 camera Cinerama' like this film, it was shown on the huge Cinerama screen. Many of the scenes would benefit from the curved screen effect. It's Warner Bros, too. Maybe a future 'Special Edition' SmileBox Blu-Ray?
