I will start with I have only tried one video. I tried the Abs video. I recently started dieting and was really excited about this video collection. I thought it would be great to start doing some exercise at home when I didn't make it to the gym. I got plantar faciitis in my feet from working out and I am no longer able to workout. I thought I could at least do the Abs video because I would not be on my feet. Well the abs video is completely done standing. Kinda a cool concept if I could be on my feet for thirty minutes. I was was upset wtih the fact that you need hand weights for the video. I didn't see anywhere that it stated you would need handweights. I thought you would for the arms video but from the introduction it looks like you need them for all the videos. Its an extra expense I didn't plan on. And more importantly when I decided to do the workout I found I couldn't until I got them. I know for me i want to work out when I first decide to and if I delay it I usually don't want to workout later. I did get hand weights but have only done the video twice. I think if I could have just done it when I was first excited about it that I would have done it more. I also didn't like the warm-up. It just showed the girls working out and this quiet voice in the background was talking. It was hard to hear and they switched exercises without letting you know verbally. I can't say I don't recommend the video but it was deffinitely lacking in some basic instructions
