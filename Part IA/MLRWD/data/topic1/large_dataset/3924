No sex! No kissing! No hugging. No holding hands, not even a handshake; almost no kind words--the closest thing to an endearment is a secret ballot. This might just be my favorite romantic movie.

Blatant political satire (objections to voting at gunpoint, pulling votes out from under a rock) and social commentary are the setting for a slow-motion love story. The plot is simple: the ballot-collecting job of an idealistic, can-do election agent and her cynical soldier escort is thwarted by the malaise and indifference that hold sway on a backward rural island, then the girl gets on an airplane and flies off into the sunset, leaving the guy to his life of sitting on a plank staring out at the sea. Sounds glum, but the real action is in the unspoken rapport creeping subtly between the agent and the soldier.

It takes almost two hours to get to the place most movies pass by under the opening credits. Like the guy says at the beginning, (and again at the end): "Nothing ever happens on time." Everything in this movie takes forever, but time's up before you know what's happening. Then she's gone. Man, that island is going to be really lonely now, until the next election day. Only love could make that seem, as it does, like a happy ending.
