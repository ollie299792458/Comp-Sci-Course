This movie is by far the best in The Fast and The Furious franchise. People who say this movie has no plot has no idea what this movie is about. That's what the whole point is. It's about drifting not about a guy and a girl driving off into the sunset to spend the rest of their lives together. For once! Paul Walker is not in the movie. I enjoyed his act in the first film but the second just made me go, "Huh?". Tokyo Drift gave me more hope that racing films will survive in the future. The scenes were amazing just on DVD, although some Japanese scenes were filmed in the U.S. This was by far the greatest movie and thank God the main theme was drifting and might I add - not bad for a title. I like the acting by Lucas Black and it was pretty nice to bring back Vin Diesel in the end to try and connect everything. Black looked a little too old to be playing a role of a high school kid but it's all good. I watched this movie about 10 times and would still watch it just for the drift scenes. Note to future producers of racing films- follow this movie's example.
