I was really excited to see that there was going to be a third Austin Powers movie, since I love the first two movies. But when Goldmember came out, I was pretty disappointed. All of the jokes showed up in the last two movies and have been tired out.
In this movie, Austin Power's father is captured by an evil Dutch man named Goldmember. He loved gold so much that when he lost his genitalia in a boating accident, he replaced his "bits and pieces" with solid gold. He planned to bring down the comet Midus 22, which was solid gold, onto the North Pole, and flood the Earth. Austin had to travel back in time a time machine at Gold Member's disco in order to save his father and thwart Dr. Evil's and Goldmember's schemems. Not only did this happen, but Scott Evil, Dr. Evil's son, started losing his hair and eventually turned evil at the end of the movie. There is also a surprising ending involving Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Nigel Power's (Austin's dad) that you do not want to miss.
I have heard that there will be another Austin Powers movie in which Scott Evil will be the evil character, but this series of movies has been stretched out to the point of exhaustion. As I said before, most of the jokes have appeared in all three movies, and the plot is almost always the same. Also, it's sometimes like, "Oh please, how can those characters be so utterly immature and pathetic?" The characters in Goldmember and the other two Austin Powers movies can just be preposterous sometimes. PLEASE, DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE AUSTIN POWERS MOVIES!!
