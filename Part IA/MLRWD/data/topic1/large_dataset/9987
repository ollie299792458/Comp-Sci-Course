I phoned the producer, Lad Allen, and asked him whether he or Lennart Moller (author of The Exodus Case, the book this video is based on) had seen the gold wheel or know the GPS coordinates of the gold wheel. Allen's answer was "NO".

So what? Well, a Nashville TV producer's wife "was told by one of Ron Wyatt's sons that the chariot wheels that Ron supposedly discovered in the Gulf of Aqaba were planted there by Ron", and John Baumgardner, a Christian geophysicist who initially believed Wyatt and travelled to Mount Ararat with Wyatt, wrote in 1996 that "I am almost 100% certain that Ron 'planted' them [rivets on the Ark]." Ron Wyatt claimed to have discovered Noah's Ark, Mount Sinai in Arabia, the Red Sea crossing location, Sodom and Gomorrah, the hole in the ground where Jesus' cross stood, drops of Jesus' blood, and the Ark of the Covenant. As Linda Gunderson said, "Is Ron Wyatt the greatest archaeologist who ever lived? Or is there another explanation?" For much more on Wyatt's frauds, google Gunderson Amirault Wyatt.  (...)

(...) Wyatt's gold wheel is marked 'Re-creation', but that is the video's ONLY hint that the wheel might be fake. While the gold wheel is being shown, Moller (who earlier in the video introduced himself as a scientist) says "you could break it if you would try to remove it." There is no disclosure that WYATT IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS SEEN THE GOLD WHEEL!
