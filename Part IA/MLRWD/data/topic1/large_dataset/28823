Let me get this out in the open first and foremost: I was genuinely impressed with Thin Red Line.  while I found it to be a meandering, unfocused film, I was still drawn in to Terrance Mallick's examination of  the soul of a soldier.  I liken this film to Apocalypse Now, my favorite  film of all time, in that it is a surreal examination of the psyche.  I  feel that many of the reviewers that gush over this film do so as an  attempt to establish themselves as 'lofty" and "discerning of  taste" while bashing a great film like Saving Private Ryan.  I view  these people as types who rave about Merchant Ivory period dramas and wear  this love like as badge of distinction and taste, yet wouldn't watch a  foreign film because " I don't like to read."  Mallick is  considered an artist, since he has made exactly 3 movies in 25 years.  Spielberg is labelled a pop culture craftsman with no subtlety and a  tendency to over sentimentalize.  I will not debate the merits of either  man's careers here, but I question the validity of many reviewer's  comments.  Many ring so much of pretentiousness, something this movie is  oft accused of doing.
