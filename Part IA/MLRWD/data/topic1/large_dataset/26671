full disclosure this movie is my 'wizard of oz' or 'it's a wonderful life' or ...
whatever movie is your favorite 'classic' of all time
so im anything but unbiased in this review

just the same i flatter myself kinda okay in being able to discern between
just good and absolutely great comedy
there are any number of examples of the former with whoever your favorite actor
or screenwiter(s) or director may be
the latter tho for me would be 'doctor strangelove'
the above just to hopefully establish some sort of credibility
in what follows ...

because imho 'midnight run' is the single funniest AND most touching movie of alltime

first saw it during its opening release and went back to the theatre to see it again
over the years since then 1988?! at least once every couple years
and each watching only gets better funnier and more touching

even tho by now i know most every line of dialogue coming
each still remains as wittily sharp as it is comedically brilliant

i guess if it's possible to fall in love with a movie i have

so why then?

it's the chemistry between robert deniro and charles grodin
an unlikely pairing at best a raging bull and a  what do you call grodin?
i dunno but whatever it is it's the opposite of raging and bull

but together these two guys bring their characters so much to life
and make them so endearing you find yourself rooting for both even as their goals
within the storyline would pull them apart

but as this is happening you see deniro's jack walsh - an excop now thoroughly burnt out
bounty hunter - slowly being unable to not like grodin's 'the duke' a sarcastic
milquiest of milque toast new york brownstone accountant who through no fault of his own
found himself handling the books for a mobster

and not just any mobster but one whose gift for describing threats to inflict mortally painful
wounds upon others - from his lawyer to his street crew - in so homicidically creative youre
both terrified and laughing out loud at the same time

the story is a bail bond'sman  assigns deniro a 'midnight run' - that is a piece of cake
job - to locate and return for trial a guy - grodin - who's jumped bail in a major mob case
the bail bonds office is in el lay deniro's jack walsh quickly finds grodin's jonathan 'the duke' mardukis
hiding out in nyc

it does seem like indeed it is gonna be 'a midnight run'
but of course fate - and a hollywood screenwriter who in my opinion
has penned the sharpest wittiest funniest script of all time - intercede to make it anything but

along the way there're ups and downs and ins and outs and plenty of laughs and i mean countless
and a scene with an exwife and an 8th grade little girl that packs such an emotional wallop
i only wish i could describe it
and chases with planes & trains & buses & even a fire breathing helichopter ...
and yeah ... things do go a wee bit over the top along the way toward the climax but ...

but the payoff* of the denouement is so touching  - that is by the time we get to the last
scene we've come so far with and grown so close to deniro's jack walsh and grodin's duke -
the emotional windup of this movie is right up there with judy garland's dorothy and jimmy stewart's
george bailey getting their wishes fulfilled

but again my lenses do not see this movie through an unrosened hue
a guilty plea i stipulate without embarrassment

because this movie makes you cheer for the good guys
and even the bad guys too because they're all such 'characters'
and makes you feel good about it - and them - too
yeah sure it's a hollywood ending but so what? isnt that what hollywood's for?
to provide some escape from the drudgery of the every day

another wonderful part of 'midnight run' is - just as 'oz' and 'wonderful life' do -
it is chock full of supporting characters whose parts are so richly written they get to
shine so brightly we've grown to know them forever  ala 'scarecrow' and 'mr potter'

i'll leave it to you to get to know these supporting characters but just as a hint
i'll say only one word 'MARVIN'

if you havent seen 'midnight run' by the time it ends you will certainly know what i mean by 'marvin!'
if you have seen it i bet you just laughed again when you read the name

but there are at least a half dozen - minimum - other absolutely great characters drawn
in this movie: fbi agent 'foster grant' (a running gag), said mob boss jimmy serrano,
bumbling but still quite badass mob guys tony darvo and joey 'hopalong cassadeech',
agent foster grant's smartass fbi underlings, bail bondsman moscone (joe pantiliano is absolutely
magnificent in this part going from self assured cockiness to growing exasperation to maniacal desperation
and in doing so stealing every scene he shares with deniro)

and more even - roles whose speaking parts are one or two lines or even words - im not kidding
watch for the train porter's quick heads up for agent foster grant
or the old codger in the bar where counterfeit $20s might be floating around
or the best of all a little boy's observation about how criminals look
and said criminal's deadpan reply (absolutely perfect line delivery)

in short everyone and everything about this movie shines bright

so here's to the cast and director and especially the scriptwriter for 'midnight run'
it is truly a marvelous time 'at the movies' even if this far removed form its opening run
it's a night 'at the dvd' (or nowadays anywhere streaming on your mobile device)
whatever and/or wherever you get to watch it it's worth it

5 stars for 'midnight run' then an under-rated buddy movie now a well earned comedy classic

ps re the '*' after the word 'payoff' above deniro's jack walsh may be burnt out
but he is anything but corrupt and you'd be taking a mighty big risk even using that word
in his presence

pps there're ALOT of f-bombs dropped in this flick and i mean alot
and there is ALOT of cigaret smoke seen as well
normally both would be off putting to some but in this particular story
both not only are necessary they actually add to its richness
at least for me anyway but just a fwiw going in ...
