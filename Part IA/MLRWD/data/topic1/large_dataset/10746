Firstly, I would like to say that I recognize Kubrick as a director with an amazing vision of how films should look, and he certainly portrays Redmond Barry's world with extreme beauty and an attention to detail never since achieved in any costume drama.
However, I must say that this is probably one of the most self-indulgent films I have ever seen. Kubrick films exude his unique style, however that is all there is to this film, Kubrick style. That is why I have given this film 3 stars. His talent for cinematography is unrivalled, and just for that this picture is worth three stars.
Films, however, need more than just a great score and cinematic artistry.  They also need interesting(not necessarily likebale) characters whom engage the audience.  I was at odds to find a character who earned my sympathy at all, even Barry's wife, whom is treated so abysmally by the protagonist, fails to gain any sympathy at all.  
The character of Barry is unlikebale at best, and throughout the film, his success and rise into the upper echelons of society is given to the fact that he is full of energy and determination. However O'Neal exhibits such a minute range of emotions that his energy is just non-existent. It's as if Kubrick told O'Neal just to make sure he looked gormless for three hours in order to repulse the audience. 
This film is watchable because of Kubrick's talent, and unfortunately that is not quite enough for a film to hold one's attention for three hours. The story is so deliberately paced that I would only recommend this film to Kubrick fans interested in viewing his ability to create the world of Redmond Barry, albeit a very dull one.
