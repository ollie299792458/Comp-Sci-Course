First of all, there is absolutely no question about the entertainment value of this movie.  When I received it, I watched it twice two days in-a-row!  It is an excellent action movie if you like hostage/terrorism themes.
Although there have been complaints about Seagal's early demise, I am neutral about it.  He played a great part and his role/performance was effective.
Mostly, I review the quality of the DVD so here we go:
"Widescreen review" must be crazy with their 5.0/picture, 5.0/sound, or I didn't receive the same DVD.  The picture is pretty bad for a 1996 film (released on DVD approx. two years ago).  The picture is grainy with various spots and blurs.  At times, there are blue lines around the actors' faces, and it's not from anything glowing, either.  It is just poor quality.  The DVD starts right away without going to the menu.  
The best sound comes at the beginning of the movie with some cheesy words typing across the screen and the effect follows the typing from left to right.  Was that necessary?
My picture rating:  1.5 at times, 3.0 maximum in the best shots.
Sound:  3.0 overall
I hope that they remaster this movie in the near future.  Clearly, this film was slopped to DVD just to make hasty sales.  If you don't mind the [bad] picture, by all means purchase this DVD and enjoy!  But I would wait another year or so.  It doesn't look like it has a lot of sales so a new release may never happen.
Oh, entertainment rating on a scale of 5:  my vote = 6.0!
