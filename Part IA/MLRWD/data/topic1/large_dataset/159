The Rodgers and Hammerstein Organisation has released this boxed set containing six of their film musicals, each of which comes with a second disc of bonus archival material and documentaries elaborating on the shows. The extra content varies: For example, in Carousel, the film of Liliom, the book on which the R&H show is based is included in its entirety. The bonus discs are themselves compelling viewing, especially prior to watching the main feature, which could be at a later stage because it could be too long to do both in one sitting; besides, these are the great masterpieces of the American Musical Theatre and Drama, although State Fair was first a film, and transferrred onto the stage more recently, and posthumously for the authors.

The stage and film musicals that Richard Rodgers, music, and Oscar Hammerstein II, lyrics, collaborated on, in both cases later in their careers, are the greatest of musical dramas to be found.

It makes revisiting these shows all the more interesting. These are the CinemaScope 55 versions.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HT3PGU">The Rodgers & Hammerstein Collection [Remastered] (The Sound of Music / The King and I / Oklahoma! / South Pacific / State Fair / Carousel)</a>
