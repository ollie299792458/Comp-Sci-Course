I just bought a 3D TV and player and wanted to really test it out with this movie.  If you love the History channel's shows on the Universe, you will be stunned at the beauty of this movie!  The 3D is just spectacular!!  I cannot say enough good things about the 3D.  I showed it to my sister, who loves these kind of information shows also, and she was blown away by the experience.  But I also love how History Channel put this together.  I definitely learned things about our own solar system I did not know.  And I watch these type of History, Discovery, Science channel shows ALL the time.  I mean, ALL the time.  The graphics really illustrate, in a very up close way, what the presenters are telling you in this movie.  The scientists not only tell you about Encelidus (one of the Wonders), but you see what it looks like.  The experience was more like being in a planetarium than watching a movie.  When the sun is being explained, you literally feel as though you can just reach out and touch it.  Really stunning.  I won't give away what all the Wonders are, but you will love how the History channel brings them to you.  This definitely raises the bar on what all the other channels, like the History Channel, show and how they show it.
