This will be short, & to the point:
Animation - Excellent, no complaints at all.

Story - Some will try to compare it to the the comic books, & you just cannot do that. Did this movie do the job of relating the story as best it could: Yes, it did!

Voice Casting - Good & Bad. This always gets to me with these WB productions. For a company that has the excellent voice talent they already have with Kevin Conroy (Batman/Bruce Wayne) & Tim Daly (Superman/Clark Kent) just to name two actors, why do they feel the need to hire anybody else to do the job? With Batman: U.T.R.H., they did a decent job of getting most of the new voice casting right for this production: Bruce Greenwood, & Jensen Ackles voice Batman & Red Hood. Both actors do a great job, Greenwood even sounds like Kevin Conroy's Batman voice, so though he did a great job, why not just use Conroy? Voice failures go to John Di Maggio - the Joker, & (I hate to say it) Neil Patrick Harris - Nightwing. Di Maggio's Joker just is horrible, and he sounds bored reading his lines. Harris' Nightwing is just too goofy sounding. He makes a good Flash, but not Nightwing. Everyone else does a good job with their characters.

So that's it! I highly recommend this movie, and not just for Batman fans. If you like a good action/adventure drama, then you should like this!
