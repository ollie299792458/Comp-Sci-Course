Having seen all 4 of the M:I films, and having read rather negative reviews of M:I-2, I have to set the record straight.  This is the best one, but only if you pay attention.  To the plot, to the way the scenes ebb and flow, to the style, to the way the whole film is put together whereby the sum is greater than the parts.  You must understand that John Woo is enamoured with old-fashioned Hollywood, and is Chinese, so honor and love and good versus evil really matter.  Hence, the "corny" dialogue, and the doves and the fire and the crashing waves symbolizing the monumental battle between good and evil.  If you appreciate old-fashioned movie making, where the good guys are good (albeit flawed - they make mistakes too) and the bad guys are bad, then you will appreciate this M:I film in particular.  Yes, the action scenes are great, but so are the characters, and so believeable are they.  The bonus: the bad guy is a really good, obsessed bad guy.  And what action movie (other than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which is much more than an action movie) has the female lead playing such an important, and strong, role?
