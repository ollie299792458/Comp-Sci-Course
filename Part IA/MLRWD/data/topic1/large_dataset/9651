I watched this documentary last night -- and though it was excellent. It really doesn't take too much research to find out what really happened - and more importantly - what didn't happen on 9/11.

This film has done an excellent job of putting in one place all the key points that must be ignored for the official 9/11 legend to remain intact.

One thing that I feel this film did (perhaps) a poor job of, is not mentioning the American side of the equation that facilitated the free movement of Mohammed Atta and the other supposed hijackers whilst in America.

The film touched upon the $100,000 wired to Atta via Omar Saeed (Daniel Pearl's executioner) in Dubai from General Mahmood -- but it did not mention the trip Atta took onboard a Suncruz casino cruise ship owned by Jack Abramovich days before 9/11, or the fact that he left that $100,000 on the ship. The film also fails to mention that the man who owned the store where the wired $100,000 was collected from -  Majik Chams - was an employee of Titan Corp. (one of  the biggest beneficiaries of the invasion of Iraq). It might have also been worth mentioning that after 9/11, Jeb Bush personally arrived at the flight school Atta and others attended in Venice, Florida, to seize the records of that flight school. It may have also been prudent to mention the close ties the owner of that flight - Wally Hilliard -has to the CIA. This link to the CIA is best illustrated by the involvement of companies Mr. Hilliard is linked to being used in the extraordinary rendition program ran by the CIA -- and more vividly by the number of times planes owned by Mr. Hillard have flown from Afghanistan to Guantanamo, Cuba. To some it may just seem coincidence that the same man who hosted Mohammed Atta at his flight school -- is also involved in the rounding up of al Queda terrorists, but I think there may be more to this that just coincidence.

An excellent film -- and one that should be shown to all Americans.
