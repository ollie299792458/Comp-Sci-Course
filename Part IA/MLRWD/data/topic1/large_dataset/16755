I'll start off by saying I have a tremendous crush on Viggo Mortensen and I'm happy anytime he's in a movie. That said, I think this was well-done. Others have found it "slow" or "unconvincing." I didn't. Though I do wish we could have seen more of the relationship between Walker and Pearl (not just the sex), you sensed that they did connect in ways other than the physical.

The most poignant moment of movie for me is when Pearl visits Walker at his house. She sees the maps on the walls of his bedroom and asks if he's been to all of these places. He seems sad, and a bit embarrassed, as he says "no." They seemed like kindred spirits in that moment; both longing for a life bigger and more exciting that what they had known. Perhaps that's what she saw in him (besides the fact that he's stunning and sexy).

I think many of us in our 30s can relate to "what might have been" thinking. I highly recommend this movie. Diane Lane is fabulous, as always. The whole cast is great. See this movie!
