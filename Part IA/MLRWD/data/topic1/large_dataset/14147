I have written reviews for the previous season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, and while they were positive, they were somewhat tongue-in-cheek.  I used a very unusual phonetic spelling and a very loosely coded slang that I figured hard-core viewers of the show would understand.  Well, I had ladies and gentleman alike explain that the reviews and the language that made them up were too "difficult."

So I've decided to drop the comedy and play it straight in the review.  Unlike the preposterously overrated "Seinfeld," this show by Larry David strikes a chord that resonates much deeper than nonsense such as a soup-nazi (which is one of the weaker socio-political aspects of "Seinfeld" - a total disrespect for historical events that need not be trivialized through 'jokes').  Larry David does, in fact, portray a stereotypical fuss-budget (if you don't understand that slang term, I suggest you consult an on-line urban dictionary).  In doing so, he and his long-suffering wife Cheryl (portrayed sympathetically by the incomparable Cheryl Hines) make themselves two of the most relatable characters currently on television.
