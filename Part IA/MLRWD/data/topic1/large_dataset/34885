In the first DVD you join Tony on a photo hike. If you are an inexperienced landscape photographer with a desire to be shown how to pick motives and choose lenses I guess this could be instructive. To appreciate what he is doing you will need to know the basics of your camera and have a basic understanding of exposure compensation and choice of aperture.  Given that, Tony will take you along on a two hour photo hike in the Smokey Mountains showing you how he works and chooses motives. I did learn about variable density ND filters and to use a 10 magenta filter to enhance the look of fog, but if you are a fairly seasoned landscape photographer most of this is plain boring.

On the second DVD Tony starts with a presentation and discussion of an early and a recent portfolio of his images which I found a bit interesting.  On the next track Tony shows how he creates images of flowers in his studio where I picked up a few tricks. Shooting through a piece of structured window glass was neat. The rest is about equipment and a bit on workflow. I would think that the tracks on workflow are to brief to be very illuminating for the uninitiated and for the more experienced photographer there is nothing to learn.

I guess it is unfair to rate this product from the point of view of an experienced photographer who will likely find most of this a waste of time. I think the product may work well for the inexperienced landscape photographer that would like to follow an experienced photographer on a hike before going out and try to create images on his own.
