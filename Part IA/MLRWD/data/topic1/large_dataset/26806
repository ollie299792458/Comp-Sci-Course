There aren't too many films that can stick to the realism of everyday temptations and emotional experiences and still be entertaining. However , " We Don't Live Here Anymore " , is one of those exceptional productions. It's a wonderfully, captivating film, that has astounding performances by it's actors and actresses. Laura Dern's performance stands out , spectacularly , as a neglected housewife , who yearns for the attention , respect , affection , and emotional connection from a husband , who's become dissallusioned about their marriage and becoming infatuated with his friend's wife ( Naomi Watts ). Eventually ,beginning an affair, that will end up pushing his own wife into an affair , with the same friend , who's wife , he's sleeping with. The script is refreshingly well written and the director did an excellent job of capturing and balancing, both the physical temptations and pleasures, as well as, the guilty and shameful remifications or deceiving the one you're married to.It's very erotic and has it's share of sex scenes. However , it doesn't over expose them. Therefore, minimizing the actual sex scenes and highlighting the emotional havok and undercurrents. From the adults , to the kids....everyone is effected. This is a very powerful film and shouldn't be missed. Don't expect alot of extras on the dvd , itself , though. In actuality , there's no extras , whatsoever. However the great acting and great script script , make this a worthwhile "sleeper" , to see.
