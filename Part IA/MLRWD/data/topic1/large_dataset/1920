Two days ago, I finished watching "Roots"  ( the re-edited DVD version) , a series I scarcely remembered from my adolescent years. I remembered I had liked it. That was just about it.
Well.....now I'm 40,  a musician (choral conductor and educator) and a profound lover of Spirituals and Gospel music.  So....let me tell you  that  "Roots" moved the very bottom of my heart.  I cried every episode, deeply touched by the sadness of the story but also by the invincible courage that has led African Americans through a hard history in the U.S. From my knowledge of Spirituals I've always admired this  courage, this strength of the spirit reflected throughout all the  melodic and rhythmic richness, ( "Hush...hush...  Somebody's calling my name")  the spiritual and physical beauty of a race,  the  deep and sincere approach to Christianity!
I think and I do hope that, someday, those "in power" all around the world will open their eyes and finally come to understand that racism, and all forms of discrimination, belong to the darkest and the most ignorant side of the human heart!
Just one last question: Is it possible to buy the printed Screenplay?
