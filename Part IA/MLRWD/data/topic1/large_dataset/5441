In a strictly technical sense this movie is a western,in a much broader and deeper sense it is far more than that.  The central plot line is the heart of the story, not the peripheral characters or the era in time.  This scenerio has been played out countless times throughout human history irregardless of place or time.

This is not an allegory regarding politics or anything characteristic of modern times or unique to the harsh realities of the western frontier. It also is not about the title of the central character of the movie.  This is not a movie critic review but the central theme of the domination of the human spirit under the most trying of times that can bring out aspects of men that simply defy description.

There simply come rare occaisons in life when the needs or safety of a single man are far outweighed by the needs and welfare of the many.  True heroes are never sterotypical but ordinary men put under extraordinary circumstances and simply respond in any way necessary even within a very real probability that he may not survive the ordeal.  Teddy Roosevelt's speech The Man In The Arena exemplifies this.  This has always been known as arising to the occaison.  I have personally seen and been involved in these types of ordeals that are both wondrous and terrifying.
