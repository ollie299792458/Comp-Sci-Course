This movie takes place after the last one with Ash attempting to send the evil back in time, but a portal opens up and Ash is sent, car, shotgun, chainsaw, and all back to the 13th century.  He is then captured by Arthur's clan, his his believed to be in league with Henry's clan (two waring groups).  After a heroic escape from the well, Ash shows those "primitive screwheads"
what's up with his shotgun (and a hilarious quote!).
Eventually Ash is sent on a quest to find the Necromonicon.  This book, while keeping the Deadites away forever, will also send Ash home.  Ash ventures out, and encounters some great scenes (bad ash, and the mini ash's).  He eventually finds the book, but screws up a vital part of taking it and unleashes the deadites.  Ash then brings Arthur and Henry together and they fight the deadites using modern science (provided by ash) and wonderful low budget goodness!
This movie, one of the most popular horror-comedies out there is also one of the most quoteable.  There are classics throughout the whole movie that everyone will love!  The special features are decent.  There's a couple of commentaries and some deleted scenes as well as story boards.  All good here!
Do yourself a favour and pick this classic up!  No longer a cult classic, but a real classic.
