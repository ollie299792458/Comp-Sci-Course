For me, this movie is the answer to the question, "if you were stranded on a deserted island with only one DVD and some way to play it, what DVD would you choose."  This production is so wonderful, and so uplifting, the music is so amazingly good and the songs so memorable, that there is no other film besides this which I could watch over and over again and still feel like I can't wait to see it again.  I even purchased the soundtrack to the movie!  I had stumbled across this movie on netflix and the reviews were so overwhelmingly positive that I had to see it, thinking "come on, it's a french musical?  How good could it be?"  Some people even stated that seeing this movie changed their lives...well it certainly did mine.  About 45 minutes in, I was grinning ear to ear.  This is the extravagant lushly orchestrated musical I've waited for my entire life....it really is that good, and it actually awaked some feelings and romantic desires I thought had completely gone away for me long ago.  When a movie can do all that you know it is truly something special.  Never has the French penchant for celebrating the joy of life been so effectively captured on film...you owe it to yourself to see this movie as soon as possible!!
