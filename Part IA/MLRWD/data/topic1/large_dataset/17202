If jamaal was actually going to teach Sean Connery something he should of mentioned some other poets that were not European. There should have been some comment from his mother about poets of color to create yet another dilemma in his world. Anna Paquin is a fine young lady but, I wish that interest would have developed only slightly more. She was obviously attracted to him for being the new phenomenon at the school as it is in real life.

It attempted to do something in this film but it didn't quite finish. I agree with many others that attempts were made but the development of the possibilites did not happen. For somehing with a little drama it is worth watching. Not thrilling but a start. Being smart should not always be how many common European poets one knows but how vast the diversity of thoughts one can pull together to see the beauty that comes from differnt experiences and perspective. Can't give it a 5 because it was Eurocentric(the norm) not culturally diverse(the future).
