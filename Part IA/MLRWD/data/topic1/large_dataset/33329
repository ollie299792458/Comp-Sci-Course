"Big Night" is another sad movie for the entrepreneur, though not as sad as "Tucker".  After all, more restaurants fail than industrial companies, and very frequently because they start with a dream of cooking outstanding food and little more to the plan.  This movie is about more than a bad business plan.  It's really about the building of community through a shared meal.

Italian brothers, significantly named Primo (Tony Shaloob, not Italian, but dark and hairy) and Secundo (writer/director and actual Italian-American Stanley Tucci) are chefs and owners of an Italian restaurant during the 1950s in the US.  Primo, the artistic one of the duo, concocts exquisite and authentic Italian food.  Secundo, who is also manager of the restaurant, stands outside his empty restaurant and watches the throngs standing in line for spaghetti and meatballs at the Italian place across the street.  Facing foreclosure, the brothers make an all-or-nothing gamble to host famous Italian-American crooner Louis Primo and his band, hoping that a good recommendation from him will bring more discerning diners.  They also impulsively invite everyone who has crossed their path during their stay in America: the cute flower shop girl Primo has been making eyes at, the Cadillac salesman who takes Secundo for a test drive, their best customer who is a Bohemian painter, and more.

It's easy to forget how foreign Italians seemed a generation or two ago, and how their less familiar foods were viewed with suspicion.

This is an affectionate and only slightly ironic portrayal of two men who predate any ability to talk about their feelings.  It's a worshipful depiction of Italian cuisine and elevates food and cooking to the level of worship.

I recommend this film for anyone who is thinking about starting a restaurant.  Also just a good movie that's about more than food.
