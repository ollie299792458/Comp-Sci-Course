You hear this phrase all the time. The movie Lord of War starring Nicolas Cage is a first person narative depicting the life of an arms dealer, a person who sells after-war weaponry.

One of the most interesting aspects of this film is that its a first person narative, as if we're directly in the mind of the main character. The story unfolds from a present time to retrospective view, from the first scene to his comment, than a flash back, returning to him once again, finishing his comment.

The story takes place during the Cold War, where his family adopts a Jewish name to escape Russian tyranny. His family makes ends meat by working at a family restuarant. He shows the audience how living in his neighborhood, there was constant gang warfare and how his one defining moment that shaped his future in arms dealing, was 2 seconds from getting shot. He realized and commented how a certain commodity was always needed... guns.

Personally, I liked watching this movie because its something many people are not aware of until Hollywood shows us its or been happening. It too portrays both sides of morality, where his wife "defends" humanity while Nicolas seems indifferent towards the use of his sold weaponry. I find Nicolas's comment when aruging with his wife, "I cant stop, because Im good at it" or something close to it, was very intriguing as I thought about the implications of that comment, where just because we're good at it and it results in deaths, do we continue?
