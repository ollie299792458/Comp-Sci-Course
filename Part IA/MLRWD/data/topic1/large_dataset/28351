This is one those exceptionally rare modern day movies that uses leading edge visual effects in service of a wonderfully rich and engaging story.
This is definitely not an effects movie (although the effects,  done by ILM, are on par with the best of the best), but a movie driven by a  simple story told exceptionally well.  The characters are developed over  time, using subtle cues, and by the end of the movie you can't help but  care what happens to them, even the ensign!
As the Amazon.com review  notes, you don't have to be a fan of Star Trek to enjoy this movie, and  having seen it with people who are not Trekkies by any stretch of the  imagination, yet enjoyed it immensely, I can personally attest to this.  The only thing you need is a sense of humor.
Also, as someone who is not  a big fan of Tim Allen, I can say that he was wonderful in this movie, as  was the rest of the cast.  Tony Shalhoub is simply hilarious in a fairly  minor role, and Sigourney Weaver shows us that she has a future in  comedy.
This movie would make a great gift for any Trek fans or a great  addition to your library of comedies.  It would also be great as a  background movie to play at parties since it will elicit laughs no matter  where in the story a viewer gets involved.  Also, it's definitely  appropriate for the kids (they probably won't understand some of the more  subtle humor, but there's plenty to keep them interested).
