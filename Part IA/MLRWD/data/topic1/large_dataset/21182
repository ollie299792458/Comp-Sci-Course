Following all the other one star reviews for production quality, which were bad enough, my rant is about the godawful subtitles. Normally I wouldn't bother to comment about subtitles in a foreign movie but for this classic I have to, especially after waiting so long for the dvd to come out. They are an insult to any English speaking person, even a 12 year old, and really degrade the experience. A few examples, just from the last 1/3 of the dvd:

"we are like cates and dogs"

"don't be so groovy" (!)

"...I'll go get some liqeur for me..."

"she has just past away.."

"I don't understand what our live is all about..."

"..she has gone completely mad. Production credit." (???)

Also the substitles were completely omitted during the change-of-season announcements, which are Chinese symbols. The original vhs copy had these, and decent subtitles. Magic Play Entertainment obviously hired some Chinese child to do their subtitles, probably to save money. The less-than-even-bootleg quality has already been covered. Shame shame SHAME! I only rented this from Netflix but I'm going to tell them to stop until a better release is done.
