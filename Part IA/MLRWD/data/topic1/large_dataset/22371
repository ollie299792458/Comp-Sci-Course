Ok, let me say that 10 years ago I moved from Colorado to FT Worth Texas and each is a big city with its own problems....
Visit slightly either side of the city and you find some of the most unique and genuine people in the world....The people of Texas...I learned to keep my mind and my eyes and ears open and have found a little of HAPPY TEXAS in all of us...From the people who work the ranch to the business leaders of the city these people in the movie are right out of the real Texas small town areas...Trusting...loving...and above all "Dont ask Dont Tell...Wherein lies the reality of Texas, I have heard many great stories about the "Boys who live down the street" and the real genuine relationships between neighbors...Where being a good neighbor is all that matters and your identity is not important as long as your "Good People".
For Those of you who have not seen this movie it is very funny and the cast genuine...William Macy steals the show with his honest and masculine character the local town sheriff who needs to talk about his own secret...I bought copies for all my family in Colorado..to show how the real people of Texas treat each other with respect and acceptance of differences...
