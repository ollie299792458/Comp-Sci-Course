Andrew Lloyd Webber is not talented.  He is gifted and so are the artists performing on this tape.  There is a great diversity of music from rock  opera to the sublime to the dramatic.  Who knew that Donny Osmond has the  voice that is heard on this tape? Sarah Brightman is brilliant as usual,  but especially in the beautiful "Pie Jesu."  Lottie Mayer's  rendition of "Whistle Down the Wind" is inspirational, especially  with Webber accompanying her on the piano.  He is visibly moved.  Michael  Ball with his signature song of "Love Changes Everything" and  joined in by the entire cast is worth the price of the tape alone!  There  are two disappointments.  Antonio Banderas was good in songs from  "Evita" but he does not have the voice necessary to to perform  the Phantom, both in range and power.  The beautiful "The Heart Never  Learns" written by Webber for Dame Kiri Te Kanawa has its weak  moments, especially at the end.  Te Kanawa has been criticized before for a  thin voice in the upper octaves, and this is true in this song as well.  All in all, this concert must not be missed by anyone who has heard and  enjoyed even one of Webber's songs, and is also a primer for those who are  just learning about musical theater.
