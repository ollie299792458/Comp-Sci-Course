This film has so many levels...it is one of those horror films that require multiple viewings to appreciate its nuances (Romero's follow-up, Dawn of the Dead, can lay even firmer hold to this claim).  It is so much more than a zombie flick; the reason it was so damned popular was that it was the mood of the times.

Faceless, unfathomable evil is stalking humanity in this film; the reason is ambiguous and never revealed as entirely true.  The film opens simply with crazed people attacking others...the truth of the matter is revealed slowly as the film progresses (if you didn't already figure it out based on the title, that is).  Then, after one man has successfully established a barrier between himself and his enemies, new people make their appearance, and the film truly begins.

Its pessimism is unrivaled...the message of the film is that if humans cannot work together we are all doomed.  And the plot is just that: humans, faced with a common enemy that threatens their very existence, still fail to bond and fight as one.  Rather, in our selfish ways we succumb to petty prejudices and infighting in even the most dire circumstances, or even perhaps BECAUSE of the dire circumstances.  Note that the zombies do not start to breach the defenses until the ragtag collection of people begin their squabbling; after that, as their relations continue to degenerate, it is only a matter of time before they are overrun.

And in the end, because of our failure to unite, all our efforts are for nothing.  Those who claim to protect us are as soulless as those who try to destroy us, but ultimately it is our fault for continuing to hate each other.

Bet you never got that out of "Scream."
