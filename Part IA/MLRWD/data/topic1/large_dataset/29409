Tension in American movies has changed in the way it is created. 
Currently, unrelenting action  accompanied by loud music is the norm for creating tension, i.e., most of  Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the entire Mission Impossible 2.
The evolution into non-stop tension producing action accompanied by loud music has been gradual. The small action scenes became highpoints of those early significant movies, i.e., the chase scene in Bullitt,  and the chase scene in the French Connection.
None of this applies to The Hustler.  Tension is produced by silences. And by darkness.
Watch this movie again and count the times when nobody speaks. Notice that there is a two minute period of tension producing silence when Newman and Gleason shoot pool.. The lighting is dark  Or perhaps the darkness is light enough to see in.
When the window shade is pulled open and the sunlight floods the pool hall, Jackie Gleason shouts to get rid of the sunlight. The shade goes back up, Darkness resumes its reign.
The tension becomes so thick you can cut it with the proverbial knife.
In the apartment, when Paul Newman opens the shutters in Piper Laurie's bedroom, sunlight floods the room. They look outside. There are people standing. There are people talking. Newman and Laurie are relaxed. They talk. 
In this movie, whenever the scene is well lit,  the people are relaxed and enjoying themselves. George C. Scorr is relaxed and drinking at the big party.
This is a great movie. It is worth studying once a year. 
There are no chase scenes. There is no music. And there are those words not spoken. There are so many words not spoken. There are those people not talking. 
But everyone is communicating. Do not mistake those silences in black and white for dead  moments. The actors are communicating with their eyes, their stances, their  gestures, their body language..
This is a great movie. It is the required text on the study of  creating tension in early  American movies.
