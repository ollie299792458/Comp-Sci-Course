I've been wanting to see this movie since the preview first aired, and I wasn't disappointed. I liked this movie (based on a Dave Egger's work) a great deal, because it reminded me (a little) about my own relationship.

At the beginning of this quirky movie, a couple -- Verona (a medical illustrator, played by Maya Rudolph) and Burt (an insurance futures salesman, played by John Krasinski) find out they're expecting a baby. The two leave their Chicago home to move closer to Burt's parents, for help raising the child.

Unexpectedly, Burt's parents decide to move oversea to Europe, and rent out their house, leaving Burt and Verona in the lurch without grandparents. Instead of getting upset -- the couple sees it as an opportunity to visit friends in different locations and decide the best place to raise their baby. They movie chronicles their journeys on train and plane to locations in America and Canada. Most of their friends are odd -- but the highlight was the hilarious Maggie Gyllenhaal's portrayal of a crazy young mother living off of a trust fund, and raising her children in an unconventional way.

Rudolph and Krasinski were believable as a couple, with a real chemistry and spark between the two, and a secret language that only couples speak to one another.

I'm surprised some reviewers feels the couple has a superiority complex, when the opposite is at play (in my opinion). At the beginning of the movie, Ruldoph asks (loosely quoted) Burt, "Are we messed up" Because they were living in a house, without heat and duck-taped plastic windows. Burt says,"No, honey we aren't messed up." And Verona says, "Yes, honey. I think we're messed up." Burt also dropped out of college, and feels insecure when selling insurance to older men who have more money and more education than he does.

Anyway, I thought this movie was well worth watching. Although, slow moving, it pays off in the end
