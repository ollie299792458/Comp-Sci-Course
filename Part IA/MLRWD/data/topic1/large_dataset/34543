This film is MUCH better then the first.  If the acting and lighting was bad, be grateful that was all they messed up on.

The Predator in this film, actually looked like a real Predator like the "Predator 1 & 2" films.  They could of showed more of him take some trophy's, but whatever.

The aliens...not so much.  They looked great, but didn't give the creepy feel like "Alien" and "Aliens" did.  They seemed just to be there, and had to be dealt with. Note: their should of been alot of blood for the chest bursting scenes (its your chest, think of all the blood that's in your body...comm'on now).

The ending seemed too much like a "Resident Evil" movie. Secret military lab could of been more creative.  Too predictable of an ending.

Overall, the film was so so.  Not as good as the originals, but pretty good for what they had to work with from the first film.  Because of the first film, this one fails on that aspect.  Two stars for the Predator, One star for the story, and One more star for the R rating.  4 Stars together.  Not bad for the AVP franchise.
