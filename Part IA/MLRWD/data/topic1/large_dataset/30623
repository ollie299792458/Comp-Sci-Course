Yes, this is probably the worst Star Trek movie made, but I don't think it is as bad as its reputation. I think this story was filmed before its time. The special effectsof the time period weren't enough to pull off what they were called upon to do, the script should have been more polished so as to avoid some serious mischaracterizations (A sixty year old Uhura dancing nsked?), and the time just wasn't right for a spiritual quest to find God.
That said, it is still a film worth watching.  There are some humorous moments, particularly between Kelly and Nimoy. Yes, therer are obvious flaws and inconsistencies in the script, but that is what suspension of disbelief is all about.
It's a fun movie to watch, even though it could have been much more. I can see why some members of the cast have an axe to grind with Shatner after seeing these results. The Paramount powers That be have never let him nar a camera ago, you know.  I'd advise anyone to seek out the story about Harlan Ellison's pitch for this movie. That, my friends, would have been a classic.
