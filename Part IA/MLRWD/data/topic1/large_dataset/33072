This is the best series of films that I have ever seen in my whole life... and I watch TONS of movies.  The plot can be a bit disjointed at times, and certain films are better than others, but there really is nothing bad about any of these films.

The violence causes emotion to be felt, and the bond between father and son is as strong as can be, even though very few words are said between the two.  Even though there is a massive amount of killing in the series, death is never glamorized and cheapened... there is always substance behind it.  The "death blow" that occurs in each of the main one on one duels is always thought provoking, and has symbolic meaning.  When Ogami Itto takes another ronin's life, the fallen samurai is always happy because they got the opportunity to die at the hand of the very best, and maintain their integrity in the process.

The cinematography is beautiful in all of these films,  The acting is superb, and the plot is amazing.  If you are a movie buff and you havent seen these films before, do yourself a favor and watch all of them.  If you are a samurai film fan and have never seen this series, dont admit it to anyone and just watch these as soon as possible... you owe it to yourself!!!
