When I first saw this movie, I laughed at the black humour it portrayed throughout. But then the ending came. Think of any movie that leaves a powerfull, shocking impression that lasts. This could best almost any. Its main concern is on the entropy of modern culture- it is done so powerfully that I was affected by it for days, which is a lot for a person who has seen much and become desensitized to video portrayles of violence. It wasn't the violence that was affecting in this movie: it was the very relevant, sad message it contained.  Watch it with an open mind. While there is extreme violence and sex, the focus isn't truly on that. It's on modern entropy and a modern hell on earth. The ending is one of the most gripping, powerful scenes in cinema ever. I compare it to the ending in "Boys Don't Cry." I recomend both- they might move you, possibly more than you like.  If you like Marilyn Manson, Anton LaVey, or even the video game Silent Hill, you will understand what most never will about this story: that it is important, moving, relevant. Thanks for reading this...
