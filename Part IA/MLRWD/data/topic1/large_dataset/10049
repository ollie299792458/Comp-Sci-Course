One of the saddest stories I ever heard about Judy Garland took place when she was in England shortly before her death in 1969.  It seems that to impress her latest husband, she trekked down to the MGM office in London to borrow to copy of "Meet Me in St. Louis," which her then-husband had never seen.  To add insult to the injury of her husband's never having seen the movie, MGM's London staff had never even heard of the movie -- incredible but true!  Well, it's too bad Judy's not around to revel in this excellent DVD edition of one of her finest movies.  "Meet Me in St. Louis" is a first class Hollywood musical, made in the hey day of the musical genre, produced by a top notch Hollywood studio, and  starring perhaps the greatest cinematic musical star of the twentieth century.  Wow! What more could one ask for?  Well, if there's anything left, it's probably included among the fascinating extras including on this 2-disc DVD.  In addition to great songs like "The Trolley Song," "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," and "The Boy Next Door," the DVD includes an alternate track of the gorgeous background score, without any dialog or singing.  There's also an alternate commentary track with fascinating details about the film, the stars, the source material for the film, etc., etc. etc.  An exceptional transfer, the movie looks like the technicolor dyes are still wet.  One of Judy Garland's top movies.  This one was a long-time coming on DVD, but it is worth every minute of the wait. Can't recommend this one highly enough!
