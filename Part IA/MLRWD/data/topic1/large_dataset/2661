I think most people will already have an opinion of the movie, so what I plan to talk about is the colorization process.  Most Dangerous Game is a small movie, never intended to be an epic; it was a fast paced exciting short little film meant to thrill audiences and keep them on the edge of their seats.  I think it works at that very well, considering it's age and the changes in acting styles.  Leslie Banks does tend to be pretty hammy by today's standards; it's a role that lends itself to that kind of performance, but Fay Wray is still the best screamer in the business!
 Colorization is a controversial process; it seems to be hated by purists and critics alike.  I grew up with black and white television so I have no problems with that format, but I do have to admit I prefer color when I can get it.  I also will be the first to say that color added by computer is different and more subdued than color from color film.  That said, I really have to say I don't mind it and rather like it, which is why I bought this edition of the movie.  This edition starts with a good print and the colorization, especially of the outdoor scenes, added to my enjoyment.  The disc does also have a good print of the black and white edition for those who prefer that.  I have had several public domain prints of Most Dangerous Game that were poor.  This is a good transfer and worth the money for just the black and white as well as the addition of the colorized print.  The disc also has several bonus features, mostly about Max Steiner that would probably be of real interest to those who  follow movie music scores.  I would recommend this disc!
