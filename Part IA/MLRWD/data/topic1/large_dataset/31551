Those of you into intelligent entertainment, like myself, will enjoy this movie. It makes you think and that's what I like. That's entertainment to me.  Sure, there are those of you out there who can't watch a movie unless there are six main characters who are all box-office stars.  And in order for a movie like that to be interesting to you people, all six of the characters either have to be driving and destroying cars and miraculously living though it all, or they all have to have at least twelve guns between the six of them and shooting people.  This movie is good.  It's good the way Good Will Hunting is good. It's not good the way American Beauty is good, but it is as good. It all depends on your mood and whether or not you're more into watching and hearing explosions or being intillectually stimulated.  Personally, I enjoy philosophy, human interaction, and interesting points of view more than watching a bunch of unbelievable action sequences with a weak plot twist thrown in somewhere. This movie is intelligent. It does have some funny parts, but overall it's designed to be serious, to make you think. And those who didn't like either didn't get the point or didn't get all the way through it in order to get the point.  Oh yeah- I loved the part about "selling God"! That puts some of you evangelists in your place!
