I could say too much about this film, but I'll keep it brief: if you've never seen this film, you owe it to yourself to see it.  This is David Mamet at his best, with some of the most memorable, profanity-laced dialogue in the English language.  A friend of mine and I used to carry on conversations using at least 50% lines from Glengarry Glen Ross (in jest, thank God.)  It's razor-sharp writing, a good story, and a stark commentary on the dog-eat-dog world of sales (and perhaps by extension, capitalism itself.)  But on top of that, this film also features some of the best performances you will ever see from Alec Baldwin, Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, even Jonathan Pryce shines as the timid sucker hustled by Ricky Roma.  This is an actor's movie, no doubt.  There are only a couple reasons I didn't give this five stars.  Firstly, the direction and cinematography are hardly inspired.  They kind of don't even need to be; in most films that'd matter a lot, but in this case the writing and acting are what makes it so great, so it's really not a problem for these otherwise essential ingredients to just get out of the way of what makes the film so enjoyable.  The real disappointment for me was the lack of extras on this so-called special edition DVD.  I won't go into details, as I know others have, but suffice it to say you should expect nothing "special."  Despite those shortcomings, this is an awesome movie and certainly one of my favorites.  It bears many repeated viewings.  Get it, or hit the bricks, pal.
