Three years before he blasted Elisha Cook Jr. and 41 years before he hitched up with a bunch of city slickers Jack Palance murdered an illegal alien and in doing so caught the bubonic plague.  Now it's up to public heath officer Richard Widmark to catch Palance before the disease spreads.

Set in the seedy area of New Orleans director Elia Kazan takes full advantage of the existing locations filming in an almost documentary style in rundown bars, ports, a huge warehouse and shabby apartments.

I like the movie and was amazed that Palance gave such a remarkable performance in his first movie, but still the pacing was too slow and my mind began to wander a few times.  Great for Widmark and Palance fans but others might find it boring.
