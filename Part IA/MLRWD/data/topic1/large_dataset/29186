Orson Welles' masterpiece, Citizen Kane, has been named as the #1 Motion Picture in history a countless number of times, including by the American Film Institute. It takes a damn good movie for such a feat, but is all the hype worth it? In my opinion, YES. This is without a doubt the greatest movie I've ever seen, and likely ever will see. Everything from the development of the story, to the direction, and incredible visual effects, all of which revolutionized film-making as we know it today, is flawless and it never lets the viewer go until the final scene. Boring? Maybe, if you're strictly into high action-filled movies. My son, who is 15, saw this movie, and couldn't understand why it was so important. I have been studying film for many years, and that's what made the difference. Before you watch it, I recommend you see or read about how unique this movie really is before you watch it, so you can understand the tiniest of nuances. Some may find it boring, and it's black-and-white palette doesn't make it seem so tempting, but believe me, if you have ANY interest in film at all, this movie is DEFINITELY a MUST-BUY. This is cinema's finest achievement ever, and the greatest masterful epic in film history. Period.
