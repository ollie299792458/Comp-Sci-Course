These are the first two words that John Clayton (Lambert) learns from the severely injured Capitaine D'Arnot (Holm) and both echo the worlds he finds himself; first in the jungle and then in England, each of these two worlds reflecting a merciless and dangerous nature. His loss of family: his ape mother and the banishment of his ape father, then coming to grips with his humanness, his life in England, society's inhumanity and again experiencing loss of family at the death of his grandfather gradually shapes his understanding. For me what is most telling is Tarzan's encounter of the slaughtered and stuffed apes at the Darwinism museum along with finding imprisoned there his Ape father who cared for him and then in releasing him to see how "Civilization" treats this creature he knew and loved. I wish here Lambert would have been given more English lines than resorting to animal mimicry to express his anger to Sir Evelyn (Wells) as it would seem more logical to express his frustration in a tongue that society would have understood and how that society is not much different and perhaps even more jungle-like than the real jungle. I would have loved to have seen a sequel with Lambert and MacDowell living part of the time at their jungle estate and part of the time at Greystoke Manor, along with son Jack who would eventually call himself Korak, but perhaps the film was better left as a single entry into the Tarzan saga.
