I suspect the director hates any group or individual feeling privileged. This is why the director uses the male lead, who's a petty criminal, to intimidate and coerce others to his will, including the female lead. And by destroying her privileged life, humiliating and degrading her into forced prostitution, somehow there is some form of retribution achieved.

The viewer must then suspend reality and believe that the college girl/prostitute will fall in love with her tormentor. That's not love. That's about power and destroying a person's self-worth and character.

Growing up in a crime invested, tough neighborhood, I know that there is a lot of injustice in the world. But if there is a lesson in life, if a street thug lives by the sword invariably, he will die by the sword. This guy would have been dead within 5 minutes in my neighborhood.

If you enjoy watching a woman beat down and emotionally and physically destroyed, this a movie for you. But I suspect, the normal, psychologically mature person would find this story hollow and empty of any redeeming value.
