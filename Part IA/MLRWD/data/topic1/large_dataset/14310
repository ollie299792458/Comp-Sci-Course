I'm getting tired or Mars movies now.  Technology has finally reached the pinacle where Mars can actually seem really realistic, and special effects are higher than ever.  Now, all of a sudden we're getting Mission To Mars, Ghosts of Mars, and Red Planet.  Why Mars?  Total Recall was an original awesome plotted film about Mars... but now we are drifting away and just counting on the special effects to do the talking.  Why does Hollywood always picks MARS anyway?  Why not Neptune or Saturn?  It would at least be something original...
This film takes to the world in about forty-fifty years in the future.  A shuttle crew stumbles upon the fact that there is algae and oxygen on Mars- or in other words: They can breathe and live in bearable temperatures.  It's because of these bugs- you see.  They can take stuff in and spit out oxygen.
And so on, their robot AMEE goes out of control and starts hunting down the crew, and eventually the crew is being hacked off and VAL KILMER must destroy it, then get back to his spaceship.  TRASH????!!!!!
The effects aren't very realistic anyway!  There isn't anything really cool or fun about the film.  It is the year's competitor for Brain De Palma's MISSION TO MARS- which at least had plot to it.  
The performances are acceptable, it is just the way the film moves- it's too strange.  It seems hard to follow- because you simply feel so bored, and when you reach the end you don't even care anymore.  It is very predictible anyway.  Most audiences can easily guess the ending.
Of course, this is Antony Hoffman (the Director)- the debut film that tries to get him some recognizability.  So, as you know, the film isn't to its full potential already.
This is a definite "pass on it".  Get something better.  Why do you think it's selling cheap- and it is barely a year old!  
CARRIE ANNE-MOSS, VAL KILMER and TOM SIZEMORE star this this sci-fi flick that might as well be thrown out with Battlefield Earth.  Try something else- I warned you.
