My daughter used to watch "Get Smart" when she was little and would laugh until she cried at Maxwell Smart. I was not a big fan of the series, but I always enjoyed watching her watch it. Her reactions were as funny as she thought the show was. On her Christmas '08 wish list was a "Get Smart" DVD. When she opened one of her gifts from me, the look on her face was well worth the price that I had paid.
  She gasped and then exclaimed excitedly, "You bought me the whole series! Oh, Momma! Thank you so much!"
  I have since asked her if she has had the time to watch any of her "Get Smart" DVDs. She said that she watches one show every night before she goes to bed so that she can end her day with laughter. My daughter is 40 now and she says that she still thinks that Maxwell is just as funny today as she did when she was little; actually, she thinks he is funnier because she is watching as an adult this time and understands some of the subtle suggestions and remarks that she had missed as a child.
  When I first saw the price for this set, I thought it was a lot to pay for Maxwell Smart. But, After seeing her expression when she first opened her gift and then hearing how much she has enjoyed watching the movies again, it would be a bargain at twice the price. It is impossible to afix a price tag to the things we enjoy and love. To me, my daughter's happiness is priceless. One hundred dollars is a very small price to pay to give her unlimited laughter.
  If you feel as my daughter does about the "Get Smart" series and think Maxwell Smart is totally funny, you will love this DVD series and be happy with your purchase. My daughter and I highly recommend it.
  I wish you lots of laughter.
