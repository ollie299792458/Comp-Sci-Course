First of all, I'm not a very big fan of action films. I like some, but none has ever caught my attention like Ong-Bak.

I saw this movie as part of an Asian Film Festival at my university. The only prior knowledge I had of this film was that it was from Thailand and that the actors perform all of their stunts without stunt doubles or special effects. Whoop-dee-do, the concept of 'doing one's own stunts' wasn't a completely foreign idea to me (remember Jackie Chan). However, if I didn't know this to be true after watching the movie, I would have thought you were lying to me. The stunts in this movie are incredible!!!

I never thought this movie would be released on DVD in America because it isn't a widely known movie, and doesn't have a big name star. I'm so excited that it is! I was trying to explain to my friends the uniqueness and intrigue of Tony Jaa's style of fighting, but they were too caught up in the mainstream admiration of Jackie Chan and Jet Li (not to say that they aren't great, but they have Hollywood to back them up). Anyway, now I'm glad I can show them Jaa's fantastic talent first hand. I'm sure they're going to want to add this to their movie collections.
