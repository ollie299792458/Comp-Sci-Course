As a kid, I watched this movie over and over!  I loved witches and still do!  I also loved Mary Poppins but this is my favorite!  I used to recite all the spells and try to get my broom off the ground with Nekipo Nekrifs Crumpic Leach and try to perform Substitutiary Locamotion! I'd also sing along to all the songs until my mother wanted to kill me!  I still have my old Vhs version (the 3rd I had to buy becuase I had all but worn out the previous two) I didn't even know it was released on DVD until my mother got it for me two Christmases ago.  I started reading the back and when I found out it was restored, I was plotzing! I now enjoy it even more than I did as a kid!  So give it a try!  It's fabulous! The only thing I was so sad about was that "Step In The Right Direction" was destroyed.  Maybe one day they'll find a print and we'll get to see it!  Another great thing is that Angela Lansbury is fresh from "Mame" and this is one of her better musical roles!  So if you're an Angie fan, as I am, this is the movie for you!
