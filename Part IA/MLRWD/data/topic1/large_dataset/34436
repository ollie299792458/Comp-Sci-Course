I was only 11 when this film hit the cinemas, but i've got it on DVD and its one of my favourites.

Sure, the plot's a bit messed up but there are some good cars and racing scenes.

Dominic Torretto (the sexy Vin Diesel) and his car-crazy team just race around in cars and fix them.

His team are his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) his sister Mia (Jordanna Brewster) a dude named Jesse and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker)

Michelle Rodriguez's "bad-ass bitch" attitude can get on your nerves in some parts but she acts good.

I'd never heard of Paul Walker before I saw this film, but it takes a while for you to figure out that he's an undercover cop.

Oh yeah, Ja Rule's also in it, but not for that long..

Some of the lines these people had to deliver were awful - Vin Diesel " I live my life a quarter mile at a time" Michelle Rodriguez - " Growwl...I can smell skanks" WTF??

All in all, it's a great film, the odd swear word here and there but good entertainment.
