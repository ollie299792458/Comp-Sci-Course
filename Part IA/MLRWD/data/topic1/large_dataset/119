The Master of the Flying Guillotine is my 3rd fav villian(my other 2 are Ghostface Killer & the White Lotus).
I was BLOWN AWAY when i saw Flying Guillotine in action,it is the most impressive Weapon ever seen!i understand
thats a bold statement but i stand by it.This movie does not lack in anything!action,story,weapons?its all there.
Also this movie has many memorable characters,like the 1 armmed boxer,a indian guy that has the power to extend his armes,& a detective that looks alot like Raiden(from Mortal Combat).Now!the movie is by all means a 5 star peice of work,but the dvd in which it comes has flaws. Its not Fantastically re-mastered,but is still watchable.Moreover the dialog switches from english to chinese quite a few times.But i still recomend it.

ALSO!!!this movie includes a Kung Fu Tournement,very similar to the 1's seen on animes such as YuYu Hakusho & Dragon ball Z.That is really impressive & entertaing to watch.As soon as the movie was over i rewinded back to that part(its about 20-30 min long)
