"Out of Africa" is a beautiful and lavish film that is largely shot in Kenya showing off the natural beauty and promise of adventure that this great country offers. What I enjoyed most was the wonderful classical music (including works by Mozart), exceptional photography and the beautiful African scenery complete with animals and lush bush. The movie is brilliantly directed by Sydney Pollack. No wonder this film won seven Oscars, including Best Movie, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Art Director as well as music and sound.

The movie is based on stories by the Danish writer, Karen Blixen. It is based on her experiences in Kenya. Karen Blixen is exceptionally well played by Meryl Streep who displayed wit, talent, adaptability and sensitivity.

The storyline is that Karen cannot marry her true love and she ends up marrying someone else whom she does not love. Their marriage is loveless and devoid of passion. Her husband cheats on her and she cheats on her husband. Karen falls in love with a hunter called Dennis. Dennis loves his freedom and is not prepared for the commitment that Karen wishes. From this is woven an interesting and intricate movie that is well worth watching.
