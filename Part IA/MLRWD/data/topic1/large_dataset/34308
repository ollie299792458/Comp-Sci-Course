This is up there as one of my favourite films of all time. It was recommended to me by my mum who lent me her copy of the dvd. After watching it I immediately went out and bought myself a copy and watch it on a regular basis, recommending it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.

It tells the story of Grace, played brilliantly by Brenda Blethyn, her husband has recently committed suicide and left her with no money, Grace then has to find a way to make money to save her home. What follows is an extremely funny film following the exploits of Grace and her gardener as they try to grow enough dope to get her out of trouble. Anyone who has ever had a `smoke', whether they've inhaled or not, will be able to relate to scenes in this film. Craig Ferguson delivers one of the funniest speeches I've heard in a movie and the scene with the two old women in the shop had me rolling on the floor with laughter the first time I saw it.

Credit has to be given to Craig Ferguson who wrote and produced this film as well as playing the starring role of Matthew, the dope smoking gardener, he's done a truly wonderful job.
