i read the book, but as usual, i try to refrain from comparing the movie to the book.  because if you do, you're usually up for one big fat disappointment.  i would highly recommend people to read the book too.
this is a pretty straightforward and simplistic film.  and my only complaint is that the film doesn't flesh out some things that i really would have liked fleshed out, and it had some loose strings left hanging in the end.  for example, i loved eve and aidan as a couple, yet the film gave them pretty flat portrayals.  on the one hand, you're left wanting to see more, but on the other hand, there is the possibility that the film could spread itself too thin in terms of plot.
the movie was well cast.  minnie driver is phenomenal.  chris o'donnell doesn't get much credit.  and my other favorite was the one who played eve.  she really had spark!  and alan cummings as the irrepressible sean walsh just makes me want to barf!
all in all, the movie's plot is a little thin, but the cast and great scenery more than make up for it.
