Hi folks -

I ordered this as soon as I found out it was available.

If you are like me, you have gotten used to seeing the Dirty Harry movie re-runs on the tv, all chopped up and edited to heck.

If you are a real fan, you will not regret getting this collection.

The movies are all re-mastered with much better color and clarity than you will EVER see on broadcast.

The sound has also been remastered, and is awesome when heard through my amp/speakers. No hiss and noise, just the clear sounds of the movies.

In addition, you will see the movies as they intended to be seen, with all of the repartee that is cut out of the broadcast versions.

The box is very nice, and comes with several postcard-type pictures , and several miniature reproductions of letters that went between the studio and producers and Clint himself when the movies were being planned.

The "badge" replica is a cheaply made piece of crap ( and it is small) , but that is not what drew me to buy this collection.

You will enjoy this immensely if you love Clint and Harry Callahan, and I promise you will get a renewed respect for the movies when you view them uncut and remastered.

Best Regards -
