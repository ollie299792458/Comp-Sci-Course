Given the other reviews, maybe I am just stuck.  I saw this as a play at Arena Stage in DC a couple of years ago, and thought it was absolutely terrific.  Easily one of the best plays I have seen in recent years, and we seem to see a lot.  I am also a big Paltrow and Jake Gyllenhaal fan.

However, I find the film heavy-handed and Paltrow and JG distracting.  This play/screenplay has important things to say about trust, relationships, what things like mathmatics mean to the world, the meaning of genius, etc.  But the movie seems corny, trite, overplayed to me, even though the cast is wonderful.  To me it is as if the actors are doing a fantastic job of acting the wrong parts.  Perhaps the Director just sees something very different for this profoundly excellent story than I do.  (I admit that the character of Claire is dead on.)

I do not want to go on "slamming" a movie that lots of folks seem to really like.  I do not want to discourage folks from seeing this.  And, I really do not want to discourage people from seeing this as a play.
