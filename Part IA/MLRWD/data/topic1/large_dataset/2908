It is a very subtle and deep film. Its dialogues seemes written by a contemporary Harold Pinter. Painful ande strog, it's amazing how we, men, can see the portrait of our diffulties in love. It is a story of men. The momento of the pub where she plays as an actress and her husband talks about pool is terrible. Every word means another. May be one of the finest actors in the actual european cinema. As Isabbelle Hupert and Anni Giradot in THE PIANIST, you can feel how the film touch you deeply , with a lot ofg crossed feelings and without any relatio with the sopa opera style of many of the productios you can see in tv or our screens. Stage actors, Mike Leigh style, maybe the best work of Patrice Cherea, after the overwhlemen Queen Margot. For sensible skins. For people who are tirden of tears in excess and excessive words. Pain in drops falling like a soft rain. Menwill feel a little break at his hearts. That's the way we are, really. Not so strog. Love breas also us. We can lost love battles a lot of times. Like a sad and beautyful ballad, the relation with el excellent book of Hanif Kureishi is perfectly solved by the screenwriter. You can read the book and after or before, see the film with a new experiencia of the deepness of love in the men of our time, so dizzy, so feared, so stupid, without a clear idea about love, sex, women or jealousy. The participation of chilndren is, like Henry James said, a painful turn of screw. The use of the camera i real poetry. The light, the cuts, the supporting roles are all superb- Withou noise, withou "stars", with an authentice sense of art in the direction ande in the job of the layers, all with a great level, hloding the emotion, avoiding blasting, without cries, only whispers, explicit and sad sex and the hjeart squizzed for the silnecs, all those that is not expolained anda happens with th weight of truth, withou words or monologues. For men who accept our weakness. For women who must know this side of us.
