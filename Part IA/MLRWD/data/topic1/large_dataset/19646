Well, I am kind of a fan of the original Starship Troopers movie, and moreso of the second one (Starship Troopers two) so I thought this might be a decent purchase - what the hey I had a gift certificate to burn.  I was kind of skeptical of the quality of the animation and of the storyline when I bought it.

I was very pleasantly surprised.  Each disc has 3-4 hours of different campaigns.  The original characters are covered, but their roles and backgrounds are a bit different than the movie as well as the interaction (Carmen and Johnny never dated in school, Dis and Xander get together, etc...).  The campaigns are kind of self-containted mini-series.  THere is a character that works for the news service and he kind of "documents" the characters and situations throughout the shows.

All-in-all I have to say that this set really exceeded my expectations, and really do a better job of filling the Starship Troopers universe which is a lot better for a storyline than the first movie really gave it service.  If you mildly liked the first movie, or liked the second movie, then I recommend this whole-heartedly.  Make sure to set the time aside - the whole series is roughly 12-16 hours in all - and amazingly R. Lee Ermey makes a voice camo in here.

Good luck and enjoy.
