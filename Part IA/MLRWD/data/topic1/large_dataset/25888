The longer version is significantly better. Rent this first if you can. Ultimately the limited edition has both versions, some commentaries and a nice balsawoodlike case.Is this a horror film, yes. The 'end achieves the reason' of it. And the psychological nuances interplay. There is no 'jack-in-the-box' surprises here. No 'scary movie' themework either. But the townfolk barscene with the Prim Sergeant staying overnite and Britt interesting nextdoor room scene leaves an interesting psyche thrill for Mr. Prim. (Britt does not actually do the scene). The subtle pagan going-ons makes this a lead-in horror.The thriller/suspense concepts comes into play with the Prim Sergeant thinking that he is outthinking the folks here. They are playing him for the fool and even the girl is into the act. This entire movie deals crop harvesting sacrifice and the level of it in paganism. Both Mr Lee and Mr Woodward are serious actors in their own right. There is maypole rituals, there nymph dancing, there is complex hide and seek in pagan costumes. Even Prim Sergeant is in costume (the pagan-folks know that he is trying to outhink them). There is even a little bit of dangerous swordplay 'guillotine' play.Mr. Hitchcock would have enjoyed this. Worth the ten bucks provided it isnt the 88 minute version.It would interesting how Nicholas Cage is going to put this across. But remakes as a general lot just sucks.True 'paganized' horror. Actually true paganism employed relevant doesnt relate to this.
