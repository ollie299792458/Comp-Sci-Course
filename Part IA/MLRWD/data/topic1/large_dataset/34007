Awesome, just awesome.  I believe this is the greatest musical ever, and the movie was well done. As always, Weber's music/Rice's lyrics were excellent.  The crucifiction/39 lashes etc. were pretty graphic, which made the entire movie extremely  moving.  I am a strong Catholic and I love the different views this story presents.  And I gotta say, some of the scenes...I'm not much of a crying person when it comes to movies, but the last scene on the cross and Judas' suicide made me a little teary.  
Some great lyrics to listen for (see if you recognize these): ~"At last, all too well, I can see where we all soon will be"  ~"You sad pathetic man, see where you've brought us to, our ideals die all around us, and all because of you" ~"I have no thought at all about my own reward, I really didn't come here on my own accord" ~"He is not a king, he is just the same, as anyone I know...he scares me so!" (Judas)
~"Why are you obsessed with fighting times and fates you can't defy?" ~"My temple should be...a house of prayer" ~"Judas...must you betray me...with a kiss?" ~"Far too keen on where and how, but not so hot on why." (Jesus)
~"tell me Christ how ya feel tonight" ~"what's the buzz, tell me what's happening?" ~"Jesus I am with you touch me touch me Jesus!" ~"Won't you touch won't ya heel me Christ?" ~"healing cripples...raising from the dead! and now i understand, you're...God.  At least that's what you've said..." (other people, herod)
And of course, the Last Supper part between Jesus and Judas is wonderful.
5 stars all the way!
