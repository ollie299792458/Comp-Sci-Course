In my opinion,  this film stands alongside "The Wizard of Oz", "Charlotte's Web",  and "Mary Poppins"  at the pinnacle of family entertainment.  A great surprise hit when it was released,  it now has a firm and enduring place in the pantheon of great films.

This is a movie for everyone to cherish,  over and over again.  It does not insult childrens' intelligence,  as so many kids flicks do,  and it delights the adults as well.

All of the characters are charming and well developed.  The lush Aussie scenery is gorgeously filmed to great effect.  Extraordinary production values all around.  Babe should have won for best picture--does anyone recall which film beat it?

This is a classic for the ages--and for all ages.  Only the foul-tempered cat might disturb the very young.  And even the adults (me included) will find a box of tissues very handy.  The floodgates open every time I see it.  But nothing here is heavy-handed tragedy a la "Old Yeller" or "The Yearling".  And certainly none of the war and gore of "Watership Down"--which is not for children at all.  This is "G" rated with all that the rating implies.

So,  grab your family,  or watch it with your adult friends.  You can't go wrong with this fine example of cinematic magic and sheer joyousness. Can't wait for the BluRay!  Now how much longer do we have to wait for a truly classic version of "Alice in Wonderland"?
