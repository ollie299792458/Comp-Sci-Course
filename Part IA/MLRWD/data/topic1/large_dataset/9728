A male friend highly recommended this and I pulled it up on Netflix.  I seldom, if ever, write reviews on movies, but this film was so engrossing and touching that I felt this one deserves the time it takes to write one. I think the director did an outstanding job and Annette Benning, along with the others, were awesome. I saw what she was going through, but it was hard to find sympathy for her, at first.  I was proud of Jimmy Smits losing it in the parking lot.  My man is older, but still gorgeous (don't his eyes just say 'dangerous'?).  Epatha (my fav Law & Order character) was on her JOB! I loved Kerry Washington's face when her mom(Epatha) told her to shape up in no uncertain terms. Naomi Watts had that hard shell, because of her circumstances.  Soon as I can plan to buy this one just so my mom can watch it.  The plot was not hard to follow if you sit still and pay attention.  I didn't forget Sam, because I will watch anything he is in.  Even the pregnant teen, her mom, the nun,and the maid and her daughter played their part in this very good movie. Recommend.
