This if for the blu-ray trilogy. I would give this set 3.5 stars, but my phone's only letting me do whole stars...

I've come to appreciate these films more over time; especially after seeing previews of Twilight. The art direction & costumes are superb. The story in the 3rd film, Rise of the Lycans, is by far my favorite, even without Kate Beckinsale; it feels complete, important & epic. Bill Nighy does a great job, and I'm to the point where I'm not as bothered by Michael Sheen's bulging-eye business. All of the films do a good job setting up and executing the action sequences. Even if they are a bit predictable, it's fun to watch it play out, and to wait for the other shoe to drop (or half a head).

Rise of the Lycans is also the best looking of the 3 on blu-ray; the costumes are the most ornate of the series, and I'm guessing it was shot 100% digital; the other 2 movies are clear but not quite as sharp. All of the films have grain, either due to the low lighting, or intentional effect; doesn't bother me.

I actually exchanged this set, due to a significant hang-up in Lycan's interactive menu. The disc's laminant was too thin, and the digital etchings were exposed to open air (not ideal). As it turned out, the lamination was not the issue; my new disc looked like it was manufactured correctly, but still got hung up. I researched it online and found out I had to upgrade my blu-ray player's firmware. I have an older player - a Samsung BD-P1500. Once I updated the firmware, the hang-up was gone.

I'd recommend this series to anyone who likes Lord of the Rings, or blood-soaked historical epics in general.
