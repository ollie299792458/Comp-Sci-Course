The teaming of Stephen King and George Romero is a Horror classic!  The stories alone aren't exactly scary, save for "The Crate" which is a stand alone scarefest.  But nonetheless this video is an essential purchase for any Horror fan!  Five stories, all written by Stephen King are contained within.
"Father's Day" is about a mean spirited old man who comes back from the grave to give his even meaner family their just desserts.
"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verril" stars King himself as a lonely farmer who finds a meteor and its strange growing properties.  King's performance is hilarious, as is his Chia Pet transformation.
"Something To Tide You Over" is a great story, starring Leslie Nielson and Ted Danson.  About a slighted man's revenge toward his wife and her lover.  And how the tide has a habit of bringing things back.  Up until the end this is a highly original thriller, with a seriously twisted murder weapon.  Entertaining, but not scary.
"The Crate" is the best of the bunch, a scary monster story.  Hal Holbrook is a professor with a problem.  His wife.  When he's asked to help a colleague with something very old and dangerous that lives in a crate and likes to eat people, he thinks of the perfect meal for the creature.  Graphic, violent, and strangely funny this is reason enough to purchase this movie.
"They're Creeping Up On You" is about a very powerful old man who likes to step on those who get in his way.  But he has a deep fear of bugs.  Probably the worst of the bunch, but worth watching for the end.  
The comic book element throughout, and a very nasty ending brought to us by a disobedient child and a mail order voodoo doll.  Creepshow is a must have for the Horror fan, especially if you ever read any of the old E.C. comics which can still be obtained through reprint editions at your local comic book store.
