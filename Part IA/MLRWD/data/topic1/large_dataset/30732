For the laughs alone, this one's worth renting--for a dollar. Indistinguishable from its predecessors except for its premise, which begins at a race track. There, a group of obnoxiously moronic, attractive, foul-mouthed college kids are the focus of a catastrophe about to happen. One of the boys has a premonition of a disaster, which begins as a multi-car mashup culminating with vehicles and various auto parts and even the stadium itself becoming shrapnel missiles attacking spectators.

In a blink, everything's back to normal the way it was just prior to the accident. It was a vision but suddenly everything in the vision prior to the disaster is identical. From here, the film becomes a menagerie of how creative can we see someone die. And the basic question is this: do we control our fate, or does fate control us? Also, what happens if we thwart fate by intervening and saving a life? The answer in these films seems to be: fate gets really pissed! I've found these films to be a good mindless excursion, actually funnier than films that are made to be so. Maybe these films should be labeled Horror/comedies. Definitely fun for the whole family!
