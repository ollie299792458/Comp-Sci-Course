I liked this movie to begin with.  Unfortunately, once Rodney had arrived at Robot City, I soon began to lose interest.

The biggest problem with this movie is that there are far, far too many characters that crowd each other and overwhelm the plot.  Robin Williams is annoying and old - his jokes are repetitive and have been done already in other movies.  I just watched Disney's Aladdin a few weeks back, and couldn't help thinking Robin Williams' performance in robots was "robot genie!"  Most of the other characters are very forgettable.

The animation looks good and the movie does not feel too dated.  The world was very detailed and interesting.  It felt huge and populated.

The plot itself was very simplistic and didn't really develop much beyond its basic "you can follow your dreams whoever you are" beginnings.  The world was nice and left me with that feeling that you could watch the movie a dozen times and always notice something fun and interesting going off in the background.  Unfortunately, I could barely get through this movie once and won't be watching it again.  The whole thing left me clock-watching and bored.

Robots was not a particularly funny movie, and I thought the humor in places was plain obnoxious-fart and ass jokes?  No thanks.  There were a couple of jokes in there that only the adults might get (most of them background stuff, that you'll only spot if you're paying attention) but for the most part, this movie didn't earn more than a "hah" from me.  Very disappointing.

The ending made me happy only because I was glad the movie was over.  Maybe a very young child would enjoy this movie, but anyone else should save themselves the boredom and watch something like Shrek instead.
