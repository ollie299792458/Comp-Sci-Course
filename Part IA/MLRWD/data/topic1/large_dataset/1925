A bold and provocative eye opening look at the future of "our way of life" on a global proportion as a result of the imminent looming oil crisis confirming the "survival of the fittest" human condition our world faces.

The results of the various scientific studies and models are staggering.  They lead us to a better understanding as to why governments and corporations are scrambling "in a race against time" to secure the future remaining limited oil resources in the Middle East (Iraq) and Arctic poles.

Yet, it isn't all gloom and doom.  In fact, it is somewhat inspiring and comforting to know that there are brilliant entrepreneurial and scientific "visionary thinkers" working towards alternative global methods of energy resources.

But, what is most fascinating is the realization of the urgency and importance of compelling every continent and their respective governments to form a global authoritative organization who's goal is to establish and execute a universal master plan for the equitable contribution and distribution of the various alternative forms of energy that exists on our planet.
