Best X-Men movie so far.  I most enjoyed the scenes about the teenagers - the challenges Rogue and Bobby have to deal with in their relationship, the attack on the school, Logan and the kids on the run and briefly taking refuge at Bobby's family's house, etc.  It was neat seeing the fantastical world of the mutants intersecting with the mundane human world for a little while.

I was also very glad to see my favorite X-Man, Nightcrawler, have a role to play; even better that he was played by Alan Cumming, one of my favorite actors.  Not one of Cumming's best performances, but the makeup was so challenging that I don't mind much.  The film's opening scene, Nightcrawler's failed assassination attempt, is one of the best scenes in the franchise.

Ian McKellen is excellent as Magneto, and I liked Patrick Stewart as Professor X.  Storm's hairstyle is better here than in the other movies, though Scott and Jean are still annoying.

The part near the end where Wolverine chooses to live in the present rather than dwell in the past was cheesy, with him carrying that kid in a bit of too-blatant symbolism; but whatever.  The movie was good enough overall to overlook nitpicky things like that.
