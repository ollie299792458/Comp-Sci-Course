I was hesitant to watch this after reading some of the reviews about how intensely graphic some of the rape scenes and murder scenes in the movie were.  However, after watching the movie, while I can't exactly say that I'm glad I watched it, I can say that this film is a nail biting, edge of my seat, scary ass, thriller of a mystery movie.  It's one hell of a great whodunnit.  I love the balance between the psychology of the main characters and the mystery unfolding, and that while Mikael never really gets to find out Lisbeth's story, we get hints of it every now and again.  We understand why she is so connected to Mikael and to finding out what happened to Harriet, but that while he doesn't quite grasp it, he's just accepted that he's along for the ride.  And, I love that he is willing to just let her figure that out on her own.  And, of course, then there's the mystery itself... What happened to Harriet???

I'm very sad to hear that the author is deceased and that this incredible talent will not be sharing his brilliance in the future.  This book and movie were stunning.  I can't wait to see the next two movies, and am looking forward to reading the next two books.
