If we were to translate the dynamics of Cameron's film, The Abyss, into human relationships, what might it resemble? Imagine two children who are fighting. They've even found some dangerous weapons and are threatening each other. Seeing this, their parents decide upon a plan. After all, they don't like seeing their children fighting. So, they go into their room, grab the handguns they keep as a means of protection, and rush the kids. They cock the triggers, screaming, "We're gonna kill you!" After holding the guns to the kids foreheads for several seconds they lower the guns. The message is clear. "Best be on good behavior, because if you're not, we can kill you."

Some message, huh? That is The Abyss in a nutshell. The film is actually quite good until its denouement. The suspense, the tension between the paranoid Navy S.E.A.L. and Ed Harris, one an authoritarian goon and the other a quite good leader with an ability to relate with other humans, are all quite well done. But the conclusion ruins it all, in addition to the fluorescent Gray-alien/fairy/angel water-beings. It's quite fascinating, and disappointing, to see a film-maker trying to imagine what a "higher" or "more developed" being's response would be to the follies of humanity, and falling flat on his face in the process. Cameron simply imagines a response as authoritarian as any we see in our world. The action is supposedly prompted by concern, and love, and yet all the aliens can muster is a supreme show of force. "Change your ways, because if you don't, you know I have the power to wipe you out at any moment." Nothing like traumatizing people into "correct" behavior. It really shows that Cameron has no clue about the depths of human nature, or the "higher" response in such a situation. And it's a "schizoidal declaration" if there ever was one! (google it)
