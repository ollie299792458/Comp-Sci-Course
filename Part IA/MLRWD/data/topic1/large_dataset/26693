Overall, I thought this video was excellent and the moves are like nothing I've done before. I do think it would be very challenging for the new mom who is just getting back into an exercise routine. In fact, I might feel a bit defeated if this was my intro to getting back into shape. 45 minutes is also a big time commitment for the new mom, let alone if you have more than one child to care for. (Tracy must have forgotten about the fatigue that you experience when you have a newborn!) My baby is almost a year and I have been going to the gym at least twice a week and working with a trainer every other week for 6 months now and I can't even do some of the exercises in this video. (I'm about 5 pounds shy of my pre-pregnancy weight and bought this video to supplement my gym outings.) This said, I am going to stick with this video and hope to buy more of hers once I master this one. Her moves (especially the the arm workout) are very elegant and ballet-like. You can see that these moves are second nature to her, having been a dancer but they are not to me so I sure hope I am doing them correctly! Overall, I really like this dvd and the filming is indeed beautiful and calming.
