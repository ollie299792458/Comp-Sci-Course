After reading only the very first pages of the book, it became obvious to  me what the book was not trying to do - be a comprehensive, scholarly and  totally accurate history of the crusades. In order to meet these goals, the  book would have had to include detailed maps, detailed chronological  timelines etc. It would definitely not have included hinted (and usually  unsupported) suppositions relating to the motivations of the various  protagonists.
So what was the book trying to do? It appears to me to have  been trying to portray the story of the crusades in les than 200 small  pages of extremely enjoyable commentary, addressing both the political,  religious, military and economic sub-motivations of the process (with the  occasional humorous quip), without getting bogged down in the levels of  detail which are best dealt with in the specialized histories. 
End  result - a wonderful read, which can serve as a perfect launching ground  for additional reading of the specialized subjects. If your goal is just to  get an overview of the crusades for general knowledge purposes - this is  the book for you. If your goal is to become an expert on the topic - this  is a great way to get started.
Enjoy!
