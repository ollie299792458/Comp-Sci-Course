The first thing you have to do to get anything out of this movie at all is to forget the book. Completely. The movie so 'freely adapts' the book, that really all that remains of the book's plot is a ghost of a germ of an idea about a Puritan woman who gets pregnant by someone who is not her husband. That's about where the similarity ends. Secondly, you must be willing to approach this movie with something of a split perspective: on the one hand, it is a perfectly enjoyable story of romance; on the other, it has some really funny moments that were not intended to be funny at all. Like the love scene. It's both hot and hilarious at the same time. All that falling (catch the symbolism!) grain everywhere...goodness! Hope it didn't get anywhere...sensitive. Another hilarious scene is when Robert Duvall holds up baby Pearl screaming "THE DEVIL'S OWN CHILD!"  And that dance he did with the deer carcass...kinda bloody but still funny as hell. Finally, realize that this movie is unabashedly a Demi-fest, as in see Demi look Defiant, see Demi look Witchy, see Demi look Sexy.... you get the idea. And sometimes you'll wonder if Gary Oldman wasn't having to hold back a chuckle or two himself.

If you can keep all that in mind, and admittedly, that's a lot of leeway to give this movie, but if you can do it, go ahead, and enjoy this movie on its own terms. Someone else here said it: it's escapism, pure and simple. It is NOT the book, but I don't think it ever intended to be. And getting to see Gary Oldman skinny-dipping is fine with me any day.
