I am used to seeing Mel Gibson in serious roles with exemplary acting requirements &amp; it felt queer to see him goofing around, wearing women's dresses, fully made up &amp; waxing his legs in his dire efforts to get an idea on "what women really want".
The situations following his freak accident, which gave him this special gift of hearing women's thoughts, were funny at first but they later on grew tiring.  One just did't know if he was genuine with all this new sincerity or was simply taking advantage to further his career.  
As it later turned out, he was more on to the latter.  But guilt stricken as he was &amp; finding himself truly in love afterall, (&amp; finally losing his gift in another freak accident) changed him for the better.  Well, there couldn't be any other ending.  He couldn't go on hearing women's thoughts forever...nor could he go on lying to those close to him.  The film had to end that way...cheesy...everybody happy...but the denouement was kind'a flat compared with the humorous line up of events preceding it.
If you want to have a quick laugh &amp; don't have much to do, this movie is generally ok to watch.
