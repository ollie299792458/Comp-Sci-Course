A lot of sequels are shameless retreads of earlier material with nothing new to explore or for the audience to experience.  Then there are some sequels which are worthy of the original, and there are even few sequels which outshine the original.  Lethal Weapon 2 is one of those.  This first sequel in the "Lethal" series is from beginning to end a roller coaster ride of action, comedy, suspense and drama.  It is more "Lethal Weapon" than the first film was.
The story picks up a few years after the first film as Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return as cops Riggs and Murtaugh. They are on the brink of busting a huge drug smuggling ring and are reassigned to protect a government informant named Leo Getz played by Joe Pesci who should have been considered for an Oscar in this performance.  
The introduction of the Getz character is the film's stroke of genius.  In the first film Riggs and Murtaugh complained and bickered with each other.  Now 2 years later the audience knows they are close friends, so bickering would seem unrealistic and a retread of the first film.  They now have Getz to complain about and insult which gives the film many comic scenes.  This action/adventure is as funny as a straight out comedy.
While the action is more abundant this time it does not replace story or character development like in most sequels.  This film pays great respect to the events in the first film by continuing the Riggs/Murtaugh friendship storyline and having them bond even more than before.
Lethal Weapon 2 is everything what a great sequel should be.
