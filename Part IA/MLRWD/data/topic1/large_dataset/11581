This is not the way America is accustomed to seeing Julia Roberts. She doesn't act here like she did with "Pretty Woman", "I Love Trouble", or for that matter: " America Sweethearts", "Sleeping With The Enemy", or "Hook". There's one thing missing that's in all the movies I mentioned, and that's Julia's laughter. That laugh of hers as far as I'm concerned has become her trademark. Actors and Actresses all have a trademark as far as I'm concerned. George Burns always and forever had a stogey in his mouth, Groucho Marx always with those wire-rimmed glasses, and Julia Roberts with her laugh. However, don't think because she doesn't laugh in this movie that means it isn't good, on the contrary this shows her ability to drop her Georgian accent, and trade it for an almost Irish accent, but it also shows her ability to act in crossover films which prepared her for an I believe an Oscar nomination for supporting actress for the film "Stepmom". The story line I will have to look into this further, and see if Robert Louis Stevenson had a character named Mary Reilly in his story "Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde". If it's not it's still a good suspensful flick.
