If you like shoot'em up sci-fi movies with explosions, tons of gore and evil aliens, I suggest you watch a different movie.  However, if you like movies that make you think and have meaning, then this one is for you.
Not far into our future, the human race finds itself in a territory war with a reptilian alien race called the Dracs.  During one such battle, a soldier from each side crashes on a planet called Fyrine IV and after a brief hand-to-hand find they must rely on each other to survive.  Their reluctance to trust each other eventually melts away and the limits of their new friendship is tested when Fyrine reveals a few of her secrets.
The DVD does have 3 behind the scenes stills, original trailers (Enemy Mine, Alien, and Alien Nation....notice a theme?) and an interactive menu but that's IT!  No extended scenes, no interviews, no "behind the scenes" footage, nothing.  2005 will be the 20th anniversary of "Enemy Mine"'s release and this fan is hoping Fox will make good and release a collector's edition with more bonus material for said anniversary.
