My Korean partner devoured this in just three or four days a couple years ago, and I always felt cheated that I couldn't watch it. I my family to chip in on this whole set, though, for my birthday, and it was worth it!

Other reviews have talked about the historical sweep of this, and it really is a fascinating look at an exciting time and place.

Some of the funny things, though: the dentistry and make-up are distractingly perfect. Each character - male and female - is simply encased in circa-1995 foundation make-up, and each has their own palette, according to their personality. Boy, Koreans in 1500 had some serious lip gloss goin' on!

The music gets old, too, when you watch episode after episode. Having said that, I know that you're only meant to watch one a week, on TV.

Another is the plot - Jang Geum is like a yo-yo! Every other episode she gets kicked out of the palace (or almost kicked out) for something or other, and someone intervenes and she's back. Also, episode 39 is really the climax - very, very satisfying... but then there are five more episodes - almost an epilogue.

Still, these are minor points in the grand scope of this addictive drama - and 10 years from now, when I've forgotten it all, I'll be prepared to dust them off and watch them again!
