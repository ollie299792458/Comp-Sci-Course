Being an employee at Blockbuster Video I like to assume that I have a pretty good handle on judging a movie for what it is and what it does. "The Squid and the Whale" is a fantastic portrayal of the ultimate dysfunctional family and it challengers it's viewers to examine how the characters are behaving and check to see if relating to the film is a little easier than it seems.

  With all of the sequels and prequels of existing movies and ideas floating around lately it was essential for a movie like this one to come around and keep this year a respectable one for films. This film refused to fall into Hollywood clich?s and unwarranted hype. Jeff Daniels was the focal point in my opinion and while the others actors did a fine job, Jeff Daniels is the man who single handedly made this movie special. He achieved this by becoming Bernard, a slipping writer whose opinions and temper are present throughout this amazing film.

  Throughout the movie you go on a journey with Bernard to see in what new and exciting ways he can destroy his family, whether it's being to pompous to salvage his decaying marriage, allowing his small child the opportunity to drink alcohol, or devastating his son's view of relationships. This movie is so great simply because it is real. There are people like Bernard out there and this where this movie gets it's entertainment value. This is simply put one of the best films of the year. While watching this film you will experience: hate, love, lust, rage, victory, defeat and the best movie experience around right now.

  Though there are other movies out there right now that remain realistic and stray from Hollywood norms, such as "Broken Flowers" or "Closer," The Squid and the Whale is simply the most entertaining and original one. Do yourself a favor, buy this movie.
