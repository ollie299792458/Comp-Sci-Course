I've noticed how there seem to be a lot more people disagreeing with the positive reviews given HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE then agreeing.  I'm surprised.

It certainly will never get confused as a Pulitzer contender but taken as it is - a time capsule snapshot of late 40's/ early 50's America and the American Dream - it is quite accurate, on point, and down right funny.

The three women work wonderfully well together.  Grable was the 20th Century Fox star; Bacall had the panache; Monroe was the up and coming one that everybody was talking about - and what should have turned into a diva-fight mess resulted in a laugh filled movie.

The whole concept is dated but let's face it - we are talking about a movie made 60 years ago!  People have all dutifully noted that (and the slap it gives to women's lib) but no one has recorded that the movie is fun - pure, plain and simple.  Some of the lines are witty and there are enough inside jokes to make it an instant classic.

Watch it with an open mind and don't look for deep messages - just have fun with it - the cast certainly did and that is what makes this an enjoyable film.
