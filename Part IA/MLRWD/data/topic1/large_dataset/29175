Rounders is such a fun and exciting movie to watch.  This is a very under-rated movie!  I'm probably biased because I happen to enjoy poker very much, and this movie is definitely a poker player's movie.  The story and plot are very interesting, but the stars really steal the show here.  Matt Damon plays a smart poker player who struggles with the choice of living the "gamblers life" which is where his heart and skill reside, or trying to be a "normal" person with a normal job.  Edward Norton plays his weasely friend who is always finding trouble and needs Matt Damon to bail him out.  The real star of the show is the owner of a poker club played brilliantly by John Malkovich.  He plays a principal role in the movie as the driving force behind a fight for the main characters life vis a vis the poker table.  You will not regret watching this movie.  The only downside is that some of the moves made by Matt Damon are somewhat foolishly believed to be super suave, and might actually be terrible in real life poker.
