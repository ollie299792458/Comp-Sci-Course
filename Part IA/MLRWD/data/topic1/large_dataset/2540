I remember looking forward to the Criss Angel Halloween shows he used to do for the ABC Family channel. The guy would do things that would literally make me gasp. But I guess that is what good magic is supposed to do, huh? It is supposed to get you to question what is real and what is not. Because I believe so strongly in the power of the mind and its ability to do anything, I often wonder if Criss Angel is giving us a preview of the possibilities that are inherent within each of us. Not that I'm particularly eager to be put in a pine box and go through a wood chipper.

My wife, who practices Wicca, says that a lot of the things he is able to do are not illusions, he really is doing them. He is able to convince himself that he is the illusion and that the magic is real. Most spiritual masters believe that this every day reality isn't reality at all, it's all illusion; that there is really is nothing that is solid, that everything is Energy. Even Albert Einstein said this. But even though I have a feeling that they are right, that everything I see is simply a projection of my own mind and what it wants to believe, I'm going to leave it to Criss Angel to walk around on fire only to fall down, collapse, and have the fireman that put him out be Criss Angel himself. Huh? All I can say is, you gotta see it. Criss always comes out of these things with a smile on his face, which is also something that Spiritual Masters tend to do. Y'see, they know...we don't...we're left scratching those heads we think our so solid and so real.

Do I recommend this collection? Heck, yeah...it will freak you out, but it will also make you start to question what we really are capeable of being, of doing, of experiencing. But don't worry about it too much, afterall, none of it's ultimately real...
