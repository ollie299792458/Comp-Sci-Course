At first I thought this movie was so original and imaginative. It is filmed beautifully. The clothing and scenery. The colors. The music. I enjoyed the narration. But you keep waiting for Ben Wishaw's character Jean-Baptiste to get interesting. He is emotionless. As another reviewer said you almost don't care what happens to any of the characters. (Although I thought Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman did a fine job with their smaller roles). Especially Jean-Baptiste. But he's so irritating with his lack of personality or emotion that I really disliked him. Stop reading here is you don't want to read a spoiler. The main plot twist is that Jean-Baptiste wants to get his hands on the beautiful Laura and so since he is the villian of the story you hope that he will, of course, not kill her like all the other girls. And even when he gets into her room you hope, somehow she will escape. You hope that finally one of the girls will be able to defend themselves... but no, that would have actually given the movie a little suspense. He killed any chance of that when he killed her. But I kept thinking that the movie might improve with an interesting twist of an ending. There is a fine line between interesting and just ridiculous. Some people loved this entire movie including the ending. I felt the ending became so bizarre and strange that it was unpleasant to watch. It was so unfufilling and stupid that I have to give this movie 1 star, despite it's promising beginning. Maybe, as another reviewer said, the book is great. I haven't read the book. But I hated this movie. Unless you enjoy period movies, enjoy great costumes or really, really bizarre movies I recommend renting this movie - like if you have Netflix and you won't be wasting $5 to watch it. If you want to see a good movie with interesting characters, suspense and mystery see the Illusionist instead.
