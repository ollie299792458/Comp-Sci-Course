I had heard a lot about "Death Wish" before seeing the movie on video.  A friend gave me the second, third and fourth sequel, and I have the Jody Foster remake titled "The Brave One."  So I ordered a copy of the original "Death Wish."
Why was this movie such a box office success?  My guess is that this urban "western" answered the question: what if the good guys played by the same rules as the bad guys?  "Death Wish" hit theaters in 1974, at a time when American society was perceived as exploding into utter chaos.  People thought that their world was ending.  "Death Wish" was a chance to see the good guys win for a change.
For a modernized B-movie Western, this isn't unwatchable.  And it is a classic.
The DVD I purchased from Amazon is bare bones--just the movie, some movie trailers and subtitles in English for the deaf and hard of hearing.  The two audio options are hearing the movie in French or English.
Notice that I haven't reviewed the movie.  Many hundred other people have done that.  At least one book analyzed the "Death Wish" phenomenon.  I decided to see for myself what all the hype was about.  I recommend that you follow my example and make up your own mind.
