Okay, so by some childrearing targedy, I missed out on Duran Duran the first time.  I loved (well, still do) their Wedding Album, but was not really familiar with their older stuff.  This summer, they played the Fox Theater in St. Louis (truly a showplace, but still intimate).  After watching that horrible NBC show this summer with bands from the 80's that traumatized my poor husband (FLOCK OF SEAGULLS>>> THIS MEANS YOU!), I did not have terribly high expectations.  Well, Simon LeBon and crew rocked OUT.  I have NEVER EVER been so ENTERTAINED at a show before.  They were enjoying themselves on stage and LeBon was hamming it up and I was on the Duran Duran bandwagon 20 years too late.

So what's my point? This DVD totally captures the experience.  The concert CD is played constantly in the Pathfinder and even our 8 month old son loves to Reach Up For The Sunshine (or the moonroof).  Anyway, very impressive package, although the 3d glasses thing was kinda lame.  I felt like Ralphie with his Little Orphan Annie decoder ring in "A Christmas Story."

If you know a Duran Duran fan, BUY THIS FOR THEM.  Not saying, I am JUST SAYING!
