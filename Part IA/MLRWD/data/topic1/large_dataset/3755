This is the most ridiculous film I have ever seen.  The absolute absurdity and unbelievability of the entire plot is beyond belief.  And you know what?  I loved this film.  Natasha Lyonne gives a stellar performance as Megan, a high school cheerleader who is sent away in order to rid herself of what her parents see as "unnatural tendencies".  While there, she meets Mary, brilliantly played by Cathy Moriarty, the head of the camp who has taken over the task of ingraining heterosexual values into the ditzy high school student.  During her stay she comes into contact with a motley group of people trying to go straight. Clea Duvall's portrayal of Graham as a pessimistic and brooding parental disappointment is the perfect foil for the optimistic/goody two shoes Megan and is never overblown or excessive.  RuPaul's performance as Mary's assistant and Eddie Cibrian's portrayal as her son Rock, are extremely funny and absurd at the same time.  Although this film is a satire on the "ex gay" movement, there are some scenes that are so accurate and true regarding love, attraction and disappontment, that the viewer ends up nodding in agreement.  Do yourself a favor and watch this film.  It's hilarious!
