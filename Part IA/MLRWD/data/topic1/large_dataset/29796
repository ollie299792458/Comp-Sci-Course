I say it's a non-zombie movie because in both 28 Weeks Later, and it's predecessor, 28 Days Later, we never actually see a zombie.  The Rage, a primate virus, has infected England's population and turns it's people into maddened monsters that are out for blood.  Just one drop of contaminated blood is enough to infect anybody or anything it comes in contact with.

This film picks up where 28 Days left off.  We're in England and the city has been deserted for about 28 weeks after the events of the first film.  It is now time to repopulate the major cities and try to start life (for those whom survived) all over again.  But is the virus really gone, or had it just been laying dormant?

I'm a huge fan of zombie movies and I'm glad to say that this one doesn't disappoint, it's even better than the original.  Containing one of the coolest helicopter-vs-other-stuff scenes I've ever seen, and one of the scariest/suspenseful night-vision shots, plus a great (although predictable) ending, this could be one of the best horror movies I've seen to date.  I'd even say that this series is bringing back elements to the horror genre that once made it so great.  Most modern horror movies stink, but the 28.. series is shining a light on the genre again that just may revive it to what it once was back in the 70's and 80's.  Don't miss this one, you'de regret it if you did.
