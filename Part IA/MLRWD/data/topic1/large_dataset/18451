John Carpenter took a good movie and made it GREAT..It's not really a horror film..it's not really a sci fi film..It's a movie about trust, paranoia, morality, isolation...and a a heck of a lot more..

Few remakes...and hollywood loves to make them...even come close to the original in quality..This movie of John carpenter simply called "The Thing" is one of them. Another I can think of but not nearly the "leap" attained by "The Thing" is "Invasion of the Body Snatcher" (1978). The original was sooo good it was, in my mind, not going to be out done..Well, IT WAS!!

If you are on the fence about this film all i can say is you do not have to be a horror fan nor a Sci Fi fan nor any specific genre fan to enjoy..and I mean really enjoy..this film

The blu-ray release has amazing Pic quality..they did their job. And Awesome HD lossless audio which gives you the feeling you are a character in the film..It puts you as close as possible in the movie.The score is incredible

I have both the DVD and the blu-ray...The Dvd is well done so if you do not have blu-ray I wouldn't hesitate to buy it.

For me, this is a movie which can be viewed every once in awhile and thoroughly enjoyed each time..

Worth the purchase..
