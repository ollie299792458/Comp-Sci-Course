Excellent animation and art combine with a unique storyline and striking choreography to form a memorable experience.  The experience is made more memorable by the bizaare turns of the story, which condenses the plotline of a manga series effectively into 80 minutes by using lavish doses of symbolism.  My only warning is that viewers might want to be familiar with the Utena story before seeing this movie.  Essentially, the director has retold the story with a great deal of imagery and symbolism as a way of revisiting a well known set of characters and storyline, almost as a fond rememberance for existing fans.  This anime, therefore, will be enjoyed by those who know the story and most by those who are rabid Utena fans.  In Japan, Utena is an absolute craze, breaking so many boundaries in a world of manga already known for challenging traditional social mores.  This movie targets those people who have already joined the legions of devout fans and who want more, more, more... .  STill, regardless of whether or not you are an Utena fan, this one is so unique and so well produced that, even with some imagery and symbolism that may be difficult to grasp... this is enjoyable and, more than anything else, memorable anime.  I may not watch it again very soon, but will certainly watch it again, and, in between these times, I will continue to think of certain scenes from time to time and puzzle over their meaning and their absolutely striking strangeness!  Enjoy...
