First of all, after I saw the trailer I was like "DZAAAAAAAAAMN!!!" and I HAD to get this movie, I thought to myself. I had real high expectations after seeing that trailer and reading up on the movie from multiple sources including Fangoria (I usually don't read that but it had an article on this movie so I was psyched to read it). I bought the movie, watched it, and seriously felt the deepest most unfullfilling...feeling ever. I don't see what all the hype was about this movie. It's true that it's KIND of original in the sense that the kids in this are actually smart and bring weapons with them and think of smart/desparate places to hide, but that being said everything else is pretty plain. SOME scenes are gross, but nothing a TRUE horror/gore fan will think new and unusual. I have to say, for people who don't watch these movies it will probably make you a little sick because of how twisted the movie is (especially during the credits), but seriously.....don't get this if you like horror. What a waste of money. Either that or expect the worst of the worst of the worstest worst ever, and MAAAAAYBE you'll enjoy it.

In summary:
Pros-Good Story. Original. Bloody in some parts. Pretty twisted.
Cons-Nothing special in the horror field. Leaves the viewer feeling empty inside and wishing the movie did more with itself. That alone makes the movie not worth the buy.
