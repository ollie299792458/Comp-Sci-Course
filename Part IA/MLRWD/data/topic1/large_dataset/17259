 All right, one day--being a professed Eyrehead--I decided to rent as many versions of Jane Eyre as I could and watch them all to see which I liked best. From those three (this one, the A&amp;E version and the William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg version), I'd have to say the version with William Hurt was the best.  
I watched this one first. Joan Fontaine has always sort of annoyed me. She was perfect for her character in Rebecca because that girl is *supposed* to be shy and timid, but she lacks the fire needed for Jane Eyre. She--to my surprise--burst forward in a few scenes and produced a flicker, but never enough to truly capture the character. 
Something in this movie has *thoroughly* discontented me though. It produces a feeling against Mr. Rochester that is undeserved. In the versions that I have watched, he *always* leaves her at the altar and walks out of the church in the ultimate marriage scene. In the book it says he "twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side" and then "Still holding me fast, he left the church". The fact that he leaves her there alone to deal with the horror she has just discovered makes you dislike him and feel incredibly bad for Jane, but those feelings should not be produced because he does *not* leave her there and I wish some director would realize that and get it right. 
Now that that's dealt with, I *will* say in praise of the movie that Orson Welles is a fine Mr. Rochester and while I don't think I will ever see an actor who captures him as I have in my mind, he has an interpretation that could be taken as true. If you want to see a version of Jane Eyre that's very true to the book, I don't know what to recommend (maybe the Timothy Dalton version, although I haven't seen it). But, if you want something entertaining with the great Orson Welles in it, look no further!
