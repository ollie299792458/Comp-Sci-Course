Am I the only one who thinks this film is assinine and full of propaganda? In the interest of full disclosure I did not sit through the whole thing as I could not get past all the excuses made for bad behavior. This film makes many assumptions that play to the uninformed. Here was my favorite exchange: "These kids are not activists, they're criminals and gang bangers" to which Hillary Swank's character responds: "But didn't they say the same thing about the Black Panthers?" Are you effing kidding me??!!!!

The black panthers WERE criminals and gang bangers who went under the guise of being civil rights activists. in addition to the agenda this film has playing to race baiting politics, it is just dull by almost any standard. Downright silly and melodramatic at times. The cinematography is stilted and lifeless. Straight color palette with handheld shots done simply to add the missing intensity to stupid situations. If you want to see a great film about the true story of someone who goes into a ghetto school and makes a difference rent "Lean On Me" with Morgan Freeman. An excellent film that doesn't make excuses for destructive and despicable lifestyles. Also check out Akeelah and the Bee. Contrast Fishburne's character with Swank's, you'll see what I mean. It was financed in part by MTV. What a shocker!! Now go ahead make your comments about how unenlightened I am.
