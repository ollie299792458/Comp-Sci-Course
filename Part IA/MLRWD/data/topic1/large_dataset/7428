Wow! This is one of my favorite old Japanese monster flicks of all time. Toho really brought to life three of the biggies in a fight over their homeland and another land you'll learn all about in the second of the Ghidorah/Monster Zero series. Throw in Godzilla and Rodan and you have a nasty little recipe for an all out war of the prehistoric monsters of the far east. This Godzilla installment also features a nice trip into orbit to a galaxy far far aw...uh well, you get the picture. In the process the big lizard and the huge old wind makin bird of prey get hijacked and taken up to a rock in space that ruled by a three headed ball of fury. The trio ends up back at earth for a whopper of a tag team match featuring Zilla and Ridan vs. Monster Zero!! Throw in a some heavy duty sonic waves, the Japanese army, a semi love story involving clones, and a mean ole group of non earthlings who covet our digs and whahlah..the result is a king sized battle that doesnt necessarily end in death. Have fun watching this great flick of the Japanese monsters at their best.
