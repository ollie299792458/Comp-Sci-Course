This movie has been described as a Twilight Zone episode written by Clive Barker, and that's as close a description as any.  The whole set-up of the film is rather imaginative, and one of the joys of the film is watching the characters figure out how to navigate this shifting maze without getting killed in gruesome fashion.  One of the other pleasures of the film is the visuals and special effects-- for a low-budget film, the sets look damn good (especially considering the difficulties they had making this-- the commentary on the making of it is almost as interesting as the film itself).
On the negative side, the script succumbs to the cliche of having the characters fight amonst themselves for no other reason than to generate conflict.  Others have faulted the acting and dialogue, but I don't think those aspects were that detrimental.  More importantly, however, the film lacks the existential weight that would have given a real Kafkaesque tone to the situation, so that the ending-- evocative though it is-- leaves one feeling slightly cheated.  Still, this is a lot more intelligent than what passes for fantasy/SF/horror these days.
