This was a very interesting story right from the word go. I had to leave part way through and found myself already thinking about where it was going and couldn't wait to get back to it. I haven't had this much anticipation about a movie in a while.
  I suppose it must be hard to make a crime show without violence, coarse language or gore but by and large this one did rest on it's storytelling merrits without overdoing it in these areas. But you wouldn't show this to a younger audience. But for this reason alone I had to give it a 4 star. I think a good crime yarn can have these negative aspects absent. Still like I say it was pretty tame in this department and stood very well on the story alone, and when there was this aspect it fit and wasn't gratuitous.. Frankly this aspect was virtualy a non factor, exept in the intrinsic nature of crime itself.
  That said I found this a gripping yarn that was intreaguing and interesting the entire show. I can't wait to watch it again, but don't want to watch it too soon as the way it unfolded was just easy enough to follow, but quick enough to keep you one your toes trying to keep up...and wonder if your were following it as good as you needed to. I can't wait to watch it again knowing what is revealed at the end.
  I suspect upon closer examimnation it's feasability might fall apart. Could the villain really be who he was, or does the story break apart upon closer examination as all too often does in this kind of intricate yarn.  But the ending and the "opening of the eyes" was pretty kool. I consider this a keeper and will watch it again sometime.
