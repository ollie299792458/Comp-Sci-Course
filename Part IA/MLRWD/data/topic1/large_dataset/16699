I want to start this out w/ saying that if I was allowed, I'd give this movie 3.5 stars.  I definitely liked it and will watch it again, but I believe there maybe were a few things that could have been thought through in the script.

If you've followed Alexis through her Gilmore Girls days, you somewhat feel a bit confused, as the character she plays is a tad different, but the overall background is quite similar.  She's been a head-strong person who is very goal oriented and figured out the right way to go about getting what she wanted through High School and then College.  Much like most people, there are those who always seem to drive a person crazy in life, and the character which Alexis plays is no different, having a girl who has always been 1 step ahead of her.

Now not everything is absolutely perfect in her life: her family is weird.  Her younger brother just wants some attention and time of his father who is always busy on some sort of science project, and the mother and grandmother have oddball issues themselves.  Out of all of these characters, I'd have to say that the mother and grandmother who are supposedly in-laws, look far too much alike, and overall - could be done without being in the movie and they wouldn't go much noticed nor missed.  Only real reason for them to really be there is to illustrate why the younger brother is so "off".

I don't want to ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it (and I really haven't given much of anything away) so I'll just mention that the remaining parts of the movie seem to be off the wall and scattered, but towards the end, everything comes together.

Its a cute movie and quite fun to watch.
