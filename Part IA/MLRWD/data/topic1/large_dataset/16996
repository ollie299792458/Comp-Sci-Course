I first saw this film sometime in the early 1990's at a screening presented by the Enoch Pratt Public Library in downtown Baltimore.  (One of the finest public libraries in the country; in a city that has been going down the toilet for a long time now, alas.  But that is another subject...)  My expectations were none too high, considering that the film has become hackneyed enough to be satirized endlessly.  ("Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey" is an especially wicked parody; my own favorite remains the takeoff on the procession of flagellants in "Monty Python and the Holy Grail".)  Boy, was I ever wrong!  It is absolutely riveting, and at an infinite remove from verbosity, ponderousness, or pretentiousness.  The thin-as-a-bone, exhausted Knight, portrayed by Max von Sydow, is the very image of disillusion and world-weariness, while his rotund, Falstaffian squire avoids these conditions by deliberately drinking instead of thinking.  When he slaps at a biting flea, you are certain what must happen.  But you are still hooked.

The scene of the hapless, moaning "witch" being given over to the flames shows only her writhing silhouette against the background of crackling fire--yet it is more effectively chilling than any amount of cinematic gore that Hollywood could dream up.  It is this idiotic and futile scapegoating for the plague that really horrifies.  At the end, the 'danse macabre' on the bare and windswept hillside will remain in memory for years to come.

Most curious of all, when the film ended I felt unexpectedly, well, lighter--actually better than when I had come in.  This can only be ascribed to the cathartic effect that Aristotle found to be the hallmark of good drama.  I do not know if a potential viewer of this film will feel the same as I, but there is something undeniably refreshing about being addressed as an adult, by an adult, and about matters of adult importance.
