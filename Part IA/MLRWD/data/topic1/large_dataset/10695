I'm not a big comedy fan, but I needed a laugh this week so I watched Mars Attacks--something I've been meaning to do for years. I've always remembered that the trailer made the movie appear to be utterly demented--and in this I was not disappointed. The combination of big-name dramatic stars, cheesy special effects, brilliantly bug-eyed Martians, '50's-style spooky sci-fi score, and completely over-the-top slapstick and sight gags made for an unforgettable film. The initial firefight in the Nevada desert, and the White House infiltration scene sporting a Martian dressed as a '50s glamor girl, complete with bouffant, are particular high points.

A very refreshing aspect of this movie, unlike most comedy efforts of this genre in the last couple of decades, is that it's almost completely devoid of bathroom or sexual humor. Of course there's violence--lots and lots of violence--but it's so ridiculously overdone that I have trouble imagining that anyone could take offense at it.

If you like your humor highly physical and not at all witty or subtle, but don't particularly prefer wallowing in the toilet or gutter, this is your film.
