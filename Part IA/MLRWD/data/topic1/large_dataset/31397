I really, really wanted to like this movie after seeing the trailers after which I immediately ordered it. The special effects are remarkably well done. The soundtrack was beautiul. The concept was clever. Sadly, the execution simply left me somewhere between flat and annoyed. It impressed me for about the first ten minutes before disappointment took over. The humour was startlingly childish in many instances and came across as forced and self-conscious in even more.
  Even though I'd been warned by a previous Amazon reviewer that aspects of Iron Sky might prove insulting, I thought it wouldn't be so bad that it would override the humour that political/cultural  satire is SUPPOSED to have. The idea that American conservatives are filling the niche left available by the death of the Third Reich is as insulting as it is tiresome and, well, simply not funny.
  If you must see Iron Sky, watch it on Netflix if they ever get it (They haven't yet.) or rent it somewhere, but don't make the same mistake I did by buying it. Es ist sehr schrecklich!
