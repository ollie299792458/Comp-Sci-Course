Having recently bought a PS3 mainly as a Blu-ray movie player, I was very curious of how well an older movie would look when enhanced to 1080p resolution for Blu-ray discs.  So I decided to choose one of my favorite classic films of all time.  I must say that I am totally blown away by this release of Dr. No!

The picture is vastly improved well beyond any of the DVD releases! Colors are very vibrant and there is so much more depth to the picture with the enhanced 1080p resolution!  I'm so pleased to see that those responsible for this conversion didn't just re-use the aged copies of the original, but actually used the original negatives to get the purest, cleanest picture quality possible for the old 1962 film.  The 5.1 surround sound is great too considering the age of the film's audio tracks and it sounded great on my surround system.  I do wish that some new special features were added to the list, but I'm glad that they carried over all of those from the DVD releases.

As far as all of the loading problems people have had with getting the movie to start and keep playing, IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR PLAYER and its FIRMWARE updating capabilities.  I watched it on my PS3 with the current updated firmware available and it loaded up very quickly, NO PROBLEM AT ALL!

I Highly recommend this Blu-ray release.  It is a must have for any Bond fan who wants the true definitive experience.  This is THE BEST release of the film thus far, bar none.
