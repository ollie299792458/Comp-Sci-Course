*Some spoilers*

I read the book first, so naturally I really didn't like the way they did this movie. I read a few of the other reviews and I think people were way too generous. I am writing this after finishing with the other Sparks flick "The Last Song". THAT was fantastic.
In my opinion these two movies don't compare. The Last song was amazing and I don't like Miley Cyrus, so that's saying alot.
This film was sooooooooo slow. It's like Amanda and this guy didn't have any chemistry whatsoever and it showed.
What I did like? Tim DOES die at the end (sorry Tim) and there's hope for the two of them afterall. In the book, They don't give you that hope. In the book, you're annoyed. Lol At least in this movie, he's very nice and he's very likeable.
We all know she should have waited for him to return from war and she should have understood about 9-11, but hey, that's what happened and that's how he wrote the story. I'm glad the screenplay was changed just a wee bit for the audience to feel better about the ending.
To me the movie just seemed to drag.
I reccomend seeing the film first, THEN read the book. Not the other way around.
They really could have done a whole lot better with this one. Miley Cyrus got the better script and a way better cast to work with.
