Hey kids, I don't know if Mystery Science Theatre gets better than this.  While the movie in question might not be as inexplicably horrible as others that have been lambasted by Joel and the Bots, all of it's elements (cheesy dialogue, incomprehensible plot, ridiculous cops and robbers scenes, and of course, Joe Don Baker the fat slob hero) make for some great opportunities for the MST3K gang to do what they do best.  What do they do best?  Well they make offhand comments about the movie of course!  And they're HILARIOUS!!
Mitchell is some sort of story about a drug bust, and a misfit cop who is given the assignment.  At least I think so.  There's also some junk about Mitchell and a prostitute, and Mitchell's life as an unloved police officer.  But are plots important in these movies?  NO!!!  The lack of a plot just makes this funnier.
It is well that this should serve as Joel's final hurrah with MST3K, because it's a finely crafted episode, and I'm thankful we can own it on video.  So say goodbye to Joel, and say hello to Mike with the next episode, "The Brain That Wouldn't Die."  
Oh, and watch out for falling rocks.
