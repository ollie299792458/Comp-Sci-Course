This is one helluva good little movie.A group of British  soldiers in the Scottish Highlands fight off a pack of wolfmen while hold up in an old cottage.Great suspense and terrific action abound in this low budget jewel while the soldiers try to survive until daylight.Its really good to see a film work with downhome special effects to make a good movie as opposed to those computer generated Hollywood slick looking movies.The wolves are believable as hell and the gore is really....well.... very gory.Intestines are ripped out and meat is eaten when the pack makes a kill and they make quite a few.
  This is the first werewolf movie Ive seen that made the wolves look real and act scary.Face it , the werewolves reputation suffered at the hands of David Naughton and Jason Bateman so its really hard to make a movie where werewolves really come across scary .In this movie they do.
  Just about everything is perfect in this little movie--a secluded cottage and the misty Scottish weather and the gloom of the woods and the impending nightfall all add up to a great setting for this man vs werewolf fight for survival.
  If you like horror then see this movie ,it will put those big budget slick Hollywood pieces of crap you usually watch to shame.
