I won't talk about the plot since others have done that but I'll just mention the ambience of the film and what it does for me. I love this film. It works for me on so many levels. While I love Peter Sellers and I can watch him in anything, I also enjoy the fabulous scenery, the clothes, and the party scenes, in fact there are four or five parties ranging from a masquerade ball to a dinner party to the wonderfully warm party in the Alpine lodge. In general this film envinces a feel good quality to it, that makes one want to go to the Italian Alps as soon as one finishes seeing it.  There is a light elegant feel to this film. From the romantic scene between Sir Charles and the Princess in his hotel room, which is both sexy and funny, to the great scene in the Alpine lodge where Fran Jeffries sings a catchy song in front of an open fire, the whole film crackles to a warm light-heartedness.  The cast is terrific. Claudia Cardinale and Capucine are both very good in their respective parts as well as being extremely pretty. David Niven looks a bit long in the tooth to play a lothario but he still plays the part very well and with great charm. I loved Brenda de Banzie as the social climbing Angela Dunning.  One criticism I have to make though. Though Yves St Laurent is credited with designing the beautiful clothes that are worn by the Princess, at the masquerade ball you can only see the top half of an exquisite orange gown that she wears. I wish that I could have seen a full-length view of the dress that she wears. Also a white silk pant-suit that she wears in another scene is only shown for a few seconds before she disappears out of view. If the film-makers are going to pay a lot of money to have a top Paris designer design the clothes in the movie, at least let us SEE THEM full-length, ok?  It's a very sixties film and brings back good memories for those of us who loved those days. They don't make them like this anymore but I wish they did.
