I first saw "Grand Prix" in a Cinerama Theater when it was released in 1967. Unbelievable! Today; it holds up. I would love to again see it on a Cinerama screen. Nothing compares to that kind of presentation. It is simply the finest racing movie ever made. "LeMans" w/Steve McQueen was also very good, but "Grand Prix" has a plot. John Frankenheimer's camera work is superb. He again used similar camera mounts on cars when filming "Ronin". "Grand Prix" is stunning in many ways. From the streets of Monaco to the actual banking at Monza, it is a masterpiece. It needs to be released on DVD. The Soundtrack is wonderful, as well. Some of the most beautiful music - The Grand Prix Overture, you will ever hear in any movie! It has been said that this kind of movie will never be duplicated. I believe it. When Stallone approached F1 about his idea about a racing movie, he was shunned. He went to CART, made "Driven", and it has it's moments (few). There is no comparison. Even with today's technology, I guess the cost to 'even' try to achieve what John Frankenheimer achieved would prohibit such a 'grand' production. He was basically given the space he needed, even the Ferrari factory allowed access, to make his masterpiece. And folks, this movie is a masterpiece! Forget the date of 1966. The cars are gorgeous, the acting superb, and the tracks - wow! You will even see cameos by some legendary drivers of the era. Graham Hill, Dan Gurney, Phil Hill, Jochen Rindt, and others.
