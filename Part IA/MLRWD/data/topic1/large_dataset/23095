This movie had me cringing, and not from suspense, or fear, but from the awful production. Everything is so bad. The screenplay is terrible. The Editing is terrible. The dialogue is atrocious, and the director must be the worst one out there. This isn't even bad in an entertaining sense, it's just dreadfully dull and disjointed. You're going to the past to the present to the past. None of the sorority girls has any personality. The prank calls are lame. There's more killing and violence, but it's extremely distasteful. If I met the director of this on the street I would laugh in his face. There isn't even a plot. If I could give this minus 5 stars I would. I used to think that 29 Palms was the worst movie ever made. How can you have the blueprint of the best movie of it's kind ever made and still manage to **** it up so bad. They just needed to copy scene for scene and they would have had a decent remake, but now, the director wanted to get creative. If you can call what this is creative??? There's no atmosphere, but what's worse is none of the characters are appealing or even charming -- nothing to make you care about anyone or anything. There's plenty of scenes that are in extremely poor taste, however. It's like taking a turd sandwich and smothering it in diarrhea. For me, the experience is particularly bad since I've just come off the high of discovering the original (I'm in love with the original) and wanted to see how this compared. It's worse than I could ever have imagined. Part of the reason I'm writing this review is to spare myself from having to watch any more of the rest of the film than necessary. Stay away. Get the original and if you ever find a copy of it's evil twin (a.k.a. this film), sacrifice it to the devil, though to be honest, it's not even worthy of Hell.
