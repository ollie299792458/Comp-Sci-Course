It is 1917. Manech is a nineteen-year-old newly-drafted soldier in the French Army. Life is hard in the trenches, and the memory of his fianc&eacute;e waiting for him at home is the only thing that keeps him going amidst gray skies, gray days and gray, bloody death. But what if he were given a medical discharge? If he is injured--not too severely--they will send him home to his beloved Mathilde, and his young life can resume. The decision made, he maims his own hand and claims it was an accident. It is his bad luck that so many others have had this same idea. He is not believed, and instead is sentenced to die as a traitor, cast out of the trenches into the barren no-man's-land between the lines with four other men, each with a similar injury--perhaps self-inflicted, perhaps not.

It is 1920. Mathilde is still not satisfied with the puzzling official explanations she has been given for her fianc&eacute;'s death, and nurses the not-so-silent conviction that he is out there somewhere, lost but alive. After all, she says, if he were dead, she would know. Ignoring the sensible advice of those around her, she sets out on a quest to find out what really happened on that lonely battlefield in France. The story is revealed piece by piece, each new puzzle piece completely altering the composition until we cannot be sure what is true, what is false, and what is mere interpretation . . .

The plot is elegant and masterful, the acting is both wonderfully human and beautifully precise, and the technical aspects of the film are stunning. This is one of the best films of 2004. It's too bad France refused to submit it to the Oscars; it would have given Million Dollar Baby a run for its money.
