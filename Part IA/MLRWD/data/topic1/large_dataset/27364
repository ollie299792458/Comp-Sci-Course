I can't even go any further than the 3rd ABSURD scene. Historically, EVERYTHING is wrong. We have enough information now to know the name is Thatch (not Teach), but that's forgivable considering the many years of incorrect speculation. However, there is nothing fun about watching 21st century actors ACT like pirates - badly. They didn't bother to grow their hair out & the costuming department somehow seemed to think that 19th century costumes would be acceptable for 1717. Apparently, everyone from scriptwriter to make-up to director to visual effects (come on - nothing looked real in any of the gun play!) was NOT UP TO THE TASK.

A bit of enthusiasm on the part of the actors gets it a star, but the disregard to even a smidgeon of authenticity is appalling & so unnecessary when the real lives of these people were FAR MORE FASCINATING than anything this crew put together.

When & where was this ever broadcast? I stumbled upon it in Blockbuster & had never heard of it. Wish I still hadn't.
