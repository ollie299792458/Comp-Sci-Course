As a comic book fan for many years, I had anticipated the release of this movie on DVD. I had originally seen this movie several years prior on VHS but it was a shoddy copy. This time around it was presented in a better format.

  The original story goes that the Punisher (aka Frank Castle) is a death-dealing vigilante who extracts more than enough vengeance for the murders of his family (wife, son and daughter) by the mob. Frank survives the hit, goes underground and reemerges as the Punisher.

  This movie was a decent rendition of the Punisher story but, like a lot of other movies, did not hold up to the original storyline. Here, Frank sees his family get blown up in the family car that is at the family home as opposed to a mob hit in Central Park. Also, The Punisher is widely known as wearing dark colored shirts with a white skeletal image on it. In the movie, the only times you see the skeletal image is on his knives, which he uses quite effectively.

  Overall, the movie plot was not too bad but could have been better written. Dolph Lundgren does a fair job as Frank although his dialogues seemed quite dumb. His physique was the one thing of Dolph that I believe fit well for the character of Frank Castle. The scenes were also pretty well done but seemed a bit choppy at times.

  For anyone who is a fan of the Punisher, I do recommend the movie but the new 2004 one with Thomas Jane is a better one although they do still change the storyline in that one too.
