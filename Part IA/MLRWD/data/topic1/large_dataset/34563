I was tempted to leave the theatre 1/4 into this movie, until I realized I was at home already....So then, I was tempted to turn this movie off and go to bed.  I should have.

Script was just God-Awful.  The plot was horrendous.  Action was mediocre.  This is basically what you have to sit through for 2 hours or so, and basically the plot of the movie...Chinese actors trying to be taken serious, by attempting to seriously speak English, however with a heavy Chinese accent, in China, with a white American boy trying to learn Chinese martial arts, while trying to save the Chinese Monkey King.......GREAT IDEA!

The fight scene:  OK, we all know Jackie Chan and Jet Li are past their primes.  Jet Li has enough pock marks on his face to fill a meteor with, and Jackie Chan plays his usual character, and usual acting...and that's being Jackie Chan.  The fight scene was so so....It was sort of like watching an old, fat Mike Tyson fight a Parkinson's Ali.  These guys have obviously slowed down, and no amount of wire work can save you.

a lot of special effects does not equal good movie.. quoting a bunch of Bruce Lee/Daoism quotes does not make the movie new, and fascinating.  Did they even film in the same rice farm as in the movie "Fearless"?

add the bad acting, horrible (fall asleep) plot line, and horrendous script, and you have one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.

Why did they make this movie???  I just don't understand the target audience?  American boys that want to learn Kung Fu, and speak bad english??
