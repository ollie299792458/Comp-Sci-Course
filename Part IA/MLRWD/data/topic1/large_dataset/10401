National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation has become a holiday tradition in my home. As many times as I've seen this movie I still laugh. There's good old cousin Eddie and his clan, the in-laws, the house covered with lights, (that don't light), an exploding turkey, and of course the squirrel. Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid play off each other perfectly. Then there's the long-suffering ever-faithful Beverly D'Angelo, who relates as Chevy's wife identically as Marge Simpson relates to Homer. The only advantage to owning this movie on DVD is the durability factor. As other reviewer's have mentioned, the DVD picture quality is poor. Besides a grainy picture, the DVD contains no extras, unless you consider a movie trailer to be a special feature. I certainly do not consider a movie trailer a big deal. There will most likely be a "Collector's Edition" released some day that will boast a better picture and added features; seems to be a trend with some of these DVD's. Patience is truly a virtue. Happy Holidays!
