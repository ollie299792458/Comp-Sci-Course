The nagging at home has gotten to me and I'm posting another review.  Hopefully this will hold him off for a while (You know that I love you to death Mr. Bronson)

I loved this movie from the moment it started.  Seeing me beautiful and peaceful scenery at the opening of the movie really got to me.  I know that all these horrible events were about to take place and seeing the serenity that opened the movie created at "wow" factor for me.  (As you've probably figured out by now, I'm really big on contrast in a movie.)  The characters are "real" in the sense that you an feel for them and sense the agony and passion throughout the movie.  I'll admit that I jumped twice in the movie.  To me, this is an indiction of how into the movie I am.  Yes it's a cheap scare but if I'm analyzing a movie going "this is wrong.  that's wrong" then I'm not going to jump when whatever comes out of the closet.

My only complaint with this movie is the ending.  I don't mind where it stops per say but it's more the instant jump to the credits with the happy and up beat music after something so sad just happened.  (I refuse to put blatant spoilers in my reviews!)  I'm all for contrast but (as stated above) but this just wasn't the place for it.  Let me have my ending and digest it before forcing me to move onto a new emotion.

But ending on a positive note: Two thumbs up and a definate keeper for the collection.
