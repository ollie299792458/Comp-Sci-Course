I purchased all three of Kim Kardashian's Fit In Your Jeans by Friday DVD's.  To my surprise, I really enjoyed both the Abs Body Sculpt and the Ultimate Butt Body Sculpt.  I thought both were done well with Jennifer Garaldi as the trainer.  Nothing was too hard to do but I really felt the workouts the next day.  The only one out of the three Fit In Your Jeans by Friday DVD's that I truly didn't like was the Butt Blasting Cardio Step.  Kim IS the trainer in this DVD and does NOT do a good job.  There were no real instructions, Kim and the two exercisers just jump in and do their thing and you're supposed to follow.  After trying the other two DVD's in the series, I was excited to work out with the Butt Blasting Cardio Step DVD because I enjoy doing step cardio workouts but this particular DVD I felt it was a total waste of money!  I have some other step cardio workouts (although somewhat old) they are very effective and at least walk you through the moves.  I highly recommend purchasing both the Abs Body Sculpt and the Ultimate Butt Body Sculpt but don't waste your money on the Butt Blasting Cardio Step.  Patrick Goudeau isn't even in the DVD to work out with you.
