This really isn't a review but more of a shout out. I love reading reviews but I've never written any. If you remember the show, then you've made up your mind if you enjoy this or not. If you had been waiting until an affordable, single season release like I had been, then your wait is over. Buying an entire set might be cheaper in the long run but for those of us who can not afford that investment at one time this is a great option. Get it with confidence as it is produced beautifully. I was surprised to see the first three pilot movies as I don't recall there being more than the first. I forgot that Darren McGavin was the "Oscar Goldman" type character in the first telefilm.
The bonus features are on a separate disc and my favorite was the feature on the show opening sequence.
I hadn't seen these probably since they first aired but remember the show fondly. It will be fun to see how the series evolved over the course of its run. I look forward to getting all the DVD sets as they are released. Thank you Universal Studios!
