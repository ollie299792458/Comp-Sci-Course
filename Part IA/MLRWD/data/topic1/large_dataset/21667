Horror film watchers have to enjoy the character played by Jeffrey Combs and the hilarious dialogue with Lance Henriksen. These little nostalgic moments are classic for true monster movie afficianados. Then there's "Otis" played by Christien Tinsley, sometimes I watch it just to see his mannerisms and insensitive expressions, he cracks me up. Schifrin did a wonderful job with this one. This is on par with enjoyable old time drive in movies like "Jeepers Creepers" and "Night of the Living Dead." No don't get me wrong, the movies are not equal artistically in any way shape or form, but the enjoyment level is excellent for an evening of slightly scary monster frolic with gore to boot, for all you bloody guts lovers. There were some wonderful surprise creeper moments, which is why I still watch it late at night occasionally before going to bed, just for the"ambiance!" Since I have been watching it on my DVR, I'm purchasing it for my private DVD collection so I can watch the uncut version (One thing I hate about non-premium channels is all the cuts in dialogue and scenes that aren't even 'R' rated, now I can watch the whole movie like I saw a year ago. If you love horror movies, no worries this will be worth the watch!
