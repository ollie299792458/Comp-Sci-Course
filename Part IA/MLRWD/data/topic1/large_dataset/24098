about fifteen or so minutes into this film there is a scene where a group of what are obviously wealthy,conservative conspiritors,led by a cranky Will Geer,question Burt Lancaster about his plan to take out JFK..Geer asks Lancaster if murder is really necessary,and demands to know if"we",meaning of course,his cabal of right wing plotters,didn't have some dirt on the then-president which would sully his name and bring him down without bloodshed..The lancaster charecter replies with a stright face,that,no,they had tried very hard but they just couldn't come up with anything that would do the trick...From this point on the entire premise of the film becomes suspect,if not downright unbelievable..For ,afterall,JFK,and,in fact,most of his family,had a lot of dirt on thier hands...dirt that was pretty much of an open secret,dirt that if made public then,in 1963,would surely have denied Kennedy re-election..Bedding marylin Monroe for starters..Or bedding Judith Campbell,who also happened to be Sam Giancanna's's squeeze(Sam being a chicago Mafia type)..Beding any number of starlets,showgirls,and suchlike,sometimes two at a time,seems dirt enough to bring down any president(or at least get him into the soup,as evidenced by what happened only recently to Bill Clinton)..So how come,if this plotline is so plausible,none of this was known to the plotters?Surely the sort of men being portrayed,rich,powerful,arrogant extremists(of the sort that even now are running our government)with thier hooks everywhere,who are so able to manage what,if this story is to be believed,was the conspiracy of the century,would know about all of JFK's adulterous affairs?The same sort of extremists portrayed as plotters in this film would have also known about J.Edgar Hoover's massive files containing dirt on everyone,JFK included,and the fact that JFK & Hoover were enemies,and that Hoover was keen to leak his dirt on JFK so as to quash his re-election bid...So this film,like the later,more elaborate,less believable Oliver Stone film,falls into the category of "Nice try but...."

  It seems fair to assume that the JFK murder was not the result of any lone nut assassin but,instead,a conspiracy of some sort..JFK had the mafia,Castro,and the right wing elements in this country on his bad side,any one of which alone,or any combination working together,might have wanted JFK dead..He had botched the bay of pigs invasion,thus upsetting the anti-castro cubans and the CIA as well...He was talking about withdrawing from south-east Asia,which perturbed the military industrial complex...the list of those who might have wanted to see JFK laid low is almost endless,so a conspiracy by some,or even all of the above is not out of the question..What IS out of the question is portraying from a JFK-AS-ICON-HERO standpoint,as if all of the brilliant,if nefarious minds arrayed against him could not find anything that would bring him down besides bullets..

  The film was made on the cheap,has very little action,is long-winded and talky..Sure,it has Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan in it but so what?Ryan was one step away from death ,suffering at the time from terminal cancer,and was starring in just about anything that gave him a paycheck(his last film not being this one but,instead,an Italien western film which also featured Alex Cord),and Lancaster was in-between going from a big star to a secondary player...His "Elmer Gantry","Rainmaker","Apache","judgement At Nuremburg"days being behind him,and his final real star turn,in"Atlantic City"being still a few years away,so the fact that these two headlined this film is not as big a thing as it might seem...Will Geer,the grandpa on the teevee program"The Waltons" had been blacklisted in the 1950s,said to have"communist leanings",so it was not a real stretch to see him supporting a film that suggested that the same right wing elements that had tried to sink his career had also conspired to murder JFK...

  This film does get one thinking,but it has too many holes and,as subsequent revealations have shown,does not really hold up well under scrutiny...
