I love this movie. I've owned a copy of the VHS version for about 11 years now, and last week I purchased the DVD. Yes, its full frame, but I don't know why everyone is so upset about it. If you look on the back of the case of the DVD, it tells you that the movie was filmed in full frame, not widescreen. They had to change it for the theatrical release. You are not missing anything with this DVD, this is how the director intended it! The transfer is very crisp, especially the "Pure Imagination" room, it looks luscious with bright colors. The extras are great. Its a delight with the audio commentary, for the actors, thirty years later, enjoy making fun of each other as they watch the film for the first time ever together. They also tell how about how some of the effects were done. They are so funny, especially Julie Dawn Cole (whole played snobby Veruca Salt). The documentary is intesting to watch. The intro of the DVD and the transition to each feature is spectaculare. You entre the Wonka Elevator and are transported to the Special Features and such. Great buy, great DVD, spectacular quality.
