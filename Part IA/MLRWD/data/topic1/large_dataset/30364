Visually beautiful, musically enchanting, perfectly cast, this movie drew me back again and again.  I was transported by the misty lakes, green hills, and evocative soundtrack, yet the enjoyment was purely superficial.  The movie is not MZB's "Mists," but a poor adaptation that reproduces selected events and characters without capturing the novel's spirit.  Condensing 876 pages to four hours, with half the time spent on the first 250 pages, completely undermines a thorough understanding of Paganism and its conflict with Christianity.  I was disappointed that Christianity was repeatedly shown to be the sole refuge for those seeking peace and forgiveness, while the Goddess religion was reduced to fertility rites.  The characters, though brilliantly portrayed, lack depth and seem more like the proverbial cardboard cut-outs than human beings.  In addition, the makers of this film did not concern themselves with story continuity. Many events were changed, but other events and dialog were not modified to reflect those changes, resulting in numerous inconsistencies.  Igraine is shown wearing a crescent, marking her as dedicated to the Goddess, yet she is married to "Britain's greatest Christian warrior" and he to her.  Morgause performs a certain ritual and tells her husband of it, yet later the two speak as though it never happened. Viviane is shown early in the movie to be an active, powerful force for Pagan preservation, yet later does nothing when it falls out of favor at Camelot.
 I sincerely hope that another, truer version of the book will be made by someone who loves and understands it as much as Peter Jackson loves "The Lord of the Rings."
