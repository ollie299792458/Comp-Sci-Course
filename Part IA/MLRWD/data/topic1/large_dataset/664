Ok, I know I'm in the minority on this one. But when I saw this in the theater in 1980, all I did was just shake my head wondering what the hell was everybody laughing at? Goofy, unrealistic & cartoonish characters with very few clever gags on display here.

Back in the late 70s and early 80s, the first string Not Ready For Primetime Players from SNL tried to get on a roll in the wake of the mega-success of Animal House with some successes (The Blues Brothers) and a lot of failures. This one falls into the latter in my opinion. Mostly just a bunch of random juvenile gags strung together into a far from cohesive plot involving an adolescent underachiever (O'Keefe) trying to make way for college while working at a snobby country club.

About 90% percent of the gags just simply don't work, however, the Baby Ruth candybar IS a good one. And Rodney Dangerfield does manage to carry the bulk of what laughs there are. But that's really it! Chevy Chase and Bill Murray are just pathetic, their one scene together going on about smoking golfcourse grass from what I've heard was more or less improvised with zero results. Ted Knight just basically reprises his Ted Baxter role from The Mary Tyler Moore Show as the stiff upper-crust judge running the country club.

Sorry folks, but this one just didn't do it for me. The film tries way too hard to be another Animal House and just bombs miserably. Animal House was much better written with more realistic characters and just plane fresh and you can't do better than John Belushi when it comes to sight-gags. Two stars just for the candybar!
