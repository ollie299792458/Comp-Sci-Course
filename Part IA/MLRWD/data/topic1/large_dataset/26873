Don't pay any attention to the negative reviews. This is an excellent feel good movie! Go see it. You will not be disappointed. I have seen it 3 times and enjoyed it more with subsequent viewings. My husband who hates chick flicks also loved it. The audience laughed and cheered throughout the movie and everyone left the film with a smile on their faces. How many movies do that?

I read the book and I personally think that the film is orders of magnitude better. The story is tighter, with much less of Bridget's friends and mother (thank God!). The acting is first rate: Renee IS Bridget, Hugh Grant is at his sleazy best and what to say about Colin Firth - fabulous! Firth delivers an amazing spot-on performance which really exposes Darcy's difficulties dealing with emotions and how he eventually manages to get past them to fight for the woman he loves. My only quibble is that Colin Firth could have had more screen time. He did however, have more time than in the first film. (I am biased, being a huge fan.)

If you want to be entertained and emerge from the theater with a smile on your face, just go see it. Nobody does romantic comedies better than the British!
