If you have never seen Lonesome Dove, then you have a treat that is waiting for you.  Just about everything works in this movie.  The cast is outstanding, the story / screen play will keep your interest and combined with beautiful cinematography that is just a pleasure to watch.  With 4 hours of runtime, there is pleny of time to develop the story and characters.  Even saying that, I wish it was longer.  Reminds me of a few books that I have read, that I was sad when it ended because you begin to live through the characters.

There are so many good performances within Lonesome Dove.  Naturally, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall are the heavy hitters here.  Both were stars before but believe Lonesome Dove cemented their credentials as being top actors within Westerns.  Even with these two seeming larger than life, Diane Lane is unforgettable as the vulnerable and heartbroken prostitute.

The only disappointment than I have is in the digital transfer.  The image quality is very good but falls short in the formatting.  Lonesome Dove was initially released in 1989 as a miniseries for TV, meaning that it originally shot in a 4:3 format.  This bluray version is reformatted to appear to be "Widescreen" 1.78:1, so the top and bottom is being chopped off in order to make it appear widescreen.  There are some shots that you just don't feel like you are seeing the entire picture...because you aren't.  Still, this is a minor criticism in looking at the production as a whole.

All in all, great entertainment.
