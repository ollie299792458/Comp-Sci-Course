Okay, Hollywood is running out of ideas. A tooth fairy as a villain, how moronic is that? I am 14 and I found this movie quite boring and not scary at all. First off, their are many mindless glitches and the story always falls apart. First off, common sense, who would have the brains to live in a tiwn called Darkness Falls? 2nd, if the tooth fairy kills every child that loses their last tooth, how come no one else in the town is dead? I mean, really. 3rd, why is the tooth fairy all of a sudden spazing out and killing everyone? I mean, 2 or 3 deaths are fine, but when it comes to grabbing doctors and police men and throwing them everywhere the movie doesn't really make sense anymore. The beginning was okay, but after that, it's really stupid. Even when people are in the light they get killed. And "stay in the light" kind of starts to drag on after he says it 100 times. This movie is not very well thought out and not put together well at all. The cast is as boring as a ball of yarn and the story is, well, there really is no story. If you want a good horror movie see The Excorcist, Silence of the Lambs, Halloween, Candyman, Psycho or the Shining, but don't waste your time with this junk. It's really quite sad, because I watched it alone in the dark and I didn't even shiver. Who on earth is scared by a tooth fairy that sounds like a dimented opera singer?
