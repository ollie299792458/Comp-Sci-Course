This is a well done Movie. In my opinion, it's this movie and Shortbus that are the best two, and must own Gay Flicks of the Year!

Yes "Another Gay Movie" with many real semi famous Gay celebrities is over the top, it's a comedy, it's suppose to be!

Be sure to get your money's worth with the unedited version!

Don't listen to the few bad reviews, I have to say, they're only offended because they were raised in and still believe in the same book that Jim Jones, David Koresh and all the other Cults Preach.  Yes that altered and MANipulated book that's caused so much harm and human shame and suffering and wars, called the Bible, that even the Amish can't even follow because much of it contains lies about our all loving God.  As if our all loving God would create such a place as Hell and a Satan and send people there for all eternity, Please wake-UP.

I can't wait for the sequel!

PS:  Sorry Bible thumpers, No violence in this movie, ONly LOVE and Humor Friendships and Fun!  If you want blood and violence, buy a Mel Gibson Flick instead or keep reading your Bible LOL
