When it comes to movies like this I've found either you love them or hate them. My wife loves this movie even if the the story line is less than factual- far fetched even - but it's one of those 'feel good' films that grabs hold of you and doesn't let go. Terrific performances and a rich story line create an atmosphere of lightheartedness that keeps even the most crusty soul entertained.

  The way I look at it, 'Patton' or the 'Matrix' or anything by the 'Duke' ( that's John Wayne to us 'pilgrims' in-the-know ) might appeal more to my sensibilities but if the wife states she wants to watch a romantic movie for a change, well, this one is made to order.

  The movie is very well made with rich production values, the BluRay sound and visuals are top notch and Gwyneth Paltrow is especially easy on the eyes in her period costumes. Overall 'Shakespeare In Love' is a winner. Keeping the peace and making the 'better half' a happy ( and romantic ) viewer has never been so easy.

  Just plan on making your own popcorn.
