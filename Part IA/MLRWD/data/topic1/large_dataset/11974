John Carpenter is one of the best horror directors ever, his skill a evedent throughout his films especially in the case of music. Carpenter has taken the task of building his films from several angles very well choosing to write the music himself for most of them and that is the same with this lost classic. A small costal town is terrorised by a gang of murderous pirate ghosts who cast a horrable green fog over their victems before ripping them apart. I believe Carpenter's music is the backing of the entire film and the creep style of shots is masterful. Also the location he has found for the film is just right for the story he is telling. Of specific note is the very starting of the film, an old fisherman is telling ghost stories around a camp fire to a group of children when he comes to the story of the curse of the Fog, when he has finished the camera rises and gives a view of the bay at night and Carpenter's creepy score biggins putting the hairs on the back of your neck on end and you suddenly know, this is going to be a great horror movie.
I suppose you could say that this film is somewhere between "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Pirates of the Carrabian".
Also of considerable note are the scenes where you see the figures of the pirates standing in the green fog or their ship's mast and rigging looming over a fishing boat, very creepy and not to be missed.
