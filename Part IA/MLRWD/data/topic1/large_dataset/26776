The first Hitchcock movie to receive an "R" rating.  I love Hitchcock ...like so many others.  My Top 5: 1. NORTH BY NORTHWEST 2. REAR WINDOW 3. DIAL "M" FOR MURDER 4. ROPE ...and 5. FRENZY.  I enjoy FRENZY for several reasons, these are: Hitchcock shows daily life in the '70's taking place.  The "daily life" aspect is one of my favorite features in many of Hitchcock's films.  I was born in the '70's so it's interesting to me to see how people dressed and acted then, as well as, how people went about their day in the '70's.  Through Hitchcock's films, one can look back and see everyday life occuring e.g. NORTH BY NORTHWEST, THE BIRDS.

Another reason is how dark this movie is compared to Hitchcock's other films.  The restrictions on what could be shown in movies was starting to ease, so you get see Hitchcock show scenes/actions he previously was unable to film.  In the movie, Hitchcock shows nudity, he shows rape, he shows violence ...these are elements that were previously only suggested and/or implied.  But just like the implications worked in Hitchcock's earlier films, the "in your face" style works too because Hitchcock was an amazing director.

Still another reason, is Barry Foster (Robert Rusk a.k.a. Uncle Bob) is fantastic at playing a truly creepy guy.  He's the dapper British gent with a scary twisted freaky side to him that's just makes you want to cringe.  Jon Finch is also excellent as playing one of Hitchcock's favorite roles i.e. "the mistaken identity guy".  It has become one of my favorite Hitchcock films, and one of my favorite suspenseful films.  It's one of those films I can watch over and over.  Plus, I'm happy we have a film by Hitchcock where he wasn't so resticted in what he could and couldn't show as in previous years.  I gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars because I reserve that for the true masterpieces such as NORTH BY NORTHWEST and REAR WINDOW.
