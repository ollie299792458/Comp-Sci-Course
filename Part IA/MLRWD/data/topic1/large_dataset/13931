How do I begin with this review?  For one thing, this movie is not a true sequel because it acknowledges that The Blair Witch Project was a work of fiction.  This acknowlegement kills the fun of the first movie.  If I could remake Blair Witch 2, first I would let the audience continue to believe The Blair Witch Project was a documentary.  Second, I would shot this movie on a lower budget.  I feel that making this movie a different sort of movie than the first was best since making another one like the first would be redundant.  This movie was suppose to be like a documentary that does a reinactment of a typical group of crazed Blair Witch fans.  Sorry, but this movie did not seem like a reinactment and felt like exactly what it is, a work of fiction.  It was too well produced and too much of a typical Hollywood film to be believable.  The third change I would make would be to write a more believable script that follows how a typical reinactment script goes.  Forth and final, I would also try to get the acting to the same level of acting you would see in a reinactment so it would be hard to tell the difference between this work of fiction and a reinactment of an actual event.  Another reason why Blair Witch 2 was not as good as it could have been is because the movie studio didn't give the director complete artistic freedom.  The movie studio dictated what text would be shown at the beginning of the film, and the flashbacks of the murders were added to the final cut of the film against the director's will.  That goes to show that directors can only have artistic freedom if they work independently, but unfortunately there isn't a lot that can be done with a low budget which can also limit artistic expression.
