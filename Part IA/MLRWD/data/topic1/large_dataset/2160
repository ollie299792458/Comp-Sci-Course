OK, this film is corny but it's a lot better than many critics have judged it to be.  I think the bad rap is coming from those who are rating it like an adult film.  Get a life; it's for kids.  The audience around me had quite a few children who were laughing out loud all the way through it.  It's like an animated feature that's come to life with its own all-star cast to do the voices.  But Night at the Museum is for grown up kids as well--like the ones who felt guilty about choosing one toy over another to play with because you didn't want to hurt the other toy's feelings.  (You know who you are.)  It makes fun of pretentious adults, points out that mistakes can be fixed if you work hard enough, and that imagination is not just a word.  I loved it because it reminded me that I once thought that anything was possible--and maybe still is.  Normally Ben Stiller is not my favorite actor but I have to admit, he sold me on this one.  I was also impressed with the presence and subtlety of Mizuo Peck, who plays Sakajawea. (She really needs a press agent--there is almost no information about her anywhere.)  Night at the Museum is a fantasy in every sense; it is often implausable but always fun.  In addition to Ms. Peck, all the familiar faces deliver the goods with joyful abandon, including the octogenarians, especially Micky Rooney.  Even if it bombs at the box office, it will sell a ton of DVDs for sleepovers and guilty pleasures of grown-ups who need to retrieve that sad little toy they left behind.  Even if you don't have any kids handy, suspend your disbelief and have a great night watching a great Night at the Museum.  You'll leave with a smile on your face.
