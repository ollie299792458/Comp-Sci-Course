...omost well cast...the cinematography is excellent...and "ali" delivers THE BEST FIGHT SCENES i have ever seen in any movie to date!
the major problem is that this movie is really all-gravy...very lil meat to it...they touch on most of the important twist and turns that ali encountered as an adult, but they do not go into any depth into those issues...example: the failure of his first two marriages, ali and his wives are shown loving and caring for each other, some tension arises - nothing openly major - and then BOOM: they divorce in darn near the very next scenes!); also ali's relationship with malcolm x seems deeply brotherly at first - ali is shown at one point running to warmly greet malcolm and then in the very same frame turns a cold shoulder to him and runs off...we know that this scene is s'pose to be reflective of the differences within the nation of islam, but the two central men at this point do nothing to discuss how this affects them...
okay...basically what i'm sayin is that there is NO MONUMENTAL DIALOGUE IN THIS MOVIE AT ALL!!!
...jamie foxx does an excellent job as does jon voight and nona gaye with what they have to work with, but for a movie that lasts well over two hours i expected more...
