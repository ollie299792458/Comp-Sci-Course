This is a pleasant, gentle, family friendly film (based on a true life story) that like so many other modern movies runs just a little longer than it should. It's got several false climaxes that push it over the two hour mark and would have played better at about 100 minutes in my opinion. That being said it's still a very good movie that children and adults of all ages will enjoy I think. It's an old fashioned film with no sex, violence or gross out humor, only a few minor vulgarities most likely inserted to make it a PG rather than G rated film.  Except for children's animation G rated films are considered box office poison nowadays, just too squeaky clean for teenagers you understand. There is an alternate family friendly audio track accessed from the "Setup" menu that apparently replaces those few vulgarities with TV network approved alternatives if you want to shield delicate ears from real world lingo. Either way there is nothing to be embarrassed about for mixed audience viewing. I enjoyed it a lot! DVD quality is fine.
