HEIMA is a concert documentary of Icelandic band Sigur Ros's return home to Iceland.  After receiving success abroad, the band returned to Iceland for a homecoming tour.  The footage shot during this point in the bands career was edited into this DVD, HEIMA.  For anyone uninitiated with the band, Sigur Ros is an experimental "shoegaze" band that creates beautiful and emotionally charged art-rock.

HEIMA is stunning.  It is beautiful.  The visuals presented here (mostly consisting of the Icelandic landscapes) are gorgeous, and it works so well with the band's live music.  While this may all sound stuffy and highbrow, the film is devoid of any pretension or arrogance.  The concert footage on display here covers a good sampling of the bands catalog.  The last live song serves as the highest point in this collection of jaw-dropping performances.  "Untitled #8" is played at the last stop of the bands' tour, and the song ends in an amazing crescendo of lights, imagery, and distortion.  HEIMA will remind you of how beautiful music can be.

I'd recommend this to anyone with a cursory interest in Sigur Ros; it serves well enough as an introductory to the band and what they can bring to the table when they are at their best.  Definitely buy this.  Of note: I believe this may be available for free on YouTube.  You won't get the same quality, but you will be at least able to sample this before you buy it.
