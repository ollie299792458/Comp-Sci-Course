This movie is surprisingly enough, a rather faithful adaptation of the Edgar Allen Poe story: Ligeia.  Ligeia is one of the most haunting and shadowy stories Poe ever wrote.  I rate it as the best story he ever wrote.  His description of the Lady Ligeia still haunts me still.  She is the ideal woman, and the most frightening of engenues!

This film captures all of the ambience of the story.  A little bit of the Poe story: The Black Cat is thrown in for good measure (it adds to the plot nicely); and you basically have a man desperately trying to divorce his dead wife!  Enter the Lady Rowena, and the fun begins.  The whole endeavor reeks of Gothic decay.  There are no flimsy sets and the dialogue is sparse and mysterious until the end.  I always enjoy a movie better when it is shot in actual locations and houses.  It transports you to a place of shadowy reality from which you may or may not wish to escape.

I shant give away the ending; but needless to say, it is one of the most macabre of film history.  If you find the powers and mysteries of the mortal will intriguing, you shall be genuinely entranced and horrified by this film.  Read the story first, by Poe, then be horrified by twists and turns of the movie version.  You'll be glad you did.
