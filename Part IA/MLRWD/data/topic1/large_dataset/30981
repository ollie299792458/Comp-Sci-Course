Although it was somewhat reminiscent of For Richer Or Poorer, I still liked the basic theme that these 2 people were able to resolve their differences in an adult, complete way by the end of the movie.
The characters of the Marshall and his wife in Montana were a perfect western counterpart to the Amish family in For Richer Or Poorer. I find Hugh Grant inherently funny in almost anything he does and Sarah Jessica Parker brings a blend of straightforwardness and assertiveness tempered with just the right amount of insecurity and naivite that make her the perfect grown-up especially when she's running behind her horse shouting-I'm not on the horse.
Hugh was properly ashamed of the affair he'd had that prompted their separation in the first place and convincingly penitent. Sara's confession of her own misdeed and how they were brought to a point of mutual trust again by mutually defending each other against the common enemy of the man sent to kill them for their bearing witness to a murder was priceless.
I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone of any age over 13. We all could use a refresher course in how to relate.
