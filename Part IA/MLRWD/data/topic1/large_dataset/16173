Arguably one of DePalma's best films, but definitely, and more importantly, one of Travolta's best.  In my always humble opinion, this is on par with Travolta's performances in Pulp Fiction and Saturday Night Fever (both of which earned him Oscar nominations).

Some will say I exaggerate, if only because this flick doesn't have the cult following that SNF and PF have established, but Travolta nails the gradually building paranoia and desperation of the character without taking it over the top (something he's sadly mastered in his many not-so-great performances).  He also delivers the character's affection for the Nancy Allen character perfectly.  His anguish in the final frames of the movie is almost heartbreaking.

However, even if you're not a Travolta fan (and I'm not entirely sure that's possible, even when he stinks), Blow Out is a great suspense/thriller.  Definitely one of DePalma's best of the genre and generally much better than most of the insultingly bad big-budget junk that comes out of Hollywood these days.
