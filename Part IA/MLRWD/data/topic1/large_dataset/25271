Everyone remembers Cyndi as that wild and colorful girl of the 80's, with the huge voice. Since that time, she has changed into a true class act, while not completely abandoning her wild ways. She's all about expressing herself and being true to the people she is singing to. There so are many sides to her that we get to see in her first live DVD formatted concert video. When she is not singing all her greatest hits, she entertains us with a story from time to time, between breaks(from singing). When she reaches back to the classics, it's like reliving that time all over again. It's nostalgic, but also incredible to see how her voice has changed over the years. It's phenomenal and surprisingly rough at times when she is singing Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood, and If You Go Away. She sings and plays a dulcimer for a new version of Time After Time, that is gorgeous. She does a manic Money Changes Everything--pulling out all he stops, leaving the audience in awe. We also get to see her off the stage, having dinner with her friends, on a Sunday evening. And even that is fascinating to watch, because it's Cyndi Lauper. It's a look into her more personal life, which I will admit always intrigued me. Cyndi is not your average person. She is bigger than life, and a superstar talent, and a very bright star in our universe.
