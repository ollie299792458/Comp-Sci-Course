Would a digitally re-mastered transfer look better?  Of course.  Do I wish it was anamorphic?  Of course.  Is there some grain and light scratching over composite elements?  Yes.  Maybe one or two matte boxes over X-Wings?  Yep.

But the fact is, this transfer looks better, pound for pound, than when I originally saw it in the theatre back in 1977 (even before the print had been played a million times).  Even pristine i saw more grain at the cinema, more matte boxes, and more scratching over elements.

Yes, it could be better.  But it seems a lot of people have some warped sense of reality, expecting the picture quality to reach some level of  perfection that never existed in the first place.  They want some artificially perfect creation, with 5.1 sound as the perfect symbol of modern improvements that never existed in the original.

Do you want the original film, and all its original technical flaws, or do you want some dolled up restoration that only exists because new technology created it?

I love these DVDs.  Sure, Lucas took the cheap and easy route.  Sure, he did it for a quick buck.  But I have some of my favorite movies now, looking just as good or better than I remember seeing them back in 1977, 1980, and 1983.

Why all the whining?  Because technology has created an artificial idea of what it's SUPPOSE to look like, nevermind that it never looked as good to start with.

I'm happy to have these DVDs, even at 80% of what they could have been.
