As a child of the 80's, I loved this movie. Every time it came on tv, I was mesmerized. But over time I had completely forgotten about it. Then I came across it at Blockbuster and rented it just for some nostaliga. I was instantly back in love with it and my 8 yr old daughter is now obessed with it. Over the couple of days we had it, she watched it probably 20 times. She even drew pictures of scenes from the movie. The title is the plot of the movie. These very creepy clowns land on earth in their circus tent spaceship and run amok in town. Using their cotton candy ray guns to spin unspecting townspeople up in cocoons or trapping them in giant balloons. It's up to Dave, Debbie and Mike to save the town. The only actor in the movie that I recognize is the actor who plays Dave the cop, he played Hunk Golden in another great bad 80's movie "HUNK."
Another thing that I like about this movie is that it's creepy, weird and funny but it's not the typcal horror movie. There almost no blood, no nudity or sex and there's no brutal violence, it's more of a comedic Beetlejuice violence which was more suitable for older children to enjoy as well.
