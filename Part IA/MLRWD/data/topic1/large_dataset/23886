Millennium is a truly awesome Television series from the creative mind of Chris Carter.  All Seasons of this phenomenal show were intriguing and captivating however it was the second season that really catapulted this show into the halls of TV genius.

Millennium Season 2 is simply astounding.  There really is no other word for it.  The acting, cinematography, atmosphere, storyline and underlying themes were simply breathtaking.  Never before have I been so captivated by a television show. The vice-like grip this show held over me as a viewer never waned.  It wasn't until the second half of Season three that things dropped off a bit but even then the show was still compelling viewing.

The actors in this series were all believable, especially Lance Henriksen who played the role of a battered Frank Black to perfection. He literaly stole every scene he was in - simply by the way he looked and talked.  One could see straight away that he was "living" the role of Frank Black onscreen.  He was definitely born for this role and Season 2 really showcased what a great talent Lance is.

A lot has been said about the famous 9-min "tripping out" scene in the Season 2 episode "The Time is Now" - most of it I concur with.  This scene alone was incredibly powerful and daring since it conjured deep emotions and was one hell of an ingenious way to jump a TV series - if it ever did, which I think not :)

The Millennium Season 2 DVD set is highly recommended.
