I recieved this dvd for christmas and up to that point i had only ever seen it on tv. i'd never witnessed the cheezy glory of the 3 boobed lady or the sweet subtlty of over exaggerated gore and blood.  The movie was almost a B movie on TV and now that i've seen the cinematic masterpiece in digital, it is definately a B movie. The disc itself looks beautiful and sounds great. the over saturated red tones on the vhs now play nicely with th evideo. The extras are entertaining enough and give you something to do if you really liked the film. In fact the disc is a 4 1/2 to 5 star disc. My gripe is actually of hte movie itself.  THe dialogue grates on me after a while, somethng i never noticed on tv, b/c they bleep it. but the script write stuck hte F! word(can i say it in a review, into every sentence. Most of the time a threat or DAMN! would have been more appropraite and meancing, but they use FOOK instead (wink). i ain't against swearing, in fact i'm all for it. But this movie jsut uses it way to much and in inapropriate places. Also the blood is way overdone and looks like huge clumps of strawberry jam. But it is still a good sci fi flick. and the story is pretty interesting once you get past all the crappy dialogue. Watch it jsut for the 3 boobed chick and memorable lines such as  "im gonna drill you sucka". If you love Arnold, buy it. Otherwise rent it first
