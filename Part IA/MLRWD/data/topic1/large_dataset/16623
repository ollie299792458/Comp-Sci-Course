Minority Report is by far the most potent, intelligent, and provocative sci-fi thriller I have ever seen. Tom Cruise stars in this riveting masterpiece, giving a vivid and realistic portrayal of his character, as do all the actors in their individual roles. The storyline is extremely well-developed, and the characters as well are well-developed and well-portrayed. And the chilling depiction of the far future is realistic as well. It is a mind-blowing action-packed masterpiece.
The storyline concerns a six year-old unit of astounding technology headquartered in Washington DC which identifies the culprits of future murders. Thus, the officers of the Precrime Unit can detain killers before they commit their crimes.
When the chief of Precrime (Tom Cruise) is himself identified as a future murderer, he finds himself in a desperate race against time to find out whether or not he has been set up by a hacker. He must discover the truth behind his revealed future before he falls prey to the system he created. 
In my opinion, Minority Report exceeds most other films in the sci-fi genre. It is perfect in every way. Even the choreography is noticeably excellent. I strongly reccomend this film to anyone. You will not regret seeing it. 5 stars. Rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, some sexuality, and drug content.
