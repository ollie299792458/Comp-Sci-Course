If you're looking for a movie that's filled with light-hearted fun and harmless action, this is definitely a good pick. Bill Murray stars as Charlie's go-between and does a good job, in my opinion, of playing the humorous, cowardly-yet-corageous fatherly figure. Diaz, Liu, and Barrymore are well cast and work together on the screen convincingly, so that it wouldn't be entirely surprising if they had a real life secret ops gig on the side.
The movie incorporates a good deal of "Matrix-esque" cinematography and borrows the kung fu style of the Matrix, as well as the "secret and dangerous mission that requires lots of cool gadgets" from the "Mission Impossible" movies. Here, however, the fighting and the cool gadgets are merely for effect to sell the movie, and don't lend anything new to the genre.
But what do you expect? This is a fun movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to people who don't like cheesy lines or improbable situations, as this movie is full of them.
