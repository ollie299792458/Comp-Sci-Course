...so it must be a good flick.

As a long standing fan of Metallica, I'd really like to see this film.  Unfortunately, given today's Political Climate that's doubtful.  There is a brief scene in the band's Long Version of the Music Video where the protaganist, as a young boy, asks his Father, "What is Democracy?"  This is pre-WWI.  The Father, John Huston, I think, mumbles something like, "It's got something to do with young men killing each other, I think."  I made sure my kids watched that video, back inna day...

The cover is, for me, thought provoking in a way.  That Peace sign, the split fingers.  That sign has it's roots in the 15th century, you know, The 100 Years War.  At the Battle of Agincourt, the French cut the middle fingers off of Welsh Archers that they had captured.  After that, the Longbowmen would show that they still had their fingers by flashing, what later became, the Peace sign.

  A few years ago, my now grown son joined the Army, right out of College.  He sent me a great picture of him taking a break on a training march...serreptitiously flashing the Peace sign.

If you can't see the movie, go pick up a Metallica CD called "And Justice For All".  You never know.  It could be life altering.  Give Heavy Metal a chance.

  "...tied to machines that make me be...Cut this life off from me, Hold my breath as I wish for Death, Oh, Please, God, wake me...."
