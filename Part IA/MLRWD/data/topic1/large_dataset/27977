As a HUGE fan of Season One and Two, I have to say Season Three left me disappointed. YES there are great moments and cliffhangers, and YES some characters finally came out swinging (Michelle esp.), but as I watched, I kept asking myself, "would the CTU of Season One ever allow this to happen?" What I LOVED about the first season was how smart and tightly wound the team was. The least little misstep in protocol was vehemently scrutinized by everyone. There was a sense that this was the best of the best...a top notch agency with brilliant minds and strategists at every turn.

Now, we have Kim Bauer working at CTU? WTF? I mean, a few years ago she was a pouty teenaged brat partying with losers. And now she's working the computer system like a pro? Sitting in on most of the important meetings and even field ops?

Since when did inter-office sniping become the norm at CTU? Someone gives an order, and the answer is, "look...I'm working as fast as I can", or "you yelling at me doesn't help". This happens about fifty times throughout the season. Again...WTF? This is CTU, not the DMV for crissakes.

Chloe. I guess she was supposed to be the "humor" point, but, again...in Season One, the team would have canned her so fast.

It all just makes the CTU team mediocre and not as cool and heroic as they used to be. The finest intelligence operation in the country should NOT remind viewers of their own offices and coworkers.

The President Palmer storyline was ridiculous. By the end, I hoped he would go down, I disliked him so much. And he was, up until this seaason, one of the strongest characters of integrity on television. They messed him up with a sub-par set of stupid circumstances. Dang.

I really hope Season 4 will return to a smart, slick suspense format, and stay away from the silly soap opera antics of Season three.
