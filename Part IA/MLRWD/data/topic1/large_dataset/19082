After viewing BBC's Planet Earth, I did not think that any other title would ever match that title.  I was wrong.  This Galapagos HD DVD is at least equal to Planet Earth.  In some respect, its narrow focus makes it even better.

Lets start with the technical details.  This 30GB HD DVD was shot in 1080p and encoded in VC-1.  The 1.78 aspect ratio makes it perfect for use with the 16:9 HDTV screens.  The audio is rendered in Dolby Digital Plus 2.0 Stereo.  It does not have any supplements but none is needed.

There is nothing exceptional about the audio but it gets the job done.  The video quality however is second to none.  The video quality is on par with Planet Earth.  There is probably none better out there as of this writing.

The impact of Charles Darwin short visit to the Galapagos continues to reverberate till today.  This video allows us to visit and experience Galapagos far better and far deeper than Charles Darwin ever did during his stay.

We view the Galapagos from the sky with satellite like shots, breath taking rushes from helicopters, panoramic views from mountain tops, incredible underwater shots.  We are able to see Galapagos in ways that even a visit to Galapagos itself will not provide unless one is willing to spent as much resources and time as the producers of this feature.

Narrated by Tilda Swinton, the features provides tremendous educational and entertainment value.  The feature is visually very engaging and with little effort, imparts a great deal of scientific information in an entertaining manner for all people from all ages.  I highly recommend Galapagos.
