While other actors in his age group (and some peers of his today) chose to play the teeny-bopper type, young Leonardo DiCaprio took a major chance to play a perfect breakthrough role. Most people have never heard of this movie (mostly do to the sterotyping of the late nineties) and I believe that most people should see this movie. Leonardo found his niche back in April of 1993 and has never given it up. Leonardo does intelligent drama. Hey, look at Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can. Gangs of New York has even proven itself to go over the heads of ignorant (and rather uneducated) American critics (who should have read more about the movie before seeing it).Maybe that's why Leonardo gets all of his major awards overseas, but not in his own country!!!  Caton-Jones, who directed DiCaprio in This Boy's Life called him "the thinking women's crumpet." And he was right. If the Academy wanted to give an award to a younger actor, they should have nominated and awarded it to Leonardo DiCaprio. Ten years from now, Leonardo will still be doing intelligent drama.
