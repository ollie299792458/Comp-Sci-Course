I stumbled upon this DVD at my local video store, mixed in with all the dramas. Little did I know what I was renting. This DVD  spends more time preaching than it does telling a story. As far as I'm concerned, this should've been CLEARLY LABELED as a religious film so unsuspecting agnostics like myself don't waste their hard-earned money on it. 
I guess the Mormons have found yet another way to invade my privacy and preach to me. Clever; I'll give them that!
But if they're trying to convert me, this wasn't the way to go about it. It just proved once again how judgemental devout Mormons truly are, and how naive to the real world they tend to be. 
As for the movie itself, it was very disappointing; I had a buck-99 coupon on the rental and still feel ripped off. While the plotline is acceptable, the acting is very stilted and none of the characters really come across as believable. To me, the killer was pretty much telegraphed as one of three characters and the ending wasn't much of a surprise because he was one of my three suspects. 
I suppose if you're one of the mindless sheep who believe anyone that shares your religious beliefs should be praised no matter how shoddy a job they do, then fine...rate this crapola five stars.
As a movie buff who doesn't give a hoot about religious messages in films, just how good the movie is, this one deserves one star only...and I'm being gracious there.
