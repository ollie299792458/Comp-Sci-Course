Arsenic and Old Lace has been a family Halloween tradition for years. In  some ways it might be called the original horror spoof: Two sweet old  ladies poison lonely old men as a "charity" and bury them in the  cellar, and no sooner does their stable nephew find out about this (while  preparing to leave for his honeymoon) than his long-lost homicidal brother  returns with a face like Frankenstein's monster.
Cary Grant knew his way  around a comedy, so it's easy to believe when his character Mortimer grows  more and more frazzled throughout the night, jumping from one problem to  the next so quickly that he can't even remember he's just been married that  day. In his place, juggling four insane relatives (three of them killers),  a handful of cops, and two dead bodies, we'd all feel the worse for wear.  The pace is quick, almost frantic at times; complications and plot twists  come faster than anyone in the movie can handle them. The only characters  who aren't perturbed and thrown completely out of their elements by the  affair are the rest of the Brewster family, who are all crazy anyway.
The  dark comedy genre is full of films that are a little too graphic or  disturbing for kids (and even some adults), but this one's not quite so  dark, and wildly funny enough to entertain all ages. And no matter how  young or old you are, no matter how normal a family you have, you won't be  able to help but chuckle when the harried Mortimer takes a breather to  explain to his new wife: "Insanity runs in my family.... It  practically gallops."
The DVD transfer is flawless; the clarity is  wonderful. Pop some popcorn and watch it with the whole family.
