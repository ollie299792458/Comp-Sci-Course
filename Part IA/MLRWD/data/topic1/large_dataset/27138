With out a doubt Zeppelin in their prime was the best band that ever rocked the stage. Zeppelin themselves said that "The Song Reamains the Same" was the worlds most expensive home video and they themselves were not too happy with it. All this new version is really is the same thing that they are selling all over again but with todays advancement features a bit more so than anything new.
Would have been always really cool if they would have made this with just the jams on stage through out the soloing as opposed to their fantasy impressions. Many of us Musicians always wanted to see Bonzo do the whole drum solo rather than Level a pool table or drive a dragster. Or see Jimmy Page do all of the guitar work instead of climbing that rocky hill with his climbing shoes on.
But at least there is more of that within "How the west was won".
For me the real difference within the new version of "The Song remains the same" is really nothing but a few features.
But it is still really cool in that sense and it is nice to go back to the 70's to the midnight movies and rock!
