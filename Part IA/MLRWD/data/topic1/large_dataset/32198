After reading some of the reviews here, I put off watching the film for a week or so. I tend to ignore most critiques if there's general waffling and I'm pleased I did in this case, as well.
  I won't do a synopsis of the plot since there's plenty of that already but will say the film is based on the novel of the same name written by Julia Leigh.
  The film makers did an incredible job capturing the look and feel of a fairly hardcore trek through Tasmanian jungle and scrubland.
  Deft acting by all players keeps the film moving well as Defoes character goes through a quiet rebirth as his humanity and choices are challenged by happenstance when he's reluctantly pulled into the position of fourth tier in an "instant family".
  This is not 'The Expendables", it's not 'Rambo' and it's not "Jaws in the Woods'. It's a well crafted film with a tempo for those who can go for 120 minutes without the planet getting shredded by robots.
  It's quiet for long moments and dialogue is often absent as it should be when you're tracking anything elusive.
  The wrap up is like reading a Gerald Seymour novel - rarely a happy ending. This one, while down beat, does leave a glimmer of hope.
  Somebody send ScientistinDC some cartoons and a grammar book.
