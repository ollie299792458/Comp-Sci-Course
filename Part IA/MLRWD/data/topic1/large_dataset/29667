I watched this movie with my husband, toddler and baby and we all loved it. It has plenty of "maternal nudity",
which consists of breasts (when the babies feed) and pregnant bellies. No vaginal or birth scenes here. I got a
lot more out of it than most other people did because I am interested in natural birth, cloth diapering and
organic living in general. I just wish they showed more about how the primitive mothers took care of their babies
when they were sick or injured, baby food preparation, more about how they diaper or potty train- things like that.
It made me realize how absorbed we "civilized" folks are in all of our gadgets from the moment we are born.
The two developed nation babies quickly had learning toys surrounding them, while the primitive babies played
outdoors with what nature provided. The primitive moms did not worry about their babies crawling naked outdoors
in the dirt, crawling in and drinking from a moving stream, crawling under livestock or on rusty barrels. When I
let my son crawl outdoors he tries to eat every stone he sees, so I don't know how they keep them from choking
on stuff! Meanwhile we developed nation mommas are concerned about each milestone, counting how many words the
child is learning and whether they will be ready for grade school, so why do we complicate things? We tend to go
for the man-made answer to everything. As a mom I felt this movie taught me not to worry so much about the small
things (like back when my son ate a bug & I nearly passed out) and I was reminded that babies are all the same no
matter where they are born, they just adapt differently to the environment they were brought into & this movie lets
us watch that happen.
