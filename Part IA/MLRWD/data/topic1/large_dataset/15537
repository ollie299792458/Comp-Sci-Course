It is not difficult to see why "Don't Tempt Me" would disappoint at first glance. The cinematography is composed of a confusing jumble of disjointed symbolism and confusing, almost psychotic characters. However, if one gives "Don't Tempt Me" another look, there is actually much content of value that surpasses the realm of fantasy and is actually applicable to current world events.

 Specifically, "Don't Tempt Me" presents one filmmaker's take on the effects and current state of globalization. If one is skeptical of corporate America, I highly recommend that he or she watch this film. Essentially, the film contrasts heaven and hell with regards to the concept of modern, Americanized democracy. Specifically, it is the "good" establishment (Heaven) that "Don't Tempt Me," mocks, somehow implying that the goodness that corporate American bestows upon the world is a farce; the IMF - a corporate establishment - is the key target of this mockery.

 On another interesting note, the film itself was released in several different countries with several different names. Likewise, the film's production credits cite the talent of several different countries, highlighting the other side of mass globalization; the real good that comes when people come together to work with little in the way of greedy self-interest.
