I absolutely loved this movie when I saw it first in the cinema. Probably one of the most underrated movies so far this year. It failed at the box office probably due to the shaky camera during action sequences and a cliche script. But you've got to give credits to the ambitious plot that was based on the real reason why the US went to war in Iraq. The reason was always for the search for Weapons Of Mass Destruction (WMD). In real life, it was a failure as no WMD's were found. This movie went all out in Hollywood fashion as we uncover the truth as to why the war started in the first place and the waste of resource used by the government for the search of the hidden WMD's in Iraq. Many lives from both sides were lost during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, all for something that doesn't exists in the country, the WMD's.. As Matt Damon's character mentioned in the movie, "The reason we go to war always matters!".

This movie is a good movie depending on how you see it, but its not a bad movie as some critics have made it out to be. Looking forward to the dvd release!
