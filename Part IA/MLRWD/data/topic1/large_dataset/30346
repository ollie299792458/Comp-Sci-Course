Add me to the list of fawning reviews.  If you do not cry at the end of this movie, you are not human.  The acting, direction, dialogue, and above all, sheer humanity of this picture make it one of the cinematic greats.  Thank you Turner Classic Movies!  As a side note, I should disclose that I am a practicing trial attorney.  The depiction of my profession is vicious, bordering on hateful.  This movie loses a half star for this, but since Amazon only provides full star increments, I'm erring on the side of a one star de-merit.  Don't get the wrong idea, I have the ability to laugh at myself and bought into the lawyer bashing as I watched the movie.  Only in retrospect do I express this half-star-de-meriting outrage.  The lawyers depicted here violated nearly every rule of professional ethics and would be disbarred in any jurisdiction.  Shame on you, Frank, for this cheap effort to move the plot!  Ironically, it's really at its base a form of stupid intolerance that this very movie seeks to critique.
