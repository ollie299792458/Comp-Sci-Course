This film was released to Imax theaters in 3D. It was probably very entertaining and exhilarating in 3D. But, I'm sorry to say, it's very ordinary in 2D. There is nothing more annoying than watching a 3D movie in 2D. All the carefully staged 3D shots, pardon the pun, stick out like a sore thumb.

And the narration, while performed by the two outstanding actors Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, is completely one dimensional. Or should I say 1D? Not only is it dull, it's annoying. It sounds like they both read the narration for the entire film and the director, Howard Hall, had buttons for both of their recordings and randomly switched them on and off with no rhyme or reason. There were times, and I'm not exaggerating, when Depp would start a sentence and Winslet would finish it!

And as for the title, "Deep Sea"? Not once did the film journey deeper than the coral reefs.

There are a lot of excellent documentaries about the ocean to add to your library. This is not one of them.
