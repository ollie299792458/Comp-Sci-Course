I wish I had watched this movie sooner.  I heard words and terms used that I had not heard before and I looked them up which expanded my vocabulary a bit.  I love how the main characters had love, affection and care for each other.  I loved that they strived to make a bad situation work.  Nolah was such a brave boy and he was ever looking forward to what needed to be done next while dealing with the problems at hand.  Nolah was the kind of son I would want if I had one because he was brave, engaged, hopeful, etc. in the movie.  Being single and having assets that you are responsible for is like Nicole had a homestead that she had to take care of and needed a good man's help.  All the pieces came together and she pulled off what her significant other had wanted to have done - drive the big bloody cattle into the big bloody metal ship.  Racial issues played a factor and class separation had an influence.  Lies were told, deceit was hidden yet revealed before it was all said and done.  Many of todays issues existed back then.
