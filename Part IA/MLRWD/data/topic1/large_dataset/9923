Kurt Russles performance is dead-on.  The strict enforcement of dicipline, obeyance of orders, complete committment to mission, lack of emotion.  It's impossible for the average person to relate in any sense to Russles character.  It's probably the main reason the movie didn't get much press. And didn't do well at the box office.  My favorite scheme is where Russle is alone using the Steel canister as a punching bag. Putting huge dents in it. You can feel the rage.  Ever wonder what his character must have been thinking?  My favorite line - When Connie Neilson is panacking over the attacking bad guys.  She asks Sergeant Todd - "What are you going to do?" Todd replies in a matter of fact dead pan way "I'm going to kill them all, sir!".  To hear Russle deliver that line....sheer poetry.

The story line is good up until the battle scenes later in the move. Then the story falls apart. Lots of explosions and violence.  The elite younger soldiers suddenly forget how to be soldiers and fall easy prey to the older Sgt Todd(Russles Character).  The directing and editing seem a little sloppy. There is one scene when Russle appears to be rising up out of the water firing his machine gun. WHAT! rewind and look again. The flames and smoke in the background are all moving downward into the water.  The 1st 2/3 rds of the movie make up for it.
