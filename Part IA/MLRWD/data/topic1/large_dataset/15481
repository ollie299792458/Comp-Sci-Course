This new PBS production is an all time television low. The actress playing Marina Gregg is fine when she is playing a dried up dutchess, but as a once beautiful Hollywood movie star, she is simply awful. She is the least convincing  American I have seen from a British production company in a very long time. The pitiful script throws Americanisms around like comfetti. Generally they are used incorrectly. Marina says "pull up a chair" to the detectives , instead of the appropriate Americanism, "have a seat."
Is there a reason that they could not hire an American actress? Jamie Lee Curtis would have been perfect and, I'll bet, available. She would have had the natural accent and she would have understood Americanisms.
My suggestion is to watch the one that was produced in the 1980's. It starred Elizabeth Taylor as Marina Gregg and was vastly superior.
Better luck next time to the production team. I hope that this was just a fluke. I hope the rest of the new Christie mysteries are up to the old standard.
