You'll have to pardon my sappiness but, as a huge fan of movies, particularly action and suspense, I was thrilled when a friend told me about Frequency. He had seen it in the theatre and knew immediately I would love it. He was right! This has now become one of my five all-time favorite movies. While there are some technical aspects that might make viewers confused, I find that if you are looking to make too much of the technical side of this movie, you won't enjoy it for its true meaning. 
As an adult woman whose father passed away when I was 11 years old, I can more than understand John's heartbreaking ache for the father he lost too young, even after thirty years. The characters blend well together and are believable but the most precious moment, for me, is the ending at the old ballpark. For those who have seen it youo might agree that coupled with the song by Garth Brooks, this scene brings tears to my eyes and an ache to my heart everytime. If I could have only one wish...that would be easy - to get the second chance that John does in this wonderful, heartwarming movie. Enjoy!
