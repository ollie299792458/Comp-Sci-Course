I found it impossible to ignore the ongoing script problems which veered waaaaay off center from the Man Of Steel mythos we have from the comics and the previous movies. I cannot fault the writers for ignoring Superman 3, 4 and 5. . . .

There is simply too much disbelief to suspend here.

In this film, Lois Lane is practically invulnerable, surviving being flung about in a falling plane without a scratch and being whammed over the head by a heavy metal door later in the film to minimal effect. She also must be infected with a Merlin virus, which is the only thing that can explain her being significantly younger than any of the character's previous appearances.  We can always justify an unaged Clark/Superman by saying Kryptonians age differently than humans - I am giving the writers a break here.  Lois also must have been having an affair around the time she and "Clark" slept together in Superman II - having had her memory of such erased by a Super Kiss at the end of that film yet ending up pregnant. There's no other time line to explain the child we meet in this film. Let's not even go into her level of unawareness about her son. . .

Kevin Spacey rises above the mediocrity of the script, as does Brandon Routh.  He does a fine job recreating the characterization originated by Christopher Reeve, though it is a bit of a shame he did not get a chance to bring anything significantly new to the role.  Not his fault as it's obvious his hands were tied by the director, writers, or both.

If not for the effects work in this film, I would have given it one star - or perhaps none.

Knowing the pantheon of DC and Marvel characters from my comic collecting days through the media success of so many Superheroes, I wish I could say this is going to be added to my extensive film collection, but I can't.  I think I will go find my copy of Larry Niven's short story "Man Of Steel, Woman Of Kleenex."  A Much more satisfying "what if" about a Superman love life.
