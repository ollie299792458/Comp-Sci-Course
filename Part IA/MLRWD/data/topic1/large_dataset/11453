4 stars for the movie itself, 2 stars for the poor quality DVD transfer. Read on for details.

I really like this movie and think it is very creative and funny. For the most part it is family friendly and appeals to all ages, but there are a few swear words and sexual references, so be aware of that if you have little ones. I rate the movie itself 4 out of 5 stars, hence the 4 star rating on this review.

The DVD transfer, however, is poor. I rate it 2 out of 5 stars. The overall quality just isn't as good as it should be in this day and age. It's shaky, grainy, and over compressed. It is also non-anamorphic letter boxed, so it doesn't provide the full resolution that the DVD format is capable of. There is no excuse for that on a DVD released on 2009! The previous release was also non-anamorphic letter boxed, but if I recall correctly, it at least played in the correct aspect ratio on my widescreen TV (black bars all around, and I could use the zoom feature of my TV to fill the screen). This one plays stretched horizontally to fill the screen on my widescreen TV, and I could not correct the aspect ratio by changing the aspect setting on the TV. I haven't had this problem with other letter boxed DVDs. The cover art on the DVD is semi-transparent monochrome silver on silver, and you have to hold it at the proper angle to be able to see it at all. Overall I am very disappointed with the quality of this DVD. They obviously didn't put much effort into it, and it doesn't do justice to this great movie.
