This is simply the PERFECT movie/series for anyone who is interested in polar exploration.  It's beautifully filmed, interesting throughout, and really makes you feel you are there.  True, Scott is, on the whole, shown in a less than favorable light, but given many of the decisions he made, it would be hard for that not to be the case.  To the film's credit it goes to great lengths to give the context/history behind the mindset that led to those poor decisions.  Likewise with Amundsen, you see his greatness mixed with his flaws.  I wouldn't change a thing about the movie itself.  As to the quality of the film transfer and the sound, it seemed perfectly fine to me - though I'm hardly an expert on such things.  As for the packaging, I admit I was a little disappointed there was absolutely no booklet of any kind, nor are there any "extras" on the discs themselves.  You strictly get the 7 episodes on 3 discs in a double-wide hard case.  But given that exploration is rarely the subject of any movie, let alone one of this length, I consider this set a real find, worth every penny, and I will treasure it.  One side note: The DVD case says "Featuring Hugh Grant & Max VonSydow", but a very young Hugh Grant has just a tiny little part in this 1985 film, so don't buy this hoping to see him or you'll be disappointed!
