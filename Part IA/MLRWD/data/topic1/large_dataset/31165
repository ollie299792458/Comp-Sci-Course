This movie is incredible, both Reese and Joaquin mold into their roles more and more as the movie goes on and by the second half you have to remind yourself that it really isn't Johnny and June.  From beginning to end you are treated to the heart of the characters and the musical performances outreached my wildest dreams.  The history of the era is demonstrated through the camaraderie of other up and rising musical greats of the time.  Their road trips together are classic and the portrayal of these personalities will make you laugh as you are treated to what seems like an endless streams of live concerts all across the United States. However, the most captivating and believable theme is the friendship and romance of June and Johnny.  As a friend she stood by him through the most down and out period of his life, his best friend and this movie excellently portrays her dedication to him as a person and how that understandably translates into his absolute adoration of her.  Extremely well done, I am looking forward to seeing it again.
