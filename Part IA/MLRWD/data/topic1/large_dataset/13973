I saw an episode on cartoon network and was so hooked that I had the box set at my house within a week. I really wanted to enjoy this show. I was hoping for an anime of Cowboy Bebop proportions.

I was attracted to the show by it's good elements: Great film noir feel, great music (while Roger was investigating), interesting characters, and a great concept: a city that has no clue what happened 40 years ago.

However, I could only watch 75% of the episodes until I finally decided to call it quits. Here's why:
-While the music is great while Roger is investigating, once the big fight scene happens, they consistently play the same weird music that sounds like it came from a marching band.
-There's no diversity between episodes; every episode follows the same format: Investigate something peculiar, find out a bad robot is involved, fight the bad robot. That's it.
-The writing isn't anything great. I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the lines that were said.

I really wanted to like this anime, but I knew something was wrong when I was falling asleep during the episodes.

To sum it up, the show is a great idea and has some great style and cinematography, but it just fails in it's execution.
