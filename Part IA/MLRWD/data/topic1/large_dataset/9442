Well acted, great local scenes of The Bronx, plausible.  Good story.  De Niro is fantastic in a different sort of role as a hard working, earnest, honest bus driver just trying to show his son a decent way to live. Parmentieri is fantastic as the local crime boss-very believable.

Deals with good/bad themes, easy money vs.integrity & hard work, racism & racial clashes in the paradigm of The Bronx.

Great musical score.

Nite: Lillo Brancato should've stuck to acting. Currently in prison acciording to a web search.

"In December 2005, he was arrested and hospitalized after he and a friend, Steven Armento, were shot by an off-duty police officer Daniel Enchautegui while the officer was investigating a burglary in New York City. The officer was killed, and Armento got sentenced to life-time prison for murder, while Brancato was only sentenced to ten years for attempted burglary.

In December, 2008, he was cleared of second degree murder in the shooting of police officer Daniel Enchautegui, but was convicted of attempted burglary.

Sentenced to 10 years in prison on January 9, 2009, for his burglary conviction that led to the the murder of a police officer."
