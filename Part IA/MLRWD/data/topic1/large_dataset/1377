Henry & June may well be one of the best "artist" films I've ever seen. It has the fantasy of Paris, the fantasy of bohemia, lush and gorgeous photography, an evocative film score, beautiful art direction (scenery, clothes), and excellent acting. Jeez, what more can you ask for?

It's also a bit subversive, which may explain why (as I later read somewhere on the internet) it did rather poorly at the box office, barely earning back its shooting budget.

Apparently, the idea of a woman exploring her own sexuality -- and the notion of female promiscuity -- is still a threatening concept to many people. (Don't only blame men, however: a good many female critics, sadly, were repulsed by the character of Ana√Øs Nin.)

This is a classic triangle romance. Henry Miller meets Nin, and the two discover that they are kindred spirits; two writers in need of support and inspiration. Then enters June, Henry Miller's somewhat devious and manipulative wife. June is a dark muse not only for Miller, but for Nin.

All the actors are brilliant. I love Uma Thurman as June, in particular, who gives a standout performance as a street-smart "Brooklyn girl" and likely hustler. Fred Ward and Maria de Medeiros are also perfectly cast as the legendary writers. This is just a great film to own. After 'The Losers Club: Complete Restored Edition' by Richard Perez (a short novel about a bohemian romance), Henry & June is best "unconventional" purchase I made from Amazon this year. Don't miss it! It's a film you'll want to watch on a rainy Sunday with a nice glass of wine.
