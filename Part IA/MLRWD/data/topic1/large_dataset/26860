This movie is a defintive western.  No doubt about it. The look of it makes the cartoony Tombstone pale by comparison.  Not only that, but the cover art (which was the movie poster) is one of the most beautiful pieces of wild west art I have ever seen. I own the poster for that reason.
Many did not like this movie, as it came out 6 months after the more flambouyant Tombstone.  But this one is the real deal.  It is painstakingly historically accurate and has a keen attention to detail.
I loved this movie from the first time I saw it, and own the directors cut VHS (let's hope this release is that cut as well).
It is an acquired taste for sure, but do give it a chance.  Some fine acting all around for an amazing cast that includes: Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, Mark Harmon, Gene Hackman, (a young pre-Jesus) Jim Caviesel and Tia Leon -- many in early roles before bigger careers. Hackman as Earp father is as always amazing.  And Dennis Quad's Doc Holliday shines. Costner gives a wholly unlovable portrayl as Wyatt (which may have turned some off -- not liking the main character is not always good for films), but he gives us a deeply layered man with a haunting past and a lot of guilt.  
Kasdan as director gives his best here, and you can tell he loves the genre.
The real pity here is that this isn't the directors cut like the VHS I have.  I would rather have that on DVD rather than the extra scenes taken out of the context of the movie.  If only there was a way to play the movie with or without those scenes like the choice of the ABYSS DVD of the theatrical release and the fuller directors release. Oh well
