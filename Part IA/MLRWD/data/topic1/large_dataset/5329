"The Others" is surely unipue, as other reviewers have said.  It is very well cast and acted.  Nicole Kidman is wonderful as always.  However, I am surprised that other reviewers, including Amazon's reviewer, liken this movie to "The Innocents" circa 1961.  "The Innocents comprised a female run household, a pre-teen boy and girl siblings, and a few servants; that is where the similarities end.  Although the children in "The Innocence" were also impressive actors, they became posessed by malevolent spirits and became secretive, mischievous, and was suspected of general wickeness.  Because I don't want to expose or spoil the plot, I will just say that "The Others" is very different.

The truely exceptional acting of the two pre-teens in "The Others" is why I've added this movie to my permanent collection.  The younger sibling, played by James Bentley, has a timid personality and can display fright and terror like no other.  His facial expressions, body language, and voice will make you go pale.  The slightly older sibling, played by Alakina Mann, is the Joan of Arc type.  She is centered, out-spoken, radiates intelligence, and takes not too kindly to being accused or punished for something she knows she didn't do.  This ghost story is unpredictable and unique, especially the ending...or does it?
