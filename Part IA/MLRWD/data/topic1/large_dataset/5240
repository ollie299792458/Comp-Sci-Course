I found this movie to be beautiful and riveting. I love the beauty and detail of the eighteenth century atmosphere, particularly because it's my favorite era in history. Maybe it wasn't completely historically correct, but I personally do not watch films to be educated and nitpicky, but to be entertained. Take it for what it is, which is a beautifully photographed and composed film offering a great feast for your senses.
I liked the confusion surrounding the essence of Salieri's character, because while he's jealous and insulted by the arrogance and talent of Mozart, he's also intrigued and strangely drawn to him with an almost obsessive reverence. The film was long, don't get me wrong, but the whole plot was successfully executed for the sake of sacrificing the audience's attention span. 
This film also brought about a new interest in Mozart and classical music for me, which is also why this film gets five stars. The compositions and planning for the film were spectacular. I don't even want to think about how much they budgeted on this piece of eye candy. Instead, just watch the film and sink into a different era of time.
PS: I hardly think getting off your butt for one minute to flip a DVD over is worth giving the film one star. How lazy can you get, people?
