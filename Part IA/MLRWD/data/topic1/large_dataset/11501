I watched this film after I had heard good reviews. The best that can be said about this film is that the concept was well thought out, and actually made me want to continue watching the movie just to find out what really happened to them (the damage after they woke up was just amazing).

Having said that...

Most of the time, it wasn't funny at all. In fact, I found the characters to be horribly immature even prior to the "accidental ingestion" (I'm not going to give too much here). I did not find the weird guy funny. All he apparently seemed to know how to do is walk around in weird clothing, or no clothing at all, and peeing all over the place. As for Bradley Cooper's character? An a-hole - stealing money from his students, calling his friend a "f******", wanting to leave a baby behind, and just being an overall moron.

Honestly, this movie made it big because apparently a lot of high schoolers, and overgrown boys decided to watch it. The supposed "funny" scenes mostly involved some sort of nudity, peeing, or pain reminiscent of the three stooges. I have to give this one two stars for an otherwise brilliant concept, but failing miserably where it counts.
