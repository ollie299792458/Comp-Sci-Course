Alien vs Predator is not a bad movie, the reason people hate it so much is because we all know that there was the potential for something great to happen with it, but just the mere fact that Paul Anderson managed to get the movie made at all is commendable.  It was in development hell for over ten years. Granted it isn't the best of the series, a definite money-making movie on Fox's part, but i wouldn't say it was the worst. There are some genuinely good scenes and a sequel is on the way with a bigger budget that could do more for the franchise than this

Now, here is where I get really angry. Obviously 20th Century Fox thinks the general public are very stupid because they try to sell us this below-average crap pile that has no difference from the previous edition apart from some box art and more scenes of people talking. They could at least have put in some retrospective interviews. But no, this is just another attempt to make money by the studio.

Unrated means they didn't bother to submit it for classification and therefore can pass it off as a "director's cut." Although in fact the supposed added gore and carnage that the director said Fox made him cut out in many interviews at the time of the film's release has still not surfaced and looks like it never will. The reinstated footage does make it a more complete movie but there are no action sequences added in. You get four talking parts and some short moments of the predators walking around and a thirty second bit of cutting open a dead alien's head. Nothing special. You're better off buying the release of the movie that came out a year ago.

I wish that the studio would quit clowning around and just release a definitive version of this, instead of teasing that there will be new stuff then just ripping us off again. Save your money.
