Ninja Scroll is the work of director Yoshiaki Kawajiri and was released in 1995. It is the story of Kibagami Jubei, a master-less samurai that wanders feudal Japan and hires his craft and his sword to whoever can pay-or whoever has a decent cause. He one day stumbles on the village of Shimoda, where the whole populace has apparently succumbed to a deadly plague and where a ninja clan has been recently annihilated by a demon. Stopping to rescue the only ninja left alive-a beautiful girl named Kagero-he unwittingly becomes part of a story that mixes shogunate politics, demonic warriors, a cachet of gold large enough to tilt the kingdom on its ear and the return of his most hated foe, Himuro Gemma. 
The animation is some of the best I've ever seen. The colors are lush and full. The tone changes constantly and fits the mood perfectly. From the dark corners to the lit fields, the contrast in Ninja Scroll provides it with another layer with which to tell its story. As for the action, well, I wish all animes had action like this. Anyone who's seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon can tell you that the rooftop scenes are nothing compared to the ones found here. There you had two persons jumping, here whole clans of ninja leap into the air and face off against Jubei. You have some dastardly demons with strange powers-including their leader, Gemma, who cannot die. (The solution to this problem is both very fitting and very appropriate). The sound is also finally given its due. From the thunk of shurikens to the crashing of Tessai's sword through tree and ninja to the flapping of Mushizo's wasps, you can now hear it as beautifully as was recorded. The best scene for sound, though, is the fight between Jubei and Mujuru (the blind swordsman). All of a sudden, the sound Jubei makes becomes very important. The simple rustling of leaves and movement of grass becomes enthralling-because they could all lead to Jubei's demise.
