Though I shop often on Amazon I have never actually added a review. Our family watched this movie again this past weekend and I was reminded just how much I love it. My children and I love the Ramona books. This movie actually takes story elements out of multiple books, rather than just following what happens in the Ramona and Beezus book.

This movie was well-cast with a well-written script which stayed true to the characters. I love the way this film portrays a family. Parents and children who love each other but experience real life: new baby, job loss, crazy childhood antics, ups and downs of sibling relationships, etc. And finally a wonderful film for all of my five children, ages 2-10. It was clean without violence, innuendos, characters in revealing clothing, etc. This is a movie suitable for all children yet endearing to adults. My children, husband, and I all love it.

Though we often enjoy rental movies, I very rarely purchase them. However, I ordered this one on Bluray from Amazon as this is one we will enjoy over and over again.
