I can't agree with the reviews that call this "porn" or a "sex movie".
Pornography is filmed and stylized to incite sexual arousal. Though the sex scenes are graphic, they are not at all stylized to arouse. In fact, they are painful to watch as the characters get caught up in their obsessions with each other. If that was the intent,the film makers achieve this beautifully.I think any viewer that has experienced being in  deep "lust" can empathize with the irrational desire to not want to leave that realm of the senses created by really, REALLY, good sex (the title is very appropriate). Inevitably, things fall apart but while one is in the moment, the moment feels like the edge of the world. I think this film drives that message home in very blunt, and quite horrific terms (the scene with the children and the ending are disturbing).

However, I did find myself a bit bored by the characterizations or the lack thereof. I wanted to know more about Sada and her lover. The one scene that sticks out in my mind is when the actors actually have a too brief dialogue about their childhoods. While I didn't find it erotic or the characters very interesting (perhaps I would have felt different if I had seen the other movies about Sada or knew more of the story?), I still think it was worth watching (as an inexpensive rental- not necessarily a buy). The sets,staging, and actors are beautiful. It will definitely give you something to talk about if you are brave enough to watch it with your friends (no prudes- their heads will likely explode even though the sex is not very sexy by adult entertainment standards). Perhaps reading some historical notes on Sada's case before viewing will give the experience more depth.
