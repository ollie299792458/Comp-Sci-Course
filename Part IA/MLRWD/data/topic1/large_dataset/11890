First, I absolutely hate buying a DVD and having to sit through anti-piracy propoganda.  This is a huge annoyance as I paid for the movie and I don't want to listen to your lies.  I have my own opinions and your brainwashing garbage does not belong on DVDs targeted at childgren.  No matter how great the material, having this on it actually encourages piracy.  You are insane to think that it will actually make people pirate the content less.  This is exactly the kind of thing that makes people like me angry enough to not buy your products.  I like commercials for other DVDs and I don't mind that at all (make it skippable though).  I understand the FBI warning etc. and really that's more than enough (still BS though).  I've got a large DVD collection and I prefer physical media and the ease of purchase with buying them.  I give this collection 4 stars but I think the money grubbing movie studios need to wake up and stop punishing their true audience for the actions of others.  I'm not a pirate, I purchase my movies so stop treaing me like a criminal!  Would have given 5 stars without the anti piracy junk.  Movie execs are grinches.
