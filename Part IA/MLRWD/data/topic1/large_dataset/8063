Ok, ok. So people didn't like this movie, mainly because of all the  nudity, and sex scenes. But did anyone ever bother to look beyond any of  that?
Beyond all the sex is a truly wonderful movie, with great actors,  satirical comedy, a good script and scenery, and the movie sends shivers  down your spine, if you lived in that time.
Yes, I know that the movie  didn't concentrate entirely on son of sam, but is that why people think so  badly of it? The movie concentrated on the summer that sam was loose in  NYC, and shows you what was happening during that time. Punk rock was  coming in, disco was going out. Men were cheating on their wives. Women  were becoming suicide blondes, thinking it would save them from sam.Cults  were being formed. Drugs were THE thing. Friends were turning against one  another, each suspecting each other to be son of sam. 
Please, if are  going to watch this movie, look and think beyond all the sex and swearing.  Think how scared everyone was, and think of all the changes that were  occuring. Look at how different everyone is from today, not at the fact  that the movie doesn't concentrate on sam.  Look and think about the fear,  paranoia, changes, hatred, and pain. Do this, and you will see what makes  this movie so wonderful.
