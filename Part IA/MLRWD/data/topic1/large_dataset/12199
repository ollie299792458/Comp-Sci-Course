I am looking for yoga that emphasizes core abdominal work but this video doesn't really fit the bill. Yes, it does work your core and I'm sure I'll feel it tomorrow. But it's not really yoga. It's more like pilates with some yogic breathing thrown in. There's none of the meditative qualities of yoga and no sequences. No down dogs, mountain poses or savasana at the end. You just jump right into working your core. I think it would be a good supplement to a yoga session but it definitely won't replace it for me. Also, some of the moves are fairly complicated if you are as ungraceful and uncoordinated as I am. It takes a lot of effort to get my arms to coordinate with what my legs are doing waving about in the air as I'm lying on the floor trying to lift my buttocks and shoulders off the ground. So not what I'm looking for but if you just want to focus on ab work without much yoga then this will work for you. And you can't go wrong with the price.

The DVD is divided into 3 segments--1st one is called Water Core and it is 10 minutes, the 2nd is called Spontaneous Core and is 8 minutes and the 3rd is called Fire Core and is 17 minutes. I will most likely use this as an adjunct to my yoga routine, picking one segment to do each time.
