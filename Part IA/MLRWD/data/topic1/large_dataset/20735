NOT a scooby doo mystery at all!!!  There was a faint mystery in the story line.  NO plot! The story jumped around too much for a kids movie.  Characters were very annoying and not fun to watch in the slightest!!! F & D crush on each other....kids don't want to see that! V really isn't that smart...FLAW. Shag...couldn't get more annoying and finally Scooby doo is not even the main character in this flick. The title is "Scooby-Doo" and not "The Kids with the Occasional Dog". My children are Scooby doo EVERYTHING!!!!! They love ALL the Scooby doo chartoons (old and new) and the 2 Hollywood movies too. My boys loved even the old globe trotter, Addams family Scooby doo cartoons. But this one......DO NOT BOTHER!!! My boys were bored and got up to leave a dozen times through this one. Did NOT keep their attention the least bit!!!  They were so excited to see the NEW Scooby doo movie and was a HUGE let down!!!!

The fact that I am taking my time to write a review (my first review ever) should let you know just how bad this one is!!!

If there was an option for NO stars...............Guess what??
