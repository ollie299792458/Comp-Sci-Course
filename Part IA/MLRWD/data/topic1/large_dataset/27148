The only thing missing from the "Memorial Day" is the a linkage with "Hallmark Movie Classics" as this movie is something I would expect to see on a Sunday night at home with the family around the TV.  In my opinion, a network should pick this up as our troops are returning home, and our veterans from previous wars and conflicts could benefit from its message.

This movie hints at realism because it does in fact utilize members of the Minnesota Red Bulls.  I first became aware of the movie because the Priest (Father Echert) in the Easter Sunday scene is actually a real priest, and a Chaplain with the Air Force no less.  I can envision him making sure everyone was prudent on their Latin before filming the scene and giving "the look".  With so many troops returning home, this movie captures fully the rounded life of many soldiers coming home from battle and the family ties including telling the stories especially to those who "get it".  I never quite grasped this fully in my younger years when a teacher brought his old slides from Vietnam into class one day this movie provided an insight into all that he shared with us that day.

Two thumbs up for the writing and execution of the movie!
