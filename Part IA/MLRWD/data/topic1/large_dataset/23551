Hadn't seen this movie in over twenty years, the premise is excelent but I have a hard time buying Kurt Russell as a bad guy, specially since his character seems to have just had a shampoo 20 minutes before every shot.
In today's big movies one spends so much time pleading: no more CGI ! but while watching ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK I had the opposite feeling. Sure, it's got a couple of pretty good special effects shots but once Snake lands the plane you just never really feel you're truly in NYC.
Many great things about this Special Edition but the video and audio themselves are not two of them. The night shoots look specially bad (with the movie itself set mostly at midnight). Fact of the matter is this was a very low budget film that was made to look more expensive than it actually was thanks to the ingenuity of the film makers involved(be sure to watch the making of documentary and you'll agree).
On the whole this is a pretty good film, not in the same stratosphere as its contemporary BLADE RUNNER but definetely not a bad time at the movies.
