Batman Returns. With a title like that, one would think that the movie would, I don't know, actually be about Batman. But no, unfortunately, Tim Burton seems more content to focus the movie around the villains. Its like he wanted to make "Penguin: The Movie," and was forced to stick Batman in there somewhere. Not to mention the fact that they took a supposedly civilized and cultured villain like the Penguin and turn him into an vulgar retard living in the sewer. Is the penguin character threatening? Maybe. Too bad his master plan is to,um, kidnap babies? and send penguins to launch rockets into the city? What?!? And Catwoman has nothing to do with anything except randomly blowing up stuff, scratching people, promoting feminism, and giving Michael Keaton someone to kiss.
  Halfway through the movie, I began to wonder, "Has Tim Burton ever heard of a plot?" I don't know, but there's not one in this film. Sure, the design of the film is great to look at, but that's all. And most films at least try to send a message or have an underlying theme. The only message I can get from this film is that if you fall out of a building, you'd better hope there's a bunch of cats there to revive you so you can run around putting aerosol cans in microwaves.
All in all, the Caped Crusader takes a back seat in this depressing, meaningless, plotless movie about a messed up version of the Penguin who uses his over-the-top flying umbrellas to reign terror upon, um, babies in their cradles.I may make people mad by saying this, but, as much as much as Joel Schumacher may have ruined the franchise with his neon lights and rubber nipples, I'd have to say that "Batman Forever" was way better than this. However, for those wanting to see Batman at his finest, watch "Batman Begins," the only Batman movie done right (so far).
P.S. Where the heck did the Penguin get the blue prints for the Batmobile, any way?
