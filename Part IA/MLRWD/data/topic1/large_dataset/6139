This movie should cement Sophia Coppola's reputation as one of the best directors working today.  Like her previous movie, "Lost In Translation", it has its detractors, but I really can't understand the criticisms.  Each of her movies are less about a typical and cliched "a" to "b" storyline, but are more character studies in which the subjects are allowed to exist in their own worlds without the audience being guided or manipulated into feeling either good or bad towards the subjects.

In "Marie Antoinette", Marie is shown experiencing all aspects of high society France of the 18th century.  She makes a number of choices which arise from situations she is put into and the movie is careful not to make its own commentary as to whether they are good or bad choices.  Because of this, and despite her unflattering historical reputation, I felt some sympathy for Marie Antoinette because the movie made me realize that she was just a person, like any other, and it is not for me to judge her.  Other viewers may have a different impression, and it is completely left up to them to decide on their own.

Of course, any movie that has Marie Antoinette as its subject matter must address the famous "Let Them Eat Cake" line and the way it's handled here is near perfect.  I won't spoil it for anyone, but after seeing the movie, try to remember how the director addressed this, and still kept the spirit of the issue alive.

This is another brilliant movie from Sophia Coppola and I, for one, cannot wait to see what she does next!
