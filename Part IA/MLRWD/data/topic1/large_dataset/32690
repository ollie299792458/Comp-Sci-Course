Summer of Sam is a film about the events of the last few New York summers of the seventies, and the bizzare killing spree of the .44 caliber killer. But while the portrayal of David Berkowitz is spectacular and, I immagine,  realistic, and while Spike Lee captured the intesity of these events, the  film is not really about the Son of Sam himself.
In fact, this film is  probably closer to a film like The Last Days of Disco, than a work like  Silence of the Lambs. And while Son of Sam is the catalyst for much of the  film's action, the decadent freedom of the seventies is the real main  character.
Spike Lee does an excelent job of paralleling the madness and  the frenzy of David Berkowitz with that of the disco age in NYC. The  complexity of a generation in the middle of a burnout is also well captured  with a fine attention to detail that is comparable to even that of the New  York kid, Martin Scorcesse, himself. The thing that really surprised me  about the direction was that it was done by Spike Lee. While I do think  Spike's "Joints" are masterful, they have a distinctly different  flavor to them.
Overall, this is a powerfully well made film with an  amazing young cast and some of the best "frenzy" cinematography I  have seen in a long time. And while I can find some fault with some of the  finer points of the writing, I wholeheartedly reccoment this film. After  all, how often does the Who's "We won't get fooled again" appear  in a film from 40 Acres and a Mule Productions.
Also, watch for Spike's  near perfect, somewhat self deprecating cameo and the one point in the film  where the audience is sudenly forced into the film's  world.
