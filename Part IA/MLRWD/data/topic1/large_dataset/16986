This is not your typical "mindless entertainment" movie. If you are expecting to kick back and watch passively while the kids are playing in the room, the dog is barking, and you're preparing dinner, then look elsewhere. If you are unable to give your COMPLETE attention to this film, it may well be the worst film you'll ever see. But give it your undivided, and you'll find that it haunts you for days, perhaps weeks, after the credits roll. Little details will return, plot points will reveal themselves, incidents will fit together in a new way, and you'll be sitting at work thinking of ways to get off early so you can rush home and see it again. This is NOT a rental, this is an OWN IT disc. You'll want to revisit it time after time. 
The acting is superb, the look is perfect, the premise is inspired, and the ending (which may take a few minutes to fully grasp) might just be the most jolting twist since the Statue of Liberty poked out of the sand in Planet of the Apes. 
Buy this disc. Set aside some quality time and let it grab you. Then try, TRY, to get some sleep that night. Odds are that your mind will still be wrapping itself around this thriller until the wee hours...
