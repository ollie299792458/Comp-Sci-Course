This is a movie that received incredibly harsh criticism.  Too harsh in my opinion.  Clearly this is not a movie for everyone; the movie moves at a slower pace and there are some holes in the plot, but I believe both actually contribute to the mood and message of the movie.  As a movie seen through the eyes of a dying and confused old woman, played brilliantly by Vanessa Redgrave, there is likely to be holes in her memory, thus the plot reflects that. What this movie offers is a reflection on life; a life full of regret, missed opportunities, hardship, friendship, happiness and life lessons.  The movie is beautifully shot, with a perfect soundtrack.  Though it is true that many talented actors only had a few moments onscreen, the moments they did have were simply amazing and would not have conveyed nearly the same amount of emotion and force had someone with less experience been given those roles.  An example of this would be Meryl Streep, who had very little time onscreen, but was absolutely amazing.  Bottom line; this movie is not something everyone can enjoy, but if the characteristics I have described appeal to you, I think you will find it to be an incredibly sad, beautiful, and honest film.
