Ok, I will admit that I have wanted to see MGM dare to put this one on DVD for a good while now and what a Halloween Treat it is!  The transfer is very nice on the feature itself and the trailer is crisp and clean as well. The rabbits are a hoot at times and somewhat creepy at others, an odd mixed bag for sure with a "western" feel among all the scientific jibber jabber.  Doomed to fail at the box office, but utterly funny and entertaining none-the-less.  The rabbits sneering in the General Store after they take it over is worth the price alone. Janet Leigh and Rory Calhoun kicks some serious Cannibal Cottontail in this USA-up-all-night cheese-fest!  This movie could have been called The Cottontail Cannibal Massacre; That may have shaken MGM into their better judgement and make them think twice about greenlighting this one! For its official home video debut, Warner Brothers has done a fabulous job with restoring NIGHT OF THE LEPUS, presenting 1.85:1 widescreen and anamorphic. It actually looks like they care about this little bastard child of a movie! While there are a number of grainy spots, usually during outdoor scenes, the skin tones are accurate, colors bold and vivid, and the black levels are deep. All those cute little killer bunnies look great on the digital format, with nice detail and a clean image throughout the presentation. The mono audio is a little quiet during dialogue scenes, but the screaming bunnies and bombastic musical score is delivered nicely. All-in-all a great addition to the cheesier parts of a horror fans DVD collection!!!
