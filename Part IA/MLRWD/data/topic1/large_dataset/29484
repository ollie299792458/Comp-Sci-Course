SPOILER - The main character was not at all likable(she is a female who is trying to fit into a snooty clique group of editors/authors via the bookstore she works at, she is sleeping with a married guy whenever he gets into a fight with his wife, chasing after some unlikable, snobby married writer and then ignoring the decent guy in the film who is kind and considerate to her because his job wasn't "up to par" with her wanna be standards) Once she passes on him (and is very rude) she sets him up with a friend, but then changes her mind and wants him for herself until the snobby writer kisses her and then she delays her date with the nice guy to make out with the snobby writer, thinking she is trading up) Finally figures out the snobby guy just wants to hire her as his assistant (with benefits) and goes running back to the nice guy, the same night......overall it was not an enjoyable film because the main character was not someone you could care about at all and I summed up the 2 hr plot in 5 sentences...what a waste of time!
