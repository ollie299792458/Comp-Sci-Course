Little Miss Sunshine is more than a movie about a dysfunctional family. It's a movie about paradigms that come together in a violent way...except Dayton and Faris make it all seem amusing.

Little Miss Sunshine takes postmodernism and places it into the form of film. What the movie does well is the same thing that seems to be so hard to wrap our minds around - being the disintegration of relationships and seeming redemption through failure. There seems to be a strain of sentimentality while still yet declaring that the family and roles in a family aren't altogether important.

Overall, LMS is a fun, funny, and wonderful slice of Americana. It takes ideas such as superficiality in life, self centeredness, and broken people with [sometimes] transcendent thoughts and strings the viewer along in one misadventure onto another. The movie explores failure in relationships, in occupation, and in general occurrences and various interpretations and reactions of the same failures through the eyes of the characters involved.

Definitely not my favorite movie, but definitely worth watching.
