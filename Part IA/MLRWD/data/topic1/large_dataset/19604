I just saw the sneak preview last night and loved it. I had heard I should expect a cross between Ocean's Eleven and The Score, and that was pretty close. It has a feel like The Score or Ronin, especially toward the beginning, but it turns out to be much more light-hearted, and sometimes downright silly, but in a good way. Great date movie if you want to show your girl how slick, chic and adventurous you are, especially when you leave the theater and drive really fast! The chase scenes were quite thrilling, I thought. I never buy movie soundtracks, but I'm actually looking forward to seeing this one on sale. Lots of sleek, orchestral drum-and-bass, perfect for pulling off a heist, with a couple of nice old rock tunes thrown in for good measure. As far as the stars, everyone was great. Ed Norton makes a pretty bad bad guy and is just revolting with that terrible mustache. I was impressed with Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of Charlie Croker, and of course Donald Sutherland was great and Charlize Theron was, well, what can I say? She's a gem. Seth Green's "Napster" character was a hoot. I definitely recommend this movie to, well, just about anyone. Awesome land- and cityscapes, too. Really nice cinematography. A near-perfect film.
