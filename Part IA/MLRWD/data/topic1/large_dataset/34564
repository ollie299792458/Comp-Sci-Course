This is a chilling film about a child murderer who terrifies a Berlin neighborhood.  The police seem to focus on the lowly criminals and prostitutes in the area and seem more interested in making a show of the hunt at least in the beginning.  The community members are terrified and numb at first then become activist in hunting for the killer.  Police eventually bring in skilled investigators who come close to catching the killer.  The people use a blind possible witness for better effect.  What happens to the killer, who captures him and his explanation form the essential thought provoking finale.  Capital punishment, evil deeds and uncontrollable compulsions are discussed and become part of the story.  The psychological background of the killer, the police and the community were ground breaking at the time.  The DVD comes with a story booklet, several interesting documentaries and quite a lot of information on Fritz Lang and German film-making at the time.  I found all very interesting.  Loved them.
