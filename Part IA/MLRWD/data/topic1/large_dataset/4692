In 1995 I was only nine and woke up diligently for my Saturday morning cartoons. Being something of an oddball kid from day one I took a fond interest in Steven Spielberg's work. "Tiny Toons", "Animaniacs", and "Freakazoid". His series' harken back to the original "Looney-Tunes" while being fresh, new, and hilarious no matter what your age. "Freakazoid" was probaly the greatest work of them all, a true 'diamond in the rough'.

I'll spare the commentary on the plot's basis and skip right on to the package itself. This two disc collection is completely stuffed full of greatness with commentaries, behind-the-scenes, and the original advertisement Promos (which I remember seeing as a kid). All in all they made sure to cram everything the fans of Freakazoid wanted. My only real issue with the whole set is that the second disc is a dual-sided DVD which is very prone to scratches. I've taken precautions to prevent it but I think that it was a gross oversight to keep costs down. Also be careful to check your DVD case when you get it. Shipping can sometimes dislodge the discs in this case as well as (in my case) break the teeth holding the second disc in place. Luckily there was no damage but keep that in mind.

My vote: If you liked "Tiny-Toons" or "Animaniacs" even in the slightest the complete first season of "Freakazoid" delivers everything that will have you rolling with laughter for hours. So, what're you waiting for, the Horn of Urgency? BUY IT!

All in all: a big freakin' 9 out of 10!
