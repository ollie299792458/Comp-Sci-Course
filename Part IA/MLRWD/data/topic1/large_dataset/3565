Audiences in 1975 were captivated by the suspense and courageous satire of the original "Stepford Wives", a story that then served as both a powerful metaphor for revealing the conservative "family values" for what it was (and is), while simultaneously sounding a warning about the power of technology to re-enforce these values on a modern age; at the current juncture, think gender role "adjustment disorder" and its increasing reliance on medications.  As a child, the Stepford Wives left its open-ended mark on me. But this new attempt by the otherwise notable Frank Oz is at best a mockery of the original. The themes of the original are especially ripe for a remake, easily rich in the potential for contemporary focus and new dimensions. We are instead sold mindless, formulaic nonsense. What could have been accomplished with the extravagant sums spent on the fine camera work and extravagant sets and otherwise top-notch performers in this film can only be imagined.  But we have, instead of an insightful update, a pathetic remake of an engaging original.  This version of the Stepford Wives fails to either satirize, extend the original, or even entertain. We can only hope this failure does not discourage a sincere and intelligent attempt in the future.
