"The Magnificent Seven" is one of the best Western TV shows ever and does credit to the genre. Anyone who likes Westerns would *love* this show! ... And since the genre is plagued with anachronisms, has been since its conception and will never be rid of them all, the point of it not being how the West really was won, but rather how present day Americans romanticize it and why, I completely forgive Mag7 theirs.

I give this item 4 stars only because I think the DVD could have been better. The screen format of the DVD being available only in 1.33:1 is annoying. I wish it were also available in wide screen format. The French subtitles could also be translated better... It doesn't really preserve the flavor of the English dialects the show uses, using much fancier synonyms when simpler language would have been closer to what the characters said in English. The DVD also has no "special features" except an ad for other western DVDs. But the image quality is excellent and it looks really good on my HDTV, and the packaging is also very pretty.

My only question at this point is, when will Season 2 be released?
