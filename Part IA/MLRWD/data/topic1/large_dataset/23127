Even though it doesn't do justice to the children's book it's still very entertaining and the visual effects are great. Regardless of the bad publicity C.S. Lewis got it is the telling of the story as the animals see it. Aslan is the image of Jesus Christ who must sacrifice his own life to save the prophecy and Narnia from the evil of the White Witch.
The children were delightful especially Georgie Henley who played the role of Lucy. There are many references in the film regarding to Biblical theology and the way C.S. Lewis wrote the story through the imaginary interpetation of the four Pevensie children, Lucy, Peter, Edmund, and Susan, the animals suffering under a hundred year bondage, Aslan the Messiah (Christ), and the evil White Witch (Satan).

There is a word of caution to parents before letting children views certain scenes like the White Witch's castle, the sacrifice of Aslan (scary looking creatures), and the battle coulde be a little to much for very young children. But I've seen worse in others. Other than that I enjoyed the storyline and that all things came to a good ending when Narnia is restored to it rightful glory of freedom and peace in the land. I recommend this to those who like something a little different that tells it in a theological view, fantastic mythical beasts, talking animals, and great visual effects.
