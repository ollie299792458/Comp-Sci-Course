Two stars is actually pushing it, but I suppose it borders on being fair at times. I'll keep this fairly short.. The first movie was entertaining, and while it certainly wasn't the best movie in the world, it had charm. This one.. let's see, what's the one fatal mistake that directors/writers often make when they find a winning formula? Overkill! Let's take everything that was redeeming and charming about the first movie, and push it to the limit- the dog down the toilet was just too much..

I actually just watched this movie for a second time(a favor for someone), and found it almost painful to sit through. The person I watched with was a pretty big fan of the first movie, and I just knew they were going to think this one was disappointing.

I don't know, I just thought everything was overblown and unrealistic.. I realize most movies are, but the first one didn't stretch it this far.

Let me actually end this on a postive note, and I will give two scenes from this movie some due credit: the shrine Gaylord's dad made for him- the one displaying all of his "Certificates Of Completion", "Sixth Place"- this was a funny thought. Also, just seeing the Focker family trying to play football.. See, the movie could have worked, but they based it too much on cheap gags, while the heart and soul of the movie was really Stiller's character coming to terms with his parents, and realizing that they might be alright the way they are.
