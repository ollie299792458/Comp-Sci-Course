All right, first of all I agree that the original cut of the film is superior, and yes, I do have a copy of it.  However, I've also bought the edited, "official" version.  Why?  Two reasons.  First of all, I wanted the movie on DVD.  Secondly, and this is the reason why any Batman fan should buy this movie and convince all their friends to buy it as well, it's showing support.  Not support of censorship, but support of the series, support of the characters, and support of Paul Dini, Bruce Timm, and Alan Burnett who worked their buns off to get this movie out.  It wasn't their choice to cut the movie, they were forced to do it by Warner Bros, but why should their success have to suffer?  Even edited, Return of the Joker is a powerful and exciting film.  It deserves our support, as does the series (which is on the verge of cancellation from what I understand).  Buy the DVD, but send Warner Bros. a letter explaining that you're disappointed that they didn't release the film the way its creators intended, and that it's out of support for the show that you bought the inferior cut.
