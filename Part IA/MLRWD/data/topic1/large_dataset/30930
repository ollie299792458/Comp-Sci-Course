"Rosemary's Baby"  is truly the horror masterpiece of the 20th  Century.  Its stars are : 1. The gorgeous young Mia Farrow radiating  innocence and purity. 2. The Dakota--a delightful old buildig just as  splendid as it is menacing. 3. Ruth Gordon as a charming but evil old  witch. What unfolds is part Hitchcockian suspense thriller (who are my  strange new neigbors and what are they trying to do to me?), part Fruedian  metaphor (guilt, fear of sex, strange dreams), part parable for the  advancing decay of civilization (the demonic baby is the harbinger of a new  dark age).  Polanski was a genius to get such a scary effect with  virtually no violence and no special effects. It has a great old fashined  style of acting(very suited to Farrow with her very formal acting  background and old Hollywood family--lots of conversations, dinners, etc.  This movie could have been made in the 40s if there had been the right  people.  All you need is great writers, actors, and a great director (and  the Dakota, or a similar gothic building).  But alas, such quality is  usually what's missing in the movie business.  Showy effects and high  budgets seem to crawl out from every rock in Hollywood.  Get a copy of this  jewel as soon as possible.
