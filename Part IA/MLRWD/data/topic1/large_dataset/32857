Jimi was really hot in Berkeley on this night. He played his axe like he was getting high off of it. This version of 'Voodoo Chile' is particularly excellent and powerful. 'Hear My Train Comin' is also a major reason to buy "Jimi Plays Berkeley". The film producers included clips of students marching to protest the Vietnam war (and also the need to pay to see or hear anything at all). Disregard these short included video pieces. They are not why you bought this DVD in the first place.
  The later in his career that Jimi wrote any particular song, the better that song is. By his own admission in interviews, Jimi was tired of having to play all of the hits he'd made off of his first album. He plays some of them here at the Berkeley shows, but the strong jams are the newer songs. (Check out "Machine Gun") None of us know exactly where he would have gone with his music if he were still with us- probably he would have led the rock music field for decades.
  If you love Hendrix and his music, don't hesitate to buy this.
