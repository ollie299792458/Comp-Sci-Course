First off, I have to disagree with the 'official' critic in regards to this story.  It's a wonderful piece of escapism, pure and simple and as such, it's a great film.
Although the Simon Templar we see in the film isn't the one we've come to recognise through the literature and other movies, he is still a very likeable character in his own right.
A master of disguise, thief and all round ladies man, Simon Templar takes a job to steal the formula for cold fusion from a  professor so that he can retire on the money that he'll make from the job.
All goes well until he meets the professor and finds her to be a young beautiful woman.  He falls for her and decides not to steal the formula from her but the person who hired him threatens to kill her if he doesn't complete the job as planned.
So, he takes the formula and from then on he does his best to keep one jump ahead of everyone using high tech equipment and pure good luck as well as trying to stop the cold fusion formula getting into the wrong hands.
Does he get the girl?  The ending will not disappoint.
There are three steps to becoming a saint - he may falter along the way but eventually he takes them.  Great piece of evening's entertainment after a hard at work when you just want relax.
