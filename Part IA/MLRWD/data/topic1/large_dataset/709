This movie is very 1950's-60's. The dialogue sounds strange half a century later. The characters use a lot of words that nobody really ever used but that film producers thought sounded hip at the time--like so's as in, "Larry, I came here so's I could talk to you, Larry. That's all, just so's I could talk to you."

For the leading man's Japanese love interest, they use a woman who appears to be Japanese mixed with white. Did they think a full-blooded  looking Japanese woman would be unpalatable to American audiences as a white man's love interest? She doesn't have a Japanese accent so they had her put on some sort of exaggerated accent that doesn't resemble any country's accent. She says "can't" like she is British but doesn't speak with a British accent. Silly.

The Japanese in the movie are mainly treated as though they are inscrutable, mysterious, and nefarious--always an ulterior motive with those sneaky Japs apparently is the message. And the tea girls make out with the customers.

The plot is thin and moves very slowly. I think a Charles Dicken book gets to the point faster than this damned movie.

The only cool thing in the movie was to see the beautiful period kimonos and obis that the women are wearing. The women's hairstyles from that period (mostly buns and updos) are so classy, too.
