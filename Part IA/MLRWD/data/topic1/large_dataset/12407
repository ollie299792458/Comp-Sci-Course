I have read so many "great reviews" of this film from the "top reviewers" from USA Today, Rolling Stone...etc... My question is "What type of substance was in your system when you saw the film?" It has to be THE WORST film of this year! We turned off the video after about 30 minutes. The jokes were "non-jokes" delivered with no sense of effective comedic acting. The main characters were excruciating (including the youngsters). The editing was so choppy, it was difficult to sense any natural flow to the scenes. The background music had little connection to the action and sounded like a retread of ominous tones of a "24" clone.

The positive reviews would seem to be a reflection of how reviewers have either become so taken with the so-called star power of the leads (based upon TV work)or have been "bought" by the production companies that churn out this drivel. Granted, there are not many good comedies out there. But, give me a break. I cannot believe that the reviewers actually laughed at any of this. Unfortunately, the laugh is on the consumer.
