The movie covers very typical ground, that is, a strong quiet type who defends the oppressed.  He comes into town (school) with a mysterious past, and shows great restraint and strength.  He has a weak but likable friend who he must defend (shades of the Illiad!).  Once he can let his anger go, it is justified and therefore satisfying to the audience.  The differences between this movie and its many American counterparts is the level of violence.  In Roadhouse, just to name one example, the main character gets horribly beaten, and horribly beats others as well.  The best friend in that movie dies, in this one just gets expelled.  What really struck me as different was that when the evil upper classmen tie our hero to stakes, they pour hot and cold water on him rather than the typical American movie fair of much rougher stuff.  It may sound that I didn't enjoy the film but I very much did, since well done genre art is very  satisfying.  There was absolutely no surprises in the movie but the cultural differences, the well done acting, and the direction made it well worth my time.  Bravo Sweeden!
