I am a fan of Robin Williams and have enjoyed many of his movies in the past, both comedies and dramas.  However, this time having him in the movie wasn't enough to salvage a poorly edited series of predictable fodder.  First, the movie left nothing to the imagination.  Each situation was set up as if the audience had never seen a movie before and needed everything spelled out for them step by step and the punch lines could be repeated in the sleep of anyone who'd ever heard a joke before.  This movie doesn't work even as something to have on in the background while doing chores around the house.  At a running time of 91 minutes it's too short to have any substance that would keep you distracted enough to not mind vacuuming the floors or doing the dishes.

I believe the actors did the best they could and that the failing of this movie is in the painfully simple script and bad editing that left the movie with no content.  I'm still a fan of Robin Williams, as I was after Father's Day with Billy Crystal (which has a 3.5 star rating on Amazon), but this will not be one of the movies I wish to have in my library to watch again in the future.  In fact, right now, I'm really hoping I can forget I ever saw it at all.
