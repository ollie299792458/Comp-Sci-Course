There will be people out there that will criticize this version of Romeo + Juliet.  Sadly, these people think they are purists, but are totally mistaken.  As one that's been reading Shakespeare for years, and have taken classes specifically about the great Bard, as well as being an avid playgoer, this is simply put, one of the most exquisite versions of this tragedy on film.  Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet was not made to be a sedate and quiet drama, it was written about a time and place that was quite racy by Elizabethan England's standards.  Verona was a place of blood, lust, and intrigue.  By updating the storyline so dramatically, Luhrmann tries to give the modern audience a taste of what made this play so remarkable in its time.  At first it might seem brash and too MTVish, and simple-minded viewers may be immediately turned off by it, but for those who love seeing Shakespeare come alive, they will be delighted.
In our modern times it's often hard to look back on a play like Romeo + Juliet and understand how a sword fight can turn a town upside down or how a feud between two families can get a whole community involved, but Luhrmann turns everything up a notch and makes it obvious why these events were so important to the story's progression.  Lurhmann is masterful at updating a classic story to the modern day while preserving the beauty of the original text, and revealing the raw emotion and fire in every scene.  The art direction, costuming and sets are excellent and created a fantasy world that the viewer can get swept up and lost in.  A great preformance by DiCaprio and the rest of the cast allow this movie to shine to it's fullest potential.  There are few people that watch this movie and have mixed views - you will either love it or hate it.  If you love it, you'll understand that this is the type of screenplay Shakespeare would have written had he lived in modern times.  If you hate it, you obviously just don't understand.
