People didn't like this movie for some reason. It's funny, smart, and action-packed. What's wrong with everybody? "Last Action Hero" is about a boy named Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) who receives a magic movie ticket from a crazy old guy. Madigan is a defiant kid who sneaks out of school to go to the movies. His action hero is Jack Slater (Immortal Arnold Schwarzenegger) and he has the opportunity to see the newest Slater movie before it opens. Well, as he watches the opulent cinematic experience, the ticket thrusts him into the screen and he steps into a whole new world. The movie world. How absurd you say! NO! The most original plot in years. Madigan meets his hero and helps him find the man who killed his favorite second cousin. Big mistake for that man! The chemistry between Schwarzenegger and O'Brien is wealth! This movie should have made more money in the theaters and is under-appreciated. This work of art came from the same whiz kid who made "Predator". Truly prominent work!
