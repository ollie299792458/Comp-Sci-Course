Between "Clarence/Clarise" taking an expanded role, and Jerry ("Hands") dating another person with a similar condition who falls in love with inanimate objects (such as an alarm clock), this series keeps getting weirder and weirder.  I have got to say, somehow the writers pull it off and make it funny and relevant.  I love the real-time jokes about up-to-date political happenings, and the cascading group of characters this show brings in is amazing.  My only complaint is that they bring in some fantastic characters that don't last long, but their long-standing regulars are amazing in this season.  The newest main character, Carl, is a fantastic addition to this series.  The fun story lines in this one include a trip to New Orleans (imagine Denny in New Orleans), and a fight against the Government after finding out that Denny was mistakenly put on the no-fly list.  If you have loved the series so far, you will love this one.

Enjoy!
