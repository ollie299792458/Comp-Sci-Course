I would agree with another reviewer here--I paid $1.20 to rent and I was robbed. Dont waste your time with this piece of crap.

I liked the first Piranha 3D. It was fun, gory and not to be taken seriously. This one..well, it's another example of when Hollywood no-talents (writers, directors, producers I'm talking to YOU) need a paycheck there is no level to which they will not sink to. Somebody related to somebody else who is friends with so and so has a few bucks. Let's make a SEQUEL!!!

Stupid "jokes". Dumb scenes wasting the few B list actors present. Decent production values but anyone with a computer can do that nowadays. Lots of crappy rock music and scenes of topless chicks. Late in movie crowd in pool attacked by piranha but far far less than the pandemonium that occurred in the first movie attack scenes.

Absolute, total, pitiful, boring, mindless, uninspired dreck. I suggest sending your nasal pickings to the writers courtesy of the film studio attached to this horrible, unwatchable thing.
