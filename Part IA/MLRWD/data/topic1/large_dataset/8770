I cannot be fully trusted to review this film. It has a great deal of sentimental value for me. I give it four stars but anyone watching it for the first time today just might not get it. It's a real early 80s treat. You've got the post apocolyptic stuff, the music, the hair, the language and images popping up from a point a moment in the past that is not likely to survive in our popular imagination the way "the 60s" or

"the 50s" have. Even now when we think of "the 80s," its like some trip to the mall. We tend to forget just how scared of nuclear war we were back then and just how much this influenced our movies. Rock and Rule was definitely one of those animated films that had that fear and tortured hopefulness as its source material.

I saw Rock and Rule for the first time back in 1986,late at night on HBO. It has just stuck with me ever since as a great piece of entertainment in the same vein as Wizards, Heavy Metal or Fritz the Cat. It's not hipster cool, it's more geek hipster fun. The music is so cool it almost defies explanation.  What other film has Lou Reed, Debra Harry, Iggy Pop, Cheap Trick, and Earth Wind and Fire... they all make this movie go from about a C- to a A- without trying too hard.

There is a version of Debbie Harry's Maybe for Sure that is sung at the end of the movie once Angel and Omar figure out that they are two halves of the same whatever lovey dovey stuff you want to stick in here. But the song Rules. Ultimately, if there is a message in this flick, it's not all that important, but it would be that love is more important than the spotlight and that Rock and Roll will probably live on long after humanity is dead and animals have mutated into peole like us but with funny noses.

This movie is perfect for anyone stuck in the early 80s looking for a fix as well.
