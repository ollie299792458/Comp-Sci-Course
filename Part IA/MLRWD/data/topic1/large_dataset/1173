Disney is one studio that takes its time and carefully manages its releases. Partly, this is to create demand for titles with the expectation that they'll only be available for a limited time before "going back to the vault". And part of that wait is to do things right, and that clearly is the case with the Blu-ray release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

One thing that Disney did NOT do is over-restore this classic animated film. The Blu-ray restoration is as close as you'll get to the original presentation (in fact, maybe better given projector limitations in 1937 when it was released). What you see is every detail of the beautiful hand-drawn, hand-colored animation cels, and the watercolor backgrounds. And, Disney was equally accurate in its audio restoration - the 7.1 channel track does not over-process or attempt to create surround sound where it didn't exist originally. Rather, you get a clean room-filling presentation mostly from the front 3 channels.

In a nice touch that more studios should do, Disney is also including the DVD version of the movie in the packaging. Alas, there is no Digital Copy for your computer (eg. iTunes) or portable media device (eg. iPod).

And, many of the extras are Blu-ray restored as well. (Silly Symphonies in HD!)

What could be improved?
- well, sadly, this release is missing a few extras from the 2001 DVD, most notably a 40-minute interview with Angela Lansbury
- navigation of the extras buried in the Hyperion Studio Tour requires you to navigate in and out of rooms
- BD-Live content (once again) is lacking - who wants to wait 5 minutes to see more theatrical trailers you could see online on your computer?

But none of these areas of improvement could take away from a stellar, true-to-the-original restoration of a timeless classic.
