Just the cover of this movie is enough to make you buy this film. Nothing like 3 hot ladies wearing tight revealing clothes carrying guns and swords. Most of the film takes place out in the desert while the rest is all flashbacks of how it lead up to the moment. Every girl has some secret agenda or isn't who she says she is. But the film is good. All the fighting and explosions and the girls especially makes the film worth seeing. Also gives you a reason to watch it again if you don't understand whats really going on. I don't know much about acting, but it seemed real enough and it was enjoyable. But when they are digging and then taking breaks to splash water all over themselves or just posing sexually or whatever, it is funny. It's a fun sexy film. I was hoping for more of a smokin aces type film, but with only bad ass girls, oh well. maybe next time. Though the other characters like the funny Japanese girl and her terrets boyfriend were cool. The second time i watched this film I enjoyed it even more so.. Worth checking out..
