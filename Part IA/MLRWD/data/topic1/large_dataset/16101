I really wanted to like this film.  I'm a big fan of Euro-trash, exploitation, low-budget horror, and "psychotronic" video in general, and all sources agreed that this was a "must see."  So, I was understandably excited when this arrived -- I immediately popped it in the player, and sat wide-eyed, prepped for maximum enjoyment.  Slowly (but not as slow as the plot of this film) it dawned on me: this movie is horrible.  I don't want to just trash talk -- the technical aspects were good, the cinematography was nice, etc.  But there is absolutely no action whatsoever.  Everyone wants to talk about the great story, and true, the story is interesting in theory.  But its portrayed in such a sluggish and boring style. The movie could have been about half as long and still developed the story fully.  Also, I personally didn't find this film erotic at all.  I understand there is a shorter version of this film -- that may help with the boredom, but it still isn't anywhere near as good as the hype.  Obviously, a lot of people like this movie, but to be fair, its not really a horror movie, its not particularly erotic, and both the lesbianism and vampirism are almost completely implied; all of this is ok, except that the way most describe it, you would expect all of these things to be present.  If you want an icredibly slow-paced, "moody" art film, this might be your thing; if you want an erotic horror movie, or a "lesbian vampire" movie, this probably isn't what you're looking for.
