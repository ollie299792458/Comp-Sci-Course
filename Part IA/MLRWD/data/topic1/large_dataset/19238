Big Trouble isn't the kind of movie that will be favoured in the box-office. A plot revolving (no pun intended) around inept security, whacked cops, bad-shot assassins, moronic thieves, hallucinogen-squirting toads, and water guns doesn't exactly scream Academy Awards. But since when has any Tim Allen movies raised to that calibre? Big Trouble is a feel good comedy mixed with great punch lines, a touch of the ridiculous, and a microscopic amount drama. 
The cast consists of Tim Allen as Eliot Arnold: an ex-columnist, now in publicity, and a recently divorced father of a son who deems him a loser. Ben Foster plays Matt Arnold: son of Eliot who is the catalyst of many misconstrued incidences. Rene Russo plays Anna Herk, mother of Zooey Deschanel (Jenny Herk), unhappily married to Stanley Tucci (Arthur Herk): materialistic criminal whose T.V. is as important as licking Sofia Vergara's toes (the housemaid, Nina).  Her love interest is Frito-obsessed; tree living, passive yet deceptively strong, sarcastic yet quiet Jason Lee (Puggy). He, in turn, ignorantly works for a couple of Russians in a run-down bar carrying weaponry and bombs back and forth. This happens to be the same bar in which two bullies with the IQ of a toothpick lead Puggy and Arthur into the great ensemble reminding the viewers what a small world we live in. 
A scene that reflects most viewers' feelings towards the film are when Nina wakes up from unconsciousness and, in a blurry daze, her eyes focus on the ever so peaceful looking Puggy. Beginning with a soft sigh, followed by familiarity and confusion, she utters: Jesus?
