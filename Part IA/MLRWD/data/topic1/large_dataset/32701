If you enjoy a stultifying plot, wooden acting, and symbolism so heavy handed it will knock you across the room, then by all means purchase this movie.  If not, wait for something to come along with Emma Thompson or Helena Bonham-Carter, or anyone who has some business appearing in a costume drama, which no one in this movie does.

Jeremy Northam is Amerigo, an Italian Prince who marries Maggie (Kate Beckinsale), daughter of "America's First Billionaire" (Nick Nolte).  Along comes Maggie's childhood friend and Amerigo's ex-lover Charlotte (Uma Thurman), who marries Maggie's father so that she can stay close to Amerigo and muck up everyone's happiness.

The lead actors seem to have set aside any acting talent they may have once possessed in order to deliver their lines like first-year high-school drama class students (except for Beckinsale, who doesn't seem to have ever had any talent to set aside).  Uma Thurman bugs her eyes out and tries to carry off an odd amalgam of Bette Davis in "Jezebel" and Lucy Lawless in "Xena: Warrior Princess".  Nick Nolte's delivery is so stilted and deliberate, I suspect he may have thought he was getting paid by the hour.  Not to be missed is Jeremy Northam's "Italian" accent, which is so bad one expects him to burst forth with " 'At's a spicy a-meatball! " at any second. Speaking of bad accents, Angelica Houston is along for the ride, and her inflection mutates from Southern Belle to Regency country girl,  WITHIN A SINGLE SENTENCE.  Give this one a pass, and go re-watch a Jane Austen adaptation until something better comes along.
