I'm not sure what's wrong with Amazon, but somehow the reviews for Street Fighter: Soul Powers are those of the Street Fighter live-action film.

Street Fighter: Soul Powers is the second of two DVD sets compiling the entire Street Fighter Saturday morning cartoon (the first set is called Street Fighter: Code of Honor), originally aired on USA network. The wikipedia article of the TV series can be found here:[...]. To reiterate, this is NOT the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie.

Essentially, the Street Fighter American animated series is a cartoon made for children based on the popular Street Fighter videogame franchise. It's not a good show, but the series can be of value to fans of the Street Fighter videogames. Its script and stories are so terrible to the point of being unintentionally humorous, some of which have become internet memes: [...]
The animation can sometimes be decent, but the artwork is usually poor and inconsistent. If you're a Street Fighter fan and want a good animated production, you have two great options among a handful:

1. Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie. Arguably the most faithful and interesting movie or TV show based on SF. The fights are entertaining, and the story is simple enough to allow the characters to play their one-dimensional personalities. 100% recommended. If you're in the US, make sure to get the latest DVD release, which is uncut. Additionally, watch it in English. Surprisingly, this is one of the few anime that benefits from a changed soundtrack.

2. Street Fighter II V: This is a 29-episode anime series that closely follows the friendship of young adults Ryu and Ken. Since it's a show, characters are allowed more time to develop, and the fight scenes do not disappoint. Manga Video has already released a compact box set containing all four discs in the US.

There are other SF animated productions out there, but in my view these two are the best ones.
