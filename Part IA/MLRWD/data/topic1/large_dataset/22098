I was looking forward to enjoying GitS in all its widescreen glory on my PSP. What I got was a letterbox view inside a 4:3 box, using I'd estimate 60% of the screen display. No extras, not even the japanese language (original) soundtrack.

I will be taking this back to the shop tomorrow and demanding a refund. Considering this disk only plays on a PSP its a travesty that they didn't use the whole screen.

Most disappointed and the copyright owners have once again let me down. For background info, the original Region 2 DVD of this film had a 1 second audio delay which rendered it pretty much unwatchable.

Its such a shame to see such beautiful work being mangled like this by people who clearly couldn't care less about the consumers who want to enjoy it.

The film itself gets 5/5. This implementation gets 1/5 and that's only because there is no 0/5 rating. If you want GitS on PSP I recommend you buy the DVD and rip it yourself. Its the only way you will be able to enjoy it in full-screen on your PSP and in its original language.
