This movie is truly a masterpiece. From the beginning to the climax, it's gloomy. Not dark or sinister, it's just that Eastwood found a way to make you empathize with the characters without being heavy handed. The sadness is usually just an undercurrent, almost subliminal. You never feel manipulated. The weight of the movie comes at you from all angles in a perfect blend of cinematography, plot development, character development, dialogue, acting, and scoring. As I stated before, all of these elements are blended so subtly that it never feels manipulative or contrived. The plot and character development are perfectly timed but the slow development may turn off fans of action movies although it will appeal to movie fans for whom an actual story line is appealing.

The genius really comes into focus when you realize that everything (I mean absolutely everything!) in the first three quarters of the movie is just preparation for the climax and resolution at which point the sadness moves from the background to the foreground in a major way and turns to pure misery. I'm a 28 year old male and pride my self on not being a crybaby, but I actually teared-up during the resolution, something a movie has not done to me for over a decade. Eastwood has made some crappy movies in his day but he has truly hit his golden era.
