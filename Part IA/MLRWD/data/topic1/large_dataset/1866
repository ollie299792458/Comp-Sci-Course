I'm a huge John Woo fan and I enjoyed many of Tom Cruise's films. After seeing Broken Arrow and Face/Off, I truly believed Woo will be able to make top notch action flicks like he used to back in Hong Kong. However, even the most spectacular action sequences in the world can not make up for shallow minded storylines that seem to be a symptom suffered by many big-budget Hollywood productions these days. Rumor has that the original uncut version of Mission Impossible 2 turned out to be over 3 hours long and received an R-rating. This was not very marketable during the extremely competitive summer season where young teenagers made up the mass majority of the movie goers. Another fact was that John Woo was not involved with the editing at all. So you eliminate a hour worth of original storylines and cut out every sequences showing any sign of blood from a John Woo film. What do you have left? A piece of fancy looking garbage that will forever haunt the reputation of Woo as a masterpiece action film director.
