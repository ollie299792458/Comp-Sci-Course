I'm going to give Phillip  K. Dick the benefit of the doubt and assume that his short story "Second Variety"--on which this movie is allegedly based--isn't as full of plot holes or as preposterous as the script for this movie. (Besides, Phil had been dead for a dozen years when his estate, who must have really been hard up for cash at the time, sold the story's rights to the makers of this sci-fi/horror schlockfest.)

The first half of Screamers is enjoyable enough as a cheesy, low-budget sci-fi flick, with Peter Weller's character leading a small group of war-weary soldiers to an enemy encampment to negotiate peace with a suspicious foe -- all while avoiding the "Screamers," burrowing buzzsaw-like robots that patrol the planet's sands. The beasties were originally deployed by Weller's side but are programmed to attack any and all people not wearing a certain protective bracelet. And, unbeknownst to the film's clueless humans, the independently minded things are busy building more advanced varieties of themselves.

But after the film's decent setup, the plot holes begin to pile up, and by the third act the supposedly battle-hardened soldiers are forced to engage in the full litany of moronic behavior necessary to set up their own gory deaths (I had fun guessing the order of the characters' demise) and the interminable final fight scene.

That said, at least two scenes make Screamers stand out from the usual sci-fi fare: an android cat fight and one of the most unintentionally hilarious movie endings I've ever seen. The fembot battle concludes too quickly to be satisfying, but the film's ending had me in stitches. Viewers with cardiorespiratory problems are advised to take the appropriate precautions.

The bottom line: Sci-fi fans can enjoy the atmospheric first half of Screamers in all low-budget seriousness, then shift into Mystery Science Theater 3000 mode and enjoy the howlers of the second half. --MellowMonk.com
