First, I would like to express my appreciation for the review by Felix Felicis (Apr. 20 2006) which I thought was extremely helpful and interesting and wise.  The reason I am adding my own review is to emphasize the wondrous acting interludes in this movie.  Mr. Welles, of course, is always hypnotic, I can never take my eyes off him in any movie in which he appears (or waddles).  The two American leads, Robert Arden and Patricia Medina, are of course hilariously bad, as has been mentioned ad infinitum ad nauseam.  Imagine Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe (or Jayne Mansfield, or maybe Brigitte Bardot), and as Raina, think of Natalie Wood.  Oh well.  Never mind them.  The four reasons Mr. Arkadin is marvelous are:

1.  Akim Tamiroff in his sad, pathetic, enormously brave and heartbreaking portrayal of the indignities of old age and poverty.  At one point he pleads to be allowed to put on his trousers (to cover up his soiled underwear?).  I have a feeling that was an improvised line.

2.  Mischa Auer and the flea circus.  It is not just the human actor but the insect performers who made my jaw drop as I stared obsessively at the screen in this unbelievable gothic and unforgettable cameo.

3.  Michael Redgrave.  I have seen Michael Redgrave in many British films of the 1940's, but I did not recognize him as the weird Hitchcockian antiques dealer.  THAT WAS MICHAEL REDGRAVE??? I thought reading the credits.  I can watch this scene over and over again and never get tired of it.

4.  Last -- the most incredible and most marvelous Katina Paxinou.  If the movie contained nothing else but Katina Paxinou as Sophia, it would rate five stars.  Six stars.  Maybe ten stars.

Of course there are other things in Mr. Arkadin.  The penitentes.  The masquerade ball.  The German street (reminiscent of The Third Man's Vienna).  The tale of the scorpion and the frog.  (Which one is Arkadin?  Maybe he's both.  Maybe he's Aristotle Onassis.  Who cares.  Watch the movie.)
