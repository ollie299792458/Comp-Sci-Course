When considering my review about this show there are items that would sound less than positive, like my feelings for the pompous Sam Ballard, who acts more like a modern day pharisee than a true Christain or the nagging wives and the womanizing barrister/judge.  And then there is Rumpole himself who drinks too much, eats too much and smokes too much.  When I first began the series I thought Rumpole to be a grumpy old man and I had to laugh the first time I saw John Mortimer with his huge Adam Ant glasses.  But as I watched more I went from laughing at Rumpole and Mr. Mortimer, to laughing with them, to enjoying their company and finally to becoming friends.  The stories are very well written and Leo McKern is a perfect Rumpole of the Bailey.  I may not want to become like Rumpole or encourage my son to use him as a role model, but I would like to have him as my friend.  By the end of the show you have a warm feeling for Rumpole and his creator and you have many fond memories.  At first I questioned the high marks that others were awarding this show but now I echo them.  If I knew Shakespeare better I would give an appropriate quote to summarize this review, but as it is, I will leave that to my friend Rumpole.
