I love this movie and have it on VHS. One of the best moives ever. Currently, I want to purchase this movie on DVD to expand my collection of DVDs; except there are two DVDs to chose from. Now I have read and tried to find this movie through many rental stores just so that I can compare the two different DVDs, but I had no luck in finding any of these version of DVDs. Next, I found these reviews on this site describing to be unhelpful because one would say how the poor quality of sound and picture are and says how prestine this DVD is. In both cases, all of these reviews shown are irrelevent and will not be helpful in finding an excellent DVD like any other DVD, (such as the Matrix). Also, I know this is not an official review, rather a case where sites and information cetners are ignorant or will not display the quality of a product caption along with the product trying to be sold. It makes me so mad that out of 134 reviews and purchases made by the 'reviewers' are not able to give accurate information reguarding the quality of a DVD and to wich the item was purchased from. 
Overall, all of these reviewers display their ignorance because no site is willing to give the quality conditions of the "Meet The Feebles" DVD. In other words, ignorance leads to ignorance and so on. 
This review, ((comment)), is no intended to heed my frustrations against the other reviewers, but at the fact there is no information to display the quality this DVD is in.
