As someone upgrading blu-ray collection and of course that means action films, the importance has always been first and foremost picture quality, then audio and any possible new featurettes. The transfer quality of this BD, compared to my version of DVD, shows a bit of improvement. The most improvement is in the on-screen text. I agree with the top reviewer that a DVD player/TV with quality upscaling engine should do just as good of a job on the DVD.

But regardless, at $8 it's well worth the purchase to round up the blu-ray collection.

UPDATE: Per comment posted I have gone back to compare my DVD version with the blu-ray again, but this time looking for more details. In some scenes (past the initial 2025AD opening) there are subtle details throughout such as wrinkles on the skin that comes through well on the blu-ray, and I don't believe it's possible with up-scaling/anti-aliasing technology today. So for me now buying this blu-ray is not just "nice-to-have" but "great buy" for collectors.
