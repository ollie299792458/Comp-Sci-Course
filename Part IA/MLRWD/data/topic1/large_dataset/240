I love action and adventure films and this is as good as the best in this genre. It is fun, exciting, the sets are amazing, the parkour fantastic and most of all Jake Gyllenhal is soooo hot. He is one of my favorite actors, very skillful and normally in deeper more serious roles, so it is clear this one was easy for him. He looks so fit, muscled and lean in this movie and best of all you can tell that he just had a blast making it. In fact everything about this movie screams fun. Clearly, aside from the extras marching in the 125 degree Moroccan desert heat, it appears that everyone involved was caught up in the magic of a wonderful tale wonderfully done. It is not deep but it has a good message, and while there is a lovely romantic story it is not the only story of love. Familial love and love of one's country and culture are also important. The special effects are good too and used sparingly as needed so this is not a CGI movie. In fact the fact that Jake did most of his stunts and Gemma did a lot of hers and that they didn't CGI the parkour makes it a lot better to watch. I really don't like movies where they have to hide the actors face all the time to cover up the stunt double or where the actor leaps from a building and becomes a cartoon character. This has a great story, gorgeous costumes and sets and an excellent cast. Ben Kingsley is a superb actor, slightly wasted in a limited role, but still an asset. I highly recommend this film, it is very enjoyable to watch and will be one of a select few that I watch more than once. I would go into more detail about the film but I feel this is one that was so much fun to watch not knowing anything about the story. Give it a chance you won't be disappointed.
