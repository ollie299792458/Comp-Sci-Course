Ye Gods the movie takes on a whole new meaning in the month since Hunter S. Thompson's suicide. Anybody familiar with the good Doctor knew it was a miracle he lived to the age he did. his death was a shock but then again not so, after all, Hunter was something of a fatalist in life. "Fear and Loathing" is a great adaptation of his most famous book, 7 years from the movie's release to Hunter's death. The fact that Johnny Depp and Hunter were good friends may play a role, but this is quite possibly Depp's best role! I am a fan of Depp and all his good roles, but his Hunter is dead on and although there is little known of "Dr. Gonzo"...Benicio Del Toro does a pretty amazing Oscar Acosta. Like all films adapted from great books, the book is usually better but this is a fascinating movie with career roles by both Depp and Toro, both amazing actors in their own right. Like the book, the movie is about as hallucinatory and zany and twisted as it gets, but comedy is what it boils down to. One of the funniest moments in the movie is the appearence of a pre Spider Man Toby Macguire rocking a " young guy bald on top long in back" 70's style hairdo. It's crazy this took 25 plus years to be made into a film, the REAL story is so much like a film anyway! Now with hunter gone this movie will make maybe a little more sense to those who may have otherwise liked it, but didn't "get it." R.I.P. Hunter you crazy Bastid
