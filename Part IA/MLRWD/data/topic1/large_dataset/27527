I bought this one on strength of reputation, which i don't normally do. But having seen such other notorious horror flicks as Evil Dead, Exorcist,  Blair Witch, Last House On The Left etc...I figured i was obligated to  check it out.
Actually it has a lot in common with all the above  mentioned flicks. Blair Witch because of the 'apparent' realism and the way  it forces you to use your imagination, Exorcist because of the creepy use  of sound, Evil Dead for the mad camera work and Last House On The Left for  sheer brutality. And thats what the film is - Brutal. The teen friendly  flicks of today cannot compare to this. This one is downright NASTY. 
It  makes every effort to hurt the audience. There is no 'guess who is the  killer' element here, no cheesy orchestral stingers, no irony, no subtlty,  no reason in the film at all. It's basically just half an hours set up then  the rest of the movie is people getting killed. No real plot or explanation  just death, just the way one likes it. 
It's twistedly funny and not in  the 'Scream' way. I mean REALLY twistedly funny. These elements combine to  make TCM one of the best of them 70's flicks I reckon. Not as painful as  Last House On The Left mind (but then what is ?), nevertheless I felt hurt  after watching it. Thats something few horror flicks do to me (refer to pre  mentioned list again !). 
The DVD comes with more extras than you would  believe and the picture quality ain't bad. Wish they'd left the grain in  tho...Still it's well worth getting on this superior format and is a killer  film in it's own right.
