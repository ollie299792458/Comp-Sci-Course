This dvd rules. The four corners match between scorpio/jericho/douglas/and pitbull 2 is AWESOME, and its so long, 40 minutes!rvd vs. bigelow is an awesome match, and rvd takes to the air when he dives into the audience..twice! sabu vs. sandman is a very brutal and entertaining match.ian vs. axl, dont expect any wrestling in this match, but its ok, they make up for it in blood. LOTS OF BLOOD. jerry lynn vs. tajiri vs. super crazy is a great three way dance. malenko vs. guerrero, great 2/3 falls match with tons of emotions in the ecw arena, since it is both their final appearance in ecw before leaving to wcw. misterio vs. psicosis is an AWESOME match, very good first impression from both men in their debut match. some extras include lots of promos, most notably steve austin.and definitely the best easter egg of all the dvds, the late great Brian Pillman invades ECW at cyberslam 96 and totally shoots (i think he was, if he wasnt they did a damn good job at making it seem he was) on Eric Bischoff, the ecw fans, and paul heyman. this segment RULES ! this dvd is definitely worth the money, no doubt about it
