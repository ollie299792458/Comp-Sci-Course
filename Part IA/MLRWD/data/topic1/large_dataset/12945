In Heat, which stars Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Val Kilmer,cops and crooks start from the same place, and satisfy the same impulses through separate, opposing means. Both are drawn to the ``heat'' of violent conflict, both enjoy making the other guy into a patsy, and both are failures at integrating relationships and family with their addiction to danger. 
 Set in contemporary Los Angeles, ``Heat'' stars De Niro as Neil McCauley, a brilliant, cold- as-ice career criminal who masterminds the robbery of an armored van containing $1.6 billion in bearer bonds. Pacino is Vincent Hanna, a homicide/ robbery detective with the LAPD who recognizes the work of a professional and spends the film's three-hour duration on De Niro's trail. Writer-director Michael Mann, the creator of "Miami Vice" and director of "Manhunter" and "The Last of the Mohicans," is a masterly image-maker. Mann binds sound, music and pictures into one hypnotic triaxial cable and plugs it right into your brain. He makes this almost-three-hour experience practically glide by.
Along with the greatest cops and robbers shoot-out scene ever filmed, Heat is a masterpiece of cinema and one of the best crime drama's of all time. By all means, buy this DVD END
