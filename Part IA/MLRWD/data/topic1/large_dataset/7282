This movie was a political movie. Yes, there is one drug crazed scene after another, but you have to look at the other parts of the movie that are there. It's the end of a culture, a war we never belonged in, the direction America was headed at that time. And the feelings of HST about it all and sensing that they had pushed too far.

When I watched the movie for the first time, I watched it with the commentary first with Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro, and the producer. They explain alot about the movie that I think some people are missing. It takes a certain type of person to understand and enjoy this movie and Hunter S. Thompson. He is

(was) his own person and one of the few that was honest about the destruction of America. He will be deeply missed and one can only pray that we are blessed with another, similar to him; for no one could ever be like him. If you've seen the movie and were not really impressed, I challenge you to rent the Criterion Collection DVD and watch it with the commentaries and the extras. It will enlighten you like no drug ever could. In the words of Hunter, "Buy the ticket, take the ride." And what a ride it is!
