Ok I keep stopping and restarting and erasing what I wrote. This movie is as stated very disturbing, not in graphic images, but in implied emotions, and happenings.

The movie starts out really slow and disjointed, much like the review I am trying to get out. When it starts it has that artsy European feel to it. It goes back and forth and is somewhat confusing - stick it out, it gets better. This is very disturbing subject matter, and I wouldn't recommend anyone under 13 watch it for sure, and maybe older.
Potential spoilers below.

I think the movie eloquently shows the horror of what a Mother goes through in the after math of a huge tragedy. Unlike many movies that show you what is to be the obvious victim people care about - this takes on (very well) the less easy to identify with Mother of the Mass Murderer. What she goes through as she knows there is something wrong with her child, and the aftermath of the tragedy.

The casting of Kevin was perfect in all the ages. It was heartbreaking to watch. I think this is a movie where 10 people can see it and have completely different views on it. Some will think it was the mothers fault, others will think Kevin was completely at fault, others will see it as no one caught it. The interesting thing is not everyone will be able to come to the same conclusion.

So my review is I hated this movie because it was so real. But I loved this movie for making me think and be better able to empathize as a human. I kind of thought the Mom was always a weirdo, but the more I think on it the more I think there is so much that happened that was not shown. I kind of thought Mom should have taken the kid to psychiatrist, curious to know what others felt. The one thing I don't doubt is that you will feel something.

Why 5 stars?  It isn't often a movie haunts me like this one did, and I appreciate having a different way to look at things.
