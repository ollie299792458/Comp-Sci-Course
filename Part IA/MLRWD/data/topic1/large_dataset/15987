I'm a fan of Jason Segel, and was looking forward to this movie, expecting it to be a funny romantic comedy - something along the lines of "Forgetting Sarah Marshall."

It does have its funny moments, for sure - but there's also a lot of dead-serious stuff here. Is it a romantic comedy, or a dramatic exploration of a relationship/breakup? It felt like an uneasy hybrid of the two. While there's nothing wrong with a "dramedy" - this just didn't hit the mark for me.

Jason's character spends much of the film in a deep depression (and doing things which I *think* are meant to be funny but just come off as pathetic) - but certain elements of that part of the plot didn't make a lot of sense to me. For instance, he's a intially a hot up-and-coming chef in a culinary mecca, but after moving to the Midwest doesn't go any farther in seeking fulfillment in his new town than half-heartedly applying for jobs at a bunch of mediocre restaurants? (No trying to find a partner, opening his own business, starting some new culinary adventure, looking in nearby towns, or at least digging a little deeper locally...?). It didn't ring true to me.

The pacing is also a little off - at 2 hours, 5 minutes, it really could have been edited to move along faster. (Some of the middle of the film - the really mopey "life really sucks because my fiancee moved us to the Midwest" portion could truly have been cut.)

Fans expecting the little girl to shout "I am Katniss!" before shooting a crossbow in the kitchen will be disappointed to hear her say "I am Pocahontas" instead. (Turns out the "Katniss" line was just for the trailer, with the hopes of getting  all you "Hunger Games" fans on board.)

The Five-Year Engagement was a pleasant enough way to spend a couple hours, but with a little tighter script and with attention from a good editor, it could have been so much more.
