Filmed in a dark room, it's about a lonely intellectual that smokes a lot and has all the answers to the world problems, from the global economic collapse to the crisis for human survival.

Michael wants to save humanity, but nobody will listen to his message. Basically, a remake of The Passion of the Christ but funnier and in documentary form.

It's got some Spirited Away and Pocahontas environmental messages too: Man destroys Earth, balance is destroyed, man suffers, balance restored.

It's also an autobiography about Michael, but I'll let the English lit majors dissect those boring human nature stuff.

Great film: Funny. Sad. Hopeful. It's got cussing too, which is why you should watch it. If you like King Corn and Food, Inc. you will like this film.

Oh, Michael, if you are reading this, pay your rent man and find a wife; the transition period won't be in full effect for another 40 years. I welcome the Planet of the Apes.

Human ingenuity....lol...who asked that silly question?
