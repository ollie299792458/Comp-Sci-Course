Many of the reviews I read here are about the heavy political or social agenda the movie has.  Now while it is obvious that Chris Weitz has his views and he makes them known I don't think it's with an agenda to make a heavy and sharp satirical film based on them.  I think he was just making fun of what is so ludacris in our society.  The remarkable and yet sad situation we have with American Idol drawing way more votes than a presidential election and its mass hysteria is made fun of and so is the situation with a current administration.  But I think that is all he is doing, is just making fun of it and getting his little pokes and takes on the situation himself.  I don't think its a sharp satire thats meant to cut.  And I don't think it was suppose to be, I think he's just exposing the stupidity of both of the subjects and how ridiculous he thinks it is.  All that aside, the performances are fun to watch.  The acting is well done.  And the movie I found generally funny, and I think you will too, as long as you don't take it too seriously.
