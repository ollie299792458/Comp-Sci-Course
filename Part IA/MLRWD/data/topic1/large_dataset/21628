This film is up there with Insomnia and Memento. It has everything needed for a good crime/detective film. I am barely starting to get into detective films as well as Mobster/Gangster films although this does not fall into those two categories. Seven is has a great cast, even though Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey have only a limited amount of screen time, their performences are still effective, especially Kevin Spacey's. Morgan Freeman did a wonderful job in this film as a the cool headed detective who is a true intellectual in this film, contrary to the hot headed Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt played his part well, in perfect contrast to his partner, of course this scenario has been seen before but that doesn't matter because Brad does true justice to his part of this duo. The ending was unexpected and suited Brad's character well, although I figured out from the begining that he was going to commit one of the seven "deadly" sins. The only problem I had, was that this DVD did not come with any extra features, especially commentaries which I would have liked. Great film.
