What a charming series. What I enjoy most about it is that, while it's highly entertaining, not every episode involves a gory murder which requires a team of CSI experts to solve. Most stories truly are just mysteries, which are solved by the ever-observant and astute Inspector Crabbe.

In preparation for Detective Inspector Crabbe's retirement, Margaret and Henry Crabbe sell their house and purchase a restaurant, Pie in the Sky, over which they now live. Dramatic circumstances arise in which Crabbe's official retirement is postponed, and he must now be at the beck and call of Assistant Chief Constable Freddy Fisher, an ambitious, self-serving administrator, to solve crimes as Fisher summons him. Fisher usually uses Crabbe's sleuthing skills to further his own hidden agenda; however (thankfully), you can't put one past Crabbe. The unfolding of the story and the development of the characters (Fisher included) are an absolute delight to watch. Also lending their own respective charms are the English countryside and the fabulous food!

Crabbe's sardonic putdowns of Fisher (watch why he names his rooster after him), dry wit, passion for the art of cooking, and the restaurant setting lend loads of charm to the series, and the Crabbes' affection for their staff and the people in their lives completely won me over.

The series appeals to the foodie in me and is definitely a television cozy. I highly recommend and look forward to Season 2!!
