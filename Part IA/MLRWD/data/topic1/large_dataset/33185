For a made-for-tv movie, this one is above average. Meredith Baxter gives a superb performance, as usual. I took off two stars because of the obvious Dan-and-Linda worship going on here, as well as the miscasting of the actors who portrayed Dan and Linda.

Stephen Collins is a competent enough actor, but he was an unsuitable choice to play Dan Broderick. Dan still had a full head of hair in middle-age, and was really handsome and photogenic. Collins just didn't project Dan's charisma on-screen.

Michelle Johnson, while attractive, is not the stunner that Linda Kolkena (supposedly) was. Linda was so beautiful that she turned heads and, reportedly, had a gorgeous smile. Johnson is merely "cute" here and is definitely no competition for Baxter in the looks department. This is important because, in real-life, Linda was ALL about her looks. It was all she had going for her.

So, watch the DVD for Meredith Baxter's performance. As Betty, she is charming, funny, shrill, self-absorbed and just plain fun to watch. She's a sympathetic character even in a movie that sets out to demonize her rather than portraying the facts of the case accurately.
