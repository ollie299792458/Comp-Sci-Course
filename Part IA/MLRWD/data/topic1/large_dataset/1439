I remember watching this with my mother when I was about 12 or 13, we were living in, at the time, West Germany, the cold war was in full bloom. I was prepared for a long long boring evening. Surprisingly this film grabbed me very early on and I didn't move for the entire time it ran, despite not understanding all the subtleties of the story at the time.

Over the last 30 or so years I have watched this film at-least 4 or 5 times, and have enjoyed it each time anew.

Antony Quinn delivers, in my opinion, one of his best performances, on par with his performance in Zorba the Greek.

Laurence Olivier, in the few minutes he is in the film produces a performance like no other, portraying a man completely convinced of the "rightness" of the system he lives in and is in charge of at the same time showing a man who is mortally afraid of what the future holds and is playing the last card in his hand, hoping that it is an ace (a comparison - Jack Nicholson in "A Few Good Men", just a total of 5 -10 min on the screen but everyone remembers him, well Laurence Olivier got there first).

Oskar Werner's portrait of a priest who is torn between his love for his God and is love and compassion for mankind and is being forced to make a decision one way or another by the church, and knowing that he will choose mankind, and is grateful that he will soon have a chance to present his case to the highest arbitrator, is one that I haven't seen since.

This seems to be, initially, a religious film, it isn't. It is about the politics within and around a religion and gives great insight into how the Pope is elected.

This film is on my list of all time favourite films, despite the fact that I am an atheist.
