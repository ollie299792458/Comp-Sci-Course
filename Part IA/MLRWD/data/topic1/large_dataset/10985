Here is something you just don't get anywhere else.  There are all sorts of instructional materials for guitar, and indeed it is a very large topic, but very very, VERY few materials stop to give you a very precise mechanical understanding of what you should be doing and exactly why and HOW !  If you have ever gotten in your own way, such as having a mental dialogue to the effect "I'll never be able to..." well... B.S.  Ney proves it, and with your own hands !  Another review I read recently of Ney's DVD was hoping for more particular exercises.  I've been 'around' Ney at GuitarPrinciples for a few years now, and one of his big things is that YOU are the Artist, after all, and you should be "practicing the music" not the "practice" - whatever that is...  In deed, think of the question "I want more exercises please..."  What are you REALLY asking for ?  imho - Ney could not be more right.  Picking can be applied in way too many varied ways to way too many styles of music to say "here are THE exercises you should be doing".  The ones he does provide in this DVD are truly foundational to virtually any form of picking you do or may end up doing.  Such insight as is required to digest a topic down to this level of "foundational elements" is a science that has taken not only a lot of time, but I would dare to say also a certain Divine Inspiration to even begin to make such an attempt.  Ney understands educational psychology in this domain very deeply.  Aspiring guitarists can turn off their egos and trust Ney in this, listen very carefully, and do !  If after watching perhaps a few times, you haven't gone "Aha ! Enlightenment !" email him.  You should SEE, IF you DO.  And some times you have to make a significant effort before you can truly "see".  The impact Ney's DVD had on me, however, was immediate, same day.  Perhaps I knew two things in advance 1) the true depth and degree of what would be presented and 2) already sound faith in Ney's instructional abilities.
