It is incomprehensible to me why this movie has not yet made it to DVD.  I think it is easily Visconti's greatest work, and one of the masterpieces of Italian film from a great era in general; and it is also a flawless adaptation of one of the finest Italian novels of the twentieth century.  The film is a close study of a noble Sicilian family, and especially of its Prince (played by Burt Lancaster in what I think is also his best role), as they interact with the new middle-class parvenus of revolutionary Italy.  The cinematic values of the film itself are stunning, from the vast panoramas of the desolate Sicilian countryside, to the stifling intimacy of the final ball (which lasts nearly an hour on film without once being boring).  What is most amazing is the depth of the film.  Even small gestures are carefully observed and capture the nuances of an aristocracy in decline.  I loved "Death in Venice" as well, but this film should justly be considered Visconti's most tightly controlled and haunting.
