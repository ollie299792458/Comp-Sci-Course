I have watched most of this film a few times - the end is too chilling and painful to watch more than once.

While Twilight was a powerful albeit fantastical love story somewhat poorly told on film, Remember Me explores so many themes - heartbreaking familial loss, parental and romantic love and betrayal, the friction between lives of the privileged and working class, and coming of age in a world that can be so deceptively cruel and honestly beautiful at the same time. It forces us (especially those of us in our 20s in 2001) to stop and evaluate the sum of our deeds during what must have been the most promising time of our lives.Have our choices been as emphatic, instinctive and momentous as those of Tyler (played by Robert Pattinson)? Probably not.

Beyond this, Remember Me finally allows Pattinson to demonstrate compelling talent and sensitivity as an actor. His signing on as a producer toward the end of production to protect the film's authenticity and artistic value also impressed me immensely. He is buoyed by a an excellent cast of players - this film could not be improved.

Thanks for reading.
