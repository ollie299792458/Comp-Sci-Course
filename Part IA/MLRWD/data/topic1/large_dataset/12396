I'm usually too lazy to write something recommending a book or movie that I enjoy.  Because I felt so much empathy for the main characters in this film I have taken a personal interest in leading the horse to water, so to speak.  This movie was amazing.  Maybe it helped that Mark Ruffalo was more or less unknown when it came out, but his scenes all seemed so unbelievably real.  I think the most powerful was when he takes his nephew to see his cold, son-of-a-... father.  The thrill I felt when he punched him, and the accompanying guilt that soon followed were so primal.  It was almost as real as if it was.  The nephew was great too, forced to become "the man of the house" well before he should have. I don't think it's fair to Laura Linney that my praise is all for her co-stars, but I felt at times she was acting.  Her character's reactions are pulled from the same suitcase her prosecutor lugged around in Primal Fear.  I hate world-weariness that seems false.  If you're over the age of 12, you've seen enough to be genuienly world-weary.  Anyhow, her scenes are still credible, and she's best when you can see the mischeviousness beneath her been-there, I'm tough, facade. All-in-all, I think this film best demonstrated cinema's capacity to reveal human longing and need out of last year's slate, Crouching Tiger be ... (don't get me started on last year's Blair Witch project).  The character are vulnerable, endearing, exasperating-enough adjectives though.  I have a running argument with a friend who claims that movies are grossly inferior to books (Voltaire couldn't see why people got all hot and bothered over Shakespheare).  I know that people who feel that way tend to universally debase popular tastes, but with Jurassic Park III and Cats and Dogs coming out soon, sometimes I forget why he's wrong.  But as Shakespheare said, "the play's the thing," and You Can Count on Me is a film that redeem's "the play's" contemporary cousin.
