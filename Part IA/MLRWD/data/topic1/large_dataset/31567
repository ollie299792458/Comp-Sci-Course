This is the best movie that I have seen with Ben Stiller and I love that he directed it as well. There aren't many movies that talk about male modeling, in fact I can't think of any others. I want to give credit to both Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, they made great models, each playing them dumb but still loveable. They are a great many moments that I could talk about, the award show, the miner montage, and the fashion show, but my favorite part of the film in the gas fight with Derick's male model roomates. Also I need to give A LOT of credit to Will Ferrell, Mugatu was GREAT to say the least. I don't think there is a person out there that can play a comic bad guy better than he can. The only performance that I did not love was that of Christine Taylor, Ben's wife. She doesn't seem to care for any of the other people in the film and she just seems to be reading her lines. But everyone else more than makes up for her.
This film is not one to pick if you put thought into your movies. But if you enjoy escaping into a world of make believe then this is the right one for you. After a stressful week this is the movie that I watch to relax and laugh with. I know that it will do the same for you.
