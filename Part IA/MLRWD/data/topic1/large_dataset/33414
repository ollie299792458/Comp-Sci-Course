This film tackles tough teenage issues like acceptance by your peers, as well as, the lack of love and support, understanding and guidance, plus the positive recognition that should be provided by all parents.  The lonliness in this environment is too intolerable for some to bear.  Kudos for surviving these years!
Heather Matarazzo's character represents each of us, whether in part, or full, so we are really drawn in by her.  She pulls off a fabulous performance.
