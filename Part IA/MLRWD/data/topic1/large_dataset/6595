Babylon A.D. is a film that looked and sounded like the perfect blockbuster vehicle for Vin Diesel based on the trailers and plot synopsis provided by 20th Century Fox.  However what you really get is a disaster that only becomes more confusing and makes less sense the longer it runs because this film editing wise was chopped and sliced to death in post production.  I mean the editing is so poor that even the action is flat which is bad because bad movies have proven that if nothing else they can still have good action sequences.  But wait that's not all,  what is perhaps the nail in the coffin for this movie is the plot itself because despite being based on the book Babylon Babies, the plot is unoriginal at best simply being Blade Runner, The Fifth Element, and Children of Men all thrown together in one pot.  Overall Babylon A.D. is a sad unfortunate misfire which is too bad because the film does have good production design and some interesting set pieces and yes Vin Diesel but it's simply not enough.  My god what a waste, a waste of something that had potential.
