So I was perusing the reviews for this movie before getting a copy and I must say that in regards to this movie, people came to the table with far too high expectations for this movie and had them in completely different areas in which this movie really shone.  The particularly vitriolic reviewers here should have known beforehand that a vehicle piloted by Will Smith with Kevin Kline riding shotgun would *not* be the next "Citizen Kane."  I knew this the first time I saw the commericals for this movie, but went to see it anyway.  I'm proud to be one of the thirty five people in America to have paid $7.50 for this movie and plan to shell out about twenty more for the DVD.  It was not a waste to me.  I do not regret seeing this movie at all in theaters.  "T3" and "Matrix: Reloaded" however....
I suppose my particular attraction to Wild Wild West was summed up quite well by a former reviewer who described it as "enjoyable" but not "good."  You must have this attitude to enjoy this movie, otherwise you cringe at what should elicit a throaty chuckle.  Of course the movie is miscast, even though Branaugh's and Kline's performances taken at face value are enjoyable.  Of course there couldn't be "big metal spiders", etc. back then.  This still doesn't keep this movie from being a fun, campy joyride that will probably engender a cult following in years to come.  Wild Wild West is the Plan 9 of the 90's.
My recommendation: watch it on TV first.  Yes, they still show it.  They also show the TV movies made from the original TV show.  Believe me, they aren't much better, despite what the WWW purists may say.  If you like the free experience, then by all means get the DVD.  But the Wild Wild West experience is not for the casual buyer.
