Season 5 of Angel was a mixed bag. After Season 4's season-long narrative, the WB network demanded that Josh Whedon construct Season 5 with more stand-alone episodes.  While the setup for season 5, with the gang now running the LA branch of Wolfram & Hart, was ingenious, the show got off to a relatively slow start.  The launch of the new setup and the return of Spike from oblivion took too many episodes, and the return of Lindsay was far less dramatic than it could have been.  The season got rolling in the second half, starting with the one-episode return of Cordelia.  The famous puppet episode was uproarius. The WWII story fun despite its continuity problems.  The Wesley/Fred/Illyria plot was incredibly dramatic.  Gunn, who had generally been underused during much of the series, finally got an interesting story arc.  A very different Connor returned.  The show finally reached the conclusion of a plot that started at the very beginning of season 3.  And everything came together, but not to a conclusion, in the series finale.  Despite what others have written here, the series finale was filmed as a cliffhanger, not a finale, and was done long before WB's surprise cancellation of the show.  The finale did, in a way, serve as an appropriate end, but it was not intended as one.

The show was cancelled by the then head of the WB because, he said, the felt taht the show had no chance of growing its audience.  He ignored the fact that the show had more viewers than almost any show that the WB could replace it with.  He was fired months later and replaced by another executive who believed that it had been a mistake to cancel Angel.  But it was too late for the show.
