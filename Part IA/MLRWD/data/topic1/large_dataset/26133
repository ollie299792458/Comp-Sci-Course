I picked the DVD up , Not knowing a thing about the movie. Never watched the trailer or heard of it . To be honest i expected some heart-breaking love drama . But oh boy i was in for some traumatizing experience.
First of all , This is a heavy movie, Not for a typical action/comedy fan , It's okay to watch a little bit of everything and thats what i do . I try to appreciate everything in the movies i watch , If the plot falls short I'll praise the music or the director . But with this one , I had to find something else to praise .. And i did , I praise the fact that this movie is so Honest it hits me on a level i can't deny . This is no movie with heart-warming scripts and dialogs, and no mind blowing special effect or impossibly intelligent people coping with life . This is a women that had the courage not to break when others around her did. I'm sure others have noticed the fact that this movie doesn't attack Islam or Arab , But hits the target to express how inhuman ISI is. Also it showed how both sides suffered in the act of terrorism and extremism . Maybe it wasn't exactly politically correct, But i found the acting and the characters interactions so real. It felt exactly like watching a documentary but a  powerful one. I am not surprised that people and critics gave this movie bad reviews, To be honest this movie is clearly not targeted to everyone and anyone, It's for those who have the power and will to understand more  about what happened to Mariane Pearl through the unfortunate events. I'll give this movie 4 stars instead of 5 , Because i believe that no perfect work can be perfect , You see imperfection is the eye of perfection.
