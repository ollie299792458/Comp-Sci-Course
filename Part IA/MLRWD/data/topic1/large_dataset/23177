READ THE LAST MESSAGE BELOW ALL THIS. THANKS ^_^
Questions does this have the extras that i love in the first print out. I couldn't tell you cause I don't have this set.I agree with one of guys on here (the dude from GA, ATL) Hey I'm from Ga. I don't understand why put more yu yu hakusho dvds out anyways when they just finished putting out the 2 dvd sets of this entire series. It may have a good price but what about the extras that are included in the first print out which are not included in 2 dvd sets? are they in this season box set or not. I love yu yu hakusho don't get me wrong. I collect everything from them mostly posters and action figures and even the card sets, and yeah I'm a chick dudes but I love anime. Anyways I wish they just stop this really. If you just want to watch the anime that's kwel but i love the extras that are included in the first print out. I got all 33 dvds which is the entire series and the movie. i wish they would have made it shorter sooner. But at least I got my extras which the last dvd was great with the actors together talking about the series and the episodes. It was funny too. And JUSTIN COOK who plays Yusuke is a awesome dude. He plays so many people in the funimation projects. You will see his name everywhere. He is just great as all the other main cast is in this series. but they need to stop making this series into so many different dvd sets. They are a great company and number in my books and they always get great actors and pick great series and weird ones too. So I hope they know what they are doing now. All in all it is a awesome a** series begining to end. If you have seen it, you seriously need to.
Later Smiles ^__^

Ok I'm writing something new to this I went out to my buddy's house and he has this box set and I have to tell there are no extras still. Man that blows. So people stop giving me non helpful marks k, cause if you didn't find it helpful just pass along ok.later
