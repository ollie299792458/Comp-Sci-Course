What were all you people thinking, drinking, smoking?  This was the biggest let down since Massacre In Dinosaur Valley. You guessed it. No dinosaurs. Yes, the story was odd, and the performances were some what engaging.
  But if you wanted to actually see a monster pig, you better take a good hard look at the cover art. Because that is the best look you are going to get. The pig is little more than a conversation piece to hang the rest of the story on. When you finally get to the great obligatory battle at the end of the film, all you are going to see is a bobbing pig head puppet popping in and out of the frame. The budget was so low and the shooting schedule so short, that the producers had no hopes of building a monster prop of any kind, beyond a big ugly trophy mounted head puppet on a gimble. It snapped. It bled. It stayed in the dark to hide the overwhelming lack of craftsmanship.
  I do not believe in spoilers. But when the people who make a movie do this bad a job of it, then nothing anyone writes is going to spoil it any worse than it is. This review is not a spoiler. They did that already while making this no-pig-in-a-poke.
  Maybe I saw a different movie than the rest of these reviewers. Maybe there are several versions of "Unrated release" and I got the tamed down cut. The pig-less version. Maybe in the original cut the monster sprouted wings and became the most hideous and terrifying psychotic porker ever seen anywhere, and THIS was the version everybody but me saw. That is why the other reviews are so glowing. Maybe they created a whole flock of flying pigs for the heart stopping end battle, rivaling Harryhausen's best efforts. Maybe. But I don't think so.
