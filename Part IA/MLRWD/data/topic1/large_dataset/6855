Surprised?  I am a fan of Hitch's lesser-known films, including "Rope", "Rebecca", and "Strangers on a Train".  Yes, they were all great movies, but not the first when you think of Alfred Hitchcock, certainly.

It's really not as bad as you might think ~ Barbara Harris is Blanche, an intentional floozy who is also "psychic".  With the help of her supernatural guide Henry, she finds longlost relatives and "contacts" people who have crossed over to the other side, for a price of course.  Bruce Dern (who I despised in "The Cowboys") is great as her henpecked boyfriend, who drives a taxi when he isn't out doing Blanche's dirty work for her, usually under the guise of a private detective or a lawyer.  This time around Blanche is hired to find a longlost nephew to a wealthy woman, who is dying and wishes to leave her vast fortune to him.  The nephew turns out to be cunning and smarmy jewel thief William Devane, who with nervous cohort Karen Black, kidnaps wealthy men and has their ransoms paid in diamonds.  Nobody here is entirely innocent, and nothing is quite what it seems.  This is a slightly complicated plot, but is relatively easy to follow.  The cast is solid, the storyline is intriguing, and there is suspense and humor in all the right places.

Seriously, if you ever come across this movie to rent or buy for cheap...check it out.  Granted, its not quite on par with Hitchcock classics like "Psycho" or "The Birds"...but it is worth watching.
