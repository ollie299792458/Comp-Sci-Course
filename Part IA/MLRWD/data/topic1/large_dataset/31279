If you grew up in the 80's like me you know why this is why kids who grew up in the 80's had it so good.  HE-MAN was just cool for our generation.  The animation is great, the storylines excellent, the action energetic and the morals were life lessons.  Even today with all the CGI they cannot compete with this league, especially with the story lines that are in current film and television.  The HE-MAN creators took everything they knew and gave back 110%.  We had this show in the UK and all my friends watched it and we all bought the toys that were made for the series.  They will probably never make a cartoon series this good again, but if they do I'll eat my hat.

Other great recommendations from the 80's are

"Thundercats",
"Mysterious Cities of Gold" (due to be released soon) http://www.80scartoons.co.uk/mysterious-cities-of-gold.html

and "Dungeons and Dragons" &lt;(Buy the UK DVD version for the original music score because they had rights issues with Disney).
