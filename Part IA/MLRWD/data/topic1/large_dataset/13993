Reece Witherspoon finds herself carrying a major release feature film for the first time, and rises to the challenge. Legally Blonde is a crisp and energetic comedy that refuses to be taken seriously, even during its most pivotal courtroom scenes. The subtle and smart screenplay, adapted from Amanda Brown's novel, nonetheless falls into mediocrity for long stretches, the plot is somewhat half-baked, and the characters are archetypal at best. Yet somehow, I was genuinely entertained.
Witherspoon triumphed as a troubled teen with a razor sharp edge in "Freeway" (1996) and as an annoying and ruthless over-achiever in "Election" (1999). In each of her roles, her intelligence and capability smolder under a Barbie-doll exterior. Her characters put us on edge. One moment we're haughtily amused, the next, hopelessly intimidated. It's the type of feeling we got watching Sharon Stone in her prime. Expect more of the same from Witherspoon in this upbeat vehicle.
As she pursues her ex (Matthew Davis II) to Harvard Law, men and women alike hastily underestimate Elle (Witherspoon)-a Sorority president and Fashion Merchandizing major from Beverly Hills. Each faces the consequences as Elle repeatedly tramples the mythology of the ineffectual Blonde, all the time remaining impeccably dressed and manicured.
Myself a graduate student at Harvard, I must admit I enjoyed Brown's jabs at the mentality of many Ivy Leaguers. But this film is mostly worth seeing for its down-to-earth common sense, for its unbelievable comedic situations (one character is outed by his knowledge of shoe designers), and of course, for Reece.
