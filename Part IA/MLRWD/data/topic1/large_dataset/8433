Having been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in my forties, I felt at times that I was watching a movie about myself.  The little tremors that you aren't even thinking about that someone else notices, the overwhelming desire to joke about it, the frustration of dropping glasses, all rang true.  Most of all,  Jake Gyllenhall captures  perfectly the looks and concerns of the partner of a person with Parkinson's Disease, and some of the dialogue could have been straight out of my marriage.  I think the movie tied together more than the critics understood.  The importance of sex in the movie becomes clear in the one scene where she tremors during love making, and he tenderly and naturally holds her shaking hand.  The fear of the person with Parkinson's disease that she will hold back her partner from enjoying his life and the need to be accepted as is (incurably sick) are all extremely sensitively portrayed.  Jake Gyllenhall perfectly captures that look of love mixed with concern that makes a person with Parkinson's Disease want to send their partner away.  But, he gets it right in the end, when the look changes to just love, and he finally, but simply says "it's okay".
