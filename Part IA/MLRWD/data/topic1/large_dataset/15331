This film is very intense and 79 minutes is about what I could take of it! We follow Peter (played by Peter Greene), a man with some kind of schizophrenia and parts of the film is how he sees the world. We are given very few explanations and the plot contains some interesting ambiguities. Clean, shaven is more about the audiovisual than about narrative and/or social criticism. Through the film we hear voices like an untuned radio, sometimes in the scene and sometimes it is inside Peter's head. Clean, shaven also contains a few quite nasty strong scenes (a corpse in close up, Peter trying to cut of his nail etc) that sensitive viewers should be prepared for. Even though the film is set in strange and ugly milieus like desolate industrial areas and shabby mansions it also contains a kind of beauty or at least it's own special aesthetics. Also, the actors are excellent, especially Peter Greene who manages to look really tormented throughout the movie.

The Criterion edition also contains some extras like commentary and a video essay. I'm really glad I have seen this special movie. Recommended to everyone interested in cinema, especially american independent!
