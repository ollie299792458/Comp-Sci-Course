If you've ever dreamed of flying, if you know someone who's a pilot, or if you're a pilot yourself, you MUST see this movie. It's really a love story -- between the pilots and their airplanes, between fathers and their sons (and daughters) who followed their dreams, and between a community and its airport, in this case VNY, Van Nuys Airport in California. The history of the airport parallels that of general aviation in this country, and it is this history that the movie seeks to tell. Although there are some famous names in the credits, they are not the stars -- and refreshingly, Brian Terwilliger treats them with no more (but no less) honor than the other less famous pilots featured in the film.

It is clear that Terwilliger is passionate about his subject -- everything about the film shows a loving admiration for the men and women who lived the history of aviation in this country and in Southern California. The cinematography is simply spectacular, and the sweeping score adds to the breathtaking aerial shots. The film's message is clear from the beginning: general aviation, and general aviation airports, are national treasures we should all work to preserve.

Recommended without any reservations whatsoever.
