I remember when Couples Retreat came out. Romantic comedies arent really my thing so I opted to see ZombieLand instead but was amazed at the long line in all the way down the theater for Couples Retreat. I believe the movie went to number 1???? Regardless I didnt view the film till the dvd release. My boyfriend and I were shockingly appalled by how bad this movie really was. The premise was utterly ridicously unrealstic. Jason Bateman and his wife Kristin Bell announce to their friends via powerpoint that they are heading towards divorce. They believe that the only way to save their sinking ship of a relationship is to travel to some exoctic island to do couple therapy because apparently thats not available here in the states. They convinve their friends to join in on the Pelican Package which is a group discount package. ALthough all the couples have kids and jobs to tend to they drop everything and head to the beautiful island, all to ready  for some and fun. When they arrive they discover their friends have duped them. Pretty ironic!
I dont have enough patience to waste any more time reviewing this movie but I will say that I know so many people were excited to see this movie. It had as much hype as The Hangover surrounding it but it failed miserably to come through. what a terrible waste
