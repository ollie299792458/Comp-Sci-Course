I have to agree with most of Toshif's DVD review (March 27, 2001) of THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.  In terms of the script, acting, and the historical accuracy, it clearly is a better film than GLADIATOR.  The latter film clearly borrowed copiously from THE FALL, why was this not acknowledged?  Alec Guiness is wonderfully cast as emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.  His performance is far better than the rather weak performance of Richard Harris in the same role in GLADIATOR.  I would like to touch on another film that seems to owe something to THE FALL.  My young son, on seeing Marcus Aurelius making his first appearance exclaimed, "That's Obi-Wan Kenobi!"  It is true, even down to the costuming and beard, the resemblance of the two characters played by Alec Guiness is startling.  We then looked up the biography of Marcus Aurelius in the World Book Encyclopedia and were informed that the Stoic emperor believed that all mankind was bound together by a "universal force."  This cannot possibly be entirely coincidental!  Is Guiness' Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight, in the STAR WARS epics a reprise of his portrayal of Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher emperor of Rome?
