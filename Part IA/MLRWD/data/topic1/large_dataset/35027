I'm not sure if I'd have ever started watching Star Trek TNG if it wasn't for Patrick Stewart and his amazing performance in this movie.  How they ever got such an amazing actor to jump on board is beyond me but I'm very happy that he did.

When I watch or read a favorite movie or book, I tend to always skip sections to get to the part that was constantly replaying itself in my head over and over again all day.  In First Contact, I repeatedly jump to Patrick Stewart's "Moby Dick" scene where he passionately expresses his obsession with destroying the Borg.  It doesn't happen too often when an actor performs exactly how you'd like to express yourself in a way that you never realized might be in you.  I first saw this movie when I was young so it made a distinct impression on me when I saw it.  Been a Trekkie ever since.

I also thought James Cromwell played Zefram Cochran incredibly.  When he comments on the disparity between him and his future self to Commander Riker, it's just funny how life can turn out and that there is still hope for us all.  Without those two actors, the movie still would have been awesome but it would have just been another good movie but nothing you really had to watch over again.

So in my opinion, rent it if you must but it's definitely worth the $10.99.  By far the best movie from the TNG series and although I more often than not skip most of the movie to get to my favorite parts, I enjoy them enough to watch the movie in it's entirety once in a while.
