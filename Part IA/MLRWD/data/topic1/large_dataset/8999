about a week after I saw it.  There's something so arrogant and contrived about its sequences that you have to ask yourself "is this for real?" The answer, of course, is no. The whole film (as well as the book), in all its nonsense, is just a metaphor for a material society driven by impulse and self-gratification. You then realize that every scene portrays its characters as almost "characters" of themselves, polished and human-like "packages". Batemen, the most obvious, is basically the male distillation of everything that's reprehensible about human nature;  he's overly handsome, wealthy, resouceful and witty, and is part of unique Manhatten uptown clique.  What's interesting is how he represents the American Dream, everything that we secretly strive to be (or at least everything that the American culture leads us to believe is important), whether or not we know it;  the only difference being that he goes as far as to act out his impulses. So is Elliot saying that, we, as an audience, are suffocated by the American dream to the point where we have become numb under its spell, have become so lost in the process of obtaining status and material that we've lost touch with each other? That we've become selfish, self-centered, ego-maniacal performers in our own lives? That our conversations are hollow and superficial?  That our relationships are nothing more than devices built to enhance personal attainment? When we see Bateman, a reflection of our ideals, carry out ritualistic acts of violence, it come across as both disgusting and hilarious. I walked out of the theater feeling jipped, like I have been made fun of. And now, as I write this review, I am finally understanding that I, as an American, was being mocked. The second time I watched it I was even more humored by Bateman's dry and hammy performance. I agree that this movie is not for everyone, but watch it,  think about it,  give it a chance; the stuff on the screen is just a tool.
