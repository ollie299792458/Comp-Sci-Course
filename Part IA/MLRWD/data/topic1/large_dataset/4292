I'm a big Superman fan and I, of course, watched this movie when it first came out.  I recently have had the opportunity to watch it again.  It is  extremely cheesy, and some of the Special FX are suspect.  The story also  has many holes in it that are never filled.  However, in spite of all of  its faults, I would highly recommend aquiring this movie if you are a fan  of the Christopher Reeve franchise of Superman.  This movie is worth  owning, if for no other reason, because it's filmed with the same look and  feel of the Superman movies.  And well it should since the Salkind's did  this movie also.  Helen Slater does a great job in the role of Supergirl.  It isn't her fault that the story is so bad!  There is a flying scene early  in the movie that alone makes it worth owning.  So don't buy this movie if  you're looking for some great sci-fi classic!  Buy it; enjoy it; poke fun  of it.  It will bring back fuzzy warm memories of the good ole days when  Chris Reeve brought true dignity to the role of Superman.
