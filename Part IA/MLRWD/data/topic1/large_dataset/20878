An avid reader of comics for quite a while in my youth.  the X-Men was one of the titles I rabidly awaited every month.  When rumors started circulating that they were going to make a movie of the comic, I was a bit disappointed.
  Films from comics have not done well in the past, look at the film for "The Punisher".  Though the casting was fairly good for that one, it was not as good as it could have been.  Plus the fact that it was a character that was hard to like.  There have been a few more in recent years also that though they were pretty to watch for the special effects, they were hard to watch for the lack of story.
  Picture my amazement when I heard that Bryan Singer would direct the film.  Bryan Singer from "The Usual Suspects", and "Apt Pupil".  How was he going to make the move from gritty realism to that of a comic book world?
  He didn't have to!  As hard as it is for me to beleive, Bryan made a gritty, realistic, comic book movie, and it is great.  With a little help from the casting , and CGI departments, he made an exceptional film.
  Now we come to the point in the interview where comic fans may be disappointed.  The film does not follow any storyline from the comics, so don't get this expecting "The Dark Phoenix Saga" or some other story.  It is totally new.  Don't get me wrong, there are elements from throughout several arcs, but not enough to say that it is any one particular one.
  Still, any movie with a short, mean Canadian with claws that come out of his arms with a "SNIKT" sound can't be bad.  Buy it yourself and see.
