If you're like me, and most (or all) of your past exposure to Python has consisted of watching their films several times, then the experience of the Python TV series might puzzle you a bit. This is not to say that you'll be disappointed, but rather that your (mostly American) expectations of some brand of NARRATIVE-driven comedy will be challenged. In the end, this is a good thing- and precisely the type of comedic revolution I imagine the troupe was shooting for when they conceived and wrote the shows.

As an American, I too was in love with the comfortable narratives that 99% of visual comedy subscribe to. Though the Python films follow some sort of loose narratives in their films, the TV series throws all of this conventional grammar out the window. If you are looking for Simpsons-esque punchlines or the predictable situations of Seinfeld, look elsewhere. However, if you want to experience "Wuthering Heights in Semaphore", this is your bag. Be forewarned: Getting used to this style of comedy is NOT easy, and you may spend the first several episodes in incredulous silence. Your brain will have to slowly acclimatize, but the pay off is worth it. If you're a fan of other Brit-comedy then you probably don't have to worry so much. But if your an interested neophyte, I would advise you to take the plunge.

ALSO: In order to warm you up, I would HIGHLY recommend watching the recent multi-part documentary on group. Very, very good.
