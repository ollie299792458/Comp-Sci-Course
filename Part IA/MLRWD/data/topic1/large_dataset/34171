If I were stranded on a desert island with a working VCR and could only have one film, this would be it!  Gaggingly hysterical lampoon has Margaret Dumont offering financial aid to her country, Freedonia, only if Groucho is  appointed leader.  He takes control and Freedonia grinds to a halt as rival  Sylvania plans to overrun it subversely by Ambassador Trentino's love  appeals to Dumont!  Zeppo gets wind of this, plots with Groucho to goad  Trentino, who will strike Groucho and he declares war.  Feedonia good,  Sylvania bad.  Great plan, only Groucho gets Trentino to insult  "him" (with the term "upstart" of all things) and  Groucho declares war! It's insane tom-foolery unparalleled!  Chico and  Harpo have several low paying jobs starting as Sylvanian spies against  Groucho ("You give us a pixchure of this man and say follow him? Well  we lose-a da pixchure!"); peanut vendors outside the Fredonian palace  (dueling with the late, great Edgar Kennedy over lemonade, peanuts and hats  -- this gets so surreal you'll spit up laughing); and ultimately Harpo is  Groucho's driver ("This is the fifth trip I've made today and I  haven't been anywhere yet!") and Chico becomes Secretary of War  ("I say we have a standing army - that way we save money on  chairs."). It is the unabashed visual and verbal commentary on the  senselessness of war that just shines in this, however (look for Chico to  punch the timeclock as he enters the war and Groucho's brilliant retort to  Trentino's stopping the war: "It's too late, I've already paid a  month's rent on the battlefield.")  Priceless, timeless and always  watchable. If there is one sour note, it is the sensitivity of our time  colliding with the insensivity of the 30's with the "darkies"  comment.  Ignore it.  I do.
