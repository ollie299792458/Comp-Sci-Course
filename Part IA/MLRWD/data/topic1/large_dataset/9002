School of Rock is a loudly amusing good time that parents will enjoy as much as their children. Director Richard Linklater (Dazed and Confused, Waking Life) in association with Paramount Pictures have put together a film that will have you rooting for its' anti-hero Dewey Finn (Jack Black) to "overcome the Man" and succeed in his quest for rock and roll recognition.  
Dewey, a rock star wannabe, finds himself kicked out of the band that he started and about to be kicked out of his apartment, when lady luck steps in and offers him an opportunity to get things back on track again.  This opportunity comes in the form of having to pretend that he's his roommate Ned Schneebly (Mike White) in order to take a job as a substitute teacher at a prestigious boarding school.  After duping the concerned principle (Joan Cusack), he is allowed to take over a classroom of fifth graders.  Finding himself ill prepared for the position, he shows no interest in teaching the kids until one day he finds that many are accomplished musicians.  This discovery leads him towards the possibility of creating a new band from them that will help him to gain the elusive award given at a battle of the bands competition that he so richly desires.  This is where the real fun begins as he takes on teaching his new curriculum Music 111: "All Things that Rock" to a less than interested bunch of kids.
This film merits four out of five stars.  This rating comes from the film's ability to instill a breath of fresh air to the comedy genre due to its' unique subject matter.  Mike White also deserves special credit for writing a script that allows Jack Black to display his range of comedic and musical skills.  Lastly, one can not overlook the contributions from the class of fifth graders, who at many times steal the scenes from the main characters.
