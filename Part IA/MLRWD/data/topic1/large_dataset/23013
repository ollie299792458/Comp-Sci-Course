Q, the Winged Serpent was one of the worst movies I have even seen. I went into the film knowing it was a "B movie", but still wanting to be entertained. I was not entertained.

For a 1982 film, the gore in Q, the Winged Serpent, probably shocked quite a few people. There is also a [...] scene that is quite enticing. But aside from these two points of note, the film offered little else, including entertainment.

The acting was passable, but of course with such a dull story and script to flesh out, the OK acting goes to waste.

Save your money. This is one of the worst movies ever made. There are far better B movies. It is the type of movie I would have liked in college in 1987, if I had been drunk and looking for laughs. But this is 2006, and there are better bad movies with better gore and nudity. You won't like Q, the Winged Serpent, at all. Even for the drunk college student, there are far better ways to spend 90 minutes. Stay away.
