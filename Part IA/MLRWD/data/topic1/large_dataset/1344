6 DVD's containing all episodes of season 1 plus a 7th DVD for the PC containing a screensaver, cast/director bio/info, Xena trivia and a list of character names for season one. Comes in a folding 7-part sleeve so there are no individial DVD cases in the set - just one long foldout. Current sets are issued with a silver season one collectible coin with a mailer that's included for a free coin holder (you pay $... P/H). Nice pictures on the foldout sleeves - packaging is very nice. DVD 1 contains a still gallery although I haven't yet checked the others in the set.
I have to question the video quality on this set - it appears to be a bit grainy and it most noticable during very dark/black scenes. I have never noticed this with other DVD's played on my Toshiba DVD player, though you may want to consult with other owners regarding picture quality (DVD player and TV type does make a difference). I tried it on two DVD players and two TV sets and the picture quality is simply grainy, more so than the season 5 video set I own.
  Sound quality is acceptible although disc 1 sounds a bit "dull" so far. Digital surround sound (not the "fake" 3D surround sound) mode seems to sound the crispest. There is no 5.1, no DTS 5.1, so the standard 2.0 Dolby Digital is offered as with all region 1 DVD's. (My home theatre system is new to me so I only hope that I have read the information correctly from my system display.)
  Still, this beats rewinding/forwarding through VHS tapes. For the price it's worth the format alone. Otherwise, I would have given 5 stars to this set... Enjoy Xena!
