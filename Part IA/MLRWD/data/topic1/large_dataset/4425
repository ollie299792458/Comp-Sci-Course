We have spent many years in recovery from the film code of 1932. It forever established that sex was dirty and should be relegated to the realm of porn in order to preserve community values. While today's mainstream filmmakers routinely deal with explicit sexuality, it is usually done with a heavy hand.  This films use of real sexual encounters in a FUN context is to be applauded. It shows that sex can be at least as enjoyable as a good comedy and doesn't have to be loaded down with adolescent angst. We do all get to grow up one day don't we? SO, WHY DID I RATE THIS WITH ONLY TWO STARS??

 I can only assume that this DVD got such good reviews because the first copies that were distributed were created with a decent grade of DVD. That is no longer the case. The copy I received was not only produced on the thinnest DVD that I have ever seen, but it was scraped up so badly that it will only play on one of my machines. The damage was done to the copy before it was packaged as the packaging was in perfect shape. Unfortunately I lost my Amazon receipt prior to opening it and can't return the copy. If you dare to buy a copy of this film, keep your return papers handy! Hopefully if enough people complain the producer will upgrade the DVD quality.
