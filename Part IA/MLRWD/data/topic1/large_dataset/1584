This was extremely true to the book ( the book is filled with even more detailed gruesome descriptions, as if conditions could get worse than presented in the movie!) and showcases the talents of two of the most accomplished character actors of the 20th century. A very young Dustin Hoffman and Steve Mc Queen are paired for an action based true story of life in the WORST notorious prison ever to exist in the civilized world.  French Guiana, also known as DEVIL'S ISLAND, housed criminals from 1852 to 1951 with the conditions literally unchanged throughout that time span.

"Pappillion" french for butterfly, was given this nickname for his large tattoo of one.  He was incarcerated for the alleged murder of a pimp and spent from 1931-1944 in and out of this horrific prison, 2 years of it in solitary confinement (aptly nicknamed "the devourer of men"). It depicts a slice of man's unbelievable capacity for cruelty to one another

This movie is the moving and incredible story of Pappillion's many attempts to escape and the people who aided and thwarted his attempts. If you liked "Les Miserable", "The Birdman of Alcatraz", "The Rock" and "Midnight Express" this is the movie for you.  If you have ever spent ANY TIME CONFINED in a jail, restrained , or detained by the law for any reason, you would benefit from seeing this movie. It is inspiring on a mental, physical and especially emotionally level.  At times, heartbreaking, and humorous it is ultimately a story of man's triumph over adversity. See the movie (read the book!) it is entertaining for it's level of acting and it's adventurous and twisting plot as well as it's riveting exotic scenic locations. Surprise ending!!!
