"If you tell a joke and it isn't funny and you put a laugh track under it it still isn't going to be funny." -Robin Williams (as Tom Dobbs in Man of the Year)

In a momentary lapse of judgement I rented this from a redbox. I knew  with Robin Williams as the lead that I was taking a risk but I thought that the prescence of Chris Walken could maybe redeem the movie. Besides I figured even if it wasn't that great it would only be a dollar investment. Today I sit in quiet reflection over what i must boldly state is the worst movie ever.

I watched this with some friends and never once during the movie did I hear the sounds of laughter. Just uncomfortable, embarassed, awkward silence as Tom Dobbs (Williams) threw out zinger after zinger, perhaps hoping that the sheer volume of terrible jokes could compensate for the incoherent story line. But it was all in vain. Much to my dismay the movie actually continued after the election and turned into a "thriller" about a big business trying to kill an employee with a shocking secret. Now let me tell you a secret, this movie is not funny and not thrilling it's just old fashioned terrible.
