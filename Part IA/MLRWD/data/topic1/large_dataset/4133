The rest of the reviews for "Cannibal Holocaust" presented here will give you a pretty good example of what to expect from this film. So, I'm just adding my two cents from an alternative perspective.

I won't go into the gratuitous nature of the violence, since I've always felt such a statement is redundant when it comes to horror films anyway. That being said, the on-screen killing of animals, even if they are consumed afterward, seems even more pointless than the litany of violence normally associated with these types of horror films. The cannibal sub-genre that had its heyday in the late 70s was known for pandering purely to exploitation and grotesque imagery, rather than for suspense or terror. Don't mistake "Cannibal Holocaust" for a frightening film.

As a fan of the horror genre, I've seen a wide variety of fictional human deaths, and so the gore and violence of "Cannibal Holocaust" didn't impact me terribly. There have been, for me, more disturbing "people being eaten" scenes amongst the zombie sub-genre. After reading so much about the supposedly visceral nature of the violence, I felt it to be competently portrayed but nothing to write home about. When characters you've developed an affection for are killed in a film, with or without gore, you feel a twinge. When so many nameless victims are disposed of, the reaction devolves into "meh... nice special effects".

Ultimately, what disturbed me most about "Cannibal Holocaust" was that, with the exception of one male at the end, the most brutal violence is reserved soley for women. Several rapes, the forced abortion, and a variety of brutal deaths are visited upon the female natives while the men are occasionally shot or beaten, but not subjected to the level degradation aimed at female characters. By the end of the film, it was this fact that left me sick at having "experienced" "Cannibal Holocaust".
