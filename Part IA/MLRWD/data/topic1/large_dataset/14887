I thought I knew all there was to know about global warming and the environmental crisis, but this movie gave me a new perspective on the subject. It was quite inspiring. I just graduated undergrad with a BFA in Visual Arts and planning on going to grad school for architecture. Also, as I've grown up in Buras, LA at the mouth of the Mississippi River, I feel like I can make a difference for my community. But you don't need to have an architecture degree to make a change for the better, all you need to do is make the conscious decision that you will make more environmentally friendly choices. The statistics are quite interesting as well. One part mentioned how much it would cost to create a machine that'll do what nature already does for us for free (turning carbon dioxide into oxygen, etc.) And they also make it clear that we don't have to drop all our technology and become hunter gatherers wearing animal skins and holding spears again. We just have to redesign our technology to be more environmentally friendly. We have the minds and resources to do so, too. Watch this movie, it's only $5 and even comes in an environmentally friendly paper cover.
