This was an entertaining and comprehensive retelling of The Door's history - accompanied by some of the best music ever recorded.  It was also narrated by Johnny Depp, and who doesn't love that?  My chief complaint had to be the cutaways to the fake Jim.  If you've seen the film already, you know what I'm talking about.  They served no real purpose and were annoying enough to detract from what was otherwise a great film.

It is great to see so Jim's legacy resurrected for modern audiences.  I know that a lot of my Kid's friends don't even know who he is, let alone the massive contributions he has made to music and art.  (MY kids know who he is though - I began their musical education's early on LOL.)

If you want to play a part in making sure that Jim's memory stays strong, you should check out [...].  The Jim Morrison Project is a site and cause devoted to preserving Jim's memory and promoting the art community in his hometown of Melbourne, Florida.  If you have never heard of it, you should take some time to check it out and spread the word.  The site's official launch is on Jim's 69th birthday - which is December 8, 2012 for those of you who don't know.  Even if you don't live in the local area, the site is collecting donations for a private Jim Morrison memorial to be built locally, which is something any fan of Jim and/or The Doors should want to see accomplished.
