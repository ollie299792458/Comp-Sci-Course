Received the blu-ray extended edition from Amazon.ca (Canada) on Nov. 25th.  Pre ordered in September.  This is likely the same product that will be shipped in the States as the sticker on the front mentions over 2 hours of additional footage not seen in the US.  The back of the box states that "this complete version of the international hit series restores notable characters and subplots, most significantly in the portrayal of Erika Berger".

Each movie is on its own disc, and split between Part 1 and 2 for each movie.  I assume that is how it was shown on Swedish TV.  I've never seen the movie versions so I can't tell what the differences are in content.

All 3 features are available with the original Swedish language with English subtitles or an English language version.

The fourth disc has the special features and is 2 hrs, 2 minutes long.  It includes a 53 minute documentary detailing the phenomenon of the Dragon Tattoo trilogy and the personal history of Stieg Larsson.

I've only watched the first disc and enjoyed it very much.  Can't wait to watch the rest!
