I watched this movie in my English class (12th grade). It is a very emotional movie - sometimes a little too emotional but in general you can say that it reaches the audience. What I like is that everyone will think about the movie after watching it regardless of his opinion about the death penalty. Dead Man Walking definitely sticks to your memory.
By using flashbacks throughout the movie, Tim Robbins created a  movie that is shifting between reality, imagination and the past history of the plot. The flashbacks are very well used to show the thoughts and impressions that Sister Helen has about Matt. Matthew Poncelet is like a puzzle - the more you see of him during the movie the clearer becomes the image of his character. However, it is left to the viewer whether it comes out to a positive or negative image.
This movie is unique because it shows another kind of `hero' than the usual brutal heroes that are  presented in every other Hollywood movie.
However, there are a few points to critisize about it:
First of all the story is a little bit overloaded with religious elements - especially in the end. This is kind of a black-and-white portrayal of the fact that religion or christianity is the only way to receive redemption.
Another point of criticism are the rather heavy accents of the protagonist that made it almost imposible to understand the movie just by listening to the dialogs. However, I don't want to blame the movie for it - at least not entirely since my problems in understanding could also be a result of my personal inability. ;-)
All in all I recommend this movie since it is extremely famous and you must have seen it!!
