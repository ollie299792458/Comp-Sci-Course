This movie could have been so much better than it was. Not sure why so many people gave this movie such high praise.  I guess they were not sober while watching it.  The first third of the movie held my attention and although it was very similar to 28 days/weeks, the angle was different and interesting and had you wanting to know what the hell the signal was.

The second part of film was utter nonesense and a waste of time. It was trying too hard to be a horror comedy like "The Cottage."  It was so predictible.  Yawn.  Anyone that likes this part of the movie, has obviously not seen enough horror comedy movies (Shaun of the Dead) because this part was not original in the slightest and not worth watching at all.

The third part felt misplaced, as if this director wanted it to be genius like "Memento" or something.  Sorry, it just wasn't working.  In the end, the Signal was meaningless.  The Movie never told you where the signal came from, why it existed, or why should we care?

I really wanted to like this moving, especailly since the begining was rather good, but I can't in good consicous recommend this film.  You would be better served to rent the individual DVDs of 28 Weeks Later, The Cottage or Shaun of the Dead, and Memento on their own.
