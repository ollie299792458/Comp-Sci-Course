This was, without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Saw a preview on TV one day and had to wait about 4 months for it to come to the theater.  Well worth the wait, I can say.
Everybody is offering their review, and thankfully, most are positive.  However, there was one particular scene that just had me.  It's when George, realizing his fame and fortune are near an end, and he is sitting in his living room looking out the window, and it's raining.  The camera angle has his face, and the raindrops that are falling down from the windows reflect on his face, and it looks as though he is crying.  Incredible!  This is what great filmmaking is all about.  I thought the acting was superb, and even the extras in the film were terrific.  When the dog has to run to the cop for help, notice the lady standing on the corner.  She reminds me of everybody's aunt, and she has that "look" about her that was just terrific.  Go see this wonderful film, and I, for one, cannot wait until it arrives at my home in a few weeks.  I will watch it over and over, because it's one of those rare, excellent films that allow you to savor them again and again.
