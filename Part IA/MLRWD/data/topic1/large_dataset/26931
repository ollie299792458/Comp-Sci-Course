I'm a man, 45.  After using this for over a year now, I say honestly that this is my best and favorite dance workout DVD, so much so that I wore it out and considering buying another new copy.  I strongly feel some people are dismissing this DVD too soon.  Granted, the moves are a bit challenging, but you CAN master them using the "rewind" button on your DVD and a bit of patience and determination.

Once mastered, these routine WILL give you years of quality exercise enjoyment AND learn some usable, impressive and funky dance moves to boot.  At dance parties these days, people call on me to lead them.  Most of my moves that impress them the most are from this DVD.  All this makes this the most valuable DVD for me.

Some have said that they don't sweat using this DVD.  WHAT????!!!  I don't know.  Perhaps they are super-athletes or something.  This makes me sweat plenty.  You can always adjust the intensity of the moves once you have learned them well.  Too, recently, after having memorized the routines, I just dance these routines to my favorite dance songs (faster in tempo).  That REALLY pumps up the intensity.  So, be creative with it.  This has been the most scientific and methodical dance workout dvd for me.

Well, now that I'm hooked on dance workout, I'll move on to see what else is out there.  But this DVD is going to be my home base for years to come.
