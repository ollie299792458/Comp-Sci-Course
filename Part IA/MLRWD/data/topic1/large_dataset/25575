I am happy with my purchase of the Blu ray version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  Although the reviews it received when it was in the theaters were not very good, it is still an entertaining adventure movie, with a interesting premise -- set in the late 19th century and getting together some of the most famous/infamous fictional heros of the time.

The quality of the blu ray transfer is excellent (5 stars).  The pictures are crisp and the sound was clear -- just like it was in the movie theatre.

The movie does not live up to its full potential.  While it is exciting to see these characters together, and the actors were all fairly good, they do not seem to develop enough relationship with one another. The plot starts well, but the ending is predictable.

Nonetheless, I showed this movie to relatives who had not seen it before and they enjoyed it and decided to add it to their own DVD collection.  I believe the movie is underrated, and many were deterred because of the poor initial reviews.
