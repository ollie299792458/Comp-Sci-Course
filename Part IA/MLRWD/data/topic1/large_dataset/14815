The Green Mile is a wonderful movie.  It weaves comedy and sadness beautifully.  The emotions are portrayed brilliantly, especially by Micheal Clark Duncan (is that his name....I'm drawing a blank) who plays John, and  he is awesome.
Yes, the movie is long, but it is one of the only long  shows that went by in what seemed like an hour and a half.
This isn't one  of your usual Stephen King movies, it has less "horror" and gory  "violence."  What it does have is a powerful and moving story  that stays with you.  The pain felt by the (sometimes cowardly) characters  is felt by you as well; a result of good acting.
But what was lacking?  I  don't know, exactly.  The story is funny, sad, interesting...but it was  just weird having a drama with a little magic and so much drama and comedy.  I would usually enjoy weirdly-combined emotions, but they didn't quite  pull that mix off....but VERY close!
Nevertheless, The Green Mile is a  film that is DEFINATELY NOT TO MISS!  Enjoy!
