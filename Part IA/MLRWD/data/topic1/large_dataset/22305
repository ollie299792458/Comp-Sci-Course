Most might think my two-and-half rating is quite scathing and therefore, think poorly of this film right off the bat. However, don't be too discouraged. "Couples Retreat" isn't all that bad. However, it's not noticeable either. The cast is all great with the exception of Kali Hawk, whose role could've honestly been played by any up-and-comer young pretty thing actress. I enjoyed the other Vince Vaughn-Jon Favreau vehicle <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CTA1UM">Four Christmases</a> more than this one.

The concept and structure of the story felt all too "sitcom special-goes-to-Hawaii," with each couple's problems magically getting resolved within one vacation. And although I could see a pair like Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl (in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TZJBQ0">Knocked Up - Unrated (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>) as a couple, the pairing of Vaughn and Malin Akerman seemed a little too unbelievable to me. I know Vaughn's a funny guy and all (I'd love to hang out with the guy), but it felt a bit too plotted and not real. Then again, this is a movie!

Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell shine as actors but are annoying as a couple who I would dread if I was friends with them in real life. This movie is enjoyable enough for those who enjoy nice, little romantic comedies, but it shouldn't be at the top of their queue to view. Instead, catch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OQCUZM">Ghosts of Girlfriends Past</a> (MUCH better!) or even treat yourself to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG99UE">Valentine's Day</a>.
