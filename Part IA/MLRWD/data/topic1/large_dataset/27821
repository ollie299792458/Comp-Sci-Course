I enjoyed the sharp contrast between the characters of Nelson (played by Keanu Reeves) and Sarah (played by Charlize Theron). I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves and watched this movie after seeing him in "Something's Gotta Give". I just had to see him in a romantic role.

Some of my favorite scenes in the movie occur when Sarah and Nelson first meet. She spends the first half of the movie pursuing him and he spends the last half pursing her. At first, Reeves' character seems very unlikeable -- almost wooden. As the movie progresses, Sarah's magic seems to wake up the workaholic from a deep sleep.

There is a scene where Sarah and Nelson stand in the rain. It reminded me of the fight scenes from the Matrix Revolutions.

In the DVD version when he is interviewed, Keanu states something to the affect that he is Nelson, and that he has met plenty of Sarah's in his life but they never called him back. Something else to watch -- Keanu loves motorcyles, and Nelson's office at the ad agency is decorated with photos of motorcycles. I wonder if he had any say in the decor...

Overall, I enjoyed the movie but it is not my favorite. There could have been more chemistry between the characters. I was a little shocked to see one of the characters in a dress but it works. I won't spoil the plot but this movie will make you cry...and also wonder why we can't enjoy life as much as Sarah.
