When a director can have the actors and cameras tell a story over about 20 minutes without a word... you have a classic.

Such is the scene that starts in the museum with Angie Dickinson being cruised, then cruising, then being picked up and taken away. She wakens in the morning, finds out a secret, leaves and is then killed horribly. It is rare that you will see all that take place and not a word is spoken by any of the principal actors.

The movie shifts gears after that and the cat is after the mouse.

Technology that was available at the time is brought into use. DePalma's use of split screens and camera angels keeps the movie going along. Nancy Allen plays a role she plays well... a hooker. But one of the principal actors here.

I would say that this is DePalma's second best movie. His best is without a doubt 'Body Double'.

Sure, they're both a lot like hitchcock. But that's okay. I liked hitchcock and I'm glad to see somebody making films so close to his you sometimes cannot tell the difference.

Speaking of body double, I understand that the making of that film was as a result of the criticism that DePalma and Dickinson recieved for the use of a body double in this movie. Interesting.
