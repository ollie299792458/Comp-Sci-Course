In this movie Manncio plays the part as Daniel Laruso. In the beginning Daniel meets this very attractive girl named Ali(Pat Motina).  Also Daniel  had a problem with Lawrence Ali's ex-boyfriend and his Kobra-kais. the  teacher in this movie is a very strict guy his saying is "First hit,  hard hit, and no mercy". This "gang" tries to ruin his life  until Maccnio meets up with Miyagi a handy man at his Apartments. When  Miyagi saves Daniel from one of their beatings Daniel asks him why he  didn't tell him earlier that he knew Karate. Daniel asks him if he could  teach him the art of karate. Miyagi teaches Daniel(Manncio) the art of  Karate. Daniel learns a very special move called the "Krane".  Miyagi teaches him by the method "Wax on Wax off" and "Paint  the Fence". In addition to this Miyagi teaches him how to keep his  balance, how to punch, and also to kick. Then, the fight is on. In the  competition Daniel goes through everybody and then faces Lawrence for  the
championship. The "Krane" proved to be helpful in this  match with Lawrence but Daniel is still sucsessful. Daniel uses Karate  against the Lawrence to beat him at his own game. For people who like  Karate this would be a very interesting movie. I would give it three thumbs  up. (If I had three.)
