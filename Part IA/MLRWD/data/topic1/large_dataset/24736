Whip It is a movie based on the book Derby Girl by Shauna Cross. It revolves around the main character Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page), a meek teenage girl trying to find herself. It is set in Bodeen and Austin, Texas. Along with Bliss there is her mother (Marcia Gay Harden), who is very conservative and beauty pageant  obsessed; her father (Daniel Stern) who is supportive of his girls, but still wishes he had a boy to play football; and Pash (Alia Shawkat) who is Bliss' only friend.

Bliss' life mostly consists of working at the local Oink Joint restaurant with Pash, going to school, and the beauty pageants her mother forces her to do. That all changes when on a shopping trip to Austin with her mom when she finds a flyer for a roller derby bout. She and Pash decided to check it out and afterward Bliss wants more. She ends up talking to one of the girls on the Hurl Scouts team and she tells Bliss about try outs, however you need to be 21 and Bliss is only 17. She lies about her age and decides to try out, unbeknownst to her parents, at the next recruitment session and makes it onto the Hurl Scouts team. The Hurl Scouts are the worst team in the league and made up of Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig), Smashley Simpson (Drew Barrymore), Bloody Holly (Zoe Bell), Rosa Sparks (Eve), and the Manson sisters (Kristen Adolfi and Rachel Piplica). Also, there's Razor (Andrew Wilson) The Hurl Scouts coach, `Hot Tub' Johnny Rocket (Jimmy Fallon) the MC at all the derby bouts, and Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis) of the Holy Rollers, the Hurl Scouts rivals.
