This movie is a monumental classic within the genre of Westerns, but it would be a classic regardless of any genre whatever. Previous reviewers have pointed out correctly the greatness of its stars, plot, editing, background music, and various other elements. They have also pointed out that it is never boring, in spite of its length. One of the main factors which holds us almost spellbound is the tightness of the plot and the unity achieved throughout in bringing out the various subplots and themes, which are numerous, namely: 1) the errors in judgment people make when jumping to conclusions and prejudging according to appearances, 2) violence in human relationships rarely produces anything good, 3) the importance of maintaining one's personal integrity, regardless of status in life, 4) the destructive nature of hatred, etc.  There is also a number of ironic twists in the movie which contribute greatly to its realism.

The technical aspects of the movie are impeccable, the acting all around is superb, and the background music has gained worldwide renown.

Grade: A+
