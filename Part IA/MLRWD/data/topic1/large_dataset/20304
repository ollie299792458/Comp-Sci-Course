I was never lucky enough to catch "Chorus Line" on the stage and found the movie so-so.  This docu certainly changed my perception of the essence of what Chorus Line was conveying to its audience and maybe with me being an ardent, almost fanatical, fan of the dance series 'So You Think You Can Dance' I've come to appreciate just how very hard these dancers have to work to develop their talent for their place in the sun.  I was fascinated how the stage play came about ie. as a result of true life stories of aspiring dancers, inserts that were taken from taped interviews over a period of 24 hours and around these song and dance numbers were formulated and brought to the stage.  Moving 3 decades on, the movie goes through the trauma (eight months of call backs)of auditioning and a further 8 months to bring it a revival back to Broadway . . . what tenacity that must take !

Most touching scene is the auditioning scene with the vulnerable youth bringing to tears the entire auditioning audience when he described how his debut stage appearance as a drag artist first shocked his attending-the-show parents, with his father, after the show, telling the producer of the show "to look after my son" - the very first acceptance of him as such.

For all lovers of stage musicals this docu is a must.
