I only recently watched this movie for the first time and found it to be a wonderful tale, although a different departure for Disney. I have read the books, The Chronicles of Prydain, and count them as being one of the best fantasy series' ever written. This movie is called The Black Cauldron but is really a combination of that book and The Book of Three. However I'm not going to sit here and compare the movie to the books. That would be a travesty.

To begin, the animation of this film is simpley breathtaking. This was the most expensive animated film of its era and it is definitely noticeable. The juxtaposition of color and darkness bring an eerie feeling of happiness mixed with foreboding and dread.

Also, the Horned King is one of the greatest Disney villians of all time and definitely one of the more memorable. Although it is true that we should see more of him to get a sense of who he is, he is one scary dude. I wouldn't want to venture into his castle either, thank you very much.

Taran as a hero is mediocre at best. However the heart of the film lies with Gurgi as a faithful friend who riskes it all for his buddies and "crunchings and munchings." Flewdurr Flam is a good character as well. Princess Eilonwy is somewhat forgettable.

I feel that this film should deserve more credit than it has received, although parents should be cautious before letting their young children view it. I'm hoping a new generation of Disney lovers will rediscover this lost gem.
