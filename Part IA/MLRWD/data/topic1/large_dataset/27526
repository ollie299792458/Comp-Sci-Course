Corman's movies always seem to have an element of humour to them and piranha is no exception.  You could really sit down with a few friends over some beers and have a good laugh at this.  Although, the fact that children get nibbled on is somewhat foul play in my opinion.  Any head to head caparison with the Jaws movies is unnecessary.  For one thing, this movie does not take itself anywhere near as seriously as Jaws.  The production values are much lower and the budget was obviously far more constrained.  However the acting is spirited and key actor Branford Dillman is a poor man's Burt Reynolds on steroids - escaping from small town cops and turning on a "dukes of hazard" style driving display.  This is all good fun and looking at many of today's movies there should be more of it.  The movie has plenty of shots of half eaten people and bodyparts flashing past the lens, but nothing substantial enough to be considered high on gore.  The suspense has been all but removed with the passage of time and you tend to look forward to the next attack as a highlight of the movie anyway.  Nudity consists of a pair of breasts in the opening scene so nothing to get too excited about on that front either.  Overall, I say that this is one of Corman's tamer more mainstream efforts.
