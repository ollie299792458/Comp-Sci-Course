Ridley Scott made his feature film directorial debut with this project which focuses on two Napoleonic era soldiers of different social status who have a fued that lasts 15 years.

It is adapted from a Joseph Conrad novel.

Unlike many other costume dramas this one is suprisingly intimate and small in scope.  It isn't some four hour sweeping epic that costs an arm and a leg, instead we are treated to a very relaxing film that is one of the most beautifully shot of its era.  The Duellists reminds me of wonderful still life oil paintings, and that is further imprinted in my mind with the setting and Scott's exhausting attention to period detail.

Harvey Keitel and Keith Carradine aren't the kind of actors one would imagine for these roles, but they don't hurt the film at all, if you are a fan of period pieces or beautiful visuals or a Ridley Scott fan I strongly recommend this.  I especially speak to the film geeks and hipsters out there that may have slipped by this one.
