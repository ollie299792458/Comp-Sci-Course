Taking place in a hotel this movie is about Ted the bell boys experience working alone on New Years Eve with four different rooms occupied by some rather eccentric guests, each room directed by a different director.

I wont go into a description of each room, its been done a few times already but I must admit the first two rooms were moderately funny if not slightly boring but if your like me dont let it discourage you give the movie a chance. The last two rooms are in my opinion worth the wait completely, in fact I went out and bought the dvd after renting it because of them, movies dont often make me cry from laughter. Tim Roth is an amazing actor in basically everything he is in but his expression and movement alone was enough to make me laugh. Apart from him Antonio Banderas and Quentin Tarantino were both exceedingly funny in this move, Banderas especially his room is by far the most hilarious. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Tim, Antonio or Quentin and to people who just generally laugh easily at stupid or random things.
