The 20th Century was blessed, not only because it produced some of the greatest tenor voices, but what is more important, the recording technology that preserves them.  In truth, previous centuries might have had equally fine tenors - or sopranos, basses, etc. - but we are limited to what we can now hear and judge by ourselves. Pavarotti, Domingo, and Carreras rise to the top in most lists of fine tenors, and this concert, held in Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles, is a prime example for why they enjoy such devotion and admiration.  Even though their other recorded concerts are perhaps equally fine, I give this one an edge; for my taste, they sang a varied selection of numbers: arias, show tunes, popular songs - and did so with flair, showmanship, and sheer joy. Even though some have noted that Jose Carreras was in decline, the truth is that you would not know it from this concert.  As Conductor, Zubin Mehta inspired the Los Angeles Symphony to play as well as any orchestra in the world could have played for this world-wide telecast.  Of interest to me was how the producer decided on the scenery and set designs for this event - that came out in the added DVD features which detail the planning for this concert.  In brief, as a fan of these tenors, I possess every one of their recorded concerts, but if you can only own one, make it this one.
