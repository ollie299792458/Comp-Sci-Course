I've not seen anything like "Fargo".It is a very quirky black comedy.Exceptional way of telling a true story.
The plot is about how Jerry Lundegaard(William H. Macy) planned a kidnapping scheme(of his wife) to get money from his father-in-law. However things got complicated when everything didn't went according to his plan,tragic struck and blood shed... 
Frances McDormand is flawless as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief in charge of this case. She's no ordinary police,she has her special ways of investigating this case. It's amazing to watch her portray. She gave a stunning and idiosyncratic performance and totally deserved her Oscar.
One of the best black comedy screenplay even written.  It have all the elements which combined into a great winning formula. Classic black comedy with touches of drama,comedy,violence,suspense,etc... 
All characters seem eccentric and Coen brothers did a brilliant script which filled with unexpected lines and wacky emotions and reaction by a great group of talented actors like Steve Buscemi as one of the 'funny-looking'kidnapper,William H. Macy,Peter Stormare etc.
This movie is so unpredictable and full of surprises and totally worth the time and money.
