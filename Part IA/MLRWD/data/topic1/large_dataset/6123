I started reading the Inu Yasha graphic novels (manga) this year because I fell in love with Ranma 1/2 when I was in college ten years ago and I needed a good comic book fix. (I dig both American and Japanese comics, but I'm not an obsessive collector of either.) After getting hooked on the Inu Yasha books, I started renting the anime DVDs. (I understand that at least one cable network airs the show on TV, but I don't have cable.)
Both the manga books and the anime series are fantastic, a brilliant blend of adventure and humor which anyone can appreciate. Though the premise did not seem as interesting as Ranma initially (hard to beat THAT premise), more depth was revealed as the story progressed. I thought nothing could match my affection for Ranma, but I must give Inu Yasha equal footing.
And though I generally prefer books to videos, these Inu Yasha DVDs are every bit as good as the books. I love the vivid colors, and the English-language voice actors were well-chosen. (I freely admit that I have not seen the Japanese version, nor would I understand it.)
I have read other manga and seen other anime, some of it truly great. But I'm beginning to think nothing will surpass my love for Rumiko Takahashi's creations. They have universal appeal.
(If you're looking for other comic books with universal appeal, check out Osamu Tezaka's "Buddha" series. Sweet without descending into schmaltzy sentimentalism, this is truly a treasure for our time. The plot weaves together the stories of many different characters while Tezuka weaves together the old mythology with some modern philosophical concerns, the serious ancient philosophy with occasional modern jokes and gags.)
