This is absolutely the worst 17th century movie I have ever seen.
Words cannot describe how much it revolted me.
They could do a better job if they would not try to make a film at all.
If halfway through the movie, the actors began to turn into lizards, it would not have surprised me.
Controlling the urge to vomit was hard to say the least.
As an armourer, reenactor, historian, and having studied the sword arts for more than two decades, I can honestly say that I believe in my own heart that Micky Mouse could have played the lead role and the little pigs could have been the Three Musketeers, which by the way, we do not even get to know the Musketeers in the movie, due to the focus being on superhuman acts of levitation and flight.
But if you must watch it, please bear in mind that this movie is pure fantasy when it comes to any historical value and I would not recommend it even to children if you ever want them to learn "real" storylines, from "real" books, based on "real" history.
