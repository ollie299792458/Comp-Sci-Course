I purchased this double feature a few years ago mainly for Lady Frankenstein and buried it away. Going through my DVD collection years later, I realized I never saw Tormented and decided to give it a viewing. The most interesting detail is that I did not fall asleep while viewing (must be all the coffee). The plot was pretty dull. Carlson kills his former jealous girlfriend at a lighthouse and is pursued by her ghost throughout the rest of the film. He is then plagued by cheesy special effects as he attempts to prepare for his wedding. Throw in some bribery and suspicious family members of the bride and you pretty much get the idea. Not many good laughs in this one except for a disembodied head yelling at the main character on occasion. Great idea for the DVD setup includes drive-in commercials and movie previews wedged between the two films. However, the image quality is poor, but for the cheap price it's not a bad deal. If you are just buying this for Lady Frankenstein, you may want to investigate other options.
