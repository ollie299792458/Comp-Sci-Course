The movie "Dirty Mary Crazy Mary" was the beginning of all car chase movies. It spawned the Smokey and the Bandit series, the Cannonball Run Series and all the rest. It is, by no means a cinematic masterpiece, but if you look at it for what it is-a low-budget drive in movie, it is among the best. Peter Fonda is not quite as wooden as usual, and Susan George is just the right mix of dumb and slutty blonde that makes this movie so enjoyable. I don't understand why Roddy McDowell(as the grocery store manager whose store gets robbed) was uncredited. Perhaps he thought the movie was so bad that he didn't want to be a part of it. But to those who have seen the movie many times, he is an integral part of the beginning, just as Vic Morrow is later on. Seems ironic that he wanted the helicopter to chase Larry, and he died jus a few years later in a helicopter accident on the set of The Twilight Zone Movie.

All in all, this is a very enjoyable movie and if you like car chase movies, this one is a must see, if just for that really cool Dodger Charger that they perish in.
