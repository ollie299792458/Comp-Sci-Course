A film about a young genius from an impoverished background who is helped by a damaged older man and how the relationship saves them both.  Sounds a little familiar?  
Yet although it is derivative of Good Will Hunting (also directed by Gus Van Sant) this movie really works for about the first 60-70 minutes.  The developing relationship between the recluse writer Forrester (Sean Connery) and Jamal (Robert Brown who, astonishingly, appears to have had no prior acting experience)is reasonably plausible, fascinating, touching, and sometimes quite funny.
There's also some nice interaction between Jamal and his family and friends.  Yeah, the Bronx depicted here is gentle fairy tale, but heck, it's a movie.
But then the boneheaded, obvious plot kicks in, full of contrived confict between the lead and F. Murray Abraham (playing the Teacher from Hell - the only thing missing is a moustache to twirl) involving a writing competition, accusations of plagiarism, and, Lord help us, a basketball championship.  The second half of this movie is just a complete train wreck, dissipating all the good feeling engendered by the first half.
So here's what you do.  Walk out/eject the cassette sometime just over the half-way point, about when Abrahams announces the writing competition.  Throttle your curiosity about how it'll all turn out.  You don't want to know.  Just walk away from it, remembering the fine performances by Connery, Brown and the actors playing his family and buddies.  Trust me, you'll have gotten everything there's to be had from this film.
And if you can't resist - well, I warned you.
