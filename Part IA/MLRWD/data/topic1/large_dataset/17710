After the first 15 minutes, I too thought this movie was over the edge in senseless violence and noise.  I thought, "What's so good about murdering someone to a background of Beethoven and "Singin in the Rain?" I decided I would rather go to sleep.  But I try to view all movies to the end, so I picked up where I left off two days later.  
This was a five star movie all the way.  The first 15 minutes sets-up everything.  It was like reading a thematic and philosophic concise novel which rooted for individual freedom and choice.  "Clockwork" was actually a pro-christian film (recall the priest opposition to the program).  It was a hurray for our society which is quite rare in a film that would be considered avant-garde.
And to counter the criticism of the apparel worn - That just added to the comedy for me.  The lodger who took over McDowell's room at his parents house.  Look at that belt around his abdomen then tell me you're not smiling.  The funked up clothes parallel's the brilliant funked up language.
6 stars if I could because I'm cured all right!
