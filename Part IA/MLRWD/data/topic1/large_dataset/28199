This is the best unintentional comedy of the year! I spent so much time rolling my eyes that it hurt. The movie has poor writing and bad dialog, not to mention horridly awful attempts at character development. Do not make a drinking game out of this someone will die of alcohol poisoning in less than 20 minutes.  I started chuckling when I saw the talking killer but I had a hard time breathing when the Borg Cube showed up along with matrix drones. Not to mention the "go on without me" and "we're not leaving you behind" speeches as well as the collapsing fortress.  This movie is so bad it is a laugh riot! The movie is pretty though. If the characters had SOME charisma or the action scenes had some emotional anchor it might have elevated this movie to being a bad flick.  It does have one thing over the bad action movies of the 80's ... It is quite pretty to look at. I am glad I bought this it was the funniest thing I have seen all year! I can't wait to show it to my friends. This thing takes bad writing to a whole new level.
