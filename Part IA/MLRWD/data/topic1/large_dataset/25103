I tuned in to this show on Showtime when it first aired.  I only paid for Showtime, so I could watch this show.  I quickly dumped Showtime when Stargate SG-1 switched to the Sci-Fi Channel.  
As for the episodes - beginning with Season 1, I felt it didn't have the best start with the emphasis on Sam being the female with the overreactive, defensive attitude, but that quickly faded.  The show grew to be one of my favorite shows.  This show just gets better and better, and I love that they pick up on previous story threads.  I was always a big Star Trek NG fan, but the characters' apparent amnesia sometimes after very emotionally charged previous episodes drove me bonkers.  These characters change and are affected by what they go through.  I love the story ideas, but the characters and their interactions really make the show.  
Although I was sad to see Daniel Jackson go for Season 6, Jonas Quinn was a great addition.  I wish he could some how have become a regular character (like having him on the Atlantis spin-off, but oh well) when they brought Daniel Jackson back.  My husband prefers Jonas Quinn to Daniel Jackson, but I love both of the characters and was kind of conflicted about Jonas leaving.  
Now, when are they going to release Season 7?  I've got to catch my husband up on this show since he didn't start watching until Season 5 was airing, and I want him to be able to have all the background before Stargate: Atlantis airs...
