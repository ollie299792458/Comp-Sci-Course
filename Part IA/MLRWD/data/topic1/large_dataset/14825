If there is a picture in this world that proves film is as great an art form as the novel, it is "Hud." Intricate, well layered, and ultimately heartbreaking, "Hud" is an American tragedy that easily merits comparison with Eugene O' Neil's New England dramas as it is a simple, yet profound contemplation of human nature. Though a tale of morality, "Hud" is at its core a eulogy to a bygone era of America's past, and devastating portrait of modern degeneration. The performances are nothing less than fantastic as the characters presented in "Hud" are all so well realized that their presences will haunt the viewer long after the screen fades to black. Paul Newman is at his best as the despicable title character, while Patricia Neal gives her most legendary performance as a rangy housekeeper. Equally brilliant are Melvyn Douglas whose character functions as the film's moral center, and the young Brandon de Wilde whose character serves as the innocent spectator to the story's tragedy.
Though the deserved winner of several Academy Awards, "Hud" has become somewhat of a forgotten masterpiece. If you have never seen this beautiful movie, go out and rent it now! I guarantee it will move you to tears!
