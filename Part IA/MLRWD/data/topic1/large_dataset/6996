Sydney White is a modern-day Snow White whose story unfolds on the campus of the college her deceased mother attended.  Sydney is a legacy pledge for her mother's sorority, but circumstances prevent her from becoming a "sister".  Instead, Sydney moves in with the "Seven Dorks" of "The Vortex" - the house that sucks in all of the losers!  These actors had me in tears because I was laughing so hard!  Each one beautifully portrayed one of the fairy tale dwarf personas.  The charming Prince (Matt Long, "Ghost Rider") even awakens the sleeping princess with a kiss.

Amanda Bynes was her usual comical self.  John Schneider is always a welcome addition to any screen.  Sara Paxton is outstanding as Rachel Witchburn.  Crystal Hunt, Jack Carpenter, Jeremy Howard, Adam Hendershott, Danny Strong, Samm Levine, Donte Bonner are an outstanding supporting cast.  Arnie Pantoja steals the show as the "Dopey"-est dork!  This was the sweetest family film!  Some sexual references and college party scenes make it appropriate for teenagers and older.  I can't wait for it to be available for purchase on DVD!
