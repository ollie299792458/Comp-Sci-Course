If you own any of the Evil Dead movies on DVD, then you know that Raimi and Campbell are the absolute best at the DVD Commentary.  
Like Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, Raimi and Campbell (along with Tapert) give you all the information, history, anecdotes, and stories behind just about every facet of the movie in the commentary.  In this DVD, Raimi and Tapert are on 1 commentary while Campbell is by himself on the other (with each pointing out how the other would probably tell a different story or hit on things a little bit better).  And typical of Raimi and Campbell, they seem to enjoy making fun of themselves and about how bad their movie was.
At any rate, Evil Dead is everything you would want if you are familiar with the series, and a pretty darn good horror flick nonetheless.
Get all the DVD's and enjoy the narratives that these great guys have given us.  No higher recommendation can be given on this or the other two movies for the DVD owner.  
Also....The insert was also missing from my DVD, and an email to Elite Entertainment quickly and politely solved that problem.
Hail to the King Baby!
