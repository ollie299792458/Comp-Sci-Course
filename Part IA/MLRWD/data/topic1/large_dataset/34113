European Cinema was the first to release THE BEYOND on DVD.  Then Anchor Bay put out their version.  To compete with the studios that have more money, Diamond Entertainment released THE BEYOND under its old American title, THE SEVEN DOORS OF DEATH.  They  did NOT use the old, butchered print of DOORS.  Diamond used the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio print that European Cinema used, which is the same one Anchor Bay used.  I have all 3 of these DVD's and the title and extras are the ONLY difference.  There is NO missing footage in any of these releases.  Some people post their comments based on old VHS movies they saw years ago.  If you want the economy priced version of THE BEYOND, then get SEVEN DOORS OF DEATH.  If you want the version with the audio commentary, you'll have to buy Anchor Bay's version of THE BEYOND.  I'll say it once again:  This version of SEVEN DOORS OF DEATH is exactly the same, scene for scene, as Anchor's release of THE BEYOND, only the titles and extras are different.
