I bought this movie at Movie Stop bc I had finally found it after waiting 2 years for it. The Tekken Movie is another one of those failed adaptions, right there with the Street Fighter movie, and Dragonball Movie. Much better than the Dragonball movie, but probably even with the Street Fighter movie. Complete lack of thought as far as the story is concerned. Not 1 reference to the Devil curse (Which can be excused). Kazuya Mishima has major character flaws. He is too whiny, and not nearly vicious enough to be the real Kazuya Mishima. Plus he has a goatee in this movie (O.O) wtf?! Heihachi Mishima was ok but yet more character flaws. He was a much more honorable man in the movie than he is in the games. In the games he is a bitter old man with a hatred for his son and grandson. Not the case in this movie. Jin Kazama was probably the better part of the movie. The outfits were all spot on, but relevance and character was lacking big time. Jin has a smaller build than he should have had which can also be excused considering it is supposed to be a younger Jin Kazama. You can tell its a low budget film as the entire Anvil part of the movie looks like stage props from a play. The only other issues I care to point out are Christie and Nina. Nina Williams has always been one of the 5 Star fighters in the games. She was always a pain in the ass to beat but Christie disposes of her like she is nothing. Unacceptable. Also Christie is not using Capoera like she, and Eddy Gordo use in the games. Eddy uses it in the movie but not Christie. Beside these great flaws in the movie, it was worth 1 watch but I am going to trade it in a movie stop. If you know nothing about the Tekken story then you will likely enjoy it, the fight scenes are excellent minus the fighting style mishaps. 2 Stars.
