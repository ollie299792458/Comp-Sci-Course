Batman Beyond Season 2 was enjoyable to watch. Although if you are expecting a Bruce Wayne type of Batman then you may be a little disappointed.

I never really got into this show when it was airing in my country of New Zealand, mainly cause they used the stupid title Batman of the future, a dumb name like that can put some people off a show.

It is done by Bruce Timm & co (Batman animated Series Team) so though it is a different show it still has that good story element to it. Legendary Kevin Conroy is also back to play elderly Bruce Wayne.

This version of Batman is set about 50 years later from the previous Batman series where an elderly Bruce Wayne has teamed up with a young hot shot Teenager called Terry McGinnis. Bruce and Terry don't start well after Terry steals the Bat suit to bring justice to the crooks who killed his father. This new Bat suit is choc full of gadgets to help Terry along with a communicator and video link built in so Bruce can keep track of him.

So to rap things up this is a show that enhances your Batman experience, different enough from previous Batmans making it a worth while purchase.
