More people are reconnecting with the original movie adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic work these days. They won't be disappointed. The 70s version of the movie gives us a Wonka who is far more benign than Johnny Depp's current version. Wilder revels in his role as candy magician, and maintains a charming enteraining eccentricity as he shares the wonders of his candy palace.

Coming back to the movie after years away, I was amazed by the wittiness of it all. Some of Wilder's turns of phrase remind of books like "The Phantom Tollbooth". "We have so much time and so little to do, wait reverse that." It's hard to give a sense of how witty it is in the review. The search for the golden tickets is hilarious and cheerfully goes beyond the book with tongue in cheek newsreporting, auctions for boxes of Wonka bars and even a ransom for Wonka bars.

The acting is mostly stellar, although I'll prefer the boy of the newer version to the perfection of the Charlie Bucket of this one. He is so innocent that he's just a little syrupy sweet for me. Grandpa Joe is great though, especially in the scene when he gets out of bed out of years of sleep.

This is a great movie, that rare children's movie that's an equal pleasure for adults and kids alike. Now I'll have to reread Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator!
