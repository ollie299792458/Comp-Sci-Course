Ugetsu is one of the most fascinating films of the Japanese Cinema and at the same time a world masterpiece.

 Kenji Mizoguchi created a yardstick in directing and capturing the very essence of the characters in a unique way.

The way the camera was keeping a distance and yet revealing the characters is fascinating.

The story is classic and the characters can appear in every era the world round.

Men obsessed by their determination to prove themselves is a common theme that became the center action of thousands of films.

Yet Mizoguchi presented this classic theme in a spectacular way.

If someone wants to study and enjoy the Japanese cinema, he/ she should start by this film and then move slowly and with a lot of attention and care to such masterpieces as Rashomon, Ikiru by Kurosawa, Sisters of Gion, Street of Shame, Life of Oharu by Mizoguchi, and only then to enjoy films such as Tampopo, The funeral , Taxing woman of Itami .
