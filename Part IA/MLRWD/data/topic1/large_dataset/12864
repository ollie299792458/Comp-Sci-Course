Irwin Allen was a man before his time. He knew what the public wanted to see on televison and on film and, say what you will about his productions, he gave the viewers what they wanted for many years. His final successful TV sci fi effort was Land of the Giants, which lasted two seasons and 51 episodes and boasted some of the most amazing special effects of its time (1968-1970).
  When 20th Century-Fox released the complete set of episodes on DVD this year I was like a kid a Christmas. The set comes in an attractive carrying case made of wood that resembles a trap the giants often used on the unsuspecting "little people" as well as a keychain, mini-comic book reprint, postcards and a spiffy Spindrft crew patch to sew on that bright red uniform you've been hiding in your closet all these years.
  But of course the best part of the package is the 51 episodes in all their unedited glory and in full color, many of which I hadn't seen in over thirty years. Sure, some if not most of the plots were corny and dated but it's evident that Allen and his talentd staff put a lot of time and effort into the sets, (giant) props and special effects and they stand up well even to today's CGI extravaganzas and are still fun to watch.
  So pop some popcorn, open a big bottle of soda, shut off your phone and be ready to be entertained in a GIANT way! This set is well worth the  price tag and the interviews alone will keep you watching for months to come.
