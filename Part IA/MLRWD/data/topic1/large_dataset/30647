I'll admit it, I'm a huge fan of Nicolas Cage so there are times when my opinion is biased towards his films. However, I can safely say that Matchstick Men is a winner as a movie. A sterling performance is given by Sam Rockwell who always seems to have an amazing presence on the big screen, but the award goes to Nicolas Cage who's portrayal of a con-man with more phobia's than you can poke a stick at, delivers an incredible performance.
The movie plot seems straight forward at first, small-time con men taking small-time people for a ride, until the opportunity for a big win comes along. The twist at the end however caught me completely by surprise and turned a great film into a supurb film. The cast was well-chosen and all played their roles with enthusiasm and reality.
I can't wait for this movie to be released on DVD so I can sit down and enjoy it all over again. I believe also, that knowing the ending of the film won't spoil the experience at all, as the entire movie is a completely enjoyable experience.
I thoroughly recommend it!
