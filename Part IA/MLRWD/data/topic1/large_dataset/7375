If you don't know Ray Bradbury & haven't read his stories, then you may have missed something elemental and exciting all these years.  Ray Bradbury is the Godfather of Sci-Fi.  The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, Something Wicked This Way Comes, Farenheit 451, the list goes ever onward...

I have been waiting for some time out of mind for this collection to come out on DVD.  I used to watch the show whenever I could on USA and when I saw it here on Amazon, I had to have it.  I have ready nearly everything Bradbury has written, so each episode of RBT brings back a short story or a piece of novel that he has done.  Great stuff...

The bad part of the show is that some of the production values were pretty low.  The phazing picture from video to digital transfer is evident as well, but I can live with those things.  We see a slew of great actors and guest stars in these episodes.  We see the great Bradbury stories like The Veldt, Usher II, A Sound Of Thunder and so many more brought to life.  I would love to see what could be done today with Bradbury's body of work in the hands of some visionary like Peter Jacson or Spielberg.  At least we have this to view.  Packaging is great.  Price is not too steep.  Worth the buy and worth the Bradbury!
