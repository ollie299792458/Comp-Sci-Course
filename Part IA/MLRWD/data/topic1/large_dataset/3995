Do you remember what the X-Files were like before the plots started to recycle?  Before 'X-Files:  Fight the Future' ('Fight the Fatigue' is more like it)?  Before Mulder left, then came back, then left again?  Before Agent John Doggett?  Well, here it is.
Season Three is, in my humble opinion, the second best season the X-Files had.  Deep Throat, killed off (prematurely, I think) in Season One makes a token appearance.  X is still alive.  Scully doesn't have cancer yet she gets it in Season Four and it goes away in Season Five).  The plots are fresh and interesting.  The mythology hasn't become so complex and impenetrable.
The epiodes alone are worth the price of the DVD.  But that's not all Chris Carter gives us.  The interviews and segments with production staff and Chris Carter himself, all apparently gathered from the FX channel, are excellent.  The Third Season is better than the first two DVDs technically - it seems like the menu is faster and easier to manage.  And when there are no "special" options like deleted scenes (I LOVE those), little bonuses are thrown in like a list of actors/actresses in each show.  Oh, and the alternate language clips are a riot.  It's a blast to see Scully talking to Mulder in Japanese, or Mulder expounding something to Skinner in German.
Get the First two seasons first, of course.  But the watch the Third Season and remember why you liked X-Files in the first place.
