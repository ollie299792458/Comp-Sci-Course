It might be okay as a stand alone film, but the problem is that it is called "The Lorax." Based on the book by Dr. Seuss, but only very loosely. It takes audacious liberties, even for a film adaptation, and crunches the actual content of the book into maybe 3 minutes of screen time in a 90 minute romp. Ridiculously anti-corporate, despite the fact that other Lorax adaptations have admitted that while they can be self interested, they are rarely flat-out, one dimensional evil entities. Ironic, also, considering all the corporate tie-ins. The Lorax apparently no longer speaks for the trees, but Mazda and iHop and Theatre AMC. Some people might like it and think it's harmless, and they are perfectly entitled to that opinion. I wouldn't have such a beef with it except that it is called the Lorax, when it should really be called "Extra money so I can finish Despicable Me 2 on time." Actually, that may be a little harsh. This movie was clearly made by someone who loved the book or the 1972 adaption, but who missed a crucial message in there somewhere and made a Captain Planet movie instead. It is a watered-down kids movie with bright colors, cooing animals, celebrity voices, evil 1984-style corporations, and not much impact. It will hold your children's gaze for 90 minutes, but if you want them to get something out of it in terms of a good message, you might want to look elsewhere.
