I do not mean to criticize the  most current incarnation to the screen of the Phantom of the Opera but it is my opinion that the original was far superior.

The silent is truly engrossing and atmospheric and does a phenomenal job inspiring both pity and dread.
Unlike today's movies most of the silent films left much to the imagination and the fact that this version was a silent picture allows the viewer the space to dream the way a good piece of fiction does.

The sets are remarkable. The volence seems  mcuh more horrific  than without the  spurting of blood and dismemberment  we find in day's films and the sewers of Paris seem so dankwe can almost feel them.

The center piece of course is Lon Chaney, the man with a thousand faces. Before the days of  fancy computerized special effects  Lon Chaney perfected movie make up and yet though the gruesome  make up he creates for this role his expressive face conveys emotions that many of today's script writers have trouble conveying in words.

We are repulsed by the Phantom and still we feel his isolation and his love for a woman.

When he is pursued as a fiend we find it heartbreaking.

The film is more than just an artifact of history. Even now it is an effective poetic portrayal not only of a disfigured man but of the human condition.

Every love who loves film should enjoy this picture.

Highly recommended.
