I bought this somewhere else because it was on sale, got it home and went to install it on my new ANDROID Tablet only to find out that the only choices to install are either through ipad or Windows Media Player.  I tried to install with Windows Media Player and was able to get the movie on to my device, but it simply wouldn't play.  I called the customer service department on the back of the package and apparently I'm not the only one who is having this problem with the download version of this movie for Android.  Customer service said they would try and get an answer for me on how to get this movie to play on Android, but so far nothing.  They said Fox is aware of this issue and there should be a fix by OCTOBER.  But I need a fix NOW.  I will update if I hear back and can get this thing to play on Android.

Other than that, I would recommend.  Besides the hiccup on the downlad version for Tablets etc, you also get the DVD and a Blu Ray version in this package.  For that price, this was a steal.
