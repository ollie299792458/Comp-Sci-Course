This movie is absolutely DISGUSTING.  It seeks to turn what was once the powerful Dynamic Duo that would instill fear into the hearts of villians into the Batman and Robin comedy hour, with the not-action-star George Clooney playing Batman and Chris O'Donnell returning as Robin.
Coming out on the heels of Batman Forever, which was rather impressive, I expected it to be great what with the prestigious cast.  But, after repeated viewings, I absolutely despise this movie.
First of all, George Clooney makes a horrible Batman/Bruce Wayne.  Let me explain something here; Bruce Wayne is not a normal person.  He is a crazy guy who dresses up as a bat and beats up bad people.  He is not a comedian and he is not a cheerful guy; he has a dark edge, and George Clooney cannot convey dark edge in this movie.
Second of all, Batman and Robin seem to be assuming soap opera role, what with their irritating "Why can't you trust me?" [stuff], and Robin eventually becomes stupid with his, "I don't need you, man!" dramatic acting.
Third complaint:  Puns puns puns!  The very harmless-looking Mr. Freeze, played by the goofy Arnold Schwartzenegger, shells out MORE than his fair share of ice puns, which not only lessen my enjoyment of the movie but give me the urge to shove a pencil in my eye.
Fourth complaint:  The atmosphere.  How can you take this movie seriously?  Everybody is acting goofy; the darkness present in the classic first one is no more.  This movie is a joke.  The plot is ridiculous.  Poision Ivy seeks to protect the environment while Mr. Freeze seeks to freeze the world... and these two form a partnership... makes sense, doesn't it?
Do yourself a favor; don't watch this movie.
