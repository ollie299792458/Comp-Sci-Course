I like Gerard Depardieu, but JEAN DE FLORETTE is not one of my favorite films.  As one New York critic put it, you get to watch Depardieu haul water in various containers for most of the movie. So, why see it or buy it?  Because it is necessary to see this film to appreciate the second part of the story MANON OF THE SPRING. 
Jean de Florette returns to his home in Provence leaving his life in Paris behind. His wife, an opera singer (who warbles a few convincing notes from time to time) and his young daughter Manon accompany him. Manon is named for the operatic 'Manon' -- but of course. De Florette wishes to resume farming on his old family homestead -- growing carnations for the Paris flower market.  His land adjoins that of his Uncle (Yves Montand) and cousin (Daniel Auteuil).  But there is a problem.  The water available for farming will not support the crops on both farms. So, the inevitable struggle for water begins. 
I believe the screenplay and direction are by Pagnol, he of MY MOTHER'S HOUSE and MY FATHER'S CASTLE fame. The photography is wonderful, and the shots of De Florette in his garden surrounded by red carnations is beautiful.  I bought the DVD because I want the matched pair, and I love MANON OF THE SPRING.
