While the fantastic performance of Ms. Jolie won an Oscar, deservedly, and jumpstarted her sensational career, the performance of Winona Ryder has somehow, and unjustly, been neglected- She is astonishingly good, sensitive, nuanced, and very brilliant in the lead role.  The irony that amongst her words spoken in the film: ("Have you ever stolen something that you could completely afford to pay for?) appear, in real life, to have slowed down her career, seems unreasonably unfair. She is a great artist and one day hopefully will have an Oscar of her own. I feel she should have been nominated for this film, as should have Whoopi Goldberg, in quite a small but emotionally rich role. In addition, Vanessa Redgrave, though seen on film here for what has to be not quite 5 minutes, leaves an incredible impact, that, too could have been Oscar nominated, as supporting actress. Ms. Jolie deserved her Oscar, though i do feel she and Ms. Ryder should have shared Best (Lead) Actress nominations with Jolie winning, and Ms. Goldberg and Redgrave in the supporting catagory- The ensemble cast is terrific, too many to name, and as a 'period piece' the film really does give the viewer the feeling they are watching a slice of life from 1968 and 1969, the 'timespace' of the movie.
It belongs in homes of people who love to study great acting, because the film is loaded with it.  Time to forgive Ms. Ryder's shopping habits- no-one's perfect-  and realize it was she who was instrumental in getting the film made in the first place and also time to admire Ryder for having the artistic integrity to give the 'showier' role to Ms. Jolie, who should repay the favor anytime soon now and give the talented Ms. Ryder a role in one of Jolie's films.  Be nice to see them work together again, too :)
