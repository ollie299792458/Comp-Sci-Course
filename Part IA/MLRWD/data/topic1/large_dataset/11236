I love this movie. I just saw it again, after a few years, when it aired on TV a few days ago. I know it's airing because of Christmas and the holidays, but I love it anyway.

I like the way this movie flows. Everything about it makes it great. Every part ties everything together and makes it all make sense.

My favorite character is Annie. I love when she asks Jack if he is really her father, then starts helping her new "alien" father figure out how to be a better dad and husband. She starts giving him hints and fills him in on what he's supposed to do next. One of my favorite parts is when she explains to Jack how to get Josh (his son - in the glimpse) out of his car seat.

Josh, by the way, is the cutest thing. So is Annie. I think they were great casts.

One thing I don't like about this movie is the end. I wanted it to end in a way that showed something happening, whether it was Jack ending up being the "family man" or going back to being his old self, instead of just having them go have coffee together. After that end I wanted there to be a sequel - even though sequels usually suck, I still wanted more closure.

Watch and ENJOY!! :-)
