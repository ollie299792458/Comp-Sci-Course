At least once a year I watch this excellent production of A Town Like Alice. This is one of those magical adaptations where the actors cease to be performers and become real people who transport you to and immerse you in their world.

I first saw it on PBS in the 80's and then many years later saw the VHS tape for sale in Parade, a supplement to our Sunday paper. This was not typical marketing for the time and it may be a clue to why this wonderful adaptation is not available on DVD today. The one tape edition I received was not the best of quality but I later found the two tape editions a little better.

The chemistry between the characters played by Bryan Brown and Helen Morse is wonderful and very authentic. Bryan Brown is one manly man. There was a reason why Rachel Ward married him both on and off screen. I also love this film because of Gordon Jackson. I had fallen in love with his noble, gentle character, Hudson, in Upstairs Downstairs, and his character here, Noel, is equally as endearing.

This story celebrates the good in people of all backgrounds and the power of human endurance and determination. It always helps to restore my faith in mankind. I also like a tall "cold beer" and love the important role it plays in this movie.

Do yourself a favor and watch this production, even if it means ordering a used VHS tape before they disappear forever. I add my wish that this will be available on dvd soon. At least get Nevil Shute's novel and read that.
