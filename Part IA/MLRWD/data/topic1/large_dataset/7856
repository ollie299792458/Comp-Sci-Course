Need I say this is a comic masterpiece?  Peter Sellers, James Coco, David Niven, Maggie Smith, Elsa Lancester, Peter Faulk, Eileen Brennan.  A great cast in a parody movie to top all parody movies.  The humor is fast and  furious.  You may want to watch it twice to catch all the jokes.  My only  disappointment, perhaps shared by anyone who's seen this in theaters, is  the video version ending.  In the theatrical release of this movie, there  was a funny scene at the end, which is not in the video release.  The  scene is Sellers (as Wang) is leaving the house, and Sherlock Holmes and  Dr. Watson (I forget the actor's names) are just arriving, and they ask  Wang directions to the house.  When they leave, his adopted son asks,  "Pop.  Why didn't you tell them the whole thing's a sham?" (or  something like that) then Wang laughs and says, "Let them figure it  out for themselves."  I think that's the way it goes.  Since they cut  that scene from the video, I don't remember it too well.  Anyway, it's a  riot.  One of my favorite comedies of all time.
