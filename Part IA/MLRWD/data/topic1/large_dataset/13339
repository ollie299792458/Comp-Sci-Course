So if you are looking for a fun action flick, especially with a female butt-kicking protagonist, this is the one. With Jason Bourne level of over-the-top fighting, it's a fun ride. If you are looking for deep emotional connection, well, look somewhere else. Like many of these movies, I really want to meet the HVAC contractors who put up these super-strong air ducts, that don't flex/collapse and make no noise when moving inside of them... Zoe Saldana is stunning to look at, and makes a compelling action star.

The movie opens with her child-version actress who does a great parkuor through the favela of Bogata, which is well filmed, and like a child (running in a school-girl outfit no less) she does not possess crazy skills which would make this more comic-book-like as in Chloe Moretz (who stole that movie BTW) in Kick-Ass, and instead more believable as a child with serious skills who will grow up to be a serious assassin. The adult version uses all sorts of creative attacks from full frontal assault to human-engineering attacks to get on the inside; and yes, stuff blows up! And watching her slink around in a catsuit is not a hardship either.

Unfortunately the "digital copy" is an ultraviolet, instead of a real digital copy, but such are the breaks.
