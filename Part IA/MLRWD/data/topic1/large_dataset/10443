Literally worth five times the price and an equal in it's own way to PULSE, with intimacy and a freer feel offsetting the more minimal lighting (although enormously impressive in its own right.)

As the other reviewers have given an accurate overview I'll just mention one cut, that being "Comfortably Numb," which you and I know every second of by heart, it's in our blood.

This performance features David Bowie sharing lead vocals. Now the idea of anyone but Mr. Gilmour taking over vocals on this song is enough to make my hair catch on fire, but THIS WORKS. It actually becomes a Bowie song while remaining a Floyd epoch. It's thrilling, it's almost dreamlike to watch a singer of equal caliber and credibility to Mr. Gilmour share this song and to take it's inherent drama and mystery to another level entirely.

The DVD also points out what a superb disc "On An Island" is, sadly overlooked by too many Floyd fans for not being heavy enough (man.)

And it's in high def - you can almost reach out and shake Rick Wright's hand.

Extras are top flight, set is an incredible bargain and you'll have trouble turning it off and going to bed. Mr. Gilmour once again proves that he's in a class all by himself, a category of artist of which there is only one.
