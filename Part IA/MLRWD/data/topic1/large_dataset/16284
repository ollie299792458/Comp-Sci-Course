Ang Lee is a superior director, and this is an introspective film on the nature of anger.

On the commentary Ang Lee mentions that he saw this movie as a "Dream of Anger"; an exploration on the nature of rage and what can cause a feeling that deep to become uncontrollable.

The Hulk is not your standard marvel superhero. In guest appearances he plays the 'Unstoppable Force'. In his own comic he runs from what he can't control. He doesn't put on a suit or fight crime. He is a creature driven by his base impulses. Impulses that take over his mind and body and drive him to do horrible horrible things, things that only later he discovers the consequences for.

Gee, sort of sounds like a metaphor for anger -- which is kind of the point of this film.

People complain about this movie because it's slow, introspective, and the hulk doesn't appear for over an hour of runtime. What they want is to put in a film, see a little bit of romance and some eye candy where things blow up. That is not what is in this film. What *is* in this film (and in my opinion is worth your time) is a study of what one man must do to come to terms with the monster that resides inside of him. This, like all films about hominid-morphs, uses an external monster to represent an internal struggle. This film, like much of Ang Lee's work, represents that struggle very well.

It's not a summer blockbuster. It doesn't have an explosive shiny battle at the end. What it does have is thought-provoking imagery and a complex statement about a complex issue. It is no wonder why your average American didn't like the film. It comes highly recommended for any fans of Ang Lee, and anyone who likes their movies filled with intelligence and metaphor.

All those proud of their ignorance make me angry, and in the words of the Hulk. . .
