The Halloween machine chugs on, most likely following up on the alternate track the series has taken, in which Laurie Strode didn't die, there are no Druids and Myer's head is lobbed off in the end. It's just as well since no matter how M is brought back the series cannot resurrect its greatest asset which was the late Donald Pleasence. Dimension hyped up the return of Jamie Lee Curtis, but let's face it. She was simply the hapless victim not unlike you or me, while H20's hoo-haa about her conquering her demons was just an attempt at giving weight to an otherwise limp story. It was Pleasence's Dr. Loomis and Myers who were the true diad with each movie following the same pattern: Myers, obsessed with killing shows up, followed by Lomis obsessed with bringing him down. Pleasence's performance lent true gravity to the situation. We believed him when this accomplished psychiatrist called Myers Pure Evil and knew the most scientific method of dealing with him was to, say, blow Michael up (after all he studied Myers his whole life). Halloween 6 actually had a different cut that what was finally theatically released (the original known now as the rarely seen Producer's Cut) but I believe the quite hokey final cut is the best way for the original Halloween plot track to end, with the ambigous final shot. We get the sound clue of Loomis screaming (being killed by Myers or simply fighting with him) and the visual shot of the mask without its owner (a clue that perhaps Myers is the one being finally put out of commision) There is nothing else to reveal and no other way to end the series except with the final bout between the two old foes, the winner's identity left open if there is one at all.
It's not clear who the hero of the latest Halloween would be. Hopefully the filmakers would copy the move they did with the last one and include an exceprt from Loomis' dialogue as a memorial. After all can there really be any one else with the mettle to take on Myers?
