This movie is enjoyable, truly every child can watch this without feeling fear or exposed to something too grown up. Suprising what they put in some "kid" movies. However, my family has been a huge fan of the Pixie Hollow books. We especially love the ones written by Gail Carson Levine (Quest for the Egg). I don't have those in front of me to double-check spelling. With a huge production of books on Tinkerbell.. I thought were a lead to the movie, I was disappointed. Disney produced (ie handstamped) the series as they did the movie. So I was suprised by the number of times it strayed in many key points with the book. For examples, Disney faries never say goodbye, they say "fly with you". The books made a big point about this.. so it jolted me out of my fantasy within the movie to hear the difference. I see they are re-inventing her and kudos for that, I believe Tink has much to offer. They created a strong, realistic female charactor..  I would have liked to seen her co-workers not so annoying as goofballs.

I enjoyed the music, Raven's voice is always a delight. The reading by Mae Whitman was done very well.

Overall there was a bit of a flat feeling with the movie, I look forward to what they do with the next ones they release. I bought it, I liked it but I advise my friends to borrow it from me and not waste their money. This isn't one you will watch 3 months from now, the "new magic" fades fast.
