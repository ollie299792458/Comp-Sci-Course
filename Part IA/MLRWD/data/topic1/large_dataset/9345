This is just one of those short made for TV movies, less than 92 minutes long!!! Hardcore, Nascar fans will still though find this amusing though!!! This movie tells about the legendary Dale Earnhart "3", giving you a basic overview and brief biography of his life, that was pretty good in fact!!! My little brother a Nascar fan has watched it already about 10 times, so I' ve pretty much mermorized the entire film!!!

 I myself didn't think that Barry Pepper, captured Earnhart's image that well either. He did a good job acting, but just jot the same as the man himself!!! Barry Pepper also with co producing the film as well, so Barry Pepper was a big contributer to the film!!! If you consider that they made this with a very low budget, you kind of see the genius!!! Their are some people who absolutely love this movie (Nascar fans), while others people that didn't like it or understand it!!!

 It may not have a lot of depth or bea movie like "Aviator"!!! Really folks can you compare an academy award winning film with a made for tv movie!!! This movie is meant to help you understand Dale Earnhart and what he was as a person and driver!!! Dale Earnhart "The Intimidator", one of the legends of the sport, and the most entertaining driver to watch, as he  feared nobody!!! The movie shows his life from his childhood, with his dad Ralph Earnhart, until his final moments at Daytona, back in 2001!!!

This movie is a Nascar fans, dream, but wait disc 2 is the real gold here!!! The best stuff is truly on the second disc which moved my rating to 3 to 3.5!!! The second disc has alot of great footage a Nascar fan's dream!!! I myself am not the biggest Nascar fan around, but let me tell you disc2 is worth buying this movie!!!

-Exclusive interviews With Dale Earnhart

-An inside look at the legend: spectacular racing footage from Dale's best races on ESPN!!!

-Making of "3" Feature

-Documentary on the life and legacy of Dale Earnhart

... and more goodies for Nascar fans!!!

Along with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and, along with French and Spanish subtitles!!!

 Overall, I will give the 2 disc collector's package of "3" a 3.5/5, the movie itself a  3/5!!! Nascar fans will love, for evrybody else it depends on your taste of movies!!!
