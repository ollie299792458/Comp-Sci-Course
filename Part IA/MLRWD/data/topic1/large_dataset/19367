I participated in the US Congressional investigation of The Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Luxembourg, Caymans, etc.) decades ago.  It WAS like that,  influence peddling BCCI DID have connections everywhere including the US Federal Reserve, prominent "populist" politicos such as Clark Clifford and Stuart Symington, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies. As to the flick, it is visually stunning; morality play only partly follows the spy-story checklist (ie, the leads markedly DO NOT sleep with each other, one deleted scene shows maybe they could have but a phone call got in the way. DRAT. Yes, car chase and truly memorable shootout.) Much of the budget went to travel and set construction; effective reversals of motives cover up any continuity problems quite well  as some of the bad guys seek instant redemption while others prosper no matter what. Easy to lose some cues as what is to come, maybe watching twice will clear up some things clearly based on supposedly unrelated Vatican Bank scandals (which you will remember from Godfather III.) Usual thousands of little people listed by name in end titles and non-melodic soundtrack chord modulations with drum-taps work effectively here.
