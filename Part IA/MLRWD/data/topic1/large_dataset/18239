It's a classic 80's U.S. vs. U.S.S.R flick, unfortunately, it was made after the Soviet Union collapsed.  Beau Davis' poor selection of plot and sub-plot leave the viewer wondering not only the background of the characters, but the future of them as well.  Brandon Lee plays Michael Gold, a 007 wanna-be, whose luck with flying projectiles rivals only that of the Road Runner.  Granted, it is nice to see Lee in another movie besides his well known (The Crow and Rapid Fire), but one can easily see why this movie didn't captivate the audience.  His acting ability doesn't show at all, as if he simple walked through the set reading his lines off teleprompters.  Ernest Borgnine acting never seems to grow passed that of a childs, and Debi Monahan, whose more popular appearance being in 1991's Shattered with Tom Beringer, shows little talent when it comes to the silver screen, but weilds a gun and high heels as Lee's secretive partner.  My suggestion when it comes down to this movie, wait til it comes out on A.B.C. or N.B.C. or another TV station that costs you nothing to watch.  Rating TV...
