But watch it again and you'll fall in love. I can't say much about this film that hasn't already been said... the dialogue is excellent, the comedy is subtle and true-to-life. Tarantino is my favorite director because he gives an imaginitive, almost voyeouristic look into the lives of a group of petty criminals and makes us genuinely care about their sucesses and failures in life. I almost feel like I'm eavesdroppig by hidden camera on the characters as they go about their business of living their lives. Tarantino brought back the rugged real gritty film-making that was missing in the yuppie era of the eighties and the glossy, high-action effect cop movies of the nineties. I won't bore you by outlining how every big star in this flick gives an awesome performance, read the other reviews for that...

This is a movie that appreciates with each viewing. The laid back story-telling that may seem boring the first time you see this film; becomes the life of the film once you've seen it a few times. The fact that they're all chasing 1/2 a million dollars becomes incidental once you fall in love with the characters. This movie is for an older generation. If you loved Pulp Fiction when you were young, then you should pick up Jackie Brown in a few more years and it will surely be your next favorite Tarantino movie.
