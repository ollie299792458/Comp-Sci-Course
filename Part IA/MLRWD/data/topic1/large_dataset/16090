From my review in RedFence Magazine:

"The cinematography in this piece achieved a level far beyond most indie fodder. Likewise, the filmmakers have fashioned fresh dialog, true characters, and time-period detail without succumbing to stodgy, history-spouting caricatures. J.T. Petty wrote a daring plot, opting for a series of late-night suspense sequences rather than the normal sweeping flow of most Westerns. This keeps the audience lost in the dark, placing them inside the exhausted heads of the main characters as they fight a losing battle, night after night.

On the whole, this film may be too bleak for its own good. When a Native American reveals that the burrowers eat human flesh because the settlers depleted their normal supply of buffalo, the film turns into a not-so-subtle metaphor for Manifest Destiny, and I found it hard not to squirm with physical and philosophical discomfort as the burrowers crept through the tall grass to claim their victims.

With modern audiences moving away from darker fair, and the constant battle for ticket sales that Westerns have fought since the 1970s, it's no wonder The Burrowers dug itself deep to the bottom of the DVD clearance pile at Wal-Mart.

But it's a shame. When great underground films stay below the surface, we're left with the hollow reboots and remakes that live in the neon lights of sprawling, corporate mega-plexes."
