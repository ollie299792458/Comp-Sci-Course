...I loved this movie. Sure, for the martial arts purists, you wanted more martial arts action, but overall it had the right mix of martial arts, car chases, explosions, and a fresh, edgy feel to it. In the clip on the making of the movie included in the DVD version, the producers wanted to get a fresh unique East meets West, hip hop, kungfu kind of weird appeal and I think they achieved it. I loved Aaliyah, she impressed me with her ability to act, she is so musically talented and has great sex appeal in a cute girl next door type way. Jet was awesome in his fight scenes as usual, but I found myself replaying the DVD and watching the scenes where Aaliyah and Jet interact. There's some chemistry there and hint of romance, but unfortunately that was not fully developed. I thought the plot of these two minority groups having a turf war to be in the realm of possibility. I also found the movie to have some light humor to balance out some of violence and destruction. Maurice, the bumbling foil of the movie was classic. It is an entertaining movie.
