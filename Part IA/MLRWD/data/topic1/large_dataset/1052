I own Criterion's latest DVD release (from 2006) and now the Blu-ray edition of The 400 Blows.  For anyone who would like to know about the differences between the two, other than the HD presentation, there are only a few.  The extras are the identical, from the commentaries and archival footage to the essay in the booklet.  So, in terms of content, the Blu-ray is edition is virtually the same as the latest DVD edition.  (This is in contrast to, say, Criterion's Blu-ray of The Last Emperor, which jettisoned the "television version" present in the DVD released just months before.)

Yes, there is a noticeable difference in the quality of the video.  The Blu-ray is less muddled and has sharper black-and-white contrasts.  I also noticed some intermittent flicks of white in the DVD that have been corrected in the Blu-ray.  (I actually feel spoiled by Criterion because I half-expect all of my classic films to be flawless now!)  The Blu-ray also touts an uncompressed audio track.  I can't say that the Blu-ray is a must-upgrade, but the difference in video quality is definitely there.
