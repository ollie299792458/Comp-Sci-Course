Striking locations, solid acting, and fidelity to the original story make this an excellent film. In contrast to what has been written in certain other reviews, this is exactly the way in which a book should be brought to life on the silver screen.
To wit- much of the dialogue used in the film has been lifted directly from the book. The storyline follows the novel with nearly exact precision. Sure, some of the detail gets left out, but it's impossible to make a feature-length film from a full-length novel without losing some of the subleties. If they're that important to you, skip the movie and stick to the book.
Secondly, Harrison Ford's preformance as the self-destructive genius Allie Fox is beyond question. Author Paul Theroux was among Ford's biggest fans, once quoted as saying "He IS Allie Fox." Ford took the role after Jack Nicholson turned it down, and this is likely for the best - his performance, superlatives aside, is in fact Oscar-worthy. The rest of the cast offers standout performances - especially noteworthy are Helen Mirren and the late River Phoenix, as Mother and Charlie respectively. 
Perhaps this film's biggest detriment is the story itself - the psychologically dark plot can be as off-putting as it is fascinating. 
This film should be viewed for what it is - an excellent film version of the book and a fascinating, dark tale of self-destruction. Fans of Harrison Ford's lighter action films might not enjoy the movie because of the dark plot. This movie, however, was never intended to please all of the people all of the time; keeping that in mind, this is an excellent film.
