Although my review is short, It will be very clear.
Having heard of this story, and debated the fee for renting: wondering in my mind, how could a film really portray the emotions he must have felt? Let alone extend the incident into a full feature.
I was pleasantly surprised at the texture, and color of this piece of film.
I would recommend this to anyone having heard of, or not heard the story prior.
Rarely do films evoke my emotions, (not to say I'm callous, just overly scrutinizing a movie is how I take part in a film) but this flick had me on toes and seats edge.
The graphic nature of the scenes were but a minor contributor to the effects on my emotions; but the portrayal of the maze in Aron's mind when faced with a narrow path to survive really sent chills through my spine.  The focus of the lens seemed to acute on all the points needed to raise the bar for the film, not limiting it to some cliche 'true story'.
What a wonderful piece of not only cinema and acting; but of the ingenuity, strength, and monumental nature of the human spirit.
Hats of to Aron, and all whom were involved in this project.
Defiantly deserved the awards it received.
Thanks Amazon!
