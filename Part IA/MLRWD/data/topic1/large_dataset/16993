I was never a big U2 fan but strangely enough what made me a Fan was the Million Dollar Hotel CD (think it was just Bono on this). Long story short...that somewhat strange CD made me start rethinking my appreciation of Bono and the musical skills of the band which HAS proved over the years that they ARE very skilled musicians and artists.  I think reason I wasn't a fan so much was because I got force fed a diet of whatever was on the radio and my favorite songs aren't usually what is played on radio (or TV).

As years have gone by...I have looked for ways to not only entertain myself...but my granddaughter. BEST PART of this DVD collection is that I can SHARE it with her...I don't have to worry that there is going to be rude and crude comments between the videos. Videos are "sexy" but compared to what is on TV now...this is better than HM...if you know what I mean.  WE love dancing around and singing together while this DVD is on.  It's just plain good for all ages IMHO.  Most of the videos on this DVD I NEVER saw before due to MTV/VH1 past playlists.

I became aware of these videos about a year ago when Comcast Online put up ALOT of their videos in a pre-release for a CD coming out.  IF I wasn't a big fan before...I became one upon seeing those videos.
