This Movie was done in the movie "I am Legend" background. A complete total waste of a movie. This movie could have been done without the hunters in it. Steven's fight scenes was pretty much it dies and he poses. The other male hunter was more impressive.

As i watched the movie, I assumed the hunters was immune. Why else would you fight close combat (without gloves) where blood of the infected will splatter on you. Also tryin to understand why the hunters want to hurry and get done if they do not know about the bombing.

The movie just made no sense. They would run down a hallway, encounter something then turn and go back the way they came (Nothing pursuing them). Strength in numbers but they kept seperating. If they survived this long, why are they suddenly trusting. for some reason they get in easily BUT they have to go out a different way. Going through an a place where any moment you can get attacked, Yet no one is carrying a single weapon (at least a knife).

The infected evolving? After seeing steven's lame fight scenes. I really did not care. The infected did not even plan some elabrate plan. If i was infected and kept my wits about me, I would try to go with them. Total Worthless movie.
