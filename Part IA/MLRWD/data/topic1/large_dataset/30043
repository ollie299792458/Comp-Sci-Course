As a non-dancer, she went a little too fast for me, but the DVD was still enjoyable to use and I'll be using it again -- it might even get into my regular rotation of exercise DVDs!

The good:  Her background dancers had very varied body types (including two that were nearly overweight). One of the background dancers was a man, which was nice to see!  Most of my DVDs use only women background dancers.

I loved the live music!  She had a band right there with her, and the camera cut to them now and then.  Fun to watch!

I was happy that she kept us marching in place while she explained things.  Sure I could march on my own when an instructor doesn't tell us to, but I'm lazy, so I'd rather be told to do it.

The bad things were minor: The DVD was really loud.  The music was loud, so she had to nearly shout to be heard; I had to turn the sound lower on my TV than I ever had before.

And, as I mentioned, she moved a little fast. It was hard to see the new steps, to see how they were done, so even on the fifth time through I wasn't really doing them right... but even so, it was still fun to do!

So all in all, I'd recommend this DVD!
