I'm an 18 male and love this show. I love most every show from the '80s: Care Bears, Rainbow Bright, Strawberry Shortcake, "Them Glowing Worms", GI JOE, Turtles, this one about talking koalas, etc... And Jem is number 1!
The story is so moving and involving. I remember sitting down a night after I got it and planning to just watch one episode. But it ended with a total cliff hanger and I just had to watch the second. I just finished the first disc and am scared to start on the second... It's such a good show I don't want it to be over!
The music is great too. I love it! I downloaded all the songs from the entire show on a Jem fansite. I'm disappointed to find out there has never been an album released of their music with full length songs. I'm listening to a CD of the Misfits right! =D
I am going to die if they don't release the rest of the episodes.
The show is appealing to not only children but older people too as the story deals with relationships and love. Today cartoon shows are disgusting, other then anime imported from Japan. Only anime is missing something. Anime is usually too serious or too bizarre, never just right as is Jem.
I pray they relase the rest of Jem and more 80 cartoons. And I used to hope they would re-create these shows. However, after seeing the new Strawberry Shortcake and Turtles, I pray that they don't. After the rest of JEm is released, I wanna see the Little Ponys.
/sigh... I'm already dreading the day I finish this box set. I'm really try to drag it out. But the end of Jem is enevitable seeing there is only 65 episodes. How many episodes of GI JOE and TRansformers are there? I got both those box sets too and they're just terrible. Absolutely boring, absurd and unrealastic.
