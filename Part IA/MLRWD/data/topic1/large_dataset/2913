I think a lot of reviews of this film have been unduly harsh. I have had a fair amount of Shakespearean exposure (I was an English major in college), and I am actually impressed with Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of the text.  Some people are so blinded by the seeming erudite stuffiness of Shakespeare's work that they forget what this play is really about.  `Romeo and Juliet' is a teenage melodrama!  With that said, this film works well.

* To begin with, Leonardo DiCaprio and Clare Danes come off just right as the "star-crossed lovers."  They handle their lines - perhaps - a bit awkwardly, and their key scenes are overacted.  But as far as I'm concerned, their somewhat `poor' performances are actually perfect.  In the reality of the play - Romeo and Juliet's behavior (though arguably passionate) is less than genuine.  They are young, fickle, and full of hormones, and what might seem like acts of heart-felt love and desire are actually just curious explorations of subversive behavior.

* Many have lamented that the dialogue in this film (essentially) mirrors the original text ... but changing the text (in any major way) would be a huge mistake.  Shakespeare's plays are not famous because they have a great story line - they are famous because of the unbelievable writing.  It would, therefore, be pointless to modernize the dialogue.  Shakespeare's plays ARE the dialogue.

* Although this film - compared with other renditions of the play - is decidedly modern, certain elements do contribute to a sort of timely ambiguity.  The cars, guns, drugs, and music suggest 1996 (or thereabouts), whereas the gothic mansions, the ball, the feuding families, and the oppressive presence of the Church seem somewhat anachronistic.  I think this ambiguity speaks to the universality of Shakespeare's work.  Does it even matter when this play takes place?  Have hot-blooded teenagers changed that much over the years?

* Lastly, the ambience of Lurhmann's film is intoxicating: zipping, choppy cinematography, an over-abundance of gaudy electric lighting, and an intriguing soundtrack.  It's very titillating in an adolescent sort of way.  Anyone who does not find the scene - where DiCaprio is dragging on a cigarette against an orangey sunscape, with Radiohead's "Talk Show Host" slowly pulsing in the background - sentimentally sexy - well, you must not remember what it's like to be 15.

All in all, this is an ingenious approach to a classic text - not to mention an entertaining film.
