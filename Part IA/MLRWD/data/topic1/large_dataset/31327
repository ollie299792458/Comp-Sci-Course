I have not reviewed any american films on amazon yet but if I should start  with one it should be the one that deserves one,to be frank I haven't found  a good psycho thriller in a long time.This movie,in my opinion out does the  other suspense thrillers around right now by leaps and bounds meaning Sixth  Sense (boo) and Sleepy Hollow,they just weren't freaky at all.This movie  was excellent though,it really emphasises on visual style which is hard to  capitalize on when you're using city landscape scenery rather than  constructed sets like in Sleepy Hollow,but I think the effect was equal if  not better than Sleepy Hollow(excellent cinematography).Next the story was  also very well put together,in the beggining I thought it was going to be a  rip off of Sixth Sense with the kid speaking to the walls ,but it doesn't  take that route at all,it was a totally origional concept of a movie that  is put together in such a way that it totally kept my attention until the  end and has an outstanding performance by Kevin Bacon.The sound track was  yet another strong point in this movie with some of the tracks seeming like  they were pulled right out of Resident Evil and helped a lot to keep the  tension built.For anyone into these sort of movies a definite must buy,but  even if you're not I think everyone should at least rent it and see it  once.Forget Sixth Sense,forget Sleepy Hollow,grab this one instead-a  psycodic master piece that almost had me going a little crazy from the  wonderful array of colors the director slips in through out the movie to  get some what of a hypnosis effect.Very origional,very artistic ,very  good-watch it
