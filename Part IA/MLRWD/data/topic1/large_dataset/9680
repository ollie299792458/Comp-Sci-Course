I own 30 or so workout videos, and this one is my favorite. I agree with some of the other reviews that this workout, as presented, may be a little much for a total beginner at first- just adjust the # of reps and the weight until you're stronger. No problem. The choreography is easy and enjoyable. Eventually I could do this whole workout and more, in only a few months. You'll be surprised how quickly you progress, if you do this 3 to 4 days a week. I made the investment of the stick and the Fanny Lifter (pretty cheap off eBay) and was very glad I did. Substitutions are fine if you want; but remember a mop or broom weighs next to nothing while the stick weighs 8 pounds, so you're losing resistance if you go that route, and may not see results as quickly. Also, a household stepstool is not going to be safe, IMHO. You've got to be able to put your entire weight on the stool, on one foot sometimes, without worrying about tipping over and injuring yourself. So if you buy only one workout tool, get the Fanny Lifter. Your legs and backside will look great if you use this correctly. It's sturdy and durable and I love it. (One more thing. Watch out for your ceiling fan. Learned that one the hard way.) ;-)

Let's face it, most workout videos have similar moves. There are only so many ways to lift a weight and do cardio in a small space. The reason I love this workout is mainly b/c Emily is such a good leader- likeable, enthusiastic without condescension or over-perkiness, and she tells you what to do next on the last rep of the previous exercise, so you can keep up. That is extremely helpful. Also, I love the music. It is a great motivator to me - if a workout video has cheesy music I won't use it, no matter how effective the exercises are. Of course, everybody's tastes differ, but give this one a try. I have this video to thank for losing 30 pounds and 4 dress sizes within a year. I've bought many newer videos lately to switch it up, but I keep coming back to this one.
