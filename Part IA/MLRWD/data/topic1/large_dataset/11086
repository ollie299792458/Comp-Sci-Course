I love watching foreign films as they give such an opposite view of life than what is portrayed in most American films. I was originally drawn to this film because of the subject matter and location - Iraq and the beginning of the war.

As I sat through this film I kept thinking I should be more sadden by the different tragedies that befall some of the characters and the general bleak surroundings. I don't know if it was concentrating on reading the subtitles and following the story or what but the full force of this film did not hit me until the end as the credits began filling the screen.

The suffering, uncertainty and poverty faced by so many people including those most hard hit, children, around the world is staggering and so painful when one lets it settle into one's heart and mind. I cried so hard after the movie was done just thinking of all those children all over the world that live in such dire circumstances. We all hear about poverty and such but this movie "brought it home" to me in really a unique way.

Yes, it is sad and maybe even depressing but for me and my fellow Americans anyways it is a terrific, sobering reminder of life and people outside of our little bubble and that we cannot forget or stop caring... I recommend it highly!
