The first sight of Ilsa, as the German Nazi camp commandant,

strutting in jack-boots and brandishing her swagger stick as she eyeballs her male and female prisoners is quite stunning.

If you are a fan of campy, 70's style movies with aggresive and dominant

female leads, then this is a movie for you!

Loosely based on history, (I don't believe there was ever a NAZI woman commander of a coed prisoner of war camp during WW2--at least not as alluring as she),

this is an evidently ridiculous, but unique, interesting, exciting and aroussing film.

Definately over the top for moral values of 1974, today it comes across as comical and satirical in its overt splendour of sexplotation.

Yes, there are scenes of torture, however the blood and gore is so unreal that is allows

the viewer to watch in curiousity, not revulsion.  For a man, the scene of castration and Ilsa cutting off a man's

genitals, who failed to please her sexually, generates a queasy feeling though!

Overall, a film to have for 'supers-schlok cinema' value and one to watch when you

need a fix for a very attractive, dominant female as an antagonist against your senses of complacency!

The fact that it is filmed on the then vintage set of the 1960's series Hogan's Heroes,

gives it that mystifying allure, harkening back to the old war themes of good against

evil:

And, Dyanne Thorne as the character Ilsa, is pure evil--but she's purely 'one hell of a good' sight for

sore eyes!
