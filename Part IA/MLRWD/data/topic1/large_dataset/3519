Rarely does a movie do justice to a book, but Fred Zinneman's production of "The Day of the Jackal" is wonderful adaptation of Frederick Forsyth's novel which, I continue to believe, is one of the greatest thrillers ever written.
It's hard to put a finger on what exactly makes this film great: excellent performances by relatively unknown actors, a wonderful plot, fantastic location shooting or a complete desire to avoid the bells and whistles, special effects laden movies that are all that makes up the "suspense" genre of films these days.  Like other reviewers have said, be this the first or the fiftieth time that you watch this film, you will be left on the edge of your seat with its "cat and mouse" plot of the search for a lone assassin hired to murder President De Gaulle.  The young Edward Fox is brilliant in the title role and the supporting cast excellent.
If anything, this film proves that you do not need big named stars, explosions around every corner or computer generated effects to make a fantastic film.  The only downside to watching this film is that you realise that the movie industry just does not make films like this any more.
Highly, highly recommended.
