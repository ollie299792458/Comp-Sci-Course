I am talking about the "Critics," and not this AWESOME movie, of course. Sorry to break the news to all the "high brows" and "low brows" out there... this was not about being an action or Sci-Fi Movie... it was a well written screenplay about ONE MAN (with some great supporting charactors and perspectives), and his personal experience/perspective when life "just happens" (As the great story of life is often apt to do). Has THAT story been told before? Sure... but this version had great acting, directing and visual effects to boot... just nothing over the top... which is GOOD.  It is AT LEAST as good as any film ever made with similar themes and genres... and that makes it GREAT, by default... if not with the blessing of the "annointed" critics out there.  Is it a "Chick Flick?" Nope. It's not a "metro man" flick either, but saying that... this film is not a "Movie for guys who love movies" flick either, per se (Sorry TNT), although it would work there. Intelligent and thoughtful women will love it just as much as any man capable of seeing the story in a movie, and not just the eye candy.

Better yet?... It does not take itself too seriously (like the critics who slammed it), but can justifiably be called a great, entertaining film with a REAL STORY anyway.  I'm prior service, and parts of this film made me very anxious duirng close-in battle scenes on the big screen in the theater, while other parts brought a sincere tear to my eye.  This is a personal story about irony, finding meaning in disaster and sacrifice, personal character in a crisis, and redemption of the tired and battered soul.  If you can't see those things when you watch... try switching to PBS or the Cartoon Network... you are not ready yet.  ;)
