Almost Famous reaches out to anyone who has ever been caught between the expectations of normalcy and experiencing the extraordinary.  William, the main character, struggles with the pressure from his mother to be a "person of substance" in the real world. Yet, he also wants to be part of the rock and roll lifestyle on the road with Stillwater.  The emphasis on the real world is just a personal construction that changes every day.  More people may accept a certain way of life as reality, but others create their own unique reality.  For William's mother it is education and success; for Penny Lane it is living in the moment with rock stars.
Stillwater adopts William as part of their family.  William is working as a journalist for Rolling Stone is referred to as the "enemy".  To the band, he is the enemy because his reflections of them can shape how the rest of the world views them personally and their music.  It is his job to report his observations, not present the band how they want to be seen.  As William befriends the band, he realizes it is hard to be honest but concludes that honesty is true friendship.
For William, life on the road is different than life at home.  On the road, there is no routine, everything changes from city to city. He is part of the group instead of an outcast, as he is at school.  While he is out of his element he does expereince life on the road.
The movie left me wondering what it was like for Stillwater and the band aids after the party was over.  Where do you go after reaching out to so many people and then fade away from the spotlight?  It is also interesting whether or not the experience changed William.
