I received this movie as a gift and just finished watching it - AND I LOVED IT! Some key points to consider -

(1) The visual effects of the blue-ray disc for this movie are stunning. The camera gets so close, and the details from the main cast themselves to the stunning African landscape are breathtaking!!!! I was in awe.

(2) Samuel L Jackson was a fabulous narrator! Yes there were some cheesy lines, but remember this is a Disney movie!

(3) The story itself was quite moving. I am 30+ male but I found my eyes getting wet at key scenes.

(4) If you are considering watching this movie with the kiddies - then do so! Yes there are death scenes but none of these are the least bit graphic.

(5) Very well made movie! The bonus features were excellent. I watched them all. I have never done that with any other dvd/blue-ray disc that I own.

(6) I am proud to own this movie, and fully anticipate having many more viewings of this movie over the years. Again I loved it, and I think you will too. A++++++ production. The extra touch they added during the closing credits made me laugh. Very well thought out!
