I consider myself one of the greatest JOEL SCHUMACHER fans alive. I am eagerly waiting for the day I can meet him and talk to him and touch him. (If he'll let me!) I adore him and all his work. Except this one. I bought this movie because it's a Joel Schumacher film and I was hoping for alot of extras featuring the director, but I am disappointed! I am surprised that Joel did such a dark horror film, it's a story where the good guys overcome the nazi's. I learned alot more about Hitler's Third Reich than I knew, and how that madman was capable of destroying so many lives. The movie was beautifully filmed, tastefully done. All the actors played their parts incredibly well. Even the gory scenes were done so well as to not turn me OFF completely. I'm not a horror film fan. It felt like parts of the story were missing. And because Lionsgate is all about promoting THEMSELVES we will never get to see the deleted scenes that would have defined the movie. KUDOS to you Joel Schumacher. You did GOOD. Stick with drama or comedy, tho. And get away from LIONSGATE. It's obvious they even tried to edit YOU out of the film.
BOO on you LIONSGATE for not allowing any extra features and instead putting way too many of your previews in place of a making-of featurette. There's not even a Biography section for the actors! The only thing extra is the director's commentary which is wonderful because I love to hear that wonderful old man talk!
