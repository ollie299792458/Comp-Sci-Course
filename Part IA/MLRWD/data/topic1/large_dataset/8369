Being a pilot, I can understand better the aviation perspective of that great movie. There's such a common area as "flush rivets" philosophy when it comes to have a "clean" surface that can results in faster speed. This philosophy applies to many dimensions in life, including how to deal with germs. Having seen many HH documentaries, this movie provide a nice deep feel of HH dreams, behavior and personal sides of his life.

One of the best sequence in the movie is the night flight with K Hepburn with that beautiful soundtrack. I purchased both soundtracks and carry so well the feel of the movie.

I went to see the movie three times (yes 3 times) and I'm planning to see it once more. A 3 hour movie deserves this attention. And each time I go, I discover new details.

Kate Blanchet is exquisite to portray K Hepburn; she can really provide a great feel of how it was back when they dated and married.

Although, prior to the movie, I wasn't a great fan of Leonardo, I discover his great qualities of actor to the point that, in the last part of the movie, he really looks and talks like HH. The ressemblance is astonishing.

I recommend to view this great movie and encourage every aviation enthousiasts to read more about HH, aviation, germs and life in the 30's.

I highly recommend!
