Truly an intense film with some great, great talent in front of the camera AND behind it.  The Coen brothers are to be commended for a near masterpiece, but a certain classic.

Tommy Lee Jones is very believable and realistic as the local town west Texas retiring sheriff (notice the armpit sweat in all his scenes).  Josh Brolin is SUPER as the cowboy/welder/husband who is stuck in the middle of intense drug-deal gone bad by his own desires, ego and survival know-how.  He really looks the part.

But, the REAL star, the really intense acting comes from JAVIER BARDEM.  He is exact in his portrayal of Cormac McCarthy's consumate representation of evil ("do you know how crazy you are?").  I know this won best pic for 2007, but I don't know if Bardem won for best actor or best supporting actor, BUT HE SHOULD HAVE!

It's a cat, and cat, and mouse (with a sawed-off 12g) story that is riveting as anything I've seen in a while.  Violent, action packed (but not violent for the sake of violence), well acted, well directed, well filmed, and moves like madness.  The story and characters reflect what our society of 'law and order' or lawlessness and disorder, has become.  This has become no country for old men.

4-Stars instead of 5 because of the ending.  Without anymore I would say in this review about an old "overmatched" sheriff doing the best he can do...end.
