Brilliant character study of the brand sold as Star Wars and the makers of the original film. The story of the making of this film, all the obstacles and triumphs, have become a lore to themselves, much like the history of many sports programs...and all of that is examined with the sensitivity of the after party your parents told you was for "adults only"...you're now able to see them as drunk as they were the night you were conceived...

The People Vs. George Lucas shows folks from all over the world, not just 30's Caucasian Americans, bearing their souls over their relationship to that galaxy...far...I'm under doctor's orders not to finish that sentence...

Meanwhile, Lucas himself seems to realize that he has to poop or get off the pot. Despite his success at creating a machine that could crank out SW movies at-will, he seems more comfortable doing anything but.

There's even a rumor he's gonna abandon his grand Universal-like studio facility in Marin County and just put up cheap housing.

If only Ned Tanen, the bully at Universal who was so abusive to George, (parodied by Tom Wilson in Back To The Future), could have lived to see how his bad attitude and poor business judgment not only backfired, but how it sent GL into a downward spiral that has essentially destroyed everything we loved about him and his creations from his earlier days. Citizen George? Meanwhile his films remain available and viewable indefinitely, in an age of web-based fanatic instant feedback.

Do we long for the days when one had to write a letter and put a stamp on an envelope to tell the studios how we felt about their content?

Not for kids. Lotsa profanity. Definitely Bachelors Party material for SW geeks, alongside Fanboys. Both will have you laughing until your ribs hurt. Even the strippers will sit down and laugh with you...
