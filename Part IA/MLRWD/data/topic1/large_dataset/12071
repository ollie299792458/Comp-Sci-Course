Then here you go.  I watched this movie in the theater and the first time I saw it at home was with my roomate, her boyfriend and all his tough guy, motorcycle riding, tatooed all over friends.  By the time this movie ended, all those tough guys were smiling from ear to ear trying their best to coolly state that they enjoyed the movie when you could tell they were all just as giddy as I was about it.

The best thing about this movie is that there are two points where you think it ends, then it takes off again.  I bought the DVD for myself a month ago after buying it as gifts for 3 different people.  A wonderful, wonderful story.

You'll love the cast, Angelica Houston turns in one of her best performances.  The guy who plays Leonardo DaVinci, not sure of his name, but he just steals every scene he's in.  This is just a well done, easy to watch, movie.  It's not overly ambitious but it really hits the mark it aimed for. The pseudo-euro accents are...er...a bit rough around the edges but don't let that stop you from enjoying the story.
