"Neverland" is a surprisingly charming story which speculates the origins of "Peter Pan".  SyFy is hardly known for quality original filmsn as most feature nuclear induced mutants, which makes "Neverland" all the more surprising. It speculates Peter as a kind of Oliver Twist and his lost boys as a gang of pick-pockets and thieves in 19th century London led by their Fagin-esque pimp Jimmy(Rhys Ifans) to assist in his re-insertion into London's high society. Charlie Rowe (The Golden Compass) agrees to a big score which involves stealing a crystal orb, which eventually teleports all to the Neverland where the story truly takes shape.  "Neverland" is done with surprising pannache, aided by a superb cast...Ifans is perfectly menacing as Hook.  Rowe is charming as Peter, and the film even features Keira Knightley as the voice of Tinkerbell.  The special effects are dazzling, even though not photo-realistic, and they add to the magic.  This bluray version looks fabulous.  Fine details and colors pop off the screen. Your family will love this imaginative tale.
