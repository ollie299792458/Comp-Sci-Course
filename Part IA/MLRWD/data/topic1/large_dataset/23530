I watched this DVD for the 8th time the other night and I still sit here in awe. Sure, it would not have even been close to being worthy of five stars if it wasn't for the stellar performance by Denzel Washington.  Two stars could have easily been taken away due to the fact that this storyline has been rehashed in several other films. But, his performance!! D@mn!! Very few actors can do a complete flip flop in character like Denzel has done in the movie. In the past he has played nothing other than a calm, cool and collective character. For anyone to say that he wasnt worthy of the oscar that he won for best actor needs to check themselves. Who should have won then? Russell Crowe for Beautiful Mind? The book made that movie. In that movie, Crowe played the same expressionless pasty faced character that he always plays.... just add some mumbling and fumbling in and you have Dr. Nash. Sure, Russell is a good actor but we have yet to see him take a role that will show us exactly how versatile his acting ablilities are.
