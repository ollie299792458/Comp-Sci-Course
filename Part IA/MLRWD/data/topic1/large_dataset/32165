I LOVE THIS DVD SET.  I am a beginner not knowing anything about Qigong.  I practice the moves with this DVD and I find it easy to follow.  The benefits were immediate for me, in that I am sleeping better and no more back pains.

There are about 20 some different moves to follow on the first DVD.  I am an insomniac, and struggle to go to sleep and stay asleep at nights.  So I do these exercises just before going to bed.  By the time I have completed only the first 3 moves (just 10 minutes), 1) Swimming Dragon, 2) Dragon Pearl and 3) Bau Gau Xun Doa Goung (sp?), I am soooooo relaxed, I can't stay awake to complete the rest of the other 16 moves.

But just even the 10 minutes alone are enough to knock me out.  I really do try to get through more of the other exercises, but I just can't keep my eyes open.

This DVD has helped me so much to fall asleep faster and sleep more deeply.  Also, my work is very stressful and I usually experience pain and stiffness in my back and neck.  The pain and stiffness are completely gone.  But I do have to do Qigong every night.  If I miss a night, my insomnia and painful neck and back torture me once again.

I also love the documentary that comes with it.  Gary Garipoli, the creator of this DVD, has put a lot of heart and soul into this DVD.  He even risked his own life, to hide and get beyond the Communist Chinese Military Check points, to study under these incredible Qigong Masters.  This is all in his interviews, that is also included on the DVD's.  I cannot recommend this DVD set enough.
