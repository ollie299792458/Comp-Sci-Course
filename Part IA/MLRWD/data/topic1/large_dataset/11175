Most video game adaptations have nothing in common with the games except for the title and a basic premise, Max Payne is a definite exception. This isn't  exactly like the game and it really shouldn't be, the game was almost entirely shooting and that would have gotten boring after a short while. This isn't about the mob like I was hoping it would be, but the movie doesn't suffer because of it. Max Payne the movie is a mystery thriller just like the game, it focus' more on the investigation of the deaths of Max's family. Violence is well handled, when it finally comes in heavily it's handled about as well as possible. Things like slow motion aren't used much, but they are in there. Another thing to keep in mind is that this is a somewhat funny movie (you have to like to make fun of movies a little bit). If you liked the game then this is a must see, Max Payne is better than the Resident Evil and Silent Hill adaptations. Even if you didn't play the game, if you like video games then you still will like the movie.
