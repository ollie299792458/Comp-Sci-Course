i approached this film expecting a lot (loved merhige's earlier "shadow of a vampire", and like any self-respecting middle-class suburbanite, enjoy serial killer-themed thrillers if well done.) the film has several nice elements but in the end falls prey to its biggest weaknesses -- an unfocused plot, including a credibility-stretching device cribbed from a TV show that mined similar territory, weak and uncompelling characters, and a flat ending. my view of the film wasn't helped by merhige's director commentary, an insufferable, pretentious ramble which, instead of shedding light on film-making technique and the choices he made in the film, insists on lecturing you on what you OUGHT to be feeling when you see the film in a very patronizing and laughably melodramatic and unnatural way ("and here a shot... of a torn photograph... a poor child, forgotten by the world... cold, forlorn..." [not a direct quote, but much of what he says is in that vein.]) i guess i should have known what to expect when he opens his commentary by self-consciously declaring that he doesn't see his creation as being a typical serial killer film -- which, his intellectual pretensions aside, it clearly is. having said that, the film has some interesting cinematography (bizarre camera angles and an obsession with doomy, cloud-laden horizons) and competent acting from ben kingsley, but that's about all it has going for it.
