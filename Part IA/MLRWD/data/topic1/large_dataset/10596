Alright, I've heard many good reviews of Ponyo and a few negative ones. I can definitely see what there is to like, because there is much, but I also see where the film could have fallen short in the eyes of many viewers. I am not a strong fan of anime, but my friends are. I do like anime though; I think many artists and storytellers have achieved great things through their works in anime but, for me, nothing compares to the works of Hayao Miyazaki. He seems to capture a magic in his visuals paired with his song choices and overall tone. I am a huge fan of Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Howl's Moving Castle, and I have become a fan of Ponyo. The reason I give this movie four stars is not because I do not like it, but because I felt it wasn't as strong as Miyazaki's other films. The four stars is based on a comparison which I probably should not even have made. This is why I say: if you're buying Ponyo because you love Miyazaki and you love the intricate details in the storytelling as well as the epic storyline (like Princess Mononoke), you will not get it here. This movie is more contained, simpler. Does that make it a bad movie? Heck no! On the contrary, Ponyo's simplicity is what makes it so great. It is the kind of movie that tells a simple enough story, but manages to bombard your eyes with beautiful, colorful images that are not simplistic in any way. I do recommend this movie; but don't do what I did: don't go in there expecting a two hour epic anime like Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, because it is not those movies. Allow yourself to be taken in and don't expect too much, because sometimes too much is not a good thing. Ponyo is just enough. Enjoy!
