Some people have complained that this movies ending is ambiguous and the director doesn't tell the audience whether Prot is really from K-Pax or just the delusional Robert Porter.  It's true, but that's what I found so fascinating about the movie and it's premise.
The story stars two of my favorite actors, Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges.  They put on these roles like a comfortable pair of shoes and it isn't long before we feel we've known them for years.  Every actor brings their best work to the show and you can't help but be interested and drawn into the story.  Whether you believe Prot is real or Robert Porter is just a very tortured man, there are plenty of ambiguities for everyone.
I usually like a movie to be tied up nicely and all the loose ends resolved by the time the credits role.  K-Pax is the exception.  I appreciated the director laying out the wonderful story with its drama, humor and sadness and letting us draw our own conclusions based on the events as they unfold.  
Whatever conclusion you arrive at, K-Pax will entertain you with its intelligent script, wonderful actors and must have  music.
