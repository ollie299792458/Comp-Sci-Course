I can understand why people dislike this film--If you haven't read the book you may tend to lose the theme of the story. I would not reccomend this film to the average narrow-minded fool. (you know who you are) Most of the ignorant, idiotic professional critics out there who bashed this film probably don't even know what the whole American idea of "Gonzo" journalism is. Thus, they are lost in the whole theme of the film. Only the highly intelligent film go-ers or those who are familiar with Hunter S. Thompson will get the idea. 
the acting by Depp and Del Toro is EXCELLENT, superb if you will. The Cinematography is PHENOMENAL. I haven't seen camera work this amazing since "2001:A Space Odyssey", or "A Clockwork Orange". If you like great acting, genuine humor, rampant drug use, and exquisite cinematography in a film, then by all means buy this DVD. Otherwise, stick to titles like "The Matrix" or "Titanic" for your mindless and predictable Hollywood cinema.
