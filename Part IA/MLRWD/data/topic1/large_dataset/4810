This movie is kind of drab, monotonous and uninteresting. All of the wonder, magic and thrills of the first film (a masterpiece) are gone. Instead we get Malcolm thrown on an island with a some totally uninteresting characters (including his girlfriend and daughter, but especially everyone else), in a dark barrage of somehow boring dino action scenes. Not much in this movie stands out, as opposed to the original where every scene was uniquely captivating. This movie just doesn't have a spark to it.

Ian Malcolm made a great character in Jurassic Park. He had a big impact in a small role. Here, he's in the lead, and either the character isn't cut out for it or the writing wasn't done in the right way to make it work. 'Cus it doesn't work. He's boring here. The whole movie is boring. Even the dinosaurs are boring. It just never takes off the ground. I can't say I cared for the book version either, I still haven't managed to read it completely. But it's pretty funny that the movie combined two characters to form Malcolm's super-gymnist daughter. Why didn't they use two seperate kids? One kid is lonely. One kid doesn't work.

And the ending. Dear Lord. The T-Rex flying down a city street destroyed whatever sense of integrity and wonder this movie had. They made the T-Rex mundane somehow by bringing it into the every day world. It was just cheap, cheesy, and sucked any enjoyment out of the film. Bah.

So, it wasn't too great of a movie. Sadly, in comparison to Jurassic Park 3, it's brilliant.
