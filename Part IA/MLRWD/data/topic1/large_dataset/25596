I bought this DVD for my wife, as she loves romances whereas I normally love action and sci-fi. But I also think very highly of Robin Williams, having enjoyed his performances in GOOD MORNING VIETNAM and DEAD POETS  SOCIETY(and I'm a closet MORK AND MINDY fan!), so I watched it with her,  and I was surprised that I ended up enjoying this movie so much! The story  tells of a man named Chris, played by the brilliant Robin Williams, who  dies in a road accident and goes to Heaven, which is his own personal  Heaven, in one of his wife's unfinished paintings. His wife Annie(Annabella  Sciorra), who has suffered the loss of their children with him in the past,  is so devastated she kills herself and descends into Hell. Cuba Gooding Jnr  plays a jovial Heaven 'guide', who shows Chris around and what he can  create for himself, but this stiry proves that he loves Annie so much he  would, quite literally, endure hell to be with her again. This movie had it  all - spectacular visual effects depicting heaven and hell, brilliant  performances all round(Robin Williams makes any movie he does worth  watching, with the possible exception of that turkey called NINE MONTHS)  and a story that will make you think about life in a different angle. The  inverted cathedral images of Hell were an imaginative touch, along with the  sea of faces and Max Von Sydow as a kind of dark man, or tracker, leading  Williams into Hell. Watch this film with someone you love, and you'll  appreciate each other more! It's unusual for me to rate a film of this type  so high, but there you go. Don't miss it.
