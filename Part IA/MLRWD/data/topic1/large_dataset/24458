The 1974 Great Gatsby movie is a vivid portrayal of the book written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The movie follows the book fairly accurately, with only some deviations from the novel. Robert Redford (Gatsby) and Mia Farrow (Daisy) do an excellent job of representing their characters as described in the book. I was disappointed in the character representation of Myrtle Wilson and Tom Buchanan, but was otherwise pleased with the actors. I liked the actress that played Jordan Baker and the actor that played Nick Carraway, and felt that they stuck to their characters as explained in the book.

The movie depicts the decade of the 1920s very well. From the costumes to the scenery to the cars, the 1920s is definitely alive in this movie. At Jay Gatsby's parties, you can really see the culture of the 1920s at its fullest. It is interesting to see the "flapper" girls and the Charleston dance steps. Even the hairstyles of the women highly parallel traditional 1920s styles.

I can't necessarily say that the movie was better than the novel, but then again, that is usually the case with movies made from books. I suggest reading the book first and watching the movie second to reinforce the knowledge gained by it. Overall, the movie is a strong and realistic portrait of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel.
