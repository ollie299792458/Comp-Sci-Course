I rate this movie very high. Although I am reasonably informed about WWII, I had little knowledge of this saturation raid on Dresden.  I thought the movie did a good job of balancing all sides and showed the physical and human toll caused by bombing a heavily populated, beautiful city.  I was awed by the realistic portrayal of the destruction of the city and the civilian suffering.  I have no idea how they managed all the effects and recreated the city of 1945 so realistically.

At the heart of the movie was a love story. Perhaps a bit like the  Titanic in that since. However, how better to bring home the emotional trauma of the war.  No movie today about such subjects can avoid controversy. However, I think this was a great movie and showed dramatically how stupid war is. Why do we continuously go to war? Regular people on all sides that could be friends fighting due to misguided leadership on one side or both sides.

Exposing the destruction and horrors of war is worthwhile in itself. Watching this and also reading about the napalm bombing of Japan should convince all that wars are to be avoided.

A friend of mine who was in the Marines noted that wars are started by those who have never been in one. He was shot twice.
