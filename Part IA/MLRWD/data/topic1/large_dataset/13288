Casey is the high school physics geek who yearns to be an Ice Princess and succeeds in her dream by applying her knowledge of physics to her skating.  Her college-obsessed Mom rejects her ambition because Casey's "destiny" is to win a physics scholarship and attend Harvard.  During the film Casey almost misses her trials due to a reception for Harvard applicants and ultimately "blows her shot" at Harvard by walking out of her interview to go to the skating finals.

A decent, if cliche ridden film good for little kids.  My daughters loved it.

But----and this is a big but give it three stars for pounding the kids with the message that you cannot be a star athlete (figure skater) and a good student.  That you cannot attend an elite college and be a champion - you MUST give up you brain for brawn.

Apparently the producer and director have never heard of two-time Olympic figure skating champion and five time world champion Dick Button, or Olympic medalists including Paul Wylie, two-time Olympic champion Tenley Albright, John Mischa Petkovich, or earlier Olympic champions like Hugh Graham, Franklin Nelson or back in 1920 - Nathaniel Niles.  What do they all have in common?  All Harvard graduates who went on to professional skating careers, as well as law school, medical school etc. etc.

A horrible message to send kids - particularly when Harvard's connection to figure skating is so well known that this element of the plot line seems almost a calculated deceit.
