Johnny Deep gave one of his best preformances in this hilarious and somewhat sad satire about a non-bankable second generation director. The remarkable thing about this movie is not just quick biopic about a person as said by his collegues, but Johnny Depp actually potrays perfectly the role of Ed Wood at play. How he spoke to actors, his craft, and every thing that shed a bit of light on what Ed Wood was thinking when directing his so-called 'masterpiece. I was easily ammused by the black-and white shot of the entire movie and how it gave that feel of Ed Wood's filmmaking era.

The acting was top notch, both from Depp and supporting actor, Bill Murray. I wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made, but it is one of the best i've seen simply because it goes even deeper into Hollywood and exploits the glitz and glamour for what it is.

This is a potrayal of the man who was actually dubbed Worst Dirctor. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it or rent it. If you like 'Ed Wood', then glance through 'Simone' starring Al Pachino as a failed filmmaker who creates a computerized actress that becomes a box-office smash.
