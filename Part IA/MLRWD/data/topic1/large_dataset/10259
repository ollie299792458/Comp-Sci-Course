Not many Americans knew much about Preston Tucker or his car before this movie came out. Since 1988 enough people became aware of both to send the value of the remaining Tucker 48's skyrocketing, assuring I'll never now own one!

This is an enjoyable movie for a car guy with numerous biographical details, good sets, costumes, and acting by Jeff Bridges that threatens to go just over the top. It's too bad that Coppola chose to beat the sterotypical "small guy with a big heart gets ground down by the big guy" horse. But good drama needs a protagonist and an antagonist, and that conspiratorical angle to be expected from Hollywood, USA. I learned a long time ago not to go to the movie theatre for a history lesson.

Fact is that Tucker tried too quickly to bring an underdeveloped product to market with an undercapitalized company. In only a few short years, much bigger companies with established product lines (Nash, Packard, Hudson, Kaiser, Studebaker, etc.) would all suffer the same fate his did.

Still, there were rumors this DVD was going out of print. Does that mean that a 20th anniversary edition is in the works?
