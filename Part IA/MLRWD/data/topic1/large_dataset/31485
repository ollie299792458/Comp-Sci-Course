This version of Emma is wonderful.  It stays true to the original story completely, and a movie based on a Jane Austen novel must do that to be any good.  Emma is the daughter of a wealthy man in good social status in the small town of Highbury.  In the beginning her governess( Miss Taylor) is getting married to a  man of great social stature.  Emma had played matchmaker and considers the wedding her own achievement.  Her friend Mr. Nightly tells her she simply made a lucky guess and nothing more.  However her mind does not change and she is determined to find (the minister) Mr. Elton a bride as well.  Her mind is made up when she meets sweet simple Miss Harriet Smith the natural daughter of someone and not that respectable.  Once she and Harriet become friends, Harriet is proposed to by a farmer(from Mr. Nightly's estate)named Robert Martin.  Emma convinces Harriet to refuse him because her is below her station.  Nightly tells her she has not done her friend a service.  Harriet is later rejected by Mr. Elton because he loves Emma.  When Emma finds out she is shocked, and tells off Mr. Elton who storms away.  He later marries a woman named Augusta for her money.  Harriet eventually marries Robert Martin.  Emma likes a man named Frank Churchill for a while ,but he was secretly betrothed to another girl(Jane Fairfax).  Then she realises that the man for her is Nightly and marries him to live happily ever after.  And we hope never to make another match.
