I remember when I was a little kid seeing this movie for the first time in theaters. I loved every moment of it. It was one of those films that really left an imprint on my childhood. Growing up I so wanted to watch it again, but Disney wasn't releasing it on video. It wasn't until 1996 that Disney decided to release this under-appreciated gem.

Having watched it again as an adult, does it hold the same magic. In a sense, yes. The story is a beautiful one, full of charm, inspired by Dicken's classic, Oliver Twist. Instead of using an orphan boy, this movie focuses on an orphan cat named, - you guessed it - Oliver! The story of his friendship with the dogs and the homeless man Fagen, along with the conflict created by being adopted by a new pet-owner, Jenny, creates a fun and touching story. Billy Joel is amazing, full of flare, as the dog Dodger. Cheech Marine does a great job as the yappy Chihuahua Tito. My favorite character in the film is Francis, the English Bulldog who can quote Shakespeare. The villain in this film is one of the scariest villains in a Disney pictures, Sykes, a ruthless loan shark who seems too close to reality for comfort.

So, with great characterization, witty humor and classy songs, why is this movie only four stars instead of five? It's because as an adult, as much as I love it, it left me wanting just a little more. I fell so in love with the gang of dogs, and Oliver, and Fagan that I would have loved more screen time to develop these characters. The transition between Fagan to Jenny happened way too early in the film. I understand that since this movie is geared towards younger children that they had to keep it shorter, but I don't think it would have hurt to have had fifteen more minutes of screen time for developing the above said characters. On the contrary, I think it would have worked wonders.

Still, all in all, this is a fun-filled film, a gem, and an underrated Disney film.
