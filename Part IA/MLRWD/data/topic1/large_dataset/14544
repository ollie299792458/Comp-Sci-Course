I love the musical RENT. I've seen it a bunch of times, and I've loved every minute of it, happy to suspend disbelief and get swept up in the journey that is the musical.

The music is great, the cast are great, sure, it's a derpressing topic or bunch of topics at best, and the music is such a huge disjointed juxtaposition to the cast of characters' situations, but it works, and it is entertaining.

I love the movie RENT. I've watched it a bunch of times, and I love the music. I don't love the acting, I don't love the direction. The scenery is great, the sets perfect. Chris Columbus gives us such a strerile, clean-cut version of this gritty musical, and he takes away any sense of the original's 'urban sensibility'.

My point is this: RENT is a bit of a funny beast. Everyone has a situation that the everyday person would consider quite difficult. Everyone has AIDS (sorry for the Team America reference...), or is unemployed (but not willing to work), or is addicted to drugs. So, of course, the obvious thing to do would be to sing and dance. I know, it's obvious, it's a musical, but there's not one reference to prevention, only a fleeting reference to medication/rehabilitation, and one thinly veiled symbol of contraception.

I love the music. The soundtrack is fantastically produced and sounds magnificent, the film looks great, but unfortunately lacks a certain filmic smoothness needed to acheive the realness to allow us to truly suspend disbelief.

I love the music in RENT, and that's pretty much it.

5 stars for the soundtrack, 2 stars for the movie.
