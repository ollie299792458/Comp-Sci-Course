The new Special Edition DVD offers very little in the way of extra features, despite the fancy two-disc packaging.  However, the film itself has been remastered in a new transfer that's superior to any previous video release.  Although this film has long been available on DVD, this new version is far superior.  If you have a widescreen 16x9 display you will really notice the improvement.

I was expecting more in the way of extras, but all you get is an audio commentary by the cinematographer and a film historian; and then a second disc which has nothing but several rough cut scenes and a trailer.  That's it.

There are certain aspects of the plot that have never completely made sense to me, and I was hoping there might be some material that would explain how the story was developed, but no such luck.

I saw this movie when it opened in 1978, and I thought it was an antiwar film.  I was very surprised when I heard some people denouncing it as fascist and pro-war.  I suppose you see what you're looking for, I guess.  I'm aware that Michael Cimino is has strong right-wing views, and they're obvious in some of the other movies he's worked on, but I think Deer Hunter can be interpreted in a variety of ways.

This was the first dramatic film to deal with the Vietnam war, and it was released only three years after the fall of Saigon.  It had to tread lightly; the wounds were still fresh (and they are still very much with us today).
