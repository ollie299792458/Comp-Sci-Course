While many movie historians claimed it would never happen,  Hollywood has finally delivered a movie worse than Ed Wood's Plan Nine From Outer Space after fifty years of trying .  David Zucker has written, directed and produce a movie that is a hysterically unfunny and offensive. A triple crown in move making failure.

  When the local video store was giving away this box office bomb with purchase of a candy bar,  I had very low expectations for this DVD.  And David Zucker delivered.  American Carol is the Citizen Kane of bad movies.

  The only entertaining feature of the film was trying to name all the washed up actors in the film.  All giving the worst performance of their careers including Kelsey Grammer. Even Ann Coulter with her adams apple could have portrayed George Patton with little bit more machismo. And poor Kevin Farley.  This film will boast his career like Showgirls did for Elizabeth Berkley career.  Not to be all negative.  The ACLU lawyers were the best zombies since the studio audience of the ill fated Rush Limbaugh television show.

  I could deal the dozens of fat jokes and racist stereotypes. But to suggest that JFK would give his stamp of approval for the last eight years of shame by the Bush administration is going way off of the deep end of reality.

  David Zucker is a Leni Riefenstahl wanna be by suggesting Michael Moore only doing movies about the "good things" about American. In fact the concert headed by some talentless hack of a singer at the end of the film reminds me of scene right of the Triumph of the Will.

  I like to send the American Carol DVD to a fiery grave, but I do not want to contribute to global warming. So I plan to recycle it.
