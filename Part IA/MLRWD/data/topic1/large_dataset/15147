The question of the civil rights of glbtq persons to marry under state and US Constitutions has been, and is still, a hot button issue for many people. Whether you agree or disagree with that idea, one should be alarmed that any religious group should have the right to impose their views on persons not of their faith community.

"8: the Mormon Proposition" looks at how The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints raised monies to influence voters in California in opposition to a ruling by the California State Supreme Court that held that civil marriage was the right of everyone...glbtq or straight. Of course the Mormon church wasn't the only religious group opposing marriage equality...the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic Fraternal organization, contributed over $1,000,000 toward that effort too, but the Mormon church contributed the majority of the funds to overturn the ruling, and became the poster child for intolerance and inequality. This is interesting, and somewhat mindblowing, considering the intolerance that Mormons have had to contend with over the past almost 200 years of their institutional existence.

"8: The Mormon Proposition" is an excellent film, and great discussion starter about the role of religion and civil rights in the US today.
