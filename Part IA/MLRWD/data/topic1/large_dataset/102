When I first saw this movie on the Disney Channel late one night, I fell in love with it, though I only saw about 2/3rds of it. A few months after that I found a "What Goonie are you?" quiz on a site and decided right away I wanted to get the movie so I could see it all. I bought the VHS and when that didn't work in any VCR I was pretty upset. I returned it and about 3 days later I found the DVD ... so I *had* to get it. I ADORE the scene with the Truffle Shuffle and Mouth in Spanish. Heh, gotta love Corey Feldman :). The commentary is great! I loved seeing all the actors as they are now! Too bad Sean left in the middle of it. The deleted scenes are terrific, I actually saw the octopus scene on the Disney channel, I didn't know it was cut from the original movie. Hopefully they will put Goonies back in theaters one day, then I shall ...drag all my friends along when I go see it >:). I annoy them every day by quoting Mouth or by talking about my favorite scenes. I even memorised the Goonies Oath. Well, all in all, The Goonies is a GREAT, timeless movie that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime... or they can watch it everyday like I do. :)
