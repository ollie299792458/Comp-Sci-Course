Having read a large number of books for my 1st pregnancy, I decided to buy this one for the second - in spite of the overall poor reviews.  I, like others, was intrigued by the epigenetic discussion and had heard good things about the YOU books in general.  I was sorely disappointed.  For starters the epigenetic discussion is not only short, but  confusing and failed to differentiate between things that were clinically proven to promote epigenetic changes (for instance smoking) from those that are merely the authors hypothesis (i.e., unhealthy eating in general).  The end result was the conclusion on the epigenetic section read more like the "What to expect" best odds concept - we-have-no-proof-but-why-don't-we-try-to-make-you-do-these-things-anyway...

The strength of this book is that it does go into substantial detail on the changes taking place in your body due to pregnancy.  The discussion on hormonal changes, fetal growth etc. are the most detailed I have read in any pregnancy book.  Unfortunately, the same descriptions are sprinkled with gratuitous sarcastic comments which are either disturbing to anyone who believes woman have half a brain or someone with an actual sense of humor.  In the interest of gathering the information I tried to ignore these BUT...I did put down the Kindle more than once because I could not go one.

The weakness of the book is that in addition to the medical detail, it tries to rapidly cover the typical pregnancy book topics - what to buy the for baby, how to prepare, how to chose an OB/GYN etc.  These are covered in much less detail than other better books and read like a last minute add on.

If you are interested in medical details this book is excellent with the caveat of the annoying comments.  If you want a good general pregnancy book, this certainly is not it.  For people interested in non condescending detail as well as a high quality general guide, "I'm Pregnant" by Leslie Regan (a DK book) is excellent.
