Ms. Delpy obviously likes Woody Allen movies very much.
Her character in this movie of hers reminded of Annie, from Woody Allen's movie "Annie Hall", of course.

The dialogue sounded as if from an Allen movie. That would explain the glasses she wears. An homage to Mr. Allen.

The movie is very funny in its American v. French ideas.
Ms. Delpy played all of that up to its funniest.
I love her social consciousness thing. Bemoaning the ugly things of the world, but not being able to do a thing about it other than to only get angry at people.
That was beautiful really. Because it was the way some women might deal with these things.

Last thing, this movie is also good for fans of "Before Sunrise" and "Before Sunset".
One gets to see/imagine what Celine might have been up to in the nine years she was not with Jesse.

I downloaded this movie from Amazon's Video On Demand. Excellent service.
No need to run out to the video store or run outside to your mailbox.
