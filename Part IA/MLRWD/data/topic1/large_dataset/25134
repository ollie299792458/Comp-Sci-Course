If you are looking for a life changing view at war and at the WWII, bone chilling never before seen footage and absolutely unbelievable stories told by those who lived through the toughest and the bloodiest years in the history of man kind, this is the documentary for you. I'm a HUGE WWII buff (i've seen hundreds of WWII documentaries) and i believe every person on the planest should be interested in this part of our history, to be educated enough so these horrors don't ever happen again. In this documentary u'll find yourself asking "how is this person still alive to tell their story right now?!" and if u have anything more than a stone in your chest, u'll find yourself shredding a tear or two as well.
Overall, please buy this documentary, it's EYE OPENING, BONE CHILLING, REAL, TOUCHING, UNBELIEVABLE... told by those who experienced the war first hand only 30 years after it was over, so it's very emotional for them and for you and the stories didn't have time to be changed by person to person telling...
THIS IS AS GOOD AND AS REAL AS IT GETS  100*
