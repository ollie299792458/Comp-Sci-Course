The Coens' Masterwork merits a place in the upper echelon of hysteria and oblique humour.  The near cameo placement of Bruce Campbell is a wonderful homage, and my only regret is the utterly overplayed role of Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Her character's treatment is admirable but the vocal 240 wpm is a bit grating at times.  Notice Steve Buscemi survives an appearance in a Coen Bros. film also!  His hepcat/beatster bartender is in no way murdered!  Go figure.  Robbins is as always, delightful, and Paul Newman is in high form and cast perfectly as the embodiment of corporate greed with Hudsucker Industries.  The plot of "use and discard a substitute to plummet stock value and swoop in and buy company on the ...[low cost]-gone wrong" is most definitely entertaining.  And the narration breaks are fantastic, probably the best edited film of the mid-90's.  A must have for any connisuer of the Coens.  A great New Years flick (for obvious reasons) that sort of hearkens back to the days of William Powell and the Thin Man series.  Only our hero is a paradoxical "genius"; not a decisive, witty highball swilling madman.  Watch it twice for the subtleties.
