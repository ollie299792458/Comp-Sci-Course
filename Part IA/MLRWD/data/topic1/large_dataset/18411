I disagree with the person saying that "Ireland was not a colony". A tactic of imperial powers has historically been to legitimise their rule over a colony by officially annexing the territory into the state. That allows them to say afterwards that such a place is not a colony but part of the overall stste etc. England (the predecessor the Britain) conquered Ireland in 1169 because a traitor called Dermot McMurrough (also known as Dermot na Gal - Dermot of the Foreigners) invited them in during a power struggle with the High King of Ireland Rory O'Connor.

I also object to the claim made by a user from Houston TX that Collins was a terrorist. Most countries on the map today would not exist today but for insurrection against an imperial power e.g. South and Central America broke away from Spain, the US broke away from Britain, African countries often only became independent after revolts. In the main, the Old IRA (1919-21) as distinct from the later IRA's (Anti-Treaty IRA, CIRA, RIRA, PIRA) did not target civilians. It is true that collaborators with the British government were targetted. However, the same was true in Vichy France where the French Resistance attacked collaborators with the regime. I think that a right to insurrection exists where a people are being oppressed.
