As the owner of a spiritual (new age/metaphysical) store, I found this movie to be very interesting and informative.  Upon receiving the movie I watched only the movie portion.  One of the psychics at my shop borrowed it and viewed the entire dvd.  She watched the interviews and how the movie was produced before watching the movie.  Upon returning the dvd she told me that the informative section of the dvd was extremely helpful in understanding the entire movie and enabled her to realize that the actors were not just acting but truely believed and practiced what they are acting out.  I rewatched the entire dvd and agree with her assessment.

Another psychic at my shop told me that it "depicts how I see many of my visions."  Everyone I know that has seen the movie, and I, agree that the  movie accurately portrays the personal Aura (energy field)that surrounds us all.  The lesson about the inner energy that we all posses has been withheld from the general population for a few thousand years.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is curious about their spiritualiy or is dissatisfied or feels incomplete with their current belief system.  View this movie with an open mind that all things are possible and when it is over see how you feel.
