I know that a lot of folks don't necessarily give Kurosawa's later works their proper due.  Choosing to focus on his earlier masterworks like Seven Samurai, Ikiru, Yojimbo, Throne of Blood, The Bad Sleep Well, Stray Dog, etc, which are indeed astounding films.  However, Ran should not be overlooked in the slightest.  Without going into the nitty gritty of the piece it is basically a transposition of King Lear into a period of feudel Japanese history with the notable difference being the presence of three sons rather than daughters.  It is a film of epic scope and contains within a final five minutes that could most likely bring tears to the eye.  Aesthetically, this film is unmatched.  It is gorgeous, colorful and vibrant and yet incredibly dark and cynical.  Humanity does not get any gold stars in this one and justifiably so.  Criterion films are very expensive but as is the case for most of them this one is worth every single penny.  The image and sound are both pristine.  The audio commentary is insightful and Chris Marker's documentary tone poem on disc 2 is worth the cost in and of itself.  As a package it is absolutely stunning.  To say much more would be superfluous as the film is epic, yet intimate, emotionally driven, yet possessed of one the most heart stopping battle sequences I have seen committed to film.  For once you feel the tragedy.  If you are a fan of Kurosawa but haven't explored his later works then do yourself a favor and pick this one up.  IF you are brand new to his work I might start elsewhere with something a little less stylized like Ikiru or Seven Samurai but keep this one high on the list because it is without a doubt another one of his masterworks.
