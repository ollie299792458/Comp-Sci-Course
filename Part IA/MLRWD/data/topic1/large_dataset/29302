I'm probably a little late coming in on this. I did not see Polar Express when it came out in theaters. I offered to take my children, and they weren't interested for some reason. We first saw it when we watched it at home after our Thanksgiving meal. What a perfect way to kick off the Christmas season. I was planning to turn it on for the kids and then leave the room, but I was hooked right away and we were all mesmerized throughout the movie. It is beautiful, exciting and touching all at the same time. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I fell in love with this movie. It really is in a league of it's own for Christmas movies. The music is also wonderful. I have purchased the soundtrack and it will become a Christmas classic along with the movie. I NEVER cry at a movie, but if you don't get misty-eyed during 'When Christmas Comes to Town' or 'Believe' then you have to be made of stone. No one will regret having this in their collection to pull out every year and re-live the magic. I think we will probably watch it every Thanksgiving night to kick off the season from now on. Usually when I purchase a DVD, I think long and hard about how often I will really watch it and if it will be worth the cost. I didn't think twice about this one. I am very proud to own this DVD and know it will bring many, many years of joy.
