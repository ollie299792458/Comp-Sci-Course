Sooner or later, every horror film fan returns to the sources of the genre. The Universal Monster movies produced between 1923 and 1936 are among the very best of these. During this period, the Laemmle family still ran Universal Pictures. Under their stewardship, horror films received a certain cachet -- along with big budgets, great directors, great actors and lavish production values -- on par with other A-list pictures of the time. Only a handful of Universal's horror pictures made after this "Golden Age" match the high quality of their famous predecessors. "The Wolf Man" (1941) is one of the very few to succeed.

Prior to watching this film for the first time, I'd only ever seen Lon Chaney Jr. shamble through the low-rent "Mummy" sequels and the rather poor "Son of Dracula." However, his performance in "The Wolf Man" is an utter revelation! Here, his acting isn't subtle and nuanced (although Claude Rains's is), but it is heartfelt (and heart-rending). It's difficult not to like him in this and I found myself genuinely feeling for his plight; hoping-against-hope that he'd find a way to beat the werewolf curse that had been thrust upon him unawares. Alas, by the end of the movie... well, it's a really good ending. So good, in fact, that Universal kept the Wolf Man around for four more movies. Personally, I don't need to see 'em. I'm perfectly happy with this movie right here!

That's a good thing too, since "The Wolf Man" is the only movie you're gonna get if you buy the two-disc Universal Legacy Series edition. Disc one contains the film (in an astonishingly clear transfer) along with an amusing commentary by film historian, Tom Weaver, a poster/still slideshow and a short documentary hosted by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024FADD8">American Werewolf in London Special Edition</a> director, John Landis. Disc two contains a short werewolf documentary, a documentary about Universal makeup legend, Jack Pierce, and the surprisingly non-fluffy (and occasionally disturbing) feature-length "Universal Horror" documentary. Owners of the Universal Legacy Series editions of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GPIPSS">Dracula (75th Anniversary Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BD9F8">The Mummy (Special Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)</a> may be tempted to stomp all over this disc since they'll already own one -- or both -- of these last two documentaries, but then they'd be crushing a rather welcome biography of Lon Chaney Jr. exclusive to this release (so far). Otherwise, this is a pretty amazing little set for an essential film in the Universal horror canon.

As far as my Amazon ordering experience went, I am grateful every day that we live in an age where items like this can be easily obtained online. In the wake of the recent remake, I had hoped to snag a copy of this DVD from local retail shops, only to be told that it wasn't in stock; quite a quandary considering Universal are *not* a notoriously small studio and "The Wolf Man" is a fairly major horror classic. Despite promises they could "order it in" for me within four-to-six weeks (at an average cost of $30 Cdn), I opted to order it from Amazon instead. The DVD arrived in my mailbox three days later (and for $10 less than the local retail price).
