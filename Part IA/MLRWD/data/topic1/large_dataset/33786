"Who's That Girl" is one of Madonna's most entertaining pictures to date. Unfortunately, the film was ignored by critics and audiences alike upon its release in the summer of 1987. This was one of Madonna's best  periods. She wrote four outstanding songs for the soundtrack that would  also be ignored by Madonna, herself, in later years. "Who's That  Girl" and "Causing a Commotion" reached No.1 and No.2,  respectively, but they weren't to be found on THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION.  "The Look of Love," meanwhile, has stood the test of time as one  of her most achingly beautiful ballads, yet she FORGOT to include it on her  ballads collection, SOMETHING TO REMEMBER. Go figure. The picture itself is  a noisy screwball comedy that is hysterically funny. One of the best lines  in the film (and there are many great ones) is "What's the patient's  name?"  "Loudon."  "Loudon what?"  "Clear." LOL. It makes me giddy just thinking about it. I should  note, however, that, while WHO'S THAT GIRL is funnier than DESPERATELY  SEEKING SUSAN, it is not a better movie. DSS is still Madonna's best  performance and she is not playing herself in either movie. The only  pictures where Madonna is playing herself are VISION QUEST and TRUTH OR  DARE. Got it?
