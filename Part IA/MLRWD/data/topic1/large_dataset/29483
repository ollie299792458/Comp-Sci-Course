tHIS DOUBLE DISC release has plenty of goodies to keep the fans occupied for a while. The picture quality is swell i must say. Especially on a widescreen telly. It's not john's best pic but it's  an enjoyable one with great tongue in cheek kurt russell performance. THe action set pieces are excellent too. It's homage to great martial arts films down the years. Carpenter mentions this  in his commentary, names a couple of old films he was influenced by. 
THe commentary is a good laugh, kurt and john reminiscing about the time they made it (fall and xmas 85). When they see an actor one says to the other 'so, what's denis dun up to now' and the other says ' oh he's doing well, in a tv show' and you can tell they don't really give a fiddler's. Kurt admits that he hadn't seen the film of late..'it's great to see the film cause i hadn't seen it in a while, you know, ..hey..i hadn't seen it since it came out' Kurt is quite giddy throughout, often bursting into laughter at the slightest prompting. You can tell this guy laughs at his own jokes a lot. It's obvious that the two didn't script this commentary because they break off into tangents a lot. John mentions that his son Cody loved the movie when it came out and this precipitates a 5 minute dialogue about their sprogs.John boasts 'Yeah, Cody is surpassing me at the keyboards, he's really good.' and Kurt counters ' Yeah my kid is into the whole Led Zeppelin thing on guitar, he's gettin' real good now' and John retreats '.. ok, anyway getting back to big trouble...' and Kurt laughs uncontrollably. It's easy on the ear, so it is.
The other extras are fairly interesting, some alternate scenes and an extended ending, nothing too exciting here, some stuff about the effects, a featurette, some trailers, and best of all the 1986 music video of the title song performed by John Carpenter and friends. It's bad. So bad i had to watch it 5 times.
Enjoy!!
