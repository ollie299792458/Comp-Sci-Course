Never in my life has a movie had such a mind-blowing effect on me as when I watched Apocalypse Now. A movie that starts off promising to be a Full Metal Jacket clone, but becomes more and more until you want to peel off your clothes and go carve an idol of Marlon Brando to sacrifice animals to.

Apocalypse Now has the largest collection of unique characters I've seen in a movie so far, from the introspective, bland assassin Willard to the charismatic, surf-happy Kilgore, all the way to Marlon Brando's jungle god, Colonel Kurtz.

This is not only the single best Vietnam movie ever, but beats out every other war film I've seen thus far. Perhaps the much talked-about forthcoming Tarantino war flick will rival it, but that remains to be seen. This movie is more than a collection of dramatic deaths, heroic triumphs, and inevitable victory. Why? Because it doesn't have any of these things. There's not a single hero in the movie, not one redeeming quality among any of the characters. Nevertheless, we are compelled to watch as Willard and his crew make their way up the river through every obstacle until they find the new Gomorrah which Brando has established around himself.

Beside the visceral disgust and terror you will feel, the amazement at the sounds and color, or the rich characters in the movie, it will leave you with the most profound sense of disillusionment and terror possible from a movie.
