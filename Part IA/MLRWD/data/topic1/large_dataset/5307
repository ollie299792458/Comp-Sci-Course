The screen version of Michael Bennett's landmark Broadway musical lets the audience experience the struggle, anxiety and triumph of a group of dancers auditiong for the chorus of a Broadway show.
  This is a classic and not  to be missed.  One of the best "backstage musicals films" ever  made. Michael Douglas soft-shoes 16 dancers through a grueling audition to  Marvin Hamlisch's Oscar nominated music and Jeffrey [Flashdance] Hornaday's  sizzling, synergistic  choreography. 
  The cast is excellent most  notably, Michael [Chaplin] Blevins, who brings charming honesty to the role  of 17 year old Mark, the youngest dancer on the line.  Other fine  performances are given by Gregg Burge, Audrey Landers, Nicole Fosse, and  Terrence Mann. For such excellent dancers they all bring great credibility  to their respective acting  roles. 
Oscar winning director Richard  Attenborough heads-up this dazzling three-time Academy Award nominated  adaptation of Broadway's long running musical that received nine Tony  awards and the Pulitzer Prize. Attneborough gracefully blends big  production numbers with intimate moments.  
This movie is so enjoyable  to watch because the transition from stage to screen is smooth and  entertaining. Afterall, the New York Times called the film :
 "A  single burst of breathtaking inspiration!" -New York Times 
The  Dance and Theatre critics raved about it:
  "It is the best dance  film, and for that matter, the best movie musical for years!" -Clive  Barnes, New York Post
 "...exhilarating...one of the year's best  pictures..." -Jeffrey Lyons, Sneak Previews, INN 
 This is a Great  White Way phenomenon. Join the chorus of this high-stepping piece of  celluloid - it is truly "One Singular Sensation"!
