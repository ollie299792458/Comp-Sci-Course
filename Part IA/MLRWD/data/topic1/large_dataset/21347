I really like this movie, so I enjoy viewing the special features on this DVD.  However, I wish there were more.  On YouTube I discovered a deleted scene (Kiran grilling Jaya and Lalita about their family connections during their vacation at Goa), bloopers, and the version of  "Show Me The Way, Take Me To Love" with the character of Darcy singing.  These are not included on this DVD.  Even so, I appreciate how the director/writer's & co-writer's commentary provided cultural & personal references as well as charming anecdotes about the production of the movie.  Also interesting are the director's brief descriptions of the Bollywood style of filmmaking and her desire to and difficulties in making this film a balance of Bollywood and Hollywood (Eastern & Western) styles.  "The Making of Bride & Prejudice" feature is delightful to watch with insightful interviews.  "The Crew Does the Songs" shows hilarious footage of the crew singing and dancing once the filming of a musical number is completed. Much like the movie, there is an infusion of joy and fun in the special features which makes viewing this DVD a delight.
