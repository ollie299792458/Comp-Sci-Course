I didn't have very high expectations for this movie, but it totally surprised me. Most movies about dysfunctional families completely bore me, because the characters are usually as pathetic in the end as they are in the beginning. Not so here. All of them have secrets which they think are so terrible, they hide them from each other; while bickering with and attacking each other, afraid they will be found out, and rejected.
The plot keeps thickening as their secrets grow, until in one hilarious final scene the truth all comes out. And in the end, they all realize that the secret each has been hiding is found to be so insignificant and forgivable by everyone else, that they come to see how much they all love one another. I know... this may sound a little like too much of a feel good movie, but it all unfolds so amazingly naturally, it's definitely not what I'd call one of those soppy movies.
This movie turned out to be one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time, because the humor is not forced or contrived. As Shakespeare said, "comedy is tragedy", and there was a lot to laugh at here. And yet, when you can laugh at something you thought was so tragic, it stops being so tragic. I'll just say that after watching this movie, I went to bed with a big smile on my face.
