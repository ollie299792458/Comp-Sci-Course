Here's why:

First, a great character driven story with a positive message.  The heroes in this story don't start out as heroes at all.  Sid is an annoying and rather pathetic sloth who is left behind when all his friends migrate.  Manfred is a mammoth with "issues" who at the beginning is walking the wrong way for some reason.  Why?  Does the scene with the moving cave drawings explain this?  Was his wife and offspring killed, and was he walking the wrong way to end his own life?  Diego the sabertooth tiger is an order following killer on a mission.

Each of these characters grow beyond themselves to save a human baby.  Sid assumes responsiblity and develops courage.  Diego learns to think for himself and do the right thing.  Manfred overcomes his grief and self-centerdness and endures all kinds of trials to save a baby who may grow up to be a hunter of mammoths.  This is a story how anyone, regardless of how non-heroic they may be, can rise above themselves and do what is right when they have to.

Second, this DVD lets you watch the movie five different ways: Widescreen, Fullscreen, "Nutty Movie" mode where you can watch the deleted scenes as if they'd been spliced back into the movie, commentary mode, and "extreme cool" mode where you watch the movie in a window while documentary material plays in another window.  How cool is that?

Third, the deleted scenes are actually very interesting.  They have their own commentary too.  Sylvia is a great character (a sloth girlfriend of Sid's) who was going to be in the movie but was cut out and replaced.  The commentary tells why.

Fourth, the two shorts are great.  Gone Nutty is more of Scrat chasing acorns, and Bunny is a brilliant short about an elderly female rabbit's last minutes of this life and the transition to the next.

And there's a lot more.  It make take until the next ice age for me to get through all the stuff on this DVD!
