Too many people have gone into this movie with the expectation of watching Silence of the Lambs rehashed. I haven't ever anticipated a movie so much, and I was very nervous that it wouldn't live up to my expectations. It exceeded them.
Hannibal cannot be compared to Silence because they are completely different. Silence was a crime thriller, while Hannibal was suspense and a little romance. The motivating forces are different, as well. In Hannibal, there is no race against the clock to save the day. The pace is very laid back, and the story unfolds in its own time.
Returning to the lead character, Anthony Hopkins delivers a performance as good as I've come to expect. In Silence, we didn't get to learn much about Hannibal, because he was behind the glass for most of the movie. But this is his movie, and Hopkins does it well. He's not as scary as he was in Silence, but that was ten years ago, and he's mellowed out a lot. Don't get me wrong ... he's still scary. But he can also be a lot of other things as well. 
Julianne Moore replaced Jodie Foster, and to tell you the truth, I didn't miss her. Except for the scene with the recordings. But other than that, Julianne Moore was truly excellent. I had always liked her as an actress, but this movie made me truly respect her abilities.
The score by Hans Zimmer is absolutely beautiful. It's been a long time since I've bought a movie soundtrack, but this one was worth it. I really hope there's an isolated score on the DVD. 
All in all, it is a very entertaining movie. There's a little bit of everything, from suspense to a little horror to romance. Just remember, it's not Silence of the Lambs.
