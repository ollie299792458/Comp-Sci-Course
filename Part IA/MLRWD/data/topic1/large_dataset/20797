When Frosty the Snowman (voiced by Jackie Vernon) is magically brought to life thanks to the magic of a hat that belongs to an evil magician (voiced by Billy DeWolfe) the children couldn't be happier. But when Frosty explains to him that he will melt if it gets too hot, they decide that it's up to them to help him get to the North Pole, so he won't ever melt. On their journey they meet many new friends, and adventures, but they also have to avoid the evil magician, for he has decided that he wants his magic hat back, even if he has to melt Frosty to get it.
While the other Rankin / Bass holiday movies such as RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER and SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN, are filmed with clay-type animation, FROSTY THE SNOWMAN is not. It is done simply in the form of a regular cartoon, and even so, it is still one of the most enjoyable holiday movies for children of all ages. Frosty is a kind snowman who wants to please the children more than anything. Karen (the main child chracter) loves Frosty so much, and will do anything to help him. And Hocus (the rabbit who belongs to the evil magician) is very imaginative and intelligent. As well as a hilarious addition to the cast. A must-have movie for all this holiday season.
