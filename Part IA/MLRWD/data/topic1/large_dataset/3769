Some movies, whether intentionally or not, were just meant to be watched several times.  I believe the popular term is "cult film" and Mystery Men is just such an example.  The first time I watched it was not unlike the first time I watched The Three Amigos--I snickered a few times, then walked away wondering why such a heavy hitting cast of comics made such a "mediocre" movie.  But the more I watched it, the more I laughed and discovered truly funny elements that just sort of slipped by the first time around.  Mystery Men is also refreshing in the sense that most of the humor, in spite of its PG-13 rating, is crude-free (I actually let my 6 and 9-year-old watch it).  Jim Carey fans, however, will probably be disappointed by the lack of slap-stick (read stupid) humor that seems to dominate most recent comedies.  One reviewer dismissed Mystery Men as a "bomb" after renting it, but I'm fairly certain that if he just made himself watch it one or two more times, he'd begin to appreciate at least some of it.  Here's a test: if you still laugh after watching movies like Raising Arizona, This Is Spinal Tap, The Three Amigos, or What About Bob? five or six times, get Mystery Men.  It gets better with repeat viewing.
