It is however, in my opinion, much closer to the original books than the clasic musical.

Now before you break out the flame throwers and turn me into extra crispy, I am in no way bashing the MGM classic. It was for me, like it was for many, my first exposure to the colorfull and magical land of Oz. It will always carry a special place in my heart, and in my DVD collection.

On the other hand, having been inspired by the movie i went out several years later and read the books. What i found was a much darker Oz than the one Judy Garland skipped through arm in arm with her newfound friends. Had i read the books at 5 (the age when i first saw the movie) I likely would have been terrified by them and never have wanted to have anything to do with Oz again. Luckily for me, this was not the case when i did read them (at about the age of 9 or 10 i think).

Return to Oz is definitely in the same vien as the books, and intended for audiences that are able to deal with it's bits of darkness, both in Oz (such as Jacks abandonment issues) and the real world (dorothy's electro-shock experiance). There is also a more sinister mood here, this is not the technicolor cotton candy world of Oz that was clear cut about who is good or bad. Queen Moombi's manipulative ways brings these shades of grey into sharp relief, as does the oh so reasonable manner of the Gnome King.

For all these reasons I rate this movie highly and recommend it for everyone's collection, with only the caveat that it is not meant for the younger kids or those looking to relive the musical numbers of the MGM classic. It is a new story that has a more grown up Dorothy dealing with more grown up things.
