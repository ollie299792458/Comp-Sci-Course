I like "little" films that focus on character and location more than plot, and this is certainly such a film, so I was sympathetically disposed toward this movie despite some of the viewer reviews. (I also enjoy plot-driven and even, occasionally, "high concept" pictures.) The film has an excellent cast, was filmed on location in Durham, NC, and the screenplay was written by Horton Foote; it touches on a problem that many small towns face when the industry on which they once relied (in this case, tobacco) has dried up, so thematically it may speak to a lot of people. Thus, the ingredients seem to promise something quite tasty, but this film is like a great souffle that fails to rise.

The overall feeling of the film -- which is never really relieved -- is one of depression; not simply economic depression, but emotional and spiritual depression as well. It is almost (but not entirely) lacking any drama or humor or anything else that would relieve the atmosphere of gentle, sinking, aimlessness. The story does not seem to culminate or resolve into much of anything -- it does not so much end as simply stop. I can well understand why many viewers gave it bad reviews, and if I could give a 2 1/2 star rating (rather than 3) I would. I think this is a film that tries hard to be subtle and succeeds only too well. I suspect that a better director could have made this a much better picture.
