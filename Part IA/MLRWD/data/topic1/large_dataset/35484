Have the Cohen brothers ever made a bad film? Never. Each and every one of their films is outstanding and each of the them have somethign new to offer. "The Man Who Wasent There" is pure Film Noir. I cannot imagine seeing this film in color...black and white is the way to go!
Billy Bob is brilliant in this film. He has very few scene specific dialogues, majority of his lines are narrative. Frances McDormand, who plays Billy Bob's wife, also gives a memorable performance. Contradictory to Billy Bob's charactor, who is a lonesome serious man who seems content with letting life pass right by him, McDormand is this sultry schemestress who under bizzarr circumstances gets caught up in dangerous circumstances. James Gandolfini, Tony Shalhoub, Michael Badalucco, Jon Polito and Scarlett Johansson play their parts to perfection as supporting actors.
The plot of this film is not too complex but has great philosophycal depth to it. The story revolves around themes like revenge and bad choices. (I feel this is all you need to know...anything more will ruin it for you). There is an air of surrealism thought the film and the use of light and space is very innovative. The cinematography is par excillence and the movi is a visual treat....think "Blood Simple" in black in white...you will get a fair idea what this masterpiece is all about.
