Hello, wonderful people at Amazon lol , First off let me say I ordered this for my nephew whom is 6 and is OBSESSED with batman, He loves batman so much, his hole world is Batman lol, He had just about every single Item any store sells, except this one and a couple others I have also ordered from Amazon. Now let's get to it, I got it in the mail today, and stopped by his house and dropped it off, he opened it and Whoa it was the most happiest smile, I have seen since Christmas LOL I just want to say the package was very nicely wrapped and the figurines have such detail, it's amazing really, I didn't stay to watch the movie, but I did call and ask how it was, My sister said she actually sat down to watch it and it was so exiting she said batman and Dracula go into battle and it's very hard for batman to defeat him and he can't and I forgot what else she said LOL But I definitely say if you want to get this it is way worth it!!! Like Roger Ebert would say "I give it two thumbs up" hehe Have a nice day now...
