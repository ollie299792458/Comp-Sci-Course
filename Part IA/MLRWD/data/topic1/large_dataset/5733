John Frankenheimer said that he wanted to make this as real as possible and that's exactly what he did. The trains and the steam are real. Burt Lancaster works in the shop on some metal parts when the train's wheel bearings become damaged after the engineer tries to sabotage the mission. You see him pour metal, you see him lift the 100+ lbs. wheel connecting rod and use a crane to move it. You see Burt Lancaster get kicked off the train while it's doing at least 25-30 mph. You see Lancaster perform his own stunts like climbing down from his hotel window to the ground, rolling down a steep hill with a german machine gun strapped to his chest after he's been injured. Cinematically this is a gem. The angles and shots show the emotion in the faces of the characters, the sweat, etc. And it catches all of the action like not many movies can. There are many thrilling moments in this movie. My favorite is when the Spitfire heads towards the train and strafes it as Lancaster nervously speeds the train towards the upcoming tunnel for shelter and he tries his best to decelerate the train to a stop before it exits the other side of the tunnel. I also noticed in the train control room there is a large poster on the back of the door that looks like a movie or theatre poster that says "Sabotage" on it. Coincidence.
