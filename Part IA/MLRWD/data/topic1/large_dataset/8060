"Look!  Up in the sky!  It's a bird!  It's a plane!  No, it's . . . it's . . . a black comedy, romance, mystery, drama, thriller."

Well, whatever it is, it's a doozey!  The plot and script are wickedly clever.  The actors are all "spot on."  The photography, colors, and sets are captivating.  And you will never think of one of Nat King Cole's songs in quite the same way again.  The juxtaposition of that song with the unfolding story is jarringly suitable.

Since the gist of the story has been shared by other reviewers, I will not go into that part here.  Just let me underline what others have said: Audrey Tautou is the perfect foil for this romance.  When you first see her, smiling amongst the roses in the florist's shop, you just know you are in for "Amelie, Part Deux."  But wait a minute: the title of this movie is not "Amelie," and Audrey Tautou, in this movie, has moved on -- on to different territory.  She just brought her smile along.

As the second half of this movie progressed, I found myself smiling with wonder at the cleverness of it, delighted with what I saw.  I couldn't help but think of the song, "I've looked at love from both sides now . . . and still somehow, it's love's illusions I recall . . ."  And if you like surprises, fiendishly clever surprises, you will smile, too.  Viewing this movie is like seeing the parts of a jigsaw puzzle fit together, only you get to see them fit together with a top and bottom view.

Creating a movie with freshness and novelty can be a challenge.  This movie rises to that challenge.

I highly recommend it!
