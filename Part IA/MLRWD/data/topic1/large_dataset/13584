When my wife and I finished watching this classic the first time I asked her what she thought.  She said, "That was great, what in the world happened?!?"  So began our love affair with this wonderful movie.  The details are all there and we've had a wonderful time over the years playing and replaying, stopping and rewinding until we, like Phillip Marlowe, have it all figured out.  This DVD is of special note because it contains the 1945 pre release version of the movie as well as the original release along with a special segment on why Jack Warner changed the film and reshot several sequences before its release.  The snappy dialogue, the cast of dark underworld characters, the wardrobe, and the smoldering film noir style make this one of my favorite Bogart films.  The censorship of the '40s meant that the writers and the director had to use subtle clues and stylish filming to portray this motley crew of pornographers, heroin dealers, homosexuals, and other sordid characters.  It's all done in a way that would probably barely get a PG rating today.  If you're a Bogart fan you've got to own this one.  If you've never seen Bogart, this film and Casablanca are must see for any film lover.
