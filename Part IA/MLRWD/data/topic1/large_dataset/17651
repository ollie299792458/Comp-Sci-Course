A well-done movie from Disney. A great kids movie, and the adults will find much to love here too. Jiminy Cricket really steals the show- just watch the scene where he comes into the pool hall where Pinocchio is smoking cigars and starts Jiminy yelling at him. I thought the scene was very funny. A good movie for the kids, slightly more mature than other Disney flicks, but something that the children will like.

However, I don't understand why parents say they don't like showing this to infants and toddlers. Fact is, a two year old child will not understand what is going on very well, if at all. The transformation scene, the smoking, destruction, and the gun under Geppetto's pillow goes right over any young child's head. If a child tells you that the movie scares them, you simply put the DVD in a closet and leave it there- period. The movie was made about 2/3 of a century ago, when people didn't make such a big stink over EVERYTHING that happens in a children's movie. And please use your head- if you are thoroughly convinced that Pinocchio will scare your toddler out of his socks, then purchase him a copy of "Hoop De Doo! It's A Wiggly Party" or "The Care Bears Movie". Be warned, though- your child may not like these sugary sweet, super censored programs any more than you do.
