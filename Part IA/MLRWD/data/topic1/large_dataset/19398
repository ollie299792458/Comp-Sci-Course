Old Black and White movies are generally difficult for this reviewer to watch.  However, Fred MacMurray's portrayal of Walter Neff had me zoned right in.  I'm not use to seeing him as this type of character.  I must admit I've only seen him in his TV show, My Three Sons.  Walter Neff is a sharp, quick witted, slick insurance salesman who finds himself consumed with thoughts of Phyllis Dietrichson played by Barbara Stanwyck.  He seems, however, to be a very straight laced by the books kind of guy.  Ms. Dietrichson's determined to "unstraighten" Mr. Neff.  The bantor between the two starts out steamy and never lets up.  It' steamy in a mid 40's kind of way, but it's enthralling none the less.
The story, directed by Billiy Wilder, is one for the ages, boy meets girl, girl manipulates boy into killing her husband, boy and girl run off with the money.  Only this time, girl gets greedy as the plot thickens.  Neff's boss (Keyes) played by Edward G. Robinson plays an important role in the movie.  He smells a rat in the fraudulent insurance claim made by Ms. Dietrichson.  His part is of an antagonistic nature, but you can't help but like the guy.  It was a good story that was fun to watch and I really enjoyed it.  The ending had a bizarre twist to it that I didn't expect, but that made me like it even more.  
I liked this movie and and would suggest it to anyone into noir films.
