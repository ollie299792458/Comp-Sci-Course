I was 4 yrs. old in 1959 when this film was first released.  When I was 7 my parents with caution introduced me to "things that go bump in the night" allowing me to view "House on Haunted Hill" on network TV.  It scared the hell out of me!  I didn't care who the actors were, the atmospheric black and white ambiance was enough for me.  Not long after I became a Vincent Price fan, admiring his deliciously sinister talents.  Later my Brother born in 68, by the time he was 5 we were sitting munching snacks enjoying this film together.  That is the kind of longevity this movie has had.  I now own the DVD and enjoy it for different reasons, as I matured I began to see the humor in it.  I just viewed it again this past Halloween and to me it is as fresh as ever.  Pure and simple; Millionaire invites a few finacially stretched guests to spend a night in a supposedly haunted house he rented.  He'll pay'em $10k grand if they can make it through the night.  This simple premise inspired me to a life time of great Horror/ScFi/Mystery/Adventure/Film Noir and even classic comedy.  Whether you pay 15 bucks or 5 this is sure to make an impression!
