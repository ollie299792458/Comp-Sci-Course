We have gone so far beyond what happened in this movie.  Torture got legalized based on the question of what is is. Assassinations have become so standard that we do them from afar with radio control airplanes.  And our media and justice system is so twisted and corrupt that these things are considered things to be celebrated rather than having people in our government tried for treason against the United States of America and its Constitution.  People responsible for these things win presidential medals for christ sakes!

What on earth is wrong with us Americans these days that we prioritize a fear of death for a tiny fraction of people that are regularly killed on our highways over the freedom of all of us!!??  Sure sure..  it is the jokers in office who enact these atrocities, but we are the ones responsible.  We are the citizens of this country who through action or inaction make this the reality we currently live in.  Will we stand up and take our responsibility back?

I cried at the end of this movie.  Bawled like a baby......  I want a happy ending too.
