This is a brilliant intimate outdoor concert attended by a few lucky fans at Sting's home in Italy. Most songs have new jazzy arrangements that I like better than the studio versions, maybe because the musicians seem to be playing with heightened passion. There is a nice balance between old and new songs and they're all good, but for me, the following stand out. "Fragile" is such a great song (maybe Sting's best) but this version is dripping with empathy and blows the studio version out of the water. The back-to-back jazz and blues punch of "Seven Days" and "The Hounds Of Winter" is stunning. "Fields Of Gold" has a soothing melody line that mentally transports you to that field. Finally, the smokin' hot band pulls out all the stops on "If I Ever Lose My Faith In You".

As for the quality of the DVD, the video is crystal clear, the editing has smooth transitions between cuts, and the audio mix is spectacular. The extras are excellent but briefly turn depressing when the band talks about the tragedy of the day and whether they should play or not. Thankfully they did and we have a document of a great show.
