Ok - the good stuff: very well filmed and edited.  The video looks beautiful.  For you guitar guys and Steve Howe fans; you will love this DVD as Steve's audio off his guitar is the most obvious in the mix and there is more than ample close-up video of his fretboard work.

Now the bad: the audio.  Now I have to admit that this is far from the worst Yes DVD from an audio perspective - but that may not be saying much.  They seem to have a knack for sub-par audio mixing on their DVD's - in fact, most of them sound terrible given modern standards.  So while this is an improvement over their past releases, it still falls far short of what a discerning audiophile and Yes concert goer would like to hear.  As mentioned, Steve's guitar is quite prominent with every note fully audiable.  Jon's vocals would be next in audiability, but somehow they lack a certain clarity.  Rick's keys are set back quite a ways, but still discernable.  Somewhat further pushed down in the mix are Alan's drums, and bringing up the rear is Chris' bass.  In fact, overall bass is sadly lacking, making the whole affair sound thin.  They must like this sort of mix, as far to many of their DVD's can be summed up the same way.  But the dynamic range is nothing close to the balance that their live performance has.

I can't think of another band that has released more DVD's than Yes.  Other than the studio-based acoustic package, I'm still waiting for one of them to sound decent.  Maybe I'm too picky.
