"Wonderland" deals with a quadruple homicide known as the "Four on the Floor Murders" in the Laurel Canyon area of L. A. back on 7/1/81.  One of the chief suspects in the murders was the former "Porno King" of 1970s "XXX" movies namely, John Curtis Holmes.  Back in 1981, John Holmes had been reduced to being a thieving, degenerate, manipulative cocaine user who had not actually made a movie in two years.  Val Kilmer plays Holmes, at this point in his life, to the absolute hilt!  Kate Bosworth is very good as Holme's girlfriend, Dawn Schiller, who also was one of the Executive Producers on "Wonderland."  For those who may purchase or rent this movie without having a clue as to who or what John Holmes was, there's a bonus DVD titled "The Life and Times of John Holmes" featuring taped interviews with the original "Mister Big."  They should watch the Bonus DVD prior to "Wonderland."  The photography is frenetic, at times, but it seems to fit the content of this movie just fine.  This is a movie that should have fared much better than it actually did at the box office.  A truly excellent movie and kudos to Director James Cox!
