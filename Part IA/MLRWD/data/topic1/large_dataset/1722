This movie was good, but comes nowhere near living up to the hype the critics have created for it. If you are expecting a story, then forget it- there is none. This movie is simply a depiction of a series of missions of a bomb disposal unit in Iraq. These missions vary greatly in their intensity and interest, and surprise!- some of the missions do not involve bomb disposal at all. With a running time of over 2 hours this film becomes somewhat monotonous, and you will likely be checking your watch to see how much longer you have to go. This movie, contrary to what you may have been led to believe, does not offer anything new or insightful to say about the psychology of soldiers or war's damaging effects. Maybe critics have been tricked into thinking this movie is better than it actually is because the first 20-30 minutes is terrific and gets the adrenaline pumping and I willingly admit to that. But really folks, it's all downhill from there, and at the end I was disappointed that the whole thing never went anywhere. If you lower your expectations going in, you might enjoy this good, but certainly not great, movie.
