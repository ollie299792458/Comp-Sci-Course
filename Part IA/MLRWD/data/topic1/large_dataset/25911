I am a devoted and long time fan of Hong Kong action movies and pleased to report that Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle is the best of the hundreds I have seen since the early 1970's. Chow's film is at once a loving tribute to and canny summary of the past 35 years of Chinese martial art cinema. KFH is also hysterically funny and the one kung fu DVD I'd gladly show to someone who was not a fan of the genre. The film is beautifully shot and cleverly scripted. It contains old school fight choreography along with marvelous wire-work stunts and up-to-the-minute CGI effects. The cast, mostly unknowns or lesser players in Chinese cinema, is a pure joy and includes several bona fide kung fu masters in key roles. There is really nothing in Chow's previous films that would hint he is capable of creating such a wonderful entertainment. If you didn't see this one in the theaters, stop reading and buy this DVD now.

Note 1: Despite the R rating, I'd be willing to show this gem to pre-teens. With the exception of the first few minutes, the violence is either wildly cartoonish or standard action film fare.

Note 2: As with almost all foreign language films, I recommend watching it in its original language with English subtitles even if an English language track is available. Dubbing is just too damned distracting and can ruin a good movie like this one.
