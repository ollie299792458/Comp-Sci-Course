Being a practitioner of one of the Chinese internal martial arts, I was glad to see a movie that features two of these arts.  Taijiquan (Tai Chi) is by far the most widely practiced of the Chinese internal martial arts, followed by Baguazhang (Pa Kua Chang) and Xingyiquan (Hsing Yi Chuan), the one I study.
This movie features the two styles of the circular Baguazhang and the rarer, predominantly linear Xingyiquan.  So after seeing The One, I was in heaven, despite the original, yet sub par quality of the film.  Not many martial arts flicks use the internal martial arts to deliver the action, much less use them in a manner to identify the character's personalities.  Xingyi is used to show the evil Jet Li, Yu Law's intention to go straight ahead and annihilate everything in his path, like a line.  Bagua is used to portray the good Jet Li, Gabe Law's philosophy that life should be like a balanced circle.
I am also glad to see that Jet Li has been working very hard at learning the English language, and I have a lot of respect for doing so, as Chinese is very different from English.
If you are familiar with any of the major Chinese internal martial arts, you will find this film to be most pleasurable.
