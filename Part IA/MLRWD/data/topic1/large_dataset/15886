I really consider From Russia With Love to be much better than Goldfinger, but this is the movie that really got the ball rolling. This movie went over so well in with the public that the studios new immediately that they would be making many more of these films.
The movie itself is above average. Oddjob is a great henchman, Goldfinger is one of the most intelligent and menacing villains ever. I guess I really like Goldfinger because he was one of the few villains who actually almost killed Bond. He may not have had that big of a part in the action, but his maniacal genius certainly makes up for that.
Pussy Galore...while she's not my favorite she's certainly right up there. I felt she was a great addition to this movie because she added a certain independence to the role of a woman.
I would have to say that this movie is definitely one of the better ones but still a bit overrated. The plot was a little bit convoluted and the cliches really started to pop up in this one. Definitely a classic Bond.
Lastly, Connery's performance is God like in this movie. I feel that he reached the pinnacle of what it meant to be Bond here.
Overall it's a great entry but a bit overtalked.
