This film premiered in Berlin on 9th November 1989, the same night that the Berlin Wall came down. This excellent film, the only one produced by DEFA concerning homosexuality, seems to be a very accurate account of life in the East under Communism during the late 1980's. DEFA (Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft) was the public-owned film studio in East Germany during East Germany's history.

Without giving too much of the plot away, Phillip (Matthias Freihof) is a high school teacher who is soon involved with Tanya (Dagmar Manzel) and Phillip soon believes that his previous curiousity of men is behind him. Through various events we are then led to Phillip returning to his desire for men and it's consequences.

There are terrific performances in this film throughout including that of the old man (Werner Dissel) in the bar at the end of the film.

If it's a look at life under commumunism in East Germany's final days, or looking at how a guy deals with his sexual identity in such times, or you just want to see a decent German film, well this film is for you. Just short of two hours, the film is well worth a watch. It has certainly made me look out for some other DEFA films produced during the time of East Germany.

Enjoy
