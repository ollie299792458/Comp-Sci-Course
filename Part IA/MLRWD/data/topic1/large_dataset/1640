I love the movie.  It's bad, but a good kind of bad.  Especially if you watch the movie with the Rifftrax commentary.  But they made some odd choices with this release.  First is the packaging that is designed with holes.  Tolerable if you're careful, but I can see some mishaps.  The other is the way they decided to do the extras.  See, it comes with the Blu-Ray version and the DVD version.  Not sure why.  Perhaps they want you to lend it to a friend who doesn't have Blu-Ray.  I dunno.  Or perhaps they were just too lazy to put the extras onto the Blu-Ray disc and had a whole bunch of DVDs left over from last release.  That's right.  There are no extras on the Blu-Ray disc but the DVD has all the extras from the DVD release.  Hmmmmmmmmmmm....

Let's see...

Blu-Ray Disc:
-Full-Length Film in 1080P
-Lossless Audio
-Smart Menus
-Theatrical Trailer
-Other Trailers

DVD "Bonus" Disc:
-Full-Length Film in SD
-Director Commentary
-Commentary with Kevin Smith and Scott Masier
-Documentary
-Featurette
-Trivia
-Multiple Language Tracks

Yep, that's right.  If you want commentary ([...]commentary aside), you have to watch the movie in standard definition because for some reason, they could not be bothered to move such features to the Blu-Ray disc itself.
