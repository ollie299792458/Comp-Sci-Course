I really liked this movie. However, I couldn't give it a five because I'm a sucker for "happy endings". With the theatrical cut, you can sit around and try to convince yourself that somewhere later down the road, Evan and Caley will meet again. Doubt it but hey - it could happen. However, the director's cut left no such possibility - it was downright disturbing.

 This doesn't take away from a very unique movie. I was captivated by the storyline within the first five minutes. If for nothing more, you continue to watch it to see how Evan's next "leap" will affect the lives of those around him.

 I was impressed by Ashton Kutcher's acting in this movie, as well. I haven't seen anything else he's done besides "Punk'd" but I think he did a darn good job in this movie.

 As always, my recommendation is to rent before you buy. However, if you're a parent...let me just give you this bit of parenting advice: "IT'S RATED R FOR A REASON!!!"
