This has got to be one of the best films I have ever seen.  I have read some of the reviews others have given it.  I was surprised by the number of negative comments directed at this film.  "It's not accurate."  "It's nothing more than a blood bath."  Wake up and smell the coffee people!  This is an epic Hollywood film.  If you want something accuate, watch the Discovery Channel, or the History Channel.  And as for the battle scenes and the "blood bath" that ensues, that was how it was.  It wasn't very pretty. You ever seen Saving Private Ryan?! And how does anyone today know how it really all went down.  Like Ridley Scott said in his commentary on Gladiator, when ever some "historical expert" told him that this wasn't right, or they never did that back then, Ridley Scott simply said "How do you know?  You weren't there."  In the director's commentary, Mel Gibson even says for the sake of Hollywood, parts of the tale of William Wallace had to be "Hollywoodized".  However, this does not take away form the core idea of the story.  I found Braveheart very moving and inspirational.  William Wallace was a passionate man.  He had passion for the woman he loved, love for his country.  I may not have any Scottish blood in me, but I would have fought beside Wallace.  Stand with Wallace through Braveheart.  Watch a legend come to life before your very eyes.  And at the end, you'll be chanting "WALLACE! WALLACE! WALLACE!  FRRRRREEEEEEDDDDDDDOOOOMMMM!
