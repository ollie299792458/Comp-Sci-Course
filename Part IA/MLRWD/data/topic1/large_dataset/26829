Before Sunset may quite possibly be one of the greatest films of the last 10 years. HOWEVER, I don't believe that everyone will necessarily agree with this opinion. I think that to truly enjoy Before Sunset, one must have experienced a similar moment in their lives such as these two characters. I believe that Before Sunset is the kind of film that gives the viewer a moment in their personal history back to them. In a sense, the film has the ability to stir up a longing for such a moment in ones life, while at the same time satisfying the reunion of these two fictional characters. Before Sunset is the type of film that is enjoyed most when there is no expectation on the part of the viewer, but rather, they should allow themselves to be taken on a journey with these two characters for 80 minutes of their lives. Tempo and flow acts as an asset to the subtleties that make this film truly enjoyable. Most importantly this film once again leaves you wanting more, but at the same time content that you will have to wait for it. Further in fact, on the extras, Hawke mentions the fact that the idea between Hawke, Delpy, and Linklater is to create several more of these films over the next couple of decades, thus allowing those who have fallen in love with these two characters to follow them through the magic of film over the course of 20-30 years. Before Sunset has the ability to captivate and engage the viewer and satisfies 9 years of waiting.
