After reading the reviews its become painfully clear that people who have given bad reviews expected too much from the movie. If your a fan of the comic book, then your probably not going to like the movie because rarely does movies based on comic characters live up to expectations. However I would ask that you watch the movie with no expectations. Its entertaining, and the actors have done a wonderful job. Special effects are also pretty good. The story line is pretty much easy to follow unless while the movie was playing you decided to not pay attention for some reason.

Keanu Reeves has played the role well.He comes of with a I dont care attitude which is probably what you would expect if the Devil wanted you, God locked you out of Heaven, every demon from hell to earth wanted your head and your terminally ill with not much time left.

Rachel Weiz has also done a good job with her role. Another reason why people may not like the movie is the fallen angel theme but this is not the first time that this has been done.

Overall its a great movie to watch, extremely enjoyable and all I would advice is to watch it without any preconceived notion of what to expect.
