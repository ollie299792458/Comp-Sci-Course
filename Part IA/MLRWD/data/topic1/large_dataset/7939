I do not regularly post my opinion for public review, but I felt it necessary in this case.  There is some confusion between this version of Pirates of Penzance (a live performance in NYC Central Park) and the filmed version which includes many of the same principals.  I don't mean to sound preachy but some people may purchase this version thinking it is the movie version and come away disappointed.  Be warned, this version was recorded live and in an outdoor setting.  The lighting, sound, and camera work are of decidedly inferior quality.  If you are seeking to experience this without paying the 20 odd dollars, borrow your parents (or grandparents) Sony Walkman, pop in the Gilbert and Sullivan casette tape, with two nearly dead batteries and lock yourself in a dark closet with a swaying 100 watt bulb.  It is nearly as pleasant, though not quite.  It is my sincere hope that I can find someone who may be interested to have this DVD, but more likely than not it will end up in some local thrift shop.  I will be looking forward to the impending release of the movie version on DVD.
