I love this movie, and I'm just a teenager!  It's definitely a classic and Marilyn Monroe is smashing in this movie despite much of the behind the scene tales.  Jack Lemmon does his best comic work in this movie as does  Tony Curtis.  If you have not seen this film, see it now.  Some people may  be reluctant because it's black and white and it's 40 years old, but  frankly, it'll remain to be fun and enjoyable forever.  My favorite scene  is in the train when the all girl band has a party in Daphne/Jerry (Lemmon)  bunk bed.  Tony Curtis is Joe/Josephine, trying to also be an english  millionaire wooing Marilyn MOnroe.  He does great voices!  But Lemmon's  performance as a wild woman just kept me watching especially when an older  man falls for him.  Billy Wilder, the director, made a great one.  It takes  place in 1929, right before the stock market crashed, watch for some  insights on that.  But you'll laugh out loud, and want to see it again,  because this movie will become one of your favorites!
