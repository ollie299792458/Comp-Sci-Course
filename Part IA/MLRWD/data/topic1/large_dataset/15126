All the actors, 'fill their boots'  well with stoicism, grit, a healthy(?) dash of idealism thrown in & a raw hard edge. Some characters have a severe case of tunnel-vision like 'Bohannon' & 'The Swede'. Characters 'Micky MacGinnes', 'Joseph Black Moon' & 'Eve' seem to be the only three normal/ethical (for now?), people , or a bias?... me as a Scot/Welsh & Rappahannock Indian/adopted Navajo. The acting is so good that the viewer becomes transported back in time & you actually want to shake then hold 'Bohannon' out of his walking nightmare, one feels so badly for him. Other men are teetering on the edges. This show can actually be a great learning tool about our countries state of affairs; pre & post Civil War. 'Hell on Wheels' is a very complex & great watch, with a  good soundtrack (biased -love Mumford & Sons). The Set authenticity is detailed & accurate, unspoiled beauty of Northern plains & even the saddlery is a  fairly close type to the period (McClellan trees were hot!,  actually invented during the Civil War,  then 3/4 seats). Accuracy with 'tack' is not seen anymore on small film, speaking as a Professional Custom SaddleMaker, which is akin to actors (two-legged) wearing modern clothing. This series will have a long paradoxical run.
