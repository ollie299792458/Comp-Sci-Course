This charming movie will have everyone in the audience laughing.  It's witty, fun, and has a little of every type of humor, not just the kid kind!  The cynical, cunning Tulio and his dreamer-type friend Miguel embark on one big mishap after another when they get in trouble for using loaded dice, get caught on a ship in their homeland, Spain, and end up stranded alone in the New World.

Historical, it is not.  Fun, it is.  With the help of a map and a sneaky and seductive thief named Chel, our "heroes" are passed off as gods so they can steal gold and riches from ancient city El Dorado and return to Europe.  We all know a plan like this is destined for some type of failure.  If anything, get this movie purely to find out how the "gods" fall flat on their faces.  The character interactions and voice acting is another big strong suit for this movie.  Kline and Branagh have an undeniable chemistry as partners in crime, and Perez gives Chel an irresistibly funny and cunning personality.

The music is well made, but sometimes pops up at random.  Believe me, this movie really doesn't give off the feeling of being a Disney musical romp, so some of the songs seem a bit misplaced.  All the same, they're quite nice and fun to listen to.  So, I really think I can safely say, I recommend this movie to anyone.
