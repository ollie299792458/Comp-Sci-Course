I know what you're thinking.. a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made, done 20 years after the fact.  It's sure to be a bomb.  Right?  Wrong.

Psycho 2 continues the story of Norman Bates, who after spending several years locked up in a mental institution after murdering several people, has been deemed fit to return to society once again.  Some people, particularly Lila Loomis, the sister of Marion Crane who was murdered by Bates, disagree.  After returning home, Norman soon begins to receive notes and phone calls from his "mother".  Little does Norman know that Lila is behind it all, and begins to become convinced that his mother has returned from the grave and slides back down the slope of insanity.  One by one, those who don't know enough to stay away from the Bates house begin to disappear..  The town sherrif becomes suspicious that Norman is up to his old tricks, but no one knows for sure..

Anthony Perkins once again was brilliant as the tormented Norman Bates, and a solid supporting cast along with tons of suspense really make the movie work.  Nothing can match the original Psycho, but this is most definitely an effective sequel that's worth a watch.
