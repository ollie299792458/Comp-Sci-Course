My eyes tear up every time I watch this spectacular documentary.  This production perfectly captures the human element of these missions.  I have seen other documentaries about the missions to the moon, and they don't even come close to this wonderful production.

You will feel an appreciation for the intelligence, determination, bravery, and sacrifice of those humans who made these missions happen.  You will feel fortunate to be a human living on our oasis of a planet.  The candid thoughts by the astronauts and other NASA staff are perfectly illustrated; the soundtrack causes a vortex of emotion.  This is a bona-fide tribute to those involved to the missions to the moon; and to humankind.

I am a scientist so I'm biased toward this movie, due to the link to science.  But my non-science friends have vouched for this movie; and I see a light in the eyes of kids when they watch this documentary.  So, I think this is more than just my biased feelings.  This is a great movie!
