First, It is a good movie. I can understand why some people

 detested it. It is not an easy movie to watch if you are used

 to typical hollywood fare. Linear plot devices. Clear cut roles

 of good guy, bad guy etc..

 There is only so much you can show in 2 hours. so, some characters are little disjointed. But, you get to see so many

 small stories. Oil Business, CIA, Gulf monarchies. Immigrant turned terrorist : I must say this is done very realistically.

Very realistic, I think it happens more or less like this.

Even if you get only small part of the movie, it is worth watching. You will definitely learn something about our government, oil business, Gulf. AND that makes you a better

citizen.

Regarding the accusation that this is anti-american. It is not

true. I believe that american people/government does more good

than most countries. But, we have to be honest in accepting that

we care for our self interest. Having control of oil supplies

is in our self interest. Is it right or wrong is upto ones conscience ?

Watch it folks. Even if you learn a thing or two, it is worth

your time and money. Even if you donot agree with some aspects

of story - Watch it. This movie has more truth to it than I am

comfortable with. But, that is not a good enough reason to detest it.

There are some good dialogues that should make people think. For

example: When Prince Nasir says about US military spending, stability etc.. George Clooney, Damon, stephen gagan, Jeff Skoll - they all deserve praise for making this movie.
