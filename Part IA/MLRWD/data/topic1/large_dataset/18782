No, I have not suffered hearing loss!  Otherwise I would have rated this movie a 5 star. The poor audio reproduction grossly distracted from enjoying the movie. Yes, if you turn the volume to high you can hear 99% of script but then audio/hissing noises become an annoyance.

The setting/cast was great. Part of the scenes were shot on an actual dilapidated antebellum plantation/home(pre-civil war) in 1956...I doubt anything was altered within the house or yard but filmed "as is"..Also, the black cotton gin workers were undoubtedly locals/authentic from the accents & clothing.

The plot was pretty deep & leaves the viewer thinking about the moral of the story. There is perhaps a thread of feminist thought? Actress Carroll Baker plays the part of a Teenage Bride which has been intellectually dumbed down. At first the viewer sees her as mentally slow (you first see her sucking her thumb in a crib) but as the movie progresses it becomes apparent she is the victim of being fixated mentally as an adolescent. In the end she shows traces of adulthood/independent thinking...Many more side plots/angles to the movie.

How could they have been so careless/sloppy reproducing this movie?
