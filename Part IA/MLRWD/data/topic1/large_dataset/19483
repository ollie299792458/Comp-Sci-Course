I'm afraid that a number of reviewers were perhaps expecting this movie to make a stong anti-capital punishment statement. It did not. If that was the intent, the studio would have titled it "The Death of David Gale". People expecting a strong statement supporting abolitionist views will probably be disappointed.
What the movie is, however, is a good story well told. It is a taut thriller, well paced and finely acted. The plot contains more twists and turns than a country road and requires the viewers constant attention. Kevin Spacey's character ranges from the highest peaks to the lowest depths and is always believable. For comparison, I thought his performance surpassed the (award winning) Russell Crowe role in A Beautiful Mind. In one scene, Spacey, in a drunken stupor, assaults a phone booth. Paul Newman's performance attacking parking meters in Cool Hand Luke pales in comparison. If not for the timing of the movie's release, this would be a guaranteed Oscar nomination for Spacey. Laura Linney's performance as a ailing activist is also quite good. Her character is difficult to embrace, but her performance is not.
I was impressed with the operational aspects of the movie including the cinematograpy, lighting and editing.  All were well done.  The unusual musical score fits well with the story and has a syncopated rhythm like a clock ticking off the final minutes and seconds of the main character's life.
If you like dramatic thrillers and enjoy trying to figure out "whodunit", then you should enjoy The Life of David Gale.
