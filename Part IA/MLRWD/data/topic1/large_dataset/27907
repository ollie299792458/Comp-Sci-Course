A lot of folks have trouble with this film.  They are turned off by the over-the-top violence, mayhem, and sex.  What they don't understand is that  it is nothing more than a really well-made exploitation film.  Remember  those?  Movies which had no higher agenda than providing plenty of fun,  cheap thrills, like gratuitous sex and violence?  Many of them were made in  the late '60s and throughout the '70s?  Like Women In Prison films?  Blaxploitation?  Car-racing movies?  Slasher films?  Russ Meyer movies?  Anyone?  Well, for those who DO remember, and who don't need every flick  they see to contain lofty statements about the nature of mankind and the  universe, you will love this movie.  The cast is great:  I mean, come on,  Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Fred Williamson... even Quentin, who can't  act, is utilized effectively.  Clooney has a great role which no one seemed  to appreciate, Hayek does a lewd dance with a snake which will make your  shorts explode, and Cheech Marin is, as always, a laugh riot.  This film is  at fever pitch every step of the way and contains plenty of Rodriguez  camera-acrobatics and clever Tarantino dialogue.  Please understand,  people, this film IS trash.  Good, fun,  doesn't-take-itself-at-all-seriously trash!  God love it!
