This has gotta be Sylvestor Stallone's best action movie in my opinion although some people are gonna say First Blood I&II. I read somewhere that this movie was a flop but I don't know why, it has some of the best action sequences I have ever seen. Standout scenes where he is on the back of a truck and mowing down bad guy bikers with his sub machine gun with laser siding.Another scene is where he throws a handgrenade at a biker and him and his bike get blown up into the air.The car chase in this movie is yet another great action scene as well as the beginning where a man walks into a shopping centre and starts blowing the place apart with his shotgun as well as killing a man for nothing.
The story is a model witnesses a crime and sees the face of the killer and becomes the target of a serial killer. But he isn't on his own. He has a whole army behind him and she is the target. This army likes to kill people,"kill the weak so the strong can survive" so the leader of the army says. A police specialist is assigned to protect the woman and he is nicknamed The Cobra, real name Marion Cobretti.
I love it at the end of the movie when the leader of the gang says the Cobra has gotta arrest him but Sly says, "This is where the law stops, and I start."Classic line. The soundtrack to this film is great too, with "Feel the Heat" probably being the best song.Few stars are all that's available to rate this film but I would give it ten out of five if I could.
