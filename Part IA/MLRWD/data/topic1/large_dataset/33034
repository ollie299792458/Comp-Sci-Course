At first, I was surprised I was even watching this movie.  I'm older now.  Been married for 20 years.  Not really into "chick flicks" but something about the dialog between these two young people caught my attention when I surfed into this movie.  These kids were truly something.  The young lady was everything I would want my daughter to be.  Smart, articulate, pretty, honest, independent and sensible.  She was a lot of fun to listen to.  The boy was honorable and really seemed to care for this girl.  I hope my sons treat the women they fall in love with with the same respect.  Why would a middle age guy like me like this movie?  I think it took me back to a time where I remember feeling the magic and excitment from meeting someone for the first time.  It was pretty nice to feel this again for a short time.  I guess I forgotten how it felt to be so intrigued by someone that nothing else in the world mattered.  It was rare to have this feeling and something that we will all remember when it does happen....or something we would want to experience again.  It's like a gift.  It reminded me of that Neil Young song Like a Hurricane....."...that magic moment right before you kissed my lips, time just slips....".  I hope I remeber the words right.  This is truly an excellent movie with great dialog.  A true gem in a world of rotten, corny movies minus the breast shots and gratuitous sex scenes.  None of that in this movie.  Just a very honest and natural progression in a short-term relationship that both charactures really appreciate.
This is just a very good movie.  Perhaps one of the best I have ever seen.  Not sure why it's rated "R".  Perhaps some of the language but I have heard worse in my son's Jr. High School.
Watch this movie and experience a wonderful feeling that you probably haven't experienced in years  or maybe never experienced but want to.  It makes this guy appreciate the woman that I have a little bit more than I did.
