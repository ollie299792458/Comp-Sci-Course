Get ready to wake the neighbors. The DTS lossless audio will definitely assault your eardrums, along with those of anyone within a 50' radius, if you crank it up.The video is pretty good except in nighttime scenes.The video is in 16:9 format with black bars on top & bottom. The movie overall is good with the usual zombie killings. The base is awesome. I watched the 2d version there is an option of 3d version also on the same disc.
I got a chance yesterday to watch the 3d version Bluray on a 65" Panasonic Plasma TV at a friend's home theater demo room. 3d is here to stay. The picture quality is just outstanding. After watching in 3d you wont feel like watching in normal 2d. At my place i watch movies on Projector but unfortunately no proper 3d projectors are available, the ones which are available are priced exorbitantly. I hope PANASONIC launches a proper 3d projector soon so we (all owners of projectors) can watch 3d movies at home. PANASONIC,PLEASE COME OUT WITH A 3D PROJECTOR SOON.
