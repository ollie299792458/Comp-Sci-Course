I saw this movie when I was little during its theatrical release-it was creepy and I got scared. A recent trip to WDW at Halloween ignited my interest in this movie again, and I believe it is one of the best films Disney ever made. The sets are incredibly detailed, each character is an individual, the voices are fantastic and the plot is very original. More than anything-I love the music. Danny Elfman not only wrote the score, but is also the singing voice for The Pumpkin King himself-Jack Skellington.

There are plenty of special features on the DVD. I enjoyed hearing the poem that Tim Burton wrote after seeing window displays switched from Halloween to Christmas, the basis for the Nightmare Before Christmas. There is also "behind the scenes" footage (from almost 20 years ago now) that shows the sets, the heads for the different characters and the intricate way each scene had to be set up and filmed.

While I had a hard time watching it as a kid-there is nothing ridiculously scary or inappropriate about this film. There are very few good family Halloween films out there. When the time comes-I hope to watch this with my kids every Halloween as a kick-off for the Christmas season.

$22.00 Is an excellent price for this DVD/Blu-Ray, I haven't found anything close in any store.
