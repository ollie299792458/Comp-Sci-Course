Similar in spirit to Wayans' cult classic "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka" (which, it should be mentioned, was clearly influenced by the Abrahams-Zucker-Zucker brand of spoof comedy (Airplane!, Naked Gun)), but updated to satisfy the Y2K hunger for low-brow humour.  Despite the numerous moments of hilarity in the film, I found Wayans' exuberant over-reliance on toilet humour to be too tedious.  I, by the way, can't wait for this brand of humour to fade away.  I love low-brow humour as much as the next intellectually-stunted guy, but being crude for the sake of being crude is not the same as being crude for the sake of being funny.  For example, I am bewildered as to why anyone found the flatulence bits funny.  Maybe it could be funny if it was set-up and paid-off in a comedic situation, but flatulence by itself is not funny.  Another example: A man in denial about his sexual orientation coming across a glory hole can potentially be very funny.  However, a phallus protruding from the said hole and perforating the said man's head is not funny.  In fact, it's darn near disturbing.  And I was also bothered by all the mimicry of other movies.  They were funny when they developed naturally from the plot, but dull and stupid when they didn't.  In the latter case, those scenes mostly just sit there and preen, waiting to be acknowledged.  I realize these films are nearly impossible to make well, but maybe the reason Airplane! and Naked Gun were so successful was because their creators did not limit themselves strictly to grossing out their audience and spoofing as many films as possible.
