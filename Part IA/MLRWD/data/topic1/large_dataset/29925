I can say that I never saw a Scrooge I didn't like, although some are just better. Sir Seymour Hicks' version shows its age definitely, but be forgiving here-it's from the depression era. This extends to Marley being invisible, Christmas Past being only a light, and Christmas Future only a shadowy hand. Hicks makes up for it by making the viewer concentrate on him and his emotions instead. Only Christmas Present is seen-although being clean shaven, fat and too serious instead of the "jolly giant" of Dickens make him a little disappointing. Hicks does not show himself as a young man in the Past, and therefore his lost fiance is shown as middle aged instead of the pretty girl of the book. However, Hicks puts his all into being Scrooge, and the photography is a wonderful example of vintage black and white. The scene in Old Joe's is especially effective, where his customers appear to be the "obscene demons" as described by Dickens. My own complaints are really few: Was the Lord Mayor's celebration scene really necessary? (Sure, it shows a grand event, but it's a distraction from the story.) And why is this short film cut even more for video? This is the only way I've been able to see it and it's very noticeable when the Spirit of Christmas Present reminds Scrooge of his opinion about "the surplus population" because he didn't say it earlier in the film. (Or is this only a scriptwriter's goof?) We need a fully restored edition. Still--watch it and enjoy! It still has plenty of "Spirit" and will make you want to say with Scrooge at the end, "God bless us--every one!"
