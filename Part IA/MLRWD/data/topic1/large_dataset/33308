The story centers on Jackie Morrison, played by Kate Dickie. Jackie works for the Glasgow, Scotland PD surveillance division monitoring spy cameras called the CITY EYE.  The district she monitors is home to the seediest parts of Glasgow including a government housing development called RED ROAD, which is home to many ex and not-so ex cons.

While performing her duties, she catches a glimpse of a felon, she was unaware had been released, having consensual sex while the City Eye with her as its operator is watching.  This felon named Clyde Henderson, played by Tony Curran, had intersected Jackie's life once before, although he doesn't remember her; she sure remembers him.  The story is about how and why she wants to get even.

Subtitles were of great benefit for most viewers, including myself, as the lower class dialect would not be that familiar to most Americans, and reminded one of an earlier movie called Trainspotting, also thick with lower class Scottish lingo, although that story primarily took place in Edinburgh, Scotland rather than Glasgow.

The story line makes abundant use of the F*** word and all its many derivations, but considering what was trying to be projected, it wasn't simply gratuitous. There was also one instance of full frontal nudity and a very realistic depiction of sex with various acts.  Again it made sense as it was part of the plot to the story, not just something thrown in.

This is definitely an adult movie worth watching, suspenseful and with a well developed plot line although it takes a while for the director to reveal what it is.
