I have to put this at 4 stars instead of 5 when comparing it to Legend for fantasy subject and presentation. I thought Legend's plot was a bit more believable, and the unicorns (like photographer Robert Vavra's creations) were perfect. Only the warrior in Willow was "perfect" as far as my tastes go! If only he were single...
The warrior Redfern is handsome and intelligent - nice, instead of just a sweaty grunt - and it was interesting to have "traditional" stereotypes turned around. The good princess is a redheaded baby, not the "mandatory" blond. Willow is a midget, not a big, burly hero type. 
As far as comparisons to Lord of the Rings, well, Tolkein and CS Lewis influenced alot of fantasy writers and fans, so some similarities would be inevitible. However, basic sci-fi and fantasy stories share common elements and it is easy for a non-writer to think copycatting took place. It probably did not. How many ways can you retell an "evil sorceress wants to rule the world and kill her opposition" story? There is a villain, a protagonist (hero) and something valuable that is in danger, which the hero must save or the villain wins. Eaaasy :-)plot. I'm really surprised no one accused this movie of copying Moses, since the baby is set adrift in a basket, and gets found by her rescuers. The sorceress could be a female copy of Pharaoh. (as if)
It's a movie I am buying before VHS is totally wiped out by DVD! I think this can rightfully sit beside Red Sonja, Conan, and Legend on any fantasy lover's shelf...especially if they want "clean" fantasy that is not dark. Not full of gratuitous splatter, either.
