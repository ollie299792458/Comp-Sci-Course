There could have been a great movie here, maybe even two great movies, but there's too much on the plate. The obvious comparison would be with "Catcher in the Rye" but the action in that is compressed into a short period of time, whereas "Igby" has enough backstory and sequel story to fill a mini-series, much less an hour and a half movie! The film is truly exhilarating from the moment Igby jumps out of the limo to escape prep school to the moment he catches his Godfather with his pants down -- I would have liked to have seen the movie concentrate those months and not try so hard to paint a larger canvas. The filmmaker/writer can't resist a clever line or poignant situation until the whole thing collapses in melodrama. It's even untrue to the "black comedy" it attempts, backing away from the provocative first scene to make it almost sentimental and giving Igby a very mechanistic explanation for being so difficult. The middle section deserves to be amplified and I think there's also a good movie about a disfunctional family with a schizophrenic dad and an uptight mom in here but this isn't it!
