This film is not deserving of the blind praise it is getting.... Devoid of a ny plot or intrigue it meanders on with little or no structure to it like someone trying to sketch a landscape in 10 minutes time. It is completely a different film than Exorcist the beginning but if you are looking for a well crafted story that is the beginning of the Exorcist saga this is not it. Sedate and pedestrian are the best way to describe this film that does not even capture mode or tension....

The possession of the boy makes little sense and how it manifests itself so abruptly when Father Francis tries to pray for him and put the crucifix on his head as to be laufable.

The bashing that Exorcist the Beginning gets it un warrented... Yes it is not Friedkin's masterpiece but it is a more compelling story from start to finish than this film which really is the Exorcist in name only. I can see why the producers of this film canned and started over... In fact watching this and then watching Exorcis the Beginning makes it seem like Lawrence of Arabia. Better direction, and actual plot to the film, real character interaction and real suspense.

Dominion watches like a first draft that was not thought out very and the acting in it flat... Exorcist the Beginning may not be a masterpiece but compared to this film it sure seems like one.
