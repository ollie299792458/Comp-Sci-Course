O...........K.........A.........Y....

First of all people are just hating on Halle, she was great in this movie. Okay maybe the script could have been a little bit better, but the movie was still great. People are talking about: oh my god. They should have continued the selina kyle story.

For what? Where else could you possibly go with that story? Tell me, i would like to know. What if they did continue with the Selina Kyle story, only the movie sucked, then what?

It's nice to see every once in a while a comic book movie not all the way dedicated to the comic. Explore a little. Try something different, and that's exactly what Warner Bros did with this story. People come on! The only thing not so great was practically the story, everything else was great.

Plus Halle's catsuit was way better than Michelle's suit.

Catwoman in my point of view is a: sexy, sleek, stylish character. Not a sewed up dominatrix.

I can't wait for the DVD because I am going to get it and I do think they should have released  the soundtrack.

I saw Catwoman 10 times, that's how much I loved that movie. It was more than just Halle's sexiness, it was just about time we see something different than what the comic originates.
