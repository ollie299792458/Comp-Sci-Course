I knew this movie was a dud but it has some nice special effects and I have a weakness for disaster films.  What I didn't expect was the klutzy way this disc was designed to operate (if it wasn't "broken").  When pause or fast forward is pressed, the bottom 20% of the screen is overlaid with a background color and a "thermometer" type set of lines to show how much of the movie has played.  I could find no way to get rid of it.  It became very difficult to read subtitles or to see any action near the bottom of the screen.  The real surprise was when I pressed stop (thinking this might return to full screen mode).  Stopping results in the movie going all the way back to the start.  I could find no way to access a menu at this point to select a scene.  I went through these key punches a couple of time just to be sure the first time wasn't an anomaly.
I returned the disc since I refuse to commit to watching the whole 2 hours plus without touching a key.  Now, to add insult to injury, SONY also won't let you skip the ads at the start of the disc.  I was already mad at them for adding another warning (which this disc has too) stating that they are not responsible for what you see in the movie. If that is so, how can they take money for someone else's work?  No wonder SONY is losing billions.  They deserve to.
