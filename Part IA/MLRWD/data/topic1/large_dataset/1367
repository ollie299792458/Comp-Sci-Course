As for remakes of films, i usually don't like them. However this film just rocks.. as its done by the great Tom Savini, the makeup fx artist for the original dawn of the dead.

This is almost a step by step exact remake of the original except for better special effects and a surprise ending, unlike the original ending i thought they should have kept it the same.

My favorite part in this film is where Barbara (Patricia Tallman) turns from the petrified little woman like in the original to the non-scared fighting woman that we all wanted to see her turn into... saying "They're so slow, if we was careful we could walk right past them."

The Zombies in this remake are much scarier than in the original and they even move slower. and as for the actors they picked for the lead roles of the main characters I would have to say did an awesome job.

Another favorite part is when Barbara asks if "this guy looks dead, Is he dead?, BANG, is he dead?, BANG, Does he look dead?" man that almost cracks me up every time..

i would recommend this movie if you liked the original Night Of The Living Dead. and if you didn't then SHAME ON YOU.
