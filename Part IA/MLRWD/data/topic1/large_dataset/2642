Our 15-month-old son is fascinated by other Baby Einstein DVD's (particularly Baby Van Gogh and Baby Shakespeare), but this just doesn't hold his attention.
It's clear that different hands are at work on this title -- which followed the sale of the Baby Einstein company to Disney -- and that they don't necessarily understand how BE works.  The music is as good as ever (thanks to the long-time personnel in the "Baby Einstein Orchestra"), but the visuals are a mess.  Earlier titles would show a scene and stick with it for a while, and transition between similar scenes, for example, from one toy to another, or between different views of the same toy.  This video madly intercuts between toys, nature footage, and pictures of children... completely missing the simpler approach of earlier titles.  The puppet shows are more elaborate, but are they any more charming?  No.
To its credit, it's not larded down with obnoxious and intrusive advertising like other Disney titles, but overall you'd still be better with the earlier titles that Julie Aigner-Clark and her people were directly involved in.
