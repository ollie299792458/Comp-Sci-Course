I was highly anticipating this film after seeing a trailer before another independent style movie I watched. Over-all I was very intrigued by this film and I do plan on watching it again, however there was a little something missing. I think that one little thing was the sense of urgency and realism. The story is being told to us, there is narration throughout the film which I feel greatly takes away the connection with the story, characters, and any sort of relation to the actions taking place. The narration takes away the horror.

The AQ and PQ are both great and have a very clean-cut style of cinematography.

I love the cast and everyone was brilliant in their portrayal of normal people going through a horrible transformation due to a spreading contagion. At it's heart, Perfect Sense is a love story, however it is semi-predictable and at times frustrating to watch. I do love the end, even through I "saw" it coming. I feel the movie trailer may have given too much away, it should have been advertised as a love story and nothing else should have been given away.

I do highly recommend this movie to fans of the cast and of the indie style epidemic film genre.
