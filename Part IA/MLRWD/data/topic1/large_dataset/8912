This is really funny, now that I've realised that it is much better to see this problem by the tragicomedy angle.

After the shock reaction with the first viewing of the 2nd disc of this pack, three months ago I wrote something, published in this section, and the question was put "in the name of dignity". What a fool I was, now that I realised that Fox have done nothing till now, to offer a solution to the customers.

I've return today to the 2nd disc and folks, I've discovered another error from the called "professionals" that had the responsabilty of this edition. The sound of the featurette THE MIRACLE OF TODD-AO is absolutely out of synchronization!!!!. It 's true. Those,like me, that have yet the pack, can verify that in the end of the referred featurette when the Harley motorcycle appears filmed by a car running at is right side, the respective sound is listened around 2 seconds earlier. The same problem that, affects all featurette, is very noticiable in the final crash too. Last week I've compared this version in DVD with the original 70mm copy that exists in the vaults of the portuguese CINEMATECA and there's no doubt; the original film is absolutely syncronized and this one is not!!

Funny is'n it?

Shame on you, once more, 20th Century Fox.
