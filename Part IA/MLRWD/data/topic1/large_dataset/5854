This movie and the prequel, Before Sunrise, must truly be enjoyed together.  When I saw the first movie as a high-schooler nine years ago, I was amazed at the concept of a truly profound connection developed in a short time with a stranger.  It hit me so hard because I had had a similar experience: meeting someone for a night and talking about everything in my little, young life all night long.  Unfortunately, it was not in an exciting city such as Vienna, Austria, but in a Denny's in small-town Oregon.

Now, viewing the sequel as a citizen of the world 9 years later, I have learned so many of the same lessons that the characters have learned.  I see so much of myself in their conversations and appreciate the gravity of re-connecting with someone from your past.  This movie ties together two very different points of time, and more importantly, two very different points of these people's lives.  As time moves forward, the best part of being in relationships, whether romantic, familial or friendships, is to see people grow.  Seeing these two characters and their growth over the 9 years is like seeing myself and my friends grow as well.  I appreciate the lessons they have learned and feel more connected with the world b/c I have shared so many of the same lessons.

This movie and its prequel appeal to me because I feel like like I personally relate to the characters.  I recommend watching the first and second movies together (if you haven't seen the first) and reflecting on your own views and choices nine years ago versus the present. However, if conversation and reflection bore you, I recommend you don't watch either and rent a mind-numbing action flick.
