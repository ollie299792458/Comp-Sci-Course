When you pick up "The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro", you know that you haven't necessarily bought the typical 3-disc set where the first disc gives a documentary to explain the timeline and back stories of the matches you will see in the set. So it gets a bit confusing to have Diamond Dallas Page give monologues throughout the set about the history of the show as opposed to what a documentary can offer with many points of view over a chronological timeline.

I don't want to complain about the match choices too much, but it feels like if you are explaining the very best of Monday Nitro, the first thing you will notice is the omission of the "surprise" appearance of Lex Luger on the debut show, which I felt could have replaced Hulk Hogan v. Big Bubba.  I actually liked seeing the unique moments that happened in Monday Nitro history over the match choices.

If the DVD set meant to be "The Very Best of Monday Nitro", then it could have included more moments and fewer matches. Even as someone who started watching NWA/WCW in 1990, I had trouble getting into some of the match choices in the set.  The content is good enough, but I would recommend The Rise and Fall of WCW over The Very Best of Monday Nitro.
