The Bourne Identity is a well made thriller about a covert agent who's 'malfunctioned' and wakes with amnesia. Matt Damon, who plays Jason Bourne, aka several other names, finds himself unable to remember who he is and at the same time aware that he's got a few 'skills' that seperate him from the rest of normal society.

Set on location in Switzerland and France, this well-paced story moves right along. Along with Damon there is Franka Potente who he meets as he attempts to speak with someone at the U.S. embassy in Zurich. Offering her money to drive him to Paris in search of his identity, she accepts with reservations. And so the chase begins. Other agents like Bourne are called into action to find him and a series of chases and assasination attempts ensues.

The characters playing these Bourne-like agents aren't really delved into, which is a shame. This also calls to mind the major weakness in the story- the U.S. government controllers who are after him. The role of 'controller' is stereotypically played throughout and it's perhaps the only weakness in the movie.

The Bourne Identity isn't great movie-making; what it is is good entertainment. A good cast, script and well paced action scenes move the plot along at a steady pace. I thoroughly enjoyed it and hope to see its sequel very soon.
