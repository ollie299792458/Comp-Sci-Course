The Onion Movie was just terrible.  Skit after skit of utterly unfunny, unimpressive crap.  Don't waste your time and/or money.  I agree with a previous reviewer--it might appeal to the Date Movie-Scary Movie-Epic Movie-Meet The Spartans crowd; but for anyone with even a hint of taste for cinema, it's an absolute joke (and, as I've said, not a funny one).  I'll cite an example:

Pretty early on there is a preview for a faux action movie-within-a-movie called "Cockpuncher" (starring Steven Segal).  The fake preview begins with the main character getting punched in the crotch several times before cutting to a scene with an Asian martial arts trainer.  The main character asks, "How did they defeat me?"

If you're unable to predict what happens next, well then maybe this IS a movie for you; and if you find this perhaps a little bit funny, like I do, try to imagine whether or not it would STILL be funny after the same pretend film is crammed down your throat for the full remaining length of the production.

Horrible acting, terrible comedic timing, hideous writing, atrociously racist, low-brow humor, and why-oh-why did they feel the need to wrap it all up by bringing all the sketches together in the end?!

As others have said: go to the website, read the books and articles, but do not watch, rent, buy, or even download or stream this movie.  Just watch the preview, that's pretty funny (and exhibits better editing than the actual film!).
