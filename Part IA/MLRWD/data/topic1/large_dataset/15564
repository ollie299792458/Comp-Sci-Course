As much as I enjoy SOUTH PARK and I really do enjoy it quite a bit, I really have a soft spot in my heart for Trey and Matt's (along co-stars Dian Bachar and Masao Maki) live-action swag. In fact, there's a part of me that wishes that SOUTH PARK wasn't so damn popular. With the guys constantly busy with the show, it has resulted in zero room for more live-action projects like ORGASMO and CANNIBAL! THE MUSICAL. Now, a few folks here have knocked ORGASMO for it's cheap production values and special effects, but what they fail to understand is that cheesy look is intentional, it's part of the film's charm. Sure, the guys didn't have a ton of cash to produce this picture, but even if they did, I'd bet that they would still employ that low-budget look for the film to get laughs. Not to spoil the ending, but showing a cheaply built miniature home going up in flames is way funnier than burning a real home or using CGI flame effects. So, relax and enjoy this film for what it is, a very funny and original comedy.
