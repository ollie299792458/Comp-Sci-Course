This is every bit as bad as you have heard and WORSE if you can imagine that! I found it totally unwatchable and after the 'Gobble, gobble it's turkey time" line I had to turn it off because I was going to barf! I must vote that line as "least sexy line of all time" Whoever allowed that line in the movie needs to have their head examined. There is NO chemestry between Ben and Jen, I don't even know how these two ever hooked up! You really want to smack the both of them. There is no way these two are convincing as 'thugs' especially when you know they are both annoying, spoiled stars with tons of $ who have both let fame go to their heads. The screen is not big enough for their combined egos. The acting is horrible, the script is horrible, the dialogue is pathetic and I never saw the ending but with this much bad going on, I really don't care. I am not going to waste over an hour of my life on such a horiffic movie! Seriously people, does Hollywood really think people are dumb enough to buy something this lame? This movie surpassed bad, surpassed 'so bad it's good' and came back around to bad and formed a whole new catagory, "So bad it needs to be reported to the Movie Safety Commission before someone goes blind" Seriously folks...IT'S REALLY BAD!
