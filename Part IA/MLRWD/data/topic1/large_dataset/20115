This is a film about miracles within a place where cynicism rules, set in an age where ignorance and connections prevailed.  This story is about the arrival of John Coffey into a prison wing run by Tom Hanks and the effect he has on all around him.  Coffey (like the drink but spelled different) has been sentenced to death for the murder of two little girls, although it is obvious to the audience that he couldn't have done it. 
This film has a fine ensemble cast with Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan (why only Oscar-nominated?), Barry Pepper and David Morse in fine form.  The other members of the cast are also very good with Doug Hutchison playing Percy the deranged guard with family connections,  his most twisted and evil role since Victor Eugene Tooms in the X-Files.  And who can forget Mr Jinks, the miracle mouse who can play fetch with cotton reels?
I'm normally a blockbuster viewer, lots of car chases and explosions, so this film is a real change of pace.  However, like the Shawshank Redemption before it, the quality of this film transcends genres and will bring something to everyone who watches it.  Stephen King has rarely had quality films made of his output, this one is an absolute gem.
Note: this is a film you need to see in one sitting from start to finish, so make sure you have a 3 hour window available before watching.  Close your curtains, take the phone off the hook and enjoy.
