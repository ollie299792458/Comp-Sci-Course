I am not a fantasy film fan nor am I crazy about Princess Bride.  However, I needed a "light" film to brighten up my mood because I was sick hence the viewing of Stardust.

To say that I was surprised is an understatement.  I was enchanted!  Especially after realizing the director is Matthew Vaughn of Layer Cake, one of my all time favorite films.

It is not a short film.  120 minutes is a long time for a lot of people.  HOwever, the pacing of this film was so superb that I did not realize that I'd spent 2 hours without falling asleep or using the bathroom.  As a matter of fact, I saw it 4 times in 36 hours!

As the "industry" would say, casting is everything.  This film did not miscast anyone, not even bit players.  They delivered the written words in uniform manner, not too seriously and not too casually.  The humor at times has a wink-wink quality but not to a point where it hurt credibility.

CGI use is a must in fantasy films now a days.  I am so glad that in Stardust, CGI was used wisely, not over the top.  The real beauty is the actually location shots in Iceland, Wales, England, and Scotland.

Overall, it is a great film to be had in your DVD library.  Both adults and kids will love it.  Highly recommended.
