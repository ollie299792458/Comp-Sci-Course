&#8230;Is just One of the Many Ultra-Clever and Endlessly Quotable lines Sprouted from the dirty mouth of Guerrilla-filmmaker Cecil B Demented in John Water&#8217;s &#8220;Cecil B Demented, a film where Heavy-Handed Satire and Over-the-Top Performances are the Name of the Game, Hollywood Filmmaking and Bad Movies are the Enemy and Cival Unrest and Mayhem are their Goals, as far as I can tell. The film makes a lot of Contradicting Statements, some I&#8217;d Fight for, some I Totally Disagreed with and Dismissed, but the Main statement the film seems to want to make is&#8230; It&#8217;s Just a Movie.
Making Statements is Ultimately not Really what the film is about, it&#8217;s about Entertaining a more Offbeat audience and Telling a Worthy Story. Stephen Dorff is Cecil, Cecil B Demented&#8230; Filmmaker Extraordinaire. Dorff plays him with Passion; I got the Feeling that Dorff Honestly Believed in some of the things he was saying. He strikes a Good Balance between Serious and Send up, and he really Looks the part. He watches the performances of his &#8220;Sprocket Holes&#8221; (his acting troupe) with a Twinkle in his Crazed eyes, much like the twinkle in Johnny Depp&#8217;s eye in the film &#8220;Ed Wood&#8221;, a director that Demented would Definitely get Along with. Dorff also looks Mighty Cool with that Bottle Blonde hair and that Concoction of Clothing. Melanie Griffith was a Inspired Casting Decision; her Persona fits the Role like a Glove, Aging Starlet on the Downward Slope of her Career. She seems to be having a lot of Fun with the role, I was waiting for her to Break out in Laughter at some points.
The Supporting cast are Equally as Dedicated to the cause at hand, and there performances strike the same balance between Real and Comic. Alicia Witt is Hilarious and has Never looked so [Good]. Jack Noseworthy is Always good and he has one of the Films Funniest scenes, where her Expresses his feelings about his Confused Sexuality. The Rest of the cast is filled with Actors who I Know by Face but not by Name, what I Do know is that they are all Great. The Films Casting Agents did a Wonderful Job.
The film is Definitely not for Everyone, but if you Ever found yourself Cursing a Big Budget film or Crying in a film that is so Sickly Sentimental that you feel Tricked, &#8220;Cecil B Demented&#8221; knows how you feel and he has the Remedy.
