This isn't a review of the movie, it's a review of the disk.

This review is for the Blu-ray release, ISBN 1-4198-5312-0. It's a single disk release.

First of all... NO JAVA!!!

This means the disk loads quickly and auto-resume works.

I just compared this with the DVD release. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C6A6FY">Casablanca (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. The menus are better implemented and you have more choices in subtitles.

The transfer is super sharp and crisp. They took full advantage of Blu-ray's capabilities. I was hesitant to buy this release as I already owned the DVD. I'm glad I did. The difference between the two is immediately obvious. Don't get me wrong, the DVD is a good release, it's just limited by DVD technology.

Sometimes I'll have both the DVD and Blu-ray version of a movie. In some the special features are implemented better in the DVD. The Patriot is one where this is true. Also I'll often want fast loading or auto-resume.

There are times I've regretted buying a Blu-ray version of a movie I own on DVD. In this case I see no reason to keep my DVD disk. This Blu-ray release is flawless.

Kudos to Warner Brothers.
