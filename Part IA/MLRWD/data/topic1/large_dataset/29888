I have been hunting for a good quality copy of NOTORIOUS, ever since the extremely popular Criterion Collection edition went out of print, and became hot on the bootleg and piracy markets.  Did not get any encouraging response from Criterion (after sending many emails) about a possible re-release.
Finally when MGM decided to relaunch this film on BluRay recently I jumped at it. Here's what I thought.
The MGM edition is probably as good as they could make it, but it does not come anywhere near the information & features-packed edition that Criterion had produced a decade ago. The quality of restoration was not apparent to me (was it restored at all?) and the picture (as far as I recall) was grainier than the Criterion edition. The result was that my HDTV chose to compress the picture display almost to half screen. yet I could see grains.
My advise to serious film collectors (may their tribe increase):
-  If you are dying to see NOTORIOUS again, beg/borrow/steal a Criterion copy from your friends.
-  If you decide to the buy the MGM BluRay (now you know, its priced cheap for a reason!), do it by all means. But with a view to holding it only until you get your hands on that wonderful rich Criterion Collection edition.
