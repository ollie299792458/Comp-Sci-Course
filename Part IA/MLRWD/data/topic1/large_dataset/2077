This is a classic Disney twist on a tale penned with a less than happy ending.  It's for kids, so of course Disney is going to change the end to be happy.  As far as Ariel not being a 'strong' role model, I can see some people's point, but I think it takes a lot to break out of your family's expextations and go after what you really want.  Yes, she falls in love with a prince (of course), but remember that she is a princess even before she marries Eric.  Also, the much-lauded character of Mulan is based on a Chinese ballad, and in the movie, is a caricature.  Yes, she kicks [...], and proves everyone wrong, showing that women really are strong and can stand up to the test as much as men can.  Fantastic.  It's too bad that such a big deal is made of it, really, because if it were a normal occurance, no one would remark.  If the movie showed that women in general are strong, rather than making a point of this one woman, it would be much more effective for the point that some people try to make with the movie.  Note her mother, who seems to stay at home worrying; also see how she is repressed when revealed as a woman, and left for dead.  Well, that's great.  Show that you are strong, and we'll leave you to prove it.  Hope everything turns out all right, bye.

My point is that no story is perfect, and every story can be seen as 'bad' or 'good' from different angles.  If you are concerned about what your children get out of such movies, then talk to them.  That will teach them far more about life than any movie ever will.  As for the Disney movies, they are stories.  Teach your children right and wrong, fact and fiction, and life will go on.  The Little Mermaid is a favorite of mine, and I highly recommend it as a feel good movie.  Mulan, too, in fact.
