Luckily I've seen both these films several times in the late 80's early 90's.  Also lucky... the sub-titles with both films were complete and accurate.  These are WONDERFUL films.  I've been wanting to add them to my DVD collection, and found these on Amazon at a great price for the pair.

I was so bummed when I watched them because the sub-titling was HORRIBLE!!  I believe they must have used a failing first-semester high school French student to write the sub-titles.  Only 30% of the dialog was written, and not well.  Person 'A' askes Person 'B' a question.. only you would only see the first 3 words of the question... then tons of dialog on the screen, then Person 'B' would answer the question, and if you were lucky, they would answer in such a way that you may be able to figure out what the question must have been.

I'm convinced that if it was not for the fact that I was very familiar with both stories, I would have been completely lost... someone who was not familiar with them, would have absolutely no clue what was going on.

If you are familiar with the stories, by all means, purchase the DVD's.. the price is great and you'll be able to watch and enjoy.  If you have never seen these films before... PLEASE... find versions with GOOD sub-titles, as these films deserve to be watched and read acurately!!
