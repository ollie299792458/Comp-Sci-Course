It's amazing how many people have never heard of this film. I believe it is not considered a Christmas classic because it was shot on video rather than film, and because of this, it has the look and feel of a daytime soap. But the feelings inspired by this film, as well as the first-rate acting, especially from the 3 leads, (Lisa Lucas, jason Robards, and Mildred Natwick) are incredible, and this movie has a powerful effect on me to this day.  This is a perfect film, yet, it is never shown on TV any longer.

Year after year, this program aired on CBS, especially in the 1970's.  My sister and I adored this film, and I still try to get anyone to watch it. It is nostalgic, and the set decoration, as well as the immediacy and realism of the characters are well-crafted.  I'm not sure if actor Lisa Lucas still reads reviews on Amazon.com, but she should realize what a powerful performance she gave as the young Addie Mills. There is nothing overtly sentimental in anyone's performance, and director Paul Bogart created a memorable film in the television medium format.  It was obviously done on a low-budget, but it proves that little money can still make a powerful story.

It's sad, since Jason Robards, Mildred Natwick, and even Addie's friend in the film, "Carla Mae" have passed away. I can only hope that everyone who is still alive who helped to make this film, recognizes what a wonderful film they made that should be re-introduced on television now amongst all the junk that plays every year around the holidays.

A MUST SEE CHRISTMAS CLASSIC. You owe it to yourself to see this little known classic.
