I've read a bunch if not all of the 1 star reviews and I've come to the conclusion that some people just shouldn't watch movies if they cannot pay attention. Or maybe they should watch something less concerting like an action movie where theres little to no dialogue and bad acting. These same people didn't get ( understand ) the movie fight club by stating. i don't get it. whats the big deal with the movie that deals with fight clubs? Again....... go watch an action flick because you surely cannot pay attention to the dialogue.

Shutter Islnad is just like that. You have to pay attention to the dialogue. If you have to stop to go to the bathroom or get some popcorn or ice cream then pause the movie because if you miss one line in this flick there's a big hole in the plot when you get back.

Use your brain. follow along. At the end you'll find out who Tyler Durden really is..... oopsie. thats fight Club talking. Use your brain... follow along closely and at the end it will still be up to you to decide who the main character really is. Its pretty evident who he is but I like the fact that the writer and the director leave you with the tiniest lingering doubt.

Excellent story, excellent movie...... excellent dialogue and excellent acting.
