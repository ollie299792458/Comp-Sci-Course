The movie is fantastic, as is the video and sound on this Blu-ray. Unfortunately, even though this isn't sitting on a shelf in a physical store trying to get your attention, Amazon.com ships this disc with a huge sticker on the front that screams "Digital Copy Included."

Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but this sticker is virtually IMPOSSIBLE to remove without damaging either the special hologram on the cover or the slip cover it sits on. This isn't one of your peel-with-ease stickers that comes right off. No, it's FULLY GLUED ON, and if this package ever encountered any high temperatures when shipping, it's stuck there for good.

You will have residual glue sticking to the hologram, you'll rip off some of the black glossy covering on the slip case, some of the sticker will remain behind without any way to remove it, or your have to dig in your fingernail so deep that you'll leave a permanent dent on the cover.

If you're not concerned about stickers on your slip cases, then you might be annoyed at the shoplifting-proof packaging that increases the chances you're going to ruin your case. Why Amazon, with all its purchasing power, doesn't require manufacturers to send these Internet-only blu-rays without all the shoplifting packaging is beyond me.

Write to Amazon.com and complain about the packaging, the stickers, and the amount of hassle and garbage generated by it!

Or, if you don't care about the case and only care that the blu-ray looks good and plays well, then you should be happy with this movie. It's spectacular fantasy cinema.
