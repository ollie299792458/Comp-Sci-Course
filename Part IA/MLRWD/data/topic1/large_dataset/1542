Well, let me just say I'm glad I rented this.  I liked Valentine's Day (and like that film, I was excited at the prospect of seeing so many talents in one film).  I thought this would be just as cute, but it's pretty forgettable, and unrealistic to boot.  All these people could never fly around NYC on New Year's Eve and never get caught in a traffic jam.  Michelle Pfeiffer's character does all those things in one day? How does Sarah Jessica Parker's character change her clothes so fast right after the ball drops...did Clark Kent loan her his telephone booth?????

I couldn't really get invested in any of the characters (especially Katherine Heigl's chef, and Ashton Kutcher's bitter illustrator), except perhaps Halle Berry's. It was a nice surprise to see her get all dolled up after her shift as a nurse, to go sit in front of her computer and Skype with her husband who is serving in the Armed Forces.

There were some nice moments...one of the pregnant couples finally seeing the big picture after the birth of their son...the daughter helping her father get his dying wish...Josh Duhamel doing a "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles" impression to go see a woman he'd met a year ago, whose name he doesn't even know.

Alas, I wanted to like it, but it's already slipping from my memory banks.  It wasn't total garbage, like some other reviewers stated, but to me it's pretty clear that the actors were just phoning it in.  Two stars.
