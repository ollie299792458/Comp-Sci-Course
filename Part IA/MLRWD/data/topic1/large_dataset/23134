First I just want to start out by saying that I got this DVD a day before I was supposed to recive it and in good condition too.

Britney Spears: Live From Las Vegas
I must say I was to young to attend a Britney concert and my mom would not take me, so I was thrilled when I finally bought this. Britney is just pure amazment and know's how to put on a show. The effects were amazing, the dance routines outstanding and the video clips that they showed were cute. I was surprised how ever to see Jon Voight on the tour but he did a good job. :)

The songs preformed are as followed:
Oops!... I Did It Again,
(You Drive Me) Crazy,
Overprotected,
Born to Make You Happy/Lucky/Sometimes (Medley),
Boys,
Stronger,
I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,
I Love Rock & Roll,
What's It's Like to Be Me,
Lonely,
Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know,
Anticipating,
I'm a Slave 4 U,
...Baby One More Time

You can tell when Britney lip synchs only due to the dancing, who can dance AND sing at the sametime and sound incontrol of their breathing?, but you can also hear her sing LIVE and trys to sing over the tracking.

My favorite's were the Stronger preformance, Lonley Preformance, Oops!... I Did It Again Preformance and Overprotected Preformance.

Her outfits are cute and go with each routine. The video clips were cute and a few were funny.

If you're a true BritBrit fan, then I would suggest picking this DVD up.

It proves that Brit know's how to put on a show. :)

Oh and also, in responce to that one review about Britney and Janet Jackson, they are NOTHING a like when they preform so don't let that get to you if you want to buy this. :)
