If your the type who sits back and watches your movies from a distance don't even bother.

I got the blue green glasses and the movie and watched it with my dad our family usually watches on an approximately 30 inch analog television letterboxed widescreen as per the classic 3D technology sitting 10 feet away there was ghosting, double vision and many moments when things were downright blurry. we had to turn off all other lights to see it half way decent and I had a headache afterward.

After the disappointment I went down and watched it on my laptop with a wide screen monitor approximately same dimensions sitting close to it. Better, but still some double vision and blurriness in some parts. I tried to see it in theaters with 3d, but could not find a place local showing it in 3d. I think the conversion to classic analog 3d compared to other 3d movies I've seen is fairly poor and rushed in come scenes. Your eyes are drawn to the main feature in the shot and the scene is out of focus.

If you are looking for the full experience and have never seen it rent it.
If you loved it in theaters, wait for the technology to catch up.
