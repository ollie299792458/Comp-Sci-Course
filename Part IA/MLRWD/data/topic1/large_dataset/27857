This movie really was good, even though  I don't like the black and the white movies, but that one was exciting, touching and deserves to watches it, because it embodies the occurring life of the Jewish people in World  War II.  Also it seems the gloomy situation of people who were in hiding  places for fear of the Germans to take them to the concentration camps.  Anne Frank's position was one of them, it really was a hard time to live  cut off from outside and deprived of a lot of things.  I didn't know it  until I read the book and I watched the movie.  I can't belive or imagine  how the two families had to be quiet and very careful as much as they could  all the day during the 48 months.  It really makes me wonder how they could  survive the 2 years without freedom and fresh air, the most important  things to live with. I also have some comments about the movie which I  found exactly the opposite of the story for example: Dussel told Anne that  he never got married but I still remember when Anne talked about everyone  in the Secret Annex first wish, when they are allowed to go outside again  he said that he wants to see his wife Lotje. Anne's helpers in the story  were 4 but in the movie were only 2. In general the acting and actors were  convincing.
