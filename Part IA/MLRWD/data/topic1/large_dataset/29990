The Classic Dark Comedy By Tim Burton Follows A Couple Who Die In A Car Accedient and Become Ghost. Along The Way, A New York Family Moves Into Thier House and Start Making HUGE Changes. The Ghost Couple Get Help From A Off-The-Wall Nutty ''Bio-Exosist'' Named Beetlejuice Who Causes Mistif and Mayham To The New York Couple. Afterwards The Ghost Couple Fall In Love With The New York Daughter, Lydia Who's The Only One Who Can See The Ghost Couple. Afterwards The Ghost Couple Try To Convence  Beetlejuice To Stop What He's Doing. But The Mistif-Making ''Bio-Exorsist'' Dosn't Listin and Continues To Make Mayham.

Tim Burton and Micheal Keaton Work Together Brilliantly in This Film as Thay Did A Few Years Later With Batman and Batman Returns. Alec Baldwin and Gena Davis Play The Ghost Couple So Great and Brilliantly That You Can Easily Belive Thay Are An Accturall Couple in Real Life. Winonna Ryder Plays Lydia and She Did It So Brilliantly and Fun She Was Easily The Best of Them All.

The Effects Aren't The Best, But Thay Stilll Bring A Chessy and Fun Look To The Film.

BEETLEJUICE is A Must-See and All Tim Burton Fans Should See It.
