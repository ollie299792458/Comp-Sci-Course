Much like Stanley Kubricks' Eyes Wide Shut, this is a disturbingly different style of cinema photography.

First, the exterior and interior of a large, massively stylish restaurant is stretched across a huge Hollywood soundstage as if a Broadplay ran continuously from one theater to another for several city blocks. Second, many of the camera shots are long takes as the characters move from one area to another. This is only part of the reality style: the camera never looks away. As the accident happens, the rubber-neckers (viewers) are right there, watching the entire scene unfold. Third, the sumptuous of the individual costumes and stages pieces is in stark contrast to the bare openness of the set. Then there is the raw offensive brutality of a way too successful gangster (Gambon) tyrannizing his wife and crew. Plus, there is the titillating full frontal, never look away, nudity of both the voluptuous Helen Mirren and her male lead, who have several scenes in which they never put on clothes and yet remain exposed, vulnerable, in rooms in the restaurant and their hiding place. Set, dialogue, color, violence, nudity are used in ways that film rarely does.

This work exposes the dangerous volcanic emotions running underneath all of ourselves, and our clothes.
