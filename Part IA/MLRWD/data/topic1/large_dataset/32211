This is without a doubt one of the craziest and disturbing movies I have ever seen. This movie has become a cult favorite and will probably be around trippin people out for a long time to come. May is not your run of the mill horror movie, it has that hopeless romantic teen flick feel to it, but at the same time you can tell that this chick is nuttier than squirel turds!and slowly but surely she becomes crazier and crazier but you kind of start to feel for her and at that point she just loses it killing people for revenge and for their "perfect parts" and while she's killing people they are playing some totally out of place music,but at the same time it fits the movie perfectly. I will try not to give away the ending, but it was beyond creepy, I really wasn't expecting exactly what happened, but I do have to say that it was the most perfect ending for this movie, because the director could have kept going but he didn't and that is what made this movie so good, right when you are really creeped out the movie stops, so you are stuck with that creepy feeling, and you just might find youself keeping the lights on that night!
