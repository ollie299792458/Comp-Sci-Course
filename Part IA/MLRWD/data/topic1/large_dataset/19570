This movie reminds me of another film called "Gabriel Over The White House", in which a president is injured in a car crash and changes as a result from a corrupt politician to the savior of the nation.  The political vision of that film holds that the causes of violence, war and corruption in the world are basically some corrupt politicians, the mob, and spineless world leaders.  Likewise, this movie reduces the political powers that constrain a president's autonomy to a couple of white house handlers.  For example, President Dave initiates a bill that will give a job to every person who wants one, and which his successor pushes through Congress.  Absent are the military-industrial complex and the multinational corporations who hold most of the real political power in the world, and who would certainly have some objections to a full employment bill.  Anyone who still believes that the president has any significant power to act on his personal political ideals is naive.

That said, this movie is a lot of fun to watch.  Very enjoyable fantasy.
