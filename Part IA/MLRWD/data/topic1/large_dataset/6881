I purchased this movie to show to my middle school students.  I did have to tell them that Kirk Douglas is Michael Douglas's Dad.  He does a wonderful job of playing an over the top sensitive yet disturbed Van Gogh.  Although not rated, I would probably give it a rating of PG.  The imagery is wonderful!  The extras and actors chosen to portray the subjects of Van Gogh's paintings were so eerily accurate.  The scenery is beautiful, and many of Van Gogh's most famous works are reproduced in scenes.  My students enjoyed seeing "Van Gogh's Bedroom" brought to life, as well as the many portraits of his friends.  The actor who plays the postman is just wonderful.  Anthony Quinn is an excellent Paul Gauguin. The friendship between the two is quite touching and the students seem to really understand what a tortured soul Van Gogh was.

I did obtain parent permission because of the drinking, smoking and fighting in the movie, the violence of the ear cutting is not shown graphically but there is a bit of blood, and he does shoot himself in the end.  Mild language, Vincent says "hell" several times.  They insinuate that his girlfriend is a prostitute but that seemed to go over their heads.  Also, they do drink absinthe although most of them did not know what it was.

Their favorite part was of course when he cut off his ear.  I think the acting is a little bit over the top, but I loved it.  I would recommend this movie to teachers and anyone that is familiar with Van Gogh's paintings and wants to see them brought to life.  The visual aspect alone makes it extremely worthwhile, and outweighs any heavy handed acting.
