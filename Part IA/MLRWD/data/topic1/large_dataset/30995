Because of critics' reaction to Alice in Wonderland in 1951, it is written, Walt Disney actually apologized for the movie and soon after his television show became a hit a few years later, he showed it in its  entirety on TV, thus relegating it to his "minor film" category.  The movie has never been able to shake this image, and that is a shame. We  should remember that "Wizard of Oz" wasn't a giant box office hit  in 1939, and only after it was made an annual event on television did it  become a classic in the eyes of the public. "Alice in Wonderland"  deserves far more attention than it has ever received. The characters are  wonderful. The music is humable, even singable. It's a short film that  takes the viewer into a dreamland, and Disney's animated version stands up  against any of the other live versions that have popped up over the years.  It's time to give this movie the credit it deserves as a classic in  animation. Watch it from a child's point of view, with the amazing images  of a cat that disappears, talking cards, and Alice constantly growing and  shrinking. And then enjoy it as an adult for the dream world into which we  are all swept. And furthermore, the DVD transfer is fantastic, with as many  extras as one will find on a Disney non-special edition disc. Take another  look at this one and be swept away.
