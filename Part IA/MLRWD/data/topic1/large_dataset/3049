Around the World in 80 Days: DVD
I found myself eager to watch the film becuase of all the press release about the film, hoping this would be better than the first release of the film, but found the film to be rather dry and somewhat corny becuase of the added computer graphics.  It almost seemed that the computer graphics were added in order to spice up the film, but they had the opposite effect and made the film corny with a certain fantasy twist.  Which resulted in a fantasy drama.  And my dissapointment to the film began when Walt Disney tried to mix this fantasy life to a real life situation, it made the storyline less attractive.  The alernate beginning found in the main menu of the computerized chicken was completly ridiculous, I would of left it off of the DVD, even my five year old daughter rolled her eyes as if to say, this is pretty corny.  However, despite the corny nature of the film, and the constant switch from fantasy to real life drama, I found Jackie Chan to be at his best.  The fight scenes and action of the film was a brillant display for all Jackie Chan fans, and if it were not for Chan, the film would be a complete waste of time and money.  I have rated this film 3 stars becuase of Chan's performance, otherwise, the fantasy nature of the film mixed in with the films drama was to much to try and swallow, even for my five year old who had a hard time watching the film.
