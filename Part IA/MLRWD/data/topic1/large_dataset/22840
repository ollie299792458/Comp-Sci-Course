Ok look, do not get me wrong. I am all into interesting, deep, artistic, and subtle movies. But they have to make sense to me and this just did not make any point whatsoever. I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my day, and you should not feel that when you watch something that is trying to send an important message to the audience.

The acting, subtle and eccentric humor,  dialogue and the nuances in the actors' expressions and feelings were all fantastic, but it was Murray's character that might have contributed to this "what was the point of all this?" that I got from the movie. Murray did not change at all, and he should have.

He was portrayed as a drifting, middle-aged character with an empty life, flitting through life from one meaningless relationship to another. Then comes his wacky neighbor-Winston, who was my favorite and felt he was the only thing that made this worthwhile to watch, provoking him to have some type of feeling and passion to a very important quest-finding if that letter really meant that he had a son out there and that maybe his life was not such a waste after all. And although Murray wanted to find his son deep down inside, it felt unnatural and forced and not convincing at all, hence the feeling of meaninglessness I got from the movie.

There really was good material for something very touching, but sadly it lacked emotion. Murray's character felt catatonic and robotic. I understand minimalism but this was not it-In The Mood For Love displayed amazing minimalist acting that was not captured here.

At some point I was bored out of my mind and I really believe that his character destroyed the movie's potential.

At the end I felt gypped and angry, ranting at what the hell was the point of all this?

Anyway, just my opinion.
