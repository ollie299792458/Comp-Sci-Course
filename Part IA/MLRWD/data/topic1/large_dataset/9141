The Grudge 2 is the sequel to the 2004 remake of the Ju-On series. The film itself is actually divided into subplots.

The first part revolves around Karen's sister, Aubrey Davis, who comes to Japan to pick up her sister, who is currently in a hospital. We also learn about Kayako's origins and the true power of the curse.

Another part is about three schoolgirls. It is inspired by the schoolgirls of the Ju-On movie, but their relationships with each other differ. Anyway, after entering the cursed house, these girls find that Kayako and Toshio are following them wherever they happen to go.

The other part involves a family in Chicago who is just moving in to an apartment. This may sound very out of place, but it ties in with the curse. Strange occurences are happening in the building, and there seems to be no logical cause.

This film has received numerous criticisms, yet I believe it is better than the first movie. It is interseting to see the connections between all of the stories, and there are a few surprisng plot twists. Obviously if you're not a fan of the genre, which is mainly Japanese horror, I would not see it, but if you enjoyed the first and would like to see a satisfying sequel, watch this movie.
