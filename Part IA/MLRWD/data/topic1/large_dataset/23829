I just have to say, as some one that is utterly obsessed with this story and wrapped up in it. It was very well done. I know that most people view it as slow and it is a slow movie. But it could not have been done any better. Gerda travels through all the seasons to find her beloved Kai. Each season she meets, the enchanting spring lady, the summer princess with the dreams on the wall and the little robber girl of fall all were very beautifully done. I could not have asked for a better story line and something to bring my fantasy to life then this movie. MUCH better then the BBC version and any cartoon version out there. And the bear prince was a wonderful addition. I love it when he tells Kai "If you disturb a sleeping bear then you get a smack!" And also Rutker the talking reindeer. All of it was amazing. I watch this movie every few months and around Christmas time. Kai is right, there is nothing more perfect on this earth this a snowflake it is flawless and no two are alike.

I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to open up a new window to their child of a fairy tale that has been a much loved one for all ages. Even adults can enjoy this too. After all that's what Mr. Andersan wanted, fairy tales that both children and adults could love as one.
