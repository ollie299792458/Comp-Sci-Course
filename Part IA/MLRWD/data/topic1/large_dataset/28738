I was very moved by this film.  I almost don't know what to say about it.  This film is a love story.  It is the story of a simple man who loves the one and the many -  and holds that love in his heart throughout the film.  It is the story of the love of good.  This film is also about what is actually required to make a change in this world.  That thing that we must do is to love - truly love each other.  This film demonstrates that we must do what is driving us in our heart of hearts - that is the good thing that is within us that must be done.  And, we, each of us is the only one who can do it.  When we do that thing  we have in our heart we make an unimaginal impact on the world.

I am so grateful for this film in this day and age.  The other reviews have covered most of the points so I won't.  But I ask you, please watch this film.  And as you do, open your heart to the possibility that each of us is part of the other.  ..  That we can connect in a way that may be unusual or different but we can connect.  It is that connection that will bring peace.
