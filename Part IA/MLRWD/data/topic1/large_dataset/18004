Without the benefit of cell phones and internet access, two young Washington Post reporters, Carl Bernstein (left wing radical Jew) and Bob Woodward (Republican WASP from the Midwest), through hard work and relentness drive, helped bring down a corrupt Presidential administration.

It's more than redundant at this point to say that "All The President's Men" (directed by Alan Pakula from a script by William Goldman and photographed by the brilliant Gordon Willis) is one of the great American films of all time much less a political thriller of incomparable intelligence and style.

Now, 30 years after its theatrical release and 8 months after Deep Throat's coming out of the closet, Warner Brothers issues "Men" in a two disc DVD package, that for the most part, is worthy of its subject.

Disc One contains a beautifully remastered edition of the film plus an intelligent, comprehensive commentary by star-producer Robert Redford (it's not hyperbole to say that without Redford's

participation, the project may never have materialized).

Disc Two contains five featurettes including a 30 minute documentary on the making of the film; a short documentary on

Mark Felt-Deep Throat; a vintage promotional film out of 1976 to coincide with the initial release of the film and a excerpt from the Dinah Shore show, in which Dinah interviews Jason Robards Jr and exhibits a well rounded knowledge of the subject matter.

"All The President's Men" remains one of the great David and Goliath tales of all time and an brilliant examination of the art of investigative reporting.
