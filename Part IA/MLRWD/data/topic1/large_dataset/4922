Most action films today, or in any day, rely on special effects and explosions more so than plot and character development. Although "Sin City" is not a complete exception, it is a stand out from other "click, click, boom" action movies.

The movie comprises of interlocking stories throughout involving different characters. These stories aren't like "Seinfeld" where each of them dose something different that somehow relates to each other and everything is resolved at the end. Much like the story telling of "Pulp Fiction" or "Reservoir Dogs", the movie is shown out of sequence, to relate with each character's segment.

The acting for the most part is what stood out for me. Excellent performances by Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood, who gives one of the most creepiest villain performances I've seen, without uttering a word.

Robert Rodriguez is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers. Not only did he co-direct the movie, he "shot and cut" it (yes that is an actual credit, just look at the back of the DVD) and directed the music as well. I guess when he made a movie over a decade ago with a $7,000 dollar budget, he knows how to do different jobs.

The only fault in "Sin City" is that it is hard to have a strong connection with the characters. When one dies, and many do, you don't have such a strong feeling as you would, say if the movie surrounded one character. The only "main" character seemed to be Bruce Willis. Yes he seems to be reprising his role from "Die Hard", but he dose it well, and for me was the one of the only characters you cared about.

Final thought: The movie is not as violent as you are lead to believe. Kill Bill or the Matrix was more violent than Sin City, but the violence is in a "comic book style", and to sum up what that means here, the blood is almost entirely white...
