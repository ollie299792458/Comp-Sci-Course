T3 is by far the most unique of the series and of the sci-fi genre that I've seen in the past 5 years. It provides the series a slap in the face, if you will. One of the primary themes of the series has been "The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves." One of T3's most significant themes, quite contrary to this, is that some things are inevitable. Since the beginning, the Terminator series was man against machine, man wins. T3 turns the tide. The inevitability of the war and the machines rising crashes in on the audience. Now, part of the future will happen, no matter what is done to try to avoid it. This theme is frequently found in independent films that want to reveal a future that is as likely to happen as triumphant man, but do not cater to the popular vote or the highest dollar. This was totally unexpected, and is quite unnerving when you consider that in 100% of all box-office sci-fi hits, either 1) man triumphs, 2) man has the choice to control fate, or 3) that all of existance revolves around man. T3 took me by surprise, and I hope that it finds your guard down as well.
