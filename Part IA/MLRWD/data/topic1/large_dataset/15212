This is Moore's best, I think. In his signature way, he documents the general principles, the relevant policies, the major players, etc. But he makes the general phenomena come alive by showing their effect on specific families and individuals. What's especially good this time is that he doesn't concentrate only on the negative. He also shows both major figures and ordinary individuals who are fighting for what's right and just, sometimes with notable success.

Some of the most memorable "factoids" that stay with you are the ironies: like the sign-making shop that stays in business mostly by making foreclosure signs; the fact that 60% of the foreclosure notices are processed through Moore's hometown and major disaster area Flint, MI; that a foreclosing bank hires a family to destroy their own furniture and household goods before leaving.

The outrages Moore reveals are intended to galvanize liberals to resist the greed and cruelty of American-style capitalism. But they are the very same outrages that provide the energy one sees among Tea-Baggers. Perhaps the greatest irony of all: among the Tea-Baggers that energy has been co-opted by capitalists like Dick Armey, Fox News, commodity traders, and even CNN now. In other words, the Tea-Baggers' energy is being used to support the very persons and policies that created the crisis in the first place.

What it comes down to is that liberals will love this movie (unless they just don't like Moore's periodic confrontations), and perhaps they'll be moved to act. As it stands, however, conservatives will hate the movie. Nevertheless, if the very same material were re-edited and disociated from Moore, Tea-Bagger conservatives would love it as much as liberals do now.
