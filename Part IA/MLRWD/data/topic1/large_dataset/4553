The Superbit version has the same extra scenes as the "Uncut International Version".  Amazon has it accurately labeled, but the packaging is not obvious.  Both are 133min instead of 110min.  The non-Superbit version has a couple extras like theatrical trailers and talent files.  If you want those extras, get the non-Superbit version.  If you don't care about those extras and are more of a quality freak, get the Superbit version.  The film content is the same either way.

Two scenes deal with Leon buying a dress for Mathilda.  One shows Mathilda threatening to possibly kill herself (Russian roulette) to force Leon to admit he cares about her.  There is a scene showing Leon taking Mathilda on her first cleaning job.  Another involves Leon taking Mathilda to an upscale restaurant, and Mathilda makes a minor scene trying to kiss Leon and drinking champagne.  Then there is a sequence where Leon takes Mathilda on a series of cleaning jobs.  In a later scene, Mathilda implies that she wants Leon to be her "first", and then Leon tells her the story of his first love (and first cleaning job), and Mathilda gets Leon to concede to start sleeping (only literally) with her.

Most of the extra scenes start at around 68min.  They are integrated smoothly and are fully finished; it sounds like these scenes were in the original theatrical release for European markets, so they're only "extra" to the U.S.  If you appericate the film, the extended version is definitely worth it.
