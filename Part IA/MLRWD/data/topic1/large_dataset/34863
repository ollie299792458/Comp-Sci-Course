I just got done watching the UK version on the DVD I just picked up today and all I can say is...INCREDIBLE!  As a fan of this movie there was no doubt that i would buy this today, but i had no idea how nice the transfer would be.  The picture is beautiful and sound is excellent.  Seeing this cult classic on DVD is a dream come true.  There is also a US version with a deleted scene added right into the feature.  There are tons of extras including the different subtitles.  There is reg. english, spanish and 3 "others" versions.  Version 1, subtitle 3 on the DVD, cues you to the things to do during the movie, such as snapping rubber gloves, tthrowing the toilet paper, etc.  Version 2, subtitle 4, shows lips at certain points in the movie that, when you press the enter button, you get greeted by Sal Piro, the RHPS fan club president.  He shows clips of audience reations and fans acting out the current scene in a theater.  Cool!  Version 3, subtitle 5, to this point hasn't done anything, but i am sure it does.  All of this plus more is just on the first disc!  Disc 2 contains excerpts and outtakes from the VH-1 special, including interviews with some cast members.  There is also a VH-1 pop up video of "hot patootie!', a double feature video show, trailers, etc.  If you are a fan of the movie, pick this up!  Even if they had none of the features, the transfer is WONDERFUL!  There was only one scene, Janet and Rocky meeting alone, that was not up to par with the rest of the film.  It only got poor for a little bit and its not that bad.  This is a must have for fans and a beautiful version for those first time "virgins"!  Enjoy!
