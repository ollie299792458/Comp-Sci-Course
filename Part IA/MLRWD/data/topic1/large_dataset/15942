The animation and music was lovely! From Disney, we expect no less. But, a bit like Esmerelda herself, there is more to this movie than a pair of big green eyes. I think Disney took on a real challenge when trying to turn Victor Hugo's tragic tale into something meaningful for children. For the most part, they did a admirable job. But I feel like someone needs to point out that they have jumped on the proverbial wagon, and Disney has thrown its own weight behind some perpetually cruel and misleading stereotypes. This movie does not acurately portray the Gypsy (Romani) people. However, I LOVE that fact that it does highlight some of the injustice they have suffered over the centuries of their wanderings, that it manages to cast sympathy on their plight and suggest that yes, Gypsies are people too, capapble of love and fear and compassion. Hopefully these lessons of tollerance will be more lasting to our children than the visions of seductive women in sugestive clothing that can read palms and conjur magic.
