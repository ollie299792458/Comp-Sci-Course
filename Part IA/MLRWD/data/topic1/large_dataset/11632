Okay, so it's not the book, but as someone else has already pointed out, the book could never REALLY be translated into a  film. The book is too much of a character study that reads like a diary. The film took some of the ideas from the book and turned into a compelling albeit (sometimes) trite story. Still, it manages to portray an interesting and eerily realistic look at that particular walk of life. I went to school with these people. Some of them grew up, like Clay, but some of them did not, like Julian. This film is beautifully, stylishly directed with stunning visual sequences. Gertz is good but McCarthy is only passable and sometimes just weak. Downey is outstanding and his performance is scary and heartwrenching. It's truly one of the most human performances I've seen in a film. The instrumental soundtrack by Thomas (Six Feet Under) Newman is haunting and adds to the exquisite direction. All in all, an above average look at the 80's rich kid, drug/club culture! Still, I can't help but think it will look like anything more than a freakshow to viewers who have never been exposed to this part of society.
