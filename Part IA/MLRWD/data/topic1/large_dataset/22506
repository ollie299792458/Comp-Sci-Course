It's time to replace your Image copy of VAMPYR with this stunning new release from Criterion.  My preordered copy actually arrived on the day of release, even with the free shipping option (thanks, Amazon!), and I watched the feature last night.

While the version from Image is not unwatchable, the improvement that Criterion offers is major.  The image is still quite soft, but has been thoroughly cleaned up.  And the print they used either did not have all of those "punch holes" that the Image disc has, or they did an excellent job of filling them in.  The sound is also very much improved.  And gone are the ugly black rectangles containing the subtitles in an Old English-style font; the subtitles can be turned on and off, and they are in the typical kind of easy-to-read sans serif font you find on most DVDs.

The Criterion release includes two versions of the film:  one with the intertitles and book text insert shots in German, the other with intertitles and book text insert shots in English.  Both have the dialogue in German, so subtitles are still needed when viewing the English text version (unless you're fluent in German, of course).  Dreyer reportedly made the film in English, French, and German versions (and also in Danish?--in one of the DVDs, can't remember which, the father writes his note on the wrapped-up book in Danish).  Sadly, the original English version of the film is no longer extant, at least not in a condition that is watchable.

I have not yet delved into the supplemental materials, but they seem to be substantial.  The packaging is exquisite, and very appropriate to the feature.  The heavy paper slipcase holds a fold-out DVD case (illustrated with images from the film) containing the two discs and a thick booklet with several interesting articles.  Also in the slipcase is a paperbound book containing an English translation of the original screenplay and the original story "Carmilla" by J. Sheridan le Fanu.
