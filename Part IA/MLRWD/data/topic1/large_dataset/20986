This is a great DVD.  Like several people have said before, every true fan of Rammstein needs this DVD.  
First, the good:  Everything is well done and there is quite a bit packed into this DVD.  I especially like having every music video in one place.  The live shows are excellent and illustrate Rammstein&#65533;s development on stage from 1996-2001.  The &#65533;making of&#65533; videos are entertaining and illuminate the band&#65533;s true personality.  It also gave me a chance to test my fading ability to understand spoken German.  
Now, the bad: there are not enough live songs.  Rammstein&#65533;s essence is best revealed on strange, so it was disappointing that there were only about ten or so live songs.  Given that &#65533;B&uuml;ck Dich&#65533; did not appear on the &#65533;Live Aus Berlin&#65533; DVD, I had been holding out hope that it would appear on "Lichthausspiel."  No such luck.  Still, if that is the only negative thing that I can say, then Rammstein has done an excellent job with this DVD.
