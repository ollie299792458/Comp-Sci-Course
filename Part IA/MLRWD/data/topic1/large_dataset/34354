When their workaholic father dies, luckless brothers Ernie (Nathan Lane) and Lars (Lee Evans) Smuntz are surprised to learn that their inheritance is not only the money-losing string factory Pop founded, but also an old Victorian mansion that turns out to be worth a fortune. The rundown manor is an architectural masterpiece known as "The Lost LaRue". Ernie and Lars - one fired from his job and the other thrown out by his wife - decide to live in the house, fix it up, and cash in by selling it at a private auction. They soon find out they have a roommate in the form of a resolute rodent who has no intention of vacating the premises. Think "The Roadrunner" as you watch this seemingly indestructible mouse go from one extreme escape to another.

Mouse Hunt is a dark comedy, seemingly made for kids but really highly inappropriate for children. There are countless violent scenes (though it's mostly people who wind up this side of sore), including an implied one with a little girl sobbing as her kitten is dropped off at the pound and promptly gassed to death. If Charles Dickens did broad comedy, this would be the result. I love it.
