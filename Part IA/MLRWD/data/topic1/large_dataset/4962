Western aren't really my kind of movies. I usually like horror and comedies. However the movie "Silverado" might just have changed my mind, it might change yours if you don't like Westerns either. This movie contains everything you'd expect in a western. The classic scenes, cowboys in the deserts having shootouts to them just having a drink at the canteens. There is one thing uniqe about his movie though, it contains comedy, not a lot of westerns do. Maybe that's another reason why I like it so much. I gotta say, though, this movie wouldn't have been the same without the wonderful soundtrack it had.
The soundtrack grabs your attention and delivers suspense chills at the right time. The soundtrack contributes the grasping feeling you get that keeps you in your seat waiting for more action, which never ends. You might think you're gonna know what's next, however that's not the case and the soundtrack contributes to that edge-gripping feeling you get as you're watching it.
So in conclusion, what I'm saying is that "Silverado" has everything. From cowboys doing a shootout to them being in a bar just drinking. It takes place in the desert, surrounded by cactuses, the sun, and spectators watching the showdowns. What I'm saying is just watch the darn movie!
