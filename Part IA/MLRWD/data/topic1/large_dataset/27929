This may be a collector's edition but it is not THE collector's edition. The real collector's edition will have the entire series, INCLUDING the Dead Dog Records arc. Leaving out some seven episodes is significant in my view. Not to mention the omission of "Nights in White Satin" is just plain WRONG. Without that song,the entire scene is just a couple of guys sitting on the floor looking at each other. And "Stairway to Heaven" without "Hit the Road Jack" loses the entire reason for Frank shooting the jukebox.

A collector's edition is something you pay more for because it's worth it, something you really want and will return to again and again. Not something you get simply because "oh well, I can't do any better so I'll settle for this." I suppose the idea is that we should be grateful for whatever we can get. "Wiseguy" is "Wiseguy," after all. And yet Wiseguy without an entire plot arc, Wiseguy with massacred music, this is just sad and disappointing. I may be chasing an elusive holy grail dream here, but I want Wiseguy in its entirety. I want to see Vinnie and Sonny eyeballing each other to the strains of the Moody Blues and Frank McPike blowing the jukebox to blazes with "Hit the Road, Jack" as the number that drives him over the edge. And I want my music arc! I want to see Tim Curry and Glenn Frey and Blondie.

C'mon people. Release it right or don't release it at all -- but for sure don't tell me it's wonderful when it's not. Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.
