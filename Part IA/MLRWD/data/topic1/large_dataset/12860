I am focusing specifically on the UK Blu Ray edition of this movie. I really wanted just the first movie in my collection, but the US stand-alone disc is ridiculously overpriced at $49. There were also sellers who had this edition available to ship within the US, so I did not pay any international shipping costs. It is region free and it played without a hitch on my PS3. I've read reviews that say the quality is the same between this and the US version, so it's a win-win! I do not have the US version to compare it to, so I'd be interested if anyone out there finds this not to be the case.

My main complaint is that the special features are not updated from the DVD Special Edition release, and they are not in HD. However, this is a great collection of special features for this movie. This is a better collection of features than any of the Nolan films have.

The other nitpick is that the UK version has those annoying rating logos on the front of the cover. US movies usually have these on the back, so as to not soil the cover artwork. It's a minor problem, and it's not worth paying an extra $25+ to change it.

I highly recommend buying this edition.
