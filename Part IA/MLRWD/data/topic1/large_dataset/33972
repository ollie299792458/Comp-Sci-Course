One of the nice things about this movie is the story.  Like a lot of people, I think that time travel movies are very fascinating.  If you are one of these people, don't miss this movie.  But, don't think of this movie as just a science fiction, make-believe movie.  Beyond that part of the story, the facts and details of this movie are suprisingly accurate.
One of the most intesting things about this movie is that it not only depicts the US Navy in a positive light, but it also accurately shows how things work on an aircraft carrier (or did at the time the movie came out).  For example, you will get to see a glimpse of how they control the launch and retrieval of aircraft, the workings of the Bridge, senior crew quarters, and procedures for handling prisoners, just to name a few.  Watching this movie, I felt that if the USS Nimitz did go back in time, the movie accurately dipicts what actions the Captain and crew might really carry out in reaction to such a scenario.
If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it.
