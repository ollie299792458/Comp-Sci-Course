Pros:

3D is the best I have seen(Fright Night 3D is second place) and is better than RE:Afterlife 3D and Underworld Awakening 3D which is more about depth than pop out(this movie has alot of great pop outs).

Pays alot of homage to the original.

Good pacing of the story.

Great popcorn flick.

Does make some minor tweaks to the story for a remake, most remakes are total copy and paste.

On your first time veiwing it really keeps your attention right up until the end.

Excellent video and sound quality when watching the movie.

Cons:

Predictable in alot of ways.

Outside of minor tweaks to some of the story,its more of the same.

Horrible,low sound quality when characters are talking in the deleted scenes and loud sound effects.

No new extra features for the blu ray release.

Overall: Its a great movie, especially if you never seen this or the original. The movie introduces a different spin of the killer which gets my respect for not being a 100 % exact copy of the original just updated for modern times and the 3D is so awesome with tons of pop out. Just pop some popcorn and get ready to enjoy a decent slasher film with great 3D.

Movie:3/5
3D: 5/5
