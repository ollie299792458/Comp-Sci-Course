Director Sally Potter's fondly embraceable, slightly over-elaborate big screen version of Virginia Woolf's famously psychedelic tale is a moving study in the power of understatement, and a testimony to how even the most justified taking of print-to-screen liberties may sometimes come back to nip its creator. In giving the androgynous-looking Tilda Swinton (probably best known to US audiences as the White Witch in the recent Narnia adaptation) the starring role as a striking young Elizabethan lad who literally carries out his venerable Queen's command that he not age or wither, and thusly lives through the next four centuries first as a man, later after a metamorphosis as a woman, the makers of this motion picture chose well. As Orlando travels through the decades and centuries, he experiences many things. He falls in love with a fickle Russian noblewoman who is visiting the court of King James I during a winter of deadly cold; he tries his hand at poetry-writing under the guidance of a seventeenth-century con-man; the one-time male makes his entrance in the decadent eighteenth-century as a female, and reaps the consequences of this bodily change. She, Orlando, goes on to spill unexpectedly in love again in Victorian times, endures pregnant during the chaos of World War One, and finally faces a tragically unfair legal confrontation in modern times that undermines even the era-spanning authority of England's greatest queen. The film Orlando is as I said fantasy for thinkers. It sketches its story on the canvas of British history, distant and modern, and if to be dubbed unique is the high praise, then it warrants the highest praise that can be given.
