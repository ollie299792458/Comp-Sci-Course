The Amazon.com editorial review is one again critical of an anime series which leads me to believe that if you're not a Disney animated movie, your going to get poor reviews...
  This anime is absolutely fantastic.  It reminds me a lot of a pre-PS2 era Final Fanstasy storyline.  I will agree that there are many French and German stylized (circa WWII) elements that are noticeable.  At the same time you get a distinctive feel of desolation in a world that suffers from water pollution ('I wonder if you even need to boil [the water] before you drink it?')--perhaps the world is covered in ocean and therefore forcing developments in sea travel that evolved into an obsession with the sky and air travel.
  The Amazon review stated, "...the filmmakers fail to set up the odd, war-torn world of the series satisfactorily."  I disagree entirely, they gave me more than enough story to be clawing at the guys at the anime store for more information on the next release.  It is my opinion that the teasing/taunting style in which 'First Move' leaves off is perfect and could not have been done better... especially from a marketing standpoint.
  At any rate this is a wonderful and intriguing dvd that goes beyond my greatest expectations.  The animation it top-notch, the presentation is great, the lead characters are well developed, and the storyline is, as I said, intriguing.
  On a personal note one of my favorite parts in this dvd is when a 'musketeer' is about to go into battle and chants in a prayer-like fashion "May Disith bullets pass by Mullin Shetland's body." and then he is the sole survivor... great scene.
