Seldom is the incomparable Harrison Ford in a project that doesn't score, and this 1990 thriller, adapted from author Scott's Turow's best-selling book, had audiences flocking and critics raving. Little wonder, given that director Alan J. Pakula historically goes for the intellect ("All the President's Men") and manages to get the most from his actors. Here, Ford is deputy prosecutor Rusty Sabich who lives to regret allowing himself to be seduced by a stunningly but venomously beautiful fellow prosecutor (Gretta Scacchi). The self-serving and manipulative lady turns up brutally murdered, and circumstantial evidence rooted in his affair with the deceased points to Sabich as the prime suspect. As Sabich's meticulous and ever-so-ethical attorney, the late Raul Julia is brilliant as the craftsman who dismantles the state's case because of shoddy investigative work and despite his client being set up by his own boss and second main suspect (Brian Dennehy). Despite his exoneration, Sabich's career is nonetheless destroyed and his family life in on thin ice. As Sabich's long-suffering but devoted and faithful wife, Bonnie Bedalia is a fascinating study piece, and the punch she KO's her husband with may not be so much a shock as is her monologue at film's end. "Presumed Innocent" remains a classy thriller that, with Pakula's intelligent guidance, keeps us guessing throughout while, at the same time, maintaining the possibility that the accused actually did it. For Ford, his performance soars to its usual lofty heights.
