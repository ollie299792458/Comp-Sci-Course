Why did I love this movie so much?  Well...the locations and set designs( especially Venice) are breathtakingly beautiful, as is

the stunningly sophisticated Armani costuming.  A visual feast!

The songs of Cole Porter are the icing on the cake. Whether it's Kevin Kline's intentional off key rendition of "In the Still of the "Night" ala Cole Porter, the footstomping production number of "Anything Goes or experiencing a Porter tune such as "Let's Do It" reworked, updated and sung by one of today's hot young rock stars Alanis Morrisette in a great performance, the songs are fabulous!  The true heart of the movie for me though was the deeply complex relationship between Cole and his wife Linda.

Through the ups and downs, gay liasons, miscarriage, accidents, sickness, she remained his anchor, his muse, his soul mate. Maybe for her, it wasn't so much the desire for physical love, but the love of his creative genius, which can be just as potent a force. I believe she truly, deeply loved him beyond his earthly flaws.  A beautiful, touching film.  Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd were magnifient!  Brava!
