The arrival of this Bluray, non-region specific, edition is welcome indeed. Beautifully rendered in it's original 1.66:1 format, in keeping with the original version and a format much-favoured by film-makers in Europe during the 1960's. The image is of course much cleaner than the earlier dvd version and the occasional observable grain entirely in keeping with the compositing technology of the times in which it was made. Nevertheless, the much sharper image reveals much more in the way of detail of the animated characters, maintaining the essential hands-on, tactile quality of Ray Harryhausen's imaginatively crafted figures. The "skeleton combat" , surely a Harryhausen masterpiece, is even more vividly creepy than ever.

The 5.1 DTS-HD MA mix is a lot cleaner, though I don't really think it can truly claim to be anything but a mono soundtrack spread "wide". Never mind. This full-bodied example of Bernard Herrmann's stirring and at times moodily atmospheric music that, even in mono, is perfect in every way. Director Don Chaffey clearly had a ball with his cast of British stalwarts, Laurence Naismith, James Donald and Nial MacGinnis in particular contributing much, though the whole cast enter into the spirit of the thing with gusto.
  Hercules, as portrayed here, is a brilliantly conceived piece of casting. No absurdly sharp-toned pectorals to be seen here. Just a bluff, good nature big guy in a lion skin who means well.

The disc-extras, and good they are too, seem to be much the same as are seen on the earlier dvd version, with the addition of more recent contributions from Peter Jackson. All in all a very satisfying reason to set aside your older dvd version.
