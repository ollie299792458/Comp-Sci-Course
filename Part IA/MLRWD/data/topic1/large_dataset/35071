I own the Frederick Forysythe novel, the 1973(?) film on DVD, and now this DVD (having seen it on satellite TV recently, I liked it enough to make it part of my collection).

Without a doubt, the original is better.  But that doesn't mean this film is a stinker.

This film is a VERY loose remake of the original, NOT a modernization.  The main storyline has changed ENTIRELY, so don't expect it to appear.  But many elements from the original novel/movie DO make it into this remake: those who hired the Jackal holed up in a hotel, the kidnapping and torture of their courier to learn what's going on, the Jackal's use of multiple identities and disguises, the Jackal's changing his vehicle's color, one person who supplies the Jackal wants more money and is eliminated, etc.  All these come to mind as I type; I'm sure there are some that I'm forgetting.

The remake is good, but not great.  There's more shoot'em'up and less intrigue than the original novel/movie.  While I don't think the shoot'em'up was overdone (the goal of the Jackal in the remake was to make a VERY public statement, not shoot a single sniper's bullet and then disappear as in the original), I do believe it was too short on the intrigue aspect of the original.

This remake works for me.  I'm happy to add it to my collection.
