I was unprepared to see such a classic performance by two actors I have never seen before in an MMA related movie. There were so many story lines and plots in the movie, that it completely overshadows the MMA, that wives and girlfriends alike would enjoy seeing this movie as well.. Nick nolte is cast perfectly as the drunk father of the two brothers.. He becomes sober, and trains one of them who has gone AWOL from the war in Iraq.. The older brother is a physics teacher, but is then suspended from his job, as he fights to help maintain his home and family.

If you are a big MMa fan, you would enjoy it somewhat, although the MMA is tarnished somewhat by the Coda Aka Kurt Angle, who does some pro wrestling moves that are too unrealistic for the MMA... It also seemed to be a big promotion for TapOut, which is the biggest producer of MMA apparel in the world. The movie was dedicated to it's creator Charles Mask Lewis, who died in an Motocycle accident two years ago.

At the end of the movie, I said to myself, that this was a highly underrated movie and should have gotten more acclaim for the whole production.. Too bad it did not do well in the box office.. Now people should rent/buy it.. Definitely!
