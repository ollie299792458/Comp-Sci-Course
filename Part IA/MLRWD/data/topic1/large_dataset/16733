I went to a screening of the extended version of Stripes.

For those who liked the original, the extended version is even better.  It filled in a number of small story holes that were in the original movie: more detailed reasons for joining the army in the beginning and a clearer storyline in the middle.

There was one scene they added where Bill Murray's and Harold Ramis' characters desert the army by jumping on a paratrooper plane only to be captured by a Spanish rebellion.  That one, in my opinion, could have been left out.

The best addition to the original?  P.J. Soles topless!

The worst addition to the original?  Bill Murray dry humping P.J. on the floor of their hotel room in Germany.

I can't comment on any of the other additions that the dvd has since I only saw the extended version at the theater.

Would I buy the extended version to replace my regular dvd version? Yes, I would.. especially since it's under $20 on here.

Additional movie warnings: nudity, profanity, and more singing on Bill Murray's part.
