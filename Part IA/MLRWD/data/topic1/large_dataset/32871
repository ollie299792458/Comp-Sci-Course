The term "coming-of-age" is often over-used when describing movies, and I have a tendency to shy away from those that state so on the DVD case.  However, I picked up Lymelife mainly due to the great cast.  I was not disappointed.

I was drawn into this movie immediately.  There is superb character development, particularly in Rory Culkin's Scott Bartlett.  The deep, bordering on love friendship he has with Emma Roberts' Adrianna is perfectly portrayed.  These two are obviously the center point of the film, but there are so many other characters that, although secondary, do not seem any less significant.  Alec Baldwin sets aside his terrific humor and gives a splendid performance as Scott's tough-love father.  And I'll agree with another reviewer who asked where's the Oscar nomination for Timothy Hutton?  His Lyme disease-suffering Tommy is spectacular.  The bar scene with him and Baldwin is nothing short of masterful.

Lymelife is a little known film with several big names in it.  I would hazard to guess that most people you would ask had never heard of it.  I for one immediately told several people to watch it right away.  And I'm recommending it here.
