this is one of my top 10 favorite horror movies ever!!! i can't believe that i finaly found it on dvd,this flick is HARD TO FIND!!! i also can't believe how unknown & underrated this GREAT horror movie is. this scary movie is glued together by a genuine & simple display of FEAR!!!!  director VICTOR SALVA captures this genuine sense of fear in just about every other scene & he does it by simpley keeping it very REAL! i mean REALISTIC in the sense of tapping into REAL CHILDHOOD FEARS such as (monsters under your bed,monsters in your closet & feeling like somthing is right behind you & yes the fear of clowns) these are true childhood fears! although the monsters under the bed & in the closet ,clowns,& the nothing monster following you threw the dark may not be so real or true,what is REAL is the common FEAR that creates them.this is what makes VICTOR SALVA'S "CLOWNHOUSE" a true & honest horror MASTERPIECE!!!YOU DON'T NEED ALOT OF BLOOD OR ACTION, ALL YOU NEED IS TO KNOW WHAT !!SCARES!! PEOPLE!!!!!!!!! "CLOWNHOUSE" should be just as big,groundbreaking & remembered  like "HALLOWEEN"  "TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE" & "PSYCHO" as true horror blueprints(aka the way its supposed to be done) but its not & thats a shame!! im sick & tired of hearing about VICTOR SALVA'S personal problems, it does nothing but make the dark cloud looming over this movie that much bigger , & this movie is too damn GOOD to be ignored like that. im a HORROR fan & i believe its a shame that such a superb horror movie is so hard to find because of a mental illness that the director has  !! THIS WILL NEVER STOP ME FROM ENJOYING THE SCARIEST CLOWN MOVIE EVER!!!!!. p.s CHEEZO  makes PENNYWIZE look like a walk in the park!! PENNYWIZE looks like a scary clown in your nightmares BUT!! CHEEZO looks like a sick clown that would stalk u in real life!. reality is scarier than fantasy!!!!!
