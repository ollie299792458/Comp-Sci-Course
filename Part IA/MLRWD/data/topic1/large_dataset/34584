This movie is about a very serious and important subject and it treats the subject seriously at times and in what I consider a silly way at others. At the beginning of the movie I almost decided to give up on it - this was not hilarious to me. I'm glad I didn't! I did smile a couple of times later on (e.g. at their version of two Christmas carols), but I did not laugh as I had expected to do when I read that it was "hilarious". What I didn't expect, was to be so moved! I did cry at two points - once during the movie and once while watching the bonus material about the ten commandments, made in China.

Obviously, what I consider silly, many people consider funny. Also, I am the sensitive type and many people may not feel sad or moved. What I do hope is that this movie makes people think about the results of our  over-consumerism - the exploitation by large companies of workers in developing countries and the negative effects on the quality of our lives when we lose sight of what gives us real satisfaction (hint: it's not the next name-brand piece of clothing we find, when our closet is already over-flowing).

I do recommend the movie, though most of its humor is not my cup of tea. It did something more important than make me laugh, it made me re-think the way I live.
