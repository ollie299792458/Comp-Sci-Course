I was one of the many losers who wasn't able to get tickets to see this show, so I waited on pins and needles for its release on DVD and let me tell you - you will NOT be disappointed. As any true Metallica fan knows,  seeing a live show is equal to a religious experience and this disc proves,  without a shadow of a doubt, that Metallica can rock in even the most  unexpected of circumstances (headlining a symphony?). You've all heard the  CD, but watching the performance brings it into a new light. Not only is  the sound great and the visuals superior (the picture on this DVD is one of  the clearest I've ever seen), it is fun to see the crowd scenes. From the  protesters outside, to the symphony fans rolling their eyes at the t-shirt  clad youth surrounding them, to the tattoo covered shirtless man in the  audience, singing along and cheering with the best of them, the crowd is  definitely worth seeing. One of the highlights of the show is during  "Memory Remains", when the audience fills in for Marrianne  Faithful, never missing a beat.  This disc is 2.5 hours of pure  adrenaline, guaranteed to please. Invite some friends over and have a night  of "culture".
