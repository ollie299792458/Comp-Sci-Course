Now almost 60 years old- Rocky Balboa,

a legend of the boxing-ring, spends his days

running a restaurant- named after his late wife

and love of his life- Adrian.

There's nothing left to prove.

Throughout his career, Rocky took on the best...

and he beat the best! His legacy is known all over,

by the many fans who stop him in the street-

asking for an autograph or a photo with

the two time ex-champion of the world!

He tells the old boxing stories!

He talks about old friends- and makes new ones

everywhere he goes. He's remembered as a legend,

a man who never backed down.

A man who fought hard- right until the very end.

Until suddenly, one day.......

There's a whole new beginning!!!

A computer simulated fight,

between Rocky Balboa- and the current

champion of the world, Mason Dixon-

is broadcasted on Television.

The computer shows, that if Dixon had ever stepped

into the ring against Balboa when he was in his prime...

Balboa would have been victorious!

This computer simulation gets everyone talking.

It gets Mason Dixon's attention, and it also gets

60 year old Rocky Balboa's attention....

who is now approached by Dixon's manager,

and asked to fight an exhibition match

against the champion!

"Rocky Balboa" the 6th film in the Trilogy-

is surprisingly, very well made!

It takes us back to the style of Part 1

and re-captures some of its old spirit!

A 60 year old man, with nothing left to prove,

and a 20 year old man, with plenty left to prove-

step into the ring, for the fight of a lifetime!

The past will meet the present-

and a whole new generation will meet

The Italian Stallion...Rocky Balboa!

It Ain't Over- Until It's Over.
