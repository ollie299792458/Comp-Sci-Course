This film has two plotlines--horror/supernatural and reality-based courtroom drama.  On the surface, the two plotlines can only work against each other.  How can the supernatural coexist with the courtroom?  In contrary, this is the film's strength.  The courtroom drama anchors horror elements in "reality," therefore adds depth to the film.  It intensifies the terror.  As a bonus, the film avoids being a clone of "Exorcist."

The courtroom drama is well-thought out.  It touches upon some enduring issues:
Good vs. evil
Religious morality vs. Human laws
Medicine vs. Spirit
Doctor's obligation to treat vs. Patient's refusal of treatment
As one watches the movie, he/she is inadventently taking sides, as one of the 12 juries selected.

The two plotlines in one movies does have its drawbacks, resulting in some awkward or underdeveloped moments.  For an example, the story suggests that the defense lawyer (Laura Linney) is under demonic attack during the trial, which engenders her spiritual growth.  The subplot adds emotional weight to the story.  However, this suggests that demons are real. The film is taking side of the defense.

Despite this, the film is a resounding success.  Scary moments are painful to watch.  Sound effects are creepy.  The acting is superb.  It leaves viewers a lot to think about long after the credits.
