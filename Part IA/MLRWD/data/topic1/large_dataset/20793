Wow.  That's basically all I can think of to say.  Wow.  Yeah, this is THE worst film that I've ever seen.  Actually, I'm not even sure if I can classify it as such, because I couldn't actually force myself to watch the whole thing.  First of all, the movie looks like it was homemade.  The film quality is like that of a soap opera, which, to tell the truth was almost more than I could handle in the first place (and very, very rarely is film quality something that I even think about when I watch a movie).  Secondly, as other reviewers have mentioned, the plot and the script are pathetic.  I really cannot express how horrible this movie was.  Also, on a personal note, I was really bothered by the fact that the main character who appeared to be in his fifties or sixties has two "deep" romantic relationships with two boys who must be in their teens.  I know that this might not bother anyone else, but personally it really grosses me out (because of the age difference (it's be illegal in the US)not because they're gay).  Anyway, that aside, the point is to avoid this movie at all costs
