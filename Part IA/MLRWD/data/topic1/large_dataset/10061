Wow!
What an awsome movie!
It follows the book, of the same name, almost to the letter.
The acting done by Depp and Del Toro is nothing short of amazing!
Some people who are unfamiliar with the late and great Hunter S. Thompson may not understand what is going on here or appreciate it but for those people I recommend they read some of his books and then watch this work of art come to life.
This is a much better presentation of HST and his weird sidekick Dr.Gonzo than Where the Buffalo Roam.
This was, for me, a much better experience because they did everything just the right way in this movie and they cast much better actors this time around.
(Dont get me wrong though, Bill Murray and Peter Boyle are great actors but I think they were wrong choices for the roles of HST and Dr.Gonzo)
Terry Gilliam did a fantastic job and I think this is some of his best work.
You dont need to be on drugs for this trip to search for the american dream because the reality of it is more screwed up than any LSD trip.
Awsome movie and it is one of my all-time favorites!
The criterion version should be the only one anyone should buy because it is packed with all the necessary extras and other trimmings that a fan would want.
If you have not watched this then please do so right now and see the world through the eyes of Gonzo!
