If you are so disposed as to be willing to accept it, joy should follow each and every viewing of this excellently bright movie. Do you need an uplifting plot for an uplifting musical? How about several main characters yearning to find their soulmates? Yet there is plenty of plain fun and humor here too. What you also get is an exquisite cast, bright colors, exceptional cinematography, dance that you no longer see, and lots and lots of great music to transfer you out of the doldrums. Yeah, there are quite a few dancers in Go-Go boots. Maybe it's satire; maybe the producers got a good deal. But you know that you are in the 60's. It's French, it's American, and in the end it's just a whole lot of joyful charm. For the first viewing (if you don't already know), I recommend that you turn the subtitles off and subject yourself to the beautiful French language. The actors are obviously having fun, and this is what puts this film over the top.  P.S. Is Gene Kelly too old for Francoise Dorleac? One of the main themes here seems to be that with artistic soulmates, the usual rules do not apply. Check out William Henderson's excellent (if a bit difficult) book "The Science of Soulmates". Also check out Francoise's look when she first sees Gene...priceless?...a hint of the eternal? Furthermore, Kelly's performance is nothing short of sublime.
