These days I see Robin Williams on a movie poster with the word "dad" anywhere in the title and I run the opposite direction with visions of screaming kids and Robin Williams in full faux-coke freak-out mode in my head.  I think those same visions are the ones that are responsible for all the 1 star reviews for this refreshingly different black comedy.  I can only imagine the lovers of such hits as Patch Adams and Old Dogs grabbing this up for some wholesome (and awful) family viewing only to find themselves confronted with a comedy with more on its mind than poop jokes.

Here we have a comedy that is notable because it ISN'T about opposites attracting or the jerk getting his comeuppance and fixing his relationships.  This is a film that stays sharply funny while steering away from preconceived notions of what it is to be a good parent, an honest person and human tendencies to view the dead in a glowing light.  It's unique and dark and poignant and deserved better than it got.

To put this film's fate into perspective, consider that it cost $10million to make and only made $200k but received a 95% rating from Rotten Tomatoes.  Comparatively, Old Dogs - a more typical Robin Williams groaner - cost $35million and made $90million yet had a STUNNING 6% on Rotten Tomatoes.  Simply put, the box-office failure of World's Greatest Dad is simply a crime.

If you like your comedies to surprise you, check this one out and you'll fully understand why I had to list the box-office disparity above.  If you disagree, take heart in knowing that another comedy like Old Dogs will be out in a month or so.  Another comedy like World's Greatest Dad?  You won't see the likes of for a very long time.
