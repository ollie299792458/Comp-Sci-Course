I always told myself I preferred Toy Story 2, but when my sister finally got a copy of the first one, I sat down to watch it again - and was totally blown away.  Toy Story 2 is just a fun movie, with action and humour and great graphics, but this is actually pretty angsty.  Sid is one of the best villains I've ever seen (was I the only one who was cheering and punching the air in the confrontation scene?) and Woody's jealousy is really well portrayed, not dumbed down at all.  The emotions and characters in the movie are complex and satisfying to watch (although it'd be nice to have a more central female character.)  I can see the point of those people who complain about it being too scary for their kids - I'd say don't buy this for the under-fives unless your child is a horror junkie.  My sister (who is five) still gets scared by the scenes in Sid's room and insists on someone watching the movie with her for that reason.  However, overall this is one of my favourite kid movies and well worth a watch however old you are.
