I quite simply love this movie. The acting is great (cast includes, Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains) and it has an awesome story line, and to tell the truth, five years ago, I was not interested in movies such as CASABLANCA. I used to really dislike black and white movies, but then I really began to appreciate movies such as this, ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE and WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Now I'd prefer a good ol' classic any day over dull sitcoms or reality shows.

 To summarize, this movie is based in Casablanca (in Africa) and this place serves as an "in between" point for many people in Europe trying to make their way to the U.S. In Casablanca, there is a popular nightclub/casino called Rick's Cafe. It is at this place where a lot a "wheeling and dealing" goes on between the people trying to leave Casablanca, and those who forge and work out the paperwork (a lot of money is spent too). It is also at this location where a certain woman walks back into a mans life. This movie it TOO good to spoil, so I'll stop there, but please if you get a chance, watch this movie!!!!
