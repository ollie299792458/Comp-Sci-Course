There are always a few movies that are better served by knowing next to nothing about them, so there is no expectation or preconceived bias. This is definitely that kind of movie. This movie is better understood if you run the course of the relationships with the characters, finding out what makes them tick as the movie progresses, like how you would get to know someone in the real world. This movie could be spoiled, to an extent, even if I told you what happens in the first scene. There isn't much I can add that someone hasn't already said, so I'm just going to say: Watch It. Decide for yourself. (After watching come back and read the next part of my review;)

*Spoiler (somewhat)*
The part that really got me in this movie was the last voice-over by Tyler. This happens after the climax and you now know everything and Tyler just says, "I love you. God I miss you. And I forgive you." That is the part that chokes me up, and the part where you can really understand the context of the movie.
