i am sure there are enough cynics in the world who would totally hate this movie, but i for one could care less about those guys, cause i loved the movie!!! :-) heres the breakdown on the flick its about a girl played by katherine heigl whose on a trip to france with her parents, tom selleck and  catherine o'hara, (whom i thought were wonderful as the parents) cause she got dumped by her geek boyfriend douche bag, but lucky for her cause she meets real love in the form of ashton kutcher, whom she does not know is a spy but he quits the life for her cause he wants a normal life and a family. anyways this does not sit well with his boss cause he wants him to stay in the game. in 3 years later living the suburban life he gets unexpected mail from his boss saying he wants him back he still denies him and now theres a 20 million dollar contract out for him!, and the friends he thought he knew are out to get him. so thats my summary of the movie, a very funny film and i enjoyed it very much! :-D it probably will not be enjoyed by many people expecting more from a ashton kutcher movie, i mean come on its kelso! dont expect too much from this guy, its just an open fun movie that people with open minds will enjoy!
