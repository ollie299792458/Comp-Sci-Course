Firstly, I don't believe I ever saw "Mosquito Squadron" so it might be that any one of all four are worth it.

"Attack" being the best of the lot with the aforementioned caveat.  A gritty black and white 50s WW2 classic, with Jack Palance as effective as hero in this one as he was as the villain in Shane, backed up by the great Lee Marvin and Eddie Albert.  I doubt seriously that the Department of the Army was in any way thrilled with this one or lent its cooperation in any way, as the film's horrific depiction of war as a meat grinder totally devoid of any vestige of glory with the lives of common soldiers spent senslessly on the alters of their officer's ambition, incompetence, or cowardice by turns.

"Porkchop Hill" is another nearly as good B&W, similarly gritty war film, this time depicting an actual Korean War battle fought, not for any strategic advantage or with any prospect of one enemy vanquishing the other, but as a demonstration of will by opposing non combatants while negotiating a truce testing each side's willingness to allow their fighting men to simultaneously die over worthless ground while they discuss terms over a conference table at Panmunjom.  Gregory Peck stars as the stalwart Lieutenant, bitterly aware of these machinations, while making a desperately heroic stand against hordes of attacking Chinese with the small surrounded remnants of his nearly decimated company.

"633 Squadron" stars Cliff Robertson in an exciting aerial combat film about a British squadron of WW2 fighter bombers (Mosquitos, actually) and their mission to destroy a highly strategic Nazi target in Norway, flying precariously through narrow fiords and walls of German flak.  The only one of the three reviewed that might inspire a gung-ho visit to a recruiter.
