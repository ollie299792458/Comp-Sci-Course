A very good effort by all concerned.

Any film based (however loosely)on true events and real people will run into challenges and Defiance is no different. It would not be surprising to learn that the real Bielskis were not quite as noble and altruistic as they come to be portrayed here; but that is not really the point of a 2 hour movie.

I particulalry enjoyed the scenes of day to day living in the forest. Craig and the rest of the cast were convincing. Craig's character, Tuvia was often faced with extremely hard choices/moral dilemmas and his reactions were credible, as was his indecision in the marshes when the young brother steps into the breech in his stead. And generally, if you had not read their story the narrative was tense.

One beef I had was the fact that the most nervous member of the group was always on guard duty at camp!  For that task, you'd place your most trusted guys, not the most skittish. Also, there would have been other safety rules-eliminating wood smoke by day, particulalry when Germans were expected nearby, keeping noise down etc. At times the camp seemed a bit to free and loose, given the potential for discovery.

Still, as a WW2 movie fan, I'd say this was one of the better efforts I have seen and is well worth watching.
