This is a GREAT movie and one of my all time favorite movies!  Look at the cast - Telly Savalas, Clint Eastwood, Don Wrickles, Donald Sutherland, Gavin McCleod, Carrol ("get the ionisphere off the air) O'Conner...to name a few.  How can you go wrong - See the movie alone just to watch each of these great actors.  The movie is hilarious.  It is not a silly type of comedy but it mixes WW2 comedy with a serious side to it. That mixture of comedy and seriousness makes the movie that much more enjoyable to watch! It is about the perfect crime - Kelly's men go behind enemy lines during World War 2 to steal gold from a bank.  The movie is full of memorable one-liners and names ("Odd-Ball, Crab Game")...that you will find youself quoting over and over and over again.  That may not sound interesting to you but once you see the movie (I have seen it many times - and I am still picking up great one-liners) you will understand.  The movie has become a cult classic with my friends and family - we are quoting lines from it every time we get together.  And of course, the movie has plenty of action with geniune (looking) equipment and tanks from World War 2.  A movie that was promoted as a modern day remake, The Three Kings with George Cloney, does not even come close to the comedy and class that Kelly's Heroes has.  This is a must-have for your collection if you lake any of these actors, like comedy, and/or like World War 2.
