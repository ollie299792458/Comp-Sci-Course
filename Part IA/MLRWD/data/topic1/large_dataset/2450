Perhaps its because so many examples of Blu Ray and surround sound audio are so bad, or perhaps it is because this Blu Ray is so good.  But if you are looking for something that can be used to make your home theater set-up shine, this is it.  The video quality is top notch. The audio is perfect.  Clean, clear, well balanced, and mixed for 5.1 perfectly.  If all 5.1 music was mixed like this everyone would buy much of it.  Perfection is in your hand when you hold the Blu Ray and it is in your room when you turn it on. The best of the three sets is the trio. I've never heard three musicians play with so much energy that you think it is a much larger band. Absolutely incredible.

Not only is John Mayer extremely talented as a musician, he is an entertainer of the highest degree as well.  I would have loved to have been at this concert in person.  Doing three sets with three different formats was genius.  It is a long concert.  John really gave his all for his fans. You can see how much he loves music and performing. His fans got every penny of their money from this concert.  Thank you John!
