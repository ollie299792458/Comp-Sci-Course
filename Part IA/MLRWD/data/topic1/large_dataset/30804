I looked around online to find out where the evil warden in this film went in life after he was forbidden to work in the prison system.  In the process of not finding this information, I found that 90% of the film was totally made up.  I saw this film and it A) gave me the sense that Alcatraz was a really evil place filled with evil people, inside & out and B) that Alcatraz got its aRRS kicked!  The former might be true, and I suppose some could argue that B is also true, but I don't consider a building getting shut down due to its monetary expense any kind of victory for Good.
  From what I can tell, the truth in this film is that a guy - who was A LOT less saintly than depicted here - was locked in solitary confinement for 3 years and used that as the basis for beating a charge for murder.

Obviously, a screenwriter is entitled to some leeway in translating a real life series of incidents to a movie.  But there is a lot more truth in movies like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, 12 ANGRY MEN, TAXI DRIVER & A CLOCKWORK ORANGE than this film.  Heck, even GHOSTBUSTERS is more substantial than this.  Because those movies aren't about historical fact, they're about people - they're about how they connect & disconnect.  Any lack of truth in those films is completely unintentional and I think most can agree that as portraits of society, they do a rather accurate job.  This film just tells people what they want to hear so they can hate the bad guys with all their might & shout out loud with joy when the good guy wins.
