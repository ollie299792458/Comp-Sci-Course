This is an enjoyable movie that will put you through a rollercoaster of emotions. Kirk Cameron delivered a good acting performance in this film. Although, I believe many people who are not religious might not FULLY enjoy this movie, as religion is a powerful force that drives this movie throughout; don't get me wrong, you can enjoy this movie if you are not religious, it's just possible that you might not enjoy it to the full extent.

There are plenty of posts that explain what his movie is about, so I'm just going to touch on a particular issue I had with it.

******SPOILER ALERT BELOW******

To tell you the truth, Catherine wasn't worth all the work. The new Caleb deserves better. I understand that she had not touched God yet, but you don't have to touch God to have a heart. I understand that she is upset at him for 7 years of neglect, but her reaction towards his continued acts of kindness would make you think that he beat her like a pinata every night for 7 years. From my observation of their interactions early on, it is clear to me that she is at least 50% of the problem in this marriage. Yet, the whole theme is that he is sorry and the conclusion is that she forgives him. A monster of a husband could have received more warmth by day 20 than he did. Heck, even the father couldn't believe how long it was taking for her to warm up. The guy had his hand on his mouth in disbelief in one scene.

Let's put into perspective the type of husband Caleb was the first 7 years: he watched porn and he didn't always listen to his wife; jeez, if real women graded on as high a scale as Catherine, nearly all of us would be out on our behinds!

From a religious perspective, I realize that I might be missing the point, but I believe this review is useful for those who are not religious and might have the same line of thinking as me.
