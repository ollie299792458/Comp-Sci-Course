Not going to rehash other customers' criticisms of this movie.  Those few that recognize what an overrated mess this movie actually is already said it well enough so there's no point (plus I already left an overlong review on imdb.com).

I will say, though, that I think PDI-Dreamworks would have been better served if they'd just made a Puss-in-Boots full-length movie, with Shrek as a secondary character (or possibly co-star); you know, a more original, story-driven movie, maybe, and one not obviously geared to milk the cash cow.  I've always thought Disney should have made a Puss-in-Boots movie (when Disney was making anything actually worth watching, anyway) and PDI-DW missed the boat somewhat by reducing the character to mere window dressing (although, the window dressing in this case is more interesting than everything else in the film).  They could have told a rousing, funny adventure story that stood the test of time instead of something that ultimately features "Living La Vida Loca" as its punchline (how many people even remember Ricky Martin these days?) and, on the DVD, an unfunny send-up of "American Idol."  Bleh.

All in all, I think PDI-DW is more interested in pop-culture references, in-jokes and bashing Disney than creating quality animation and telling interesting and exciting stories and that's just a damn shame.  The premise of parodying fairy tales is a good one, but PDI-DW doesn't do enough with it.  The end result is just...blah...
