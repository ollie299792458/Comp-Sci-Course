Oh yeah, the melancholy eurorock soundtrack, Mr. Karlen's post-Beatles bangs and insectoid shades, driving through a Dutch forest at dawn, these are the essentials one ought to really savor, not whether the lebianism is erotic enough, nor whether the vampirism convincing.  Speaking of Karlen, if one thumbs through any Japanese comic from the 70's, one realizes he is the embodiment of the male manga hero.  Just for that you should own this flick.  Ok, so the movie is no Don't Look Now...but does it really matter?  And for the very cultured person who thinks Blade is a good movie, I hope Wesley Snipes cuts him in half.  The problem, as I see it, is too many of the wrong kind of people watch and comment on this film.  It's either the Goth/Anne Rice crowd, the eurotrash perve, or the art dweeb.  Give it up y'all, this movie should be filed next to Le Mans under "K" for KILLER HAIR AND MUSIC.  By the way, I got the VHS, and it is nice not to have to see the pixels.  Plus, any movie with a white mink coat in it already deserves 3 stars, so this is easily 4 stars.
