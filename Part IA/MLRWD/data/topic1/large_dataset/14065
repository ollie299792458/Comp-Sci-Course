Now I have to say that this film is NOT a biography about Les Paul. But it does give you a brief insight to his humble beginnings from a small town to his working relationship to Mary Ford and eventually marrying her. (Which the film did not really cover. A fact that I learn only through the historic video that was included in the film.) The film actually does focus on Les Paul and his accomplishment. But to hear the beginnings of his work from the man himself is like sitting in the room with him and feeling history. Lets not forget, the man can still play even in his late age. More importantly you can see and hear it in his music.

What's great about this film was that it does illustrate how much of an inventor Les Paul was (like his early works in developing a 4-track recording system)!

Overall, this is definitely a great DVD to own, regardless if you're a Gibson lover or a Fender lover. Cause there was bit in the film that did discuss the rivalry between the 2 companies. (Fender Les Paul...? Nah!!) Either way, regardless, the film does justice in giving you a broad view of how the music industry had changed over the decades, in both tone and technology.
