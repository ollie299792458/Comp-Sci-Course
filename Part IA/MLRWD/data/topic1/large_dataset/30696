Description said, "In 2021 a man discovers that his estranged wife has been cloned while unexplaned phenomenon threaten all life on earth." Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes, Sean Penn. All in all it sounded interesting.

WRONG! This movie has actually hurts my brain. It looks pretty, cinematography gets an A. Everything else is downhill. People are dropping dead from "lonliness in their hearts" all over new york, there's some sort of coming ice age theme running in the background and early on an interesting bit about Ugandans flying, but they don't really explore that subject much at all.  Oh, and there's figure skating, musn't forget that, cloning, pills, alternate realities, etc.

Claire Danes is supposed to be from Poland- the accent is horrendous, on the brightside though sometimes she forgets to use it for whole scenes at a time. Near the end you can tell Joaquin is supposed to be Polish too, but his bad accent doesn't show up until the last 15 mins of the picture.

The movie is all over the place, after I was more then half way through I found myself hating almost every minute, but still watching- clinging to the hope that they would somehow tie it all together and it would in some way be a return on my time investment. It never happened.

It's not bad in a campy cute John Waters way, it's bad in a Battlefield Earth / what have I done to myself kind of way.
