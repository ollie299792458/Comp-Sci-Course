Donald Duck celebrates his birthday Latino style.
This rather amusing look at Central America, the second of two features commissioned by the Office of Inter-American Affairs, is both far funnier and far stranger than "Saludos Amigos".
The hook of Donald accepting a gift from South America which continues to reveal more and more gifts reminds me of a Pinata.  The almost psychedelic trip the gifts send him on are great uses of animation artistry.
Of the cartoons, it's a wonder that "The Cold Blooded Penguin" even made it into this movie.  Other than showing the penguin travelling past South America on his journey to warmer climates, it doesn't have much to do with the rest of the movie.
But "The Flying Guachito" more than makes up for this.  The story of a little boy who finds a flying burro, it fits very well into the framework created for this movie.
Then it progresses into a wild and crazy look at the South American scene.  The music is infectious, and watching Donald chase after every good looking girl that passes his way is rather amusing, but slightly out of Donald's character.
The disconcerting switch from a collection of Disney classic cartoons (most of which were still fairly new at the time) to the live-action travelogue is a bit much to take, but still makes for a fun roller coaster ride that kids might enjoy.
Finally, there's two good Disney cartoon gems, "Don's Fountain of Youth" and "Pueblo Pluto".  Both cartoons really round out this look at Latin America, and add to the flavor and tone of the movie.
Far more fun than "Saludos Amigos", but because it is another travelogue, and contains a mixture of live-action and animation, it may only appeal to Disney purists.
