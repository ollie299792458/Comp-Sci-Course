This video has four 15 minute segments for toning. There are segments for arms, abs, hips and thighs:

The arm segment focuses on 2-3 pound hand weights (or soup cans if you are just starting) and working on repetition. After you do the standing section there is a floor section and some stretching to fill out the 15 minutes.

The abs section is done mostly on the floor and focuses on breathing while doing the exercises correctly. You do not need any equipment for this section. There is some back work here as well and some stretching to fill out the 15 minutes.

The hips and thighs sections are very similar. Neither require any equipment. Both have some classical standing ballet (you may want to use a chair for balance if first starting out though) and some yoga/pilates moves that go through a standing-plank-moves-standing routine that is not as challenging as it looks. They both finish off with almost the same floor work (leg circles, point up and flex downs, and finishes with stretching.

Jennifer Kries is a great teacher. She teaches you about breathing and technique, most of the time. She doesn't cue great, but a few times through the video and it's very easy to pick up. I usually do 1 segment daily, added on to another workout. I have seen great results!
