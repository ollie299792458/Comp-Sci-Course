I know the other reviewers sort of panned this movie, but I had caught a glimpse of it on sci-fi channel and found it interesting.
And by the looks of it on tv, edited quite a bit.  So seeing this at a great price as a bluray, I figured what the hey.  It's not a grade A movie, but a good B movie.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Liked the premise of a future world and the kind of society it presented, a corporate future fighting for the last of earths resources. Lots of action. I thought the effects were quite good for the budget. Not much CGI, but old school effects meaning masks and suits as opposed to computer generated beings.  Probably more cost effective.  The acting was pretty good with name stars although Jon Malkovich didn't have much of a role.  The movie itself was on the dark side, as in not much lighting, but the clarity was there.  It really looked good in blu.  Very sharp.
Lots of neat features on the disc.  I saw this 3 weeks ago, so apologies when I say I forgot what they were.  I only checked out out a few at the time, like the "making of", but loads of good stuff to make the purchase worthwhile.
