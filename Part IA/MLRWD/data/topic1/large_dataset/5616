As many reviewers have noted, "Cool Hand Luke" is an absolute milestone of anti-establishment cinema.  The performances are nuanced and powerful, the on-location shooting resonates with heat and oppression, and the story and characters exude archetypal impact.  The reviewers who claim that the "moral" of this film is that people should not assert individuality in prison clearly have no understanding of the word "allegory," because in a symbolic sense, the exact point of the film is that the existence of the human spirit depends upon asserting individuality in the face of brutal, institutionally-backed conformity.  As a systematic, hard-headed noncomformist, Newman's Luke is purposefully cast as a savior figure--which is why he's photographed via the iconography of crucifixion after the egg-eating contest, for example--and reviewers who take his character to task for rebelling against the system completely miss the point and go a long way toward demonstrating the very problem the movie works to expose.
