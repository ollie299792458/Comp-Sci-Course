This movie is one that stirs great controversy.  Admitted it is not for everyone.  And I did not think it so great upon my first viewing either.  Many think it is about guns, artillary, and good old fashioned patriotism.  This movie is about a different war- the inner war.  This beautiful canvas  full of poetic beauty and sensual mindflow, is one not to be taken  superficially by the viewer, which has lead to a great misunderstanding of  this masterpiece.  It needs not to be watched on a war movie frame-of-mind,  but needs to be experienced like a favorite piece of classical music (if  you like classical music).  The setting for this movie is stunning although  should not be the center piece.  The battle scenes are excellent (the  taking of the hill), and the cinematics wonderous; backed by a disturbing  (sometimes menacing) perfect musical score.  The film seems to wander  fluidly much like the human mind, and the train of thought unfolding is  underappreciated.  Fans of strait-forward action may be disappointed.  Best  advice is to rent the movie before viewing, that way there will be no harsh  reviews of people who hated this movie.  I believe this film would be more  appreciated by the art crowd.  The art crowd should not be distracted by  its premise or its big name actors.  The cast in this picture are supurb  and complement Malicks haunting direction without overshadowing it.  The  unsettling nature of this movie is sure to invoke the same in the viewer.  Remember only great movies stir such extreme emotions from viewers.  A  movie either loved or hated.  This movie should be given a chance or even a  second chance.  email me At  ----------&gt;  mhanlen@mtnhome.com
