Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood reaches it's amazing catastrophic conclusion in part 5. Everything comes to an end, some chracters meet their ends and some find their new beginnings, with that said this is the satisfying conclusion all FMA fans have been waiting for and the ending a true great anime deserves. Filled with a great story, action packed fight scenes and characters that you truly connect with, Brotherhood is without a doubt the far superior anime compared to the first incarnation.

I cannot spoil the details about the story, but this is the climactic battle between the homonculis and the human, filled with twists and turns left and right. It's amazing how you can feel sympathy for animated people but every emotion they showed I felt and every word they said felt real and that is a sign of a very well done TV series whether it is real or animated. I advise every person to look into this series because it has everything you could possibly want in an anime; action, drama, comedy and real human affection. Highly recommended, it's just sad how everything must come to an end. :(
