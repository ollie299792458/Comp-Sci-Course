LONG BEFORE T.V.S POPULAR BUT PREDICTABLE 'C.S.I.' WILLIAM PETERSON LIT UP THE BIG SCREEN IN A FEW FILMS. THIS WAS BY FAR THE BEST OF THE LOT.
PETERSON PLAYS AN AGGRESSIVE, ADRENLINE JUNKIE SECRET SERVICE AGENT WHO LIKES TO TAKE CHANCES. HIS HOBBIES INCLUDE BUNJI JUMPING AND BLACKMAILING FEMALE SNITCHES.
HIS MENTOR A RETIRING AGENT IS KILLED WORKING A 'FUNNY MONEY' CASE AND PETERSON SETS OUT TO TAKE DOWN THE BAD GUY.
WHEN THE FED CANT GET HIS BOSS TO FRONT REAL CASH FOR A COUNTERFEIT BUY HE OPTS TO CROSS THE LINE AND ROB A THOUGHT TO BE CROOK WHO IS CARRYING BIG TIME FUNDS.
THE CROOK TURNS OUT TO BE ANOTHER UNDERCOVER FED WHO IS BEING SHADOWED BY FELLOW AGENTS. BULLETS FLY AND THE U.C. IS ACCIDENTALLY KILLED BUT OUR ANTAGONIST GETS AWAY WITH THE MONEY AFTER A PULSE POUNDING CAR CHASE THAT IS PROBABLY THE BEST SINCE 'BULLITT.'
PETERSONS GUN SHY PARTNER WANTS NO MORE OF IT AND IS HAUNTED BY WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.
THE PARTNER THOUGH WINDS UP GOING ALONG AND WE SEE HOW HE TRANSITIONS FROM A DO GOODER HONEST COP TO A RENEGADE LIKE HIS OBSESSED BROTHER WITH A BADGE.

THIS IS A FAST PACED GO GETTER OF A FILM WITH A SURPRISE ENDING.
SOME OF THE SUPPORTING CAST DROPS THE BALL IN PLACES BUT ALL THINGS CONSIDERED IT IS AN ABOVE AVERAGE FLICK.
