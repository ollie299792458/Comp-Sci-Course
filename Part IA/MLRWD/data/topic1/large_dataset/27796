Our family went to this movie in Minnesota.  The Mann Theaters did a limited release viewing at six or seven locations for several weeks.  At the showing that we attended the movie was well received with applause and laughter several times by the audience including my family and I.

One of the important messages presented in this film I believe is that when somebody states something as fact we need to use our critical thinking skills to investigate and not just rely on the purported face value of the statement.  As Americans we need to have the courage to scrutinize the evidence regardless of weather or not we agree with Michael Moore or anyone else for that matter.  The next message presented here is that if you are in a position of influence the duty to deliver a complete and honest appraisal is paramount. The other major theme running throughout this film is to admit when you are wrong.

Mike Wilson shows several examples of how Michael Moore has combined movie footage and taken quotes out of context thereby creating major deceptions for his viewing audience (AKA The Big Lie).  I also believe that Michael Moore is not serving well the causes that he professes to believe in.  Moore's use of Anti American rhetoric in his films and public statements has created a toxic poison that has been utilized by Osama bin Laden and other terrorist.  Thankfully, some voices from the political left and right are starting to realize the ramifications and are demanding accountability from Michael Moore.  BTW: You should see this film and give it a rating yourself.

Thank You,
