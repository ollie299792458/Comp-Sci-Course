i had read alot reviews on this movie before my wife i saw this.and most of them were bad, but i just love dakota fanning and i liked brittany murphy in just married so we wanted too see this. we went to a early afternoon showing so there was not that many people there there was about 8 other ladys and 1 others guy and two young girls there.i have heard this movie called chick flick i hate that term because this is one guy that just loved this movie for what it was a plan old sentimental movie it is one of the best i have seen this year.yeah every lady that was in the place sat there and was bawling there eyes out through most of the movie but there is nothing wrong with that and i am sure not ashamed to say that i was sitting there BAWLING my eyes out with snot flying the same way they did because i have a heart and if you do you will see why everyone in the place was bawling like babys. it a story of great friendship that came too be. and it is just a great sentimental time there should be more movies like this one.i will see this time and again and buy it when it come out on dvd. so forget it is a chick flick this is a great movie. and so what if you need a box of kleenex's for it. that is what makes it one of the best i think.
