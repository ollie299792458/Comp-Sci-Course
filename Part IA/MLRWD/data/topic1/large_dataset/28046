I was a fan of Mad Men seasons one and two; the mystery of Don Draper and the charisma of John Hamm made it a fascinating blend of Cheeveresque desire and noir-like intrigue. Then season three showed up, creator Matthew Weiner admitted in interviews he hadn't anything left in the barrel in terms of where to go, and so the audience is inflicted with a pedestrian view of office life as an English company takes over the ad agency- one tedious, pointless incident after another is catalogued (at one point a mower gets out of control and runs over a Brit's foot and they center an episode on the JFK assasination just to wake us out of our coma)-and all of this is compounded by an achingly, teeth-grindingly SLOOOOW depiction of the Draper marriage breaking down, with endless shots of monotonous January Jones staring stone-facedly into space, maybe occasionally smoking a cigarette or arching an eyebrow. The old argument of whether Jones is a bad actress, or whether her range perfectly fits the lifeless, emotionally-stunted character of Betty, is moot; beyond her psuedo-Hitchcock era beauty, she is simply unbearable to endure.  Thankfully season four really picked up its game, it contained some of the best episodes in the series history, and season three could just be written off as a bad dream. But for God's sake DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE DVD of it. You've been warned.
