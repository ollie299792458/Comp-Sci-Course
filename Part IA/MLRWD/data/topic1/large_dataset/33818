I am a Sting fan, of the kind of the ones who hate his The Police times. And I see no wrong in being one. But even so, I was not prepared for the experience of this concert. I was utterly convinced that after the Labyrinth he couldn't possibly do a better work of art and I am glad of having being completely wrong.

I have never seen a concert like this before. The other reviews describe it so well I have very few descriptive words to add. Maybe just emphasizing how amazingly professional musicians Sting chose. Every single one of them, the orchestra members, the soloists and the voices, but Kathyrn and Peter Tickell were my favorites. The musical performance, being the closest I've seen to perfection, was far from being just technically flawless. What I find most valuable, infinitely valuable from this work was how all of the musicians became one in the music and how they were able to share and make grow and grow the spirit of that music and the aesthetics, the emotion and the spirit of its creator. The beauty and the joy...

I deeply admire and love Sting for being such a great musician and having such a huge personal integrity. Because he is courageous and couldn't care less about being "musically correct". This production also shows that, from the beginning to the end.
