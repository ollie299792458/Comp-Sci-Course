This movie is a knockout comedy/murder mystery. Jerry is an excellent example of the modern tragic figure. One almost feels sorry for him despite his wrongdoing as his desparate plan to solve his financial situation spins out of his control.

Also, Marge Gunderson is an excellent character. Despite her career as a cop, she still seems to retain that bubbliness that is stereotypically attached to people from that area. But in the end, after the completion of her investigation and her encounter with Mike (who turns out to be a fraudulent figure), Marge is completely disillusioned with everything. As she tearfully says "I just don't understand it," she seems to be referring to human nature in general.

However, this film also has its comical parts. The running gag of the midwestern accents throughout the movie is very well done. Also, this film has some great dialogue bits. The "Where's Pancake's House?" conversation is a classic. The recreation of the late 1980's for the film is also highly convincing with the '87-88 Oldsmobiles (many of which today are rusting hulks) and even the scenery with such subtle elements as the Miller sign in the background of one scene.

Truly this film will never die.
