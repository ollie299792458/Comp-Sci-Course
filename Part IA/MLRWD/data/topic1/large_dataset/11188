Now you're talking. I've been waiting so long for this that I'm (literally) just about to turn 46. I've had a copy of 6 taped episodes on "permanent loan" from the video store to tie me over(I'll now return it and pay the $11,000 fine). Remember that this series came out when the space race was on in ernest and so anything sci-fi or space related was all systems go on Saturday morning TV. Alex Toth was the artistic genius behind this and many of the other sci-fi related cartoons of the era (Herculoids, Jonny Quest...). The opening music is dynamite and it just gets better from there. You gotta love all the force rays, invisibility, fabulous planets... and it's just amazing how many evil insects exist in space.

There is some repetiton of the story lines between this and the other similar series but no matter - this is 60s cartoons in all it's glory. The younger viewers will love it but those who have grown up on TV cartoons of a more recent time may wonder what all the fuss is about - it's history boys so embrace it for what it is - land-mark TV. Buy 2 copies for when you wear out the first.
