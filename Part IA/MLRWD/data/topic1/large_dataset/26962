Tim Burton excels at taking well-known fairy tales and revealing the dark psychological undercurrents. No example is better than that of Batman.
Watching his parents murdered as a young child, young Bruce Wayne  dedicates his life to fighting the forces that tore apart his world.  Obsessed to the point of mania, he hides behind a mask, appears only at  night, and lives outside the law. His desire for revenge consumes  him.
His nemesis - the gangster who gunned down his family - becomes  horribly disfigured while trying to escape him, and is tipped into  homicidal mania by his scars. He becomes a crazed terrorist using chemical  weapons against civilians.
The two characters oppose each other in every  sense; the irony is heightened by each one being responsible for creating  the other.  This is not a story for children to appreciate.
Burton  successfully creates a brooding, gothic look to his city and characters. He  draws inspiration from Lang's Metropolis, especially in the final scene  atop the cathedral.
Look beyond the script flaws to enjoy a fantastic  performance from Jack Nicholson and a dark visual delight.
