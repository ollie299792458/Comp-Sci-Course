And I say it's a great movie in spite of the fact the half the movie appeared to be filmed with a hand-held camera being operated by someone suffering from the dt's.  The annoying jerkiness of much of the movie aside, everything else was top-notch.  The character development in this film was one of the most appealing things about it.  I'm not the biggest football fan in the world, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It's filled with both heroes and villains, and a couple of villains who turn out to be heroes.  You won't go wrong in making this one your entertainment choice for the evening.  The blu-ray transfer was excellent.

From reading some of the 1 star reviews, it looks like the filmmakers took significant - and in many cases - completely unnecessary liberties with the actual, real life storyline.  As someone who was unfamiliar with the actual storyline, this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film, but if you know the real story or have read the book, your own viewing experience will likely be diminished as a result.
