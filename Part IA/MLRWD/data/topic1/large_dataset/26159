Predator is one of two classic Sci-fi movies along with Aliens that cemented itself in the 80s. Ever since Predator 2, fans have been clamoring for a 3rd installment, but have not found their fix. With the release of AVP and AVP2, Predator fans have been left out in the wind, with two horrible attempts. This all changed with Predators. The movie pulls no punches and wastes no time. A group of soldiers from different backgrounds (Mercenary, Israeli Sniper, Yakuza, Russian Spetnaz, Mexican Mafia, African Warlord, Death Row Inmate, and a weakling Doctor) all free fall into a strange planet, non of which can remember how they got there, or why they are there. These become meek points as they find themselves trapped on an Alien planet. Once this point is realized, they ban together to get the hell out of there. This of course becomes a moot point as they are meticulously hunted by a new breed of Predator. That's right, a new Predator. The new Predator, of a different tribe then the one we have come to know, not only hunts humans, but other aliens, and even our familiar predators as well. With drones, and hunting "dogs" the new Predator is smarter, badder, and meaner than the original. After locating the people, the hunt begins, and the humans are on the run. Eventually running into another human survivor (Fishburn) who has survived, but lost his mind in the process. The humans fight on, taking on what they have to to kill the new Predators, but can they survive? Can they escape the planet in one piece?
