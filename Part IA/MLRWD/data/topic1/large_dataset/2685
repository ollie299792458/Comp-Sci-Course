I ordered "About Schimidt" when in a book by a very conservative Christian scholar spoke highly of it. Although "About Schimdt" can by no strech of the imagination  be called Christian lititure
(it has some heavy profanity and a naked fat woman in it)the Christian writer empasises the theme of the book which is not manifest until the very end of the presentation.

Schimdt was a man who "had it all" and then it came time for him to retire. This retirement obviously caused him to reflect on all of his life's attainment, even his love or hatred for his wife.

It is an adult comedy, and I enjoyed it as such. But only at the end, when Schimdt is reduced to tears when he finaly discovers some thing he had done (almost inconsequenly and insignificantly)which proved to be the greatest thing he had done in all of his life.

It convinced him that his life had been worth something after all.

It is worth seeing this film, if you bear in mind that is the premise of the film.
