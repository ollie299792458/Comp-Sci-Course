I've been watching a lot of movies recently and I have to say we get used to what we have until someone/ something raises the bar.
Was this movie technically perfect? No, it wasn't for sure.
Was this movie artistically perfect? No, it wasn't.
But when do we consider a movie five stars? We give movies five stars when we like what we see. And Kick Ass gave me everything I haven't been getting since The Matrix or Superman or Star Wars. It's like watching something for the first time and feel like a child and you feel such joy and bliss you start laughing and feeling so good about yourself.
How many times we went back to the theaters to watch the sequences to feel like that again, The Matrix failed (parts 2,3#, Superman#parts 3,4# failed and Star Wars also failed#parts 1,2,3(I actually liked this one)). The failings are not the point, the desire to see a sequel is what makes some movies great.
I've already watched this movie about fifteen times and I know someday I'll get sick of watching it, but so far I am watching over and over and still having fun.
Kick Ass is all about the right reasons to be a super hero but Hit Girl, even though she's icy cool, is the sparkle that makes the main character keep on moving, she's the heart and uses all that she has in order to achieve her goals. She is the reason why we laugh like crazy, feel sad and have so much fun. She does things that were supposed to be ridiculous but incredibly, we believe, and then we know we can get more from life than only a few pennies. It's like when we could watch Michael Jordan play, that inspired us.
This is only my opinion about the movie, I'm not interested in mental discussions, if someone wants to make a complaint, seek help from the Authorities.
