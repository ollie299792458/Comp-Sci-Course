This is another of those movies I caught on late-night TV, and eventually ended up buying.

In some ways it kind of reminds me of Rudyard Kipling's "Kim".  There's not really a plot, as such, there's just people who come together for a while, do their thing, and part.

A couple of things make it clear this is a WWII propaganda film made to encourage wartime Anglo-American friendship and understanding:  Sgt Johnson impresses the locals with his knowledge of lumber, and then goes on to slam isolationists who oppose the Lend Lease program.  At the end he is completely overwhelmed by the glory of Canterbury Cathedral, but remains proud of his small rural church back in Oregon.

What else to say.  Well, Kent is laid out in all its glory.  I lived in the UK for a couple of years in the mid 1980's, and got to travel all over, including to Kent.  Seeing the hop gardens, drying sheds, and the manicured British countryside brought a nostalgic lump to my throat.

Great movie.  I think I'm going to go on a Criterion Collection WWII movie buying spree.
