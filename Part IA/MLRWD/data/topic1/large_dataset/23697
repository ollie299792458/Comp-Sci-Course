This movie is probably the most thought provoking movie I have seen in quite while. In this movie, we have a completely hedonistic, nihilistic Patricia Arquette who denies God, while  Gabriel Byrne plays a scientist/priest who questions miracles and on some level questions his faith through his church, yet believes in God. 
The cast does an outstanding job, and there are some excellent religious points made in the movie. Gabriel Byrne has a brief speech where he explains how science and the "just happened" theory in regards to life appearing on this planet has contradictions. Then, in another scene, an ex-priest talks of what and where the true church is to be found. Which, by the way, is very much correct, according to the Gospels.
The ending very much follows the religious theme of the movie and draws heavily from stories in the Bible where both doubters and unbelievers were given signs that convinces them of the existence of God.
I rate it worth owning, because the movie is worth seeing more than once. Again, another movie that had lousy reviews, and once again, the reviews were wrong.
