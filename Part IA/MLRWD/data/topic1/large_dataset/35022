This was already released from the Disney Movie Club I already got it on a pre order while i won't give actual movie spoilers like plot or anything like that other then what was cut (See Below) I will say this, the set is only worth getting if you want to have both movies on a blu-ray disc or if you want to get a value for both movies since this is a valuted Disney movie. The biggest gripe that i have about this is back in 2005 when they made the 10th anniversary release of the first film they added back the cut song "If i never knew you" seamlessly into the film where pocahontas goes to meet up with the prisoner John Smith which really added the magic of Disney into the movie and in the end where they finished it quite nicely i might add to give the movie that great classic feel to it.
Don't expect to see that in this version of the film its only an extra on the Bluray and not even an option on the dvd and its only the one song that is mentioned above not the final clip of the film.

On a slightly better note the remaster of the music and crisp look of the animation in full 1080p is a nice touch and having both movies is another since i don't belive that they really bothered with the second movie for dvd (I could be wrong on that one).

All in all its a good price but unless you really want to get the new format personally go and get the 10th anniveresary edition on DVD. Why Disney decided to cut the extras out like they did with the Lion King ReReRelease after going through all the extra work to make the additions is a mystery but who knows.
personally i rate it a 3 1/2 stars only due to the value of getting both movies when the DVD's are out of print but if you already have both unless you really need that Blu-ray copy its not the greatest of investments.
