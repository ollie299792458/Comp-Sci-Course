I don't recall the last time I saw a true romance movie, though I've watched many so-called. So, I almost passed on this one. However, I had read some of this poet's works and was aware of his life story. And I like historical period pieces. So, I gave this movie a chance and watched the DVD. It is easy to become cynical about romance, and to disdain society's often-preposterous version of it. Here is a man who wants to write poetry (and thinks himself a failure at it), and a woman who loves him, nevertheless. It is the story of the relationship between Fanny Brawne and John Keats. It is a true story of a true love, a love beyond lust, desire of a nobler kind, and passion with compassion. For anything less is not love at all, but a pathetic parody. Indeed the poet himself says with fervor (to his cynical friend), "There is a holiness to the heart's affections. Know you nothing of that?" The question is well put to us all, especially in today's world, with its violent illusions wherein people often use and abuse one another and know little, if anything, of genuine love -- or even of romance, which is not head games of infatuation, but is rather the sacred Eros of negotiating a covenantal relationship -- respect, honor, commitment. It is this kind of human love that reflects well the Love of Christ for His Church. Naturally, given the setting of the story, the Christian undertone is evident. I would watch this movie again, and I recommend it to everyone. There was a time when language had meaning, love was holy, a poem was a thing of beauty, and romance was a work of art. It can still be so.
