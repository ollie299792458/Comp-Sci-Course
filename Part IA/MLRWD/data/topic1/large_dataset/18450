The Lookout starts out simple enough-an unassuming character study. One might think it's a little too "drawn-out", almost waiting for some excitement-and boy, does the last 20 minutes or so of this movie provide this.I think that is the point of this charming, little movie-how one bad mistake(or in this case two) can make your life sprial downward so fast. I think all the acting in this film is very subtle & moving.While the underlying point to this movie is quite generic-underdog redeems himself, foils the bad guys & saves the day-this movie puts a new, fresh twist on this & because it is fairly short, the story comes together very nicely.
I thought the relationship between Chris & his blind roomate Lewis was sweet & sincere & I also thought the sequences in which Chris saw/ talked to his old girl friend (who survived the accident) had a touching, other-wordly quality-you are left wondering if he really saw her or only thought he was seeing her-she had an almost Angel-like quality.I thought the music in the movie went along very well with the story. All in all I highly recommend this movie~
