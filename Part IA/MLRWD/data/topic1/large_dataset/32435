In this ground-breaking laughathon, pube-haired chucklemonger Willy Ferrell (comedy genius) plays a man. A man who is a little bit mentally retarded who is involved in some sort of sport (or in rare bursts of innovation and invention, has a job in a place). At the beginning of the film, yeah he's doing pretty good, life is going pretty good for the Willmeister. Could be better, can't complain. It carries on like this for a bit until a rivalry with someone in some form or other means he gets sacked/fired/kicked off his team. Things don't seem like they could get any worse for the Ferret, but they can and do. Wilfelz is at a real low point in his life dark times. but then by some twist of fate or miracle he's allowed to do whatever it is in this particular film he does again, nine times out of ten teaming up with the ex-antagonist. and wins and the end is happy and he's even more successful than he was prior to the 'things cant get any worse' bit and its HILARIOUS

The sentence above this one was just me smashing my forehead against the keyboard in red-raw fury. But the paragraph above that sentence could be copy and pasted to every Will Ferrell film and no-one would notice. Will Ferrell should be illegal.

you can say 'it doesnt have to be groundbreaking just entertaining' but it isnt entertaining either. Ahhhh I hate you Ferrell you can only play one character, yourself.
He's an idiot, this film is awful and he's really done it this time
