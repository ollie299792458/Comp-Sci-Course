It's tempting to say that some people love this movie and others hate it because some understand irony and others don't.  But actually, I think there's a more charitable explanation:

In order to "get" (and love) Wes Anderson, I think it really helps to have been born between about 1960 and 1975.  That is: you really  need to think of American culture in the '60s, '70s and  very early '80s as the time of your lost childhood.  For me, the lime-green rotary phone on Raleigh St. Clair's desk is enough to bring me to tears.  The Stones albums, the board games, the CP/M Minicomputers in _The Life Aquatic_...Wes loves the stuff that surrounded us as kids in post-Boomer America and is now mostly gone, or kicking around in basements and thrift stores.  Actually, I wish I could be the guy he hires to go out and find that stuff.  But it's not just material culture; it's the feel of '70s books and movies too, Max Frisch's _Montauk_, John Irving's books, Salinger's stories (okay, they're from the '50s and '60s, but the feeling is there), _Harold and Maude_ and _The Hotel New Hampshire_.  We were kids in a time when America was disappointed, but thoughtfully so (for the most part, anyway).  Wes understands that.

Note how long I went without using the term "Gen X"!  Hah!
