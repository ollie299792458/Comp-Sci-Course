"Kung Pow!" is an extremely original and hillarious comedy, period! I LOVED this film, it had me rolling on the floor! There are a few amount of clunkers (the talking tongue and the French aliens could've been left out), and it begins to lose it's charm about two thirds of the way through, but most of it is ingenious! I have no idea why critics hate this movie so much, don't listen to them. It is one of the funniest movies in recent years whether those uptight cinema snobs admit it or not. It's tempting to list every hillarious moment in this film, but you really should see it yourself. I know it looks stupid, but just trust me. You WILL laugh, and laugh often. It's not the perfect comedy, but it's pretty damn close! It breathes new life into a genre that's currently overflowing with clones of the "different people switch places" and "white guy meets black cop" plots. 
If you enter a film like this with a bad attitude, like most of the critics out there, you'll hate it. If you enter it with an open mind and the willingness to laugh at a group of really stupid yet really clever jokes, you may find it to be the funniest comedy that you've seen in a long, long, time. 
I give "Kung Pow! Enter the Fist" a very solid 8.0 out of 10.0
