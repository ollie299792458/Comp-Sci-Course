Like a lot of people, I first saw "From Beyond" on home video in the late '80s, when I was still in high school. Needless to say, its a movie that makes an impression. Its taken years and years for this film to finally be released legitimately on DVD, and after very recently watching it again for the first time in ages, that original impression has not changed - "From Beyond" is one of the most delightfully gross, perverse and flat out weird horror movies ever made. Sprouting from the kernal of an H.P. Lovecraft short story, Stuart Gordon really takes the film into some very weird and uncomfortable places (no, not the backseat of a Volkswagon), combining physics, psychology, and sexuality into an icky, slimy, grotesque tale that harkens back to and embodies the original source material. How much fun you have watching "From Beyond" really depends on your own sensibilities, but it can't be denied that this is a *bold* and uncompromising movie, particularly this new director's cut, which reincorporates material that was trimmed by order of the MPAA to get the movie an R rating back in the day. Its kind of breathtaking to realize how many lines Gordon was willing to not only step on but waltz over, and then to remember that he did it 20 years ago. Easily one of the best Lovecraft-related films, and far superior than most of the dreck that followed after it in the '90s. If this is your thing, then definitely check out Dan O'Bannon's brilliant "The Resurrected", and Gordon's own "Re-Animator" and "Dagon". "From Beyond" isn't as arch and playful in tone as "Re-Animator", but its a must-see in the Lovecraft film oeuvre. And Jeffrey Combs remains the man.
