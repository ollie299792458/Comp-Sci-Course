The British "Queer as Folk" is witty, intelligent, well-written, well-acted, and incredibly entertaining. The American version is dumbed down; the punchlines sound like they belong on a sitcom, and the creators seem intent on hitting us over the head rather than observing. Where the American version particularly suffers is in the character of Brian. Stuart in the British version (played by Aidan Gillen) has such presence and vitality that it's impossible not to watch him. His charisma makes him likeable; we can root for him despite his smug self-confidence. Brian, by comparison, is a piece of dead wood that just walked out of GQ. I just wanted him to go away. The American version also uses flashy "MTV-style" editing in a effort to look cool, I guess, but it's really just annoying.
I could go on, but you get the idea. Watch the British version. (And as for the person who wrote that the Brits don't have it in the looks department...you don't know what you're talking about.)
