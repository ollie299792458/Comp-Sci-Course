The Coen brothers' warmest, smartest comedy--and I'm a huge fan of all their work (don't get me started on Miller's Crossing). Obviously, anyone who's seen and liked a Coen brothers film will like this, but if you're a Frank Capra fan you'll also like it.
After despondent C.E.O. Werring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) throws himself off the 44th floor, the conniving V.P., Sidney J. Mussberger (Paul Newman at his shrewd best) and the rest of the Board have to move fast to steal the stock before it goes public. So they decide to crash the stock by promoting new mailmroom clerk and schmuck Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins, in yet another great performance) to President. Unfortunately for the Board, Barnes has a few tricks up his sleeve. Unfortunately for Barnes, Jennifer Jason Leigh's fast-talking reporter is hot on his trail&#65533;
Dazzling cinematography from Roger Deakins, wonderful production design emulating the 50s and the 30s, and a rich, textured score by Carter Burwell and well-done special effects (in a Coen bros. movie??) all contribute to make this a wonderful, thoroughly entertaining film.
Think of Preston Sturges directing a Horatio Alger story crossed with Terry Gilliam and you'll have an inkling of how good this film is. Should have won Oscars in 1994 (along with Red & Quiz Show, and Pulp Fiction) instead of Gump, but them's the breaks. This film really needs to be in widescreen, so watch the DVD and not the pan-and-scan VHS.
