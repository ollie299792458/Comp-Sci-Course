The Passenger is a study in identity.  The study is facilitated not only by the plot line, but also by the shifting camera perspectives.  Like Antonioni's other movies, this movie does not attempt to resolve the subject matter.  Instead, upon completion of movie, the viewer is left with some poignant questions.  This movie was out of circulation for the longest time...rumour has it that Jack Nicholson had bought all its known prints after its less than successful showing in the 1970s.

For you film buffs and film students, what's truly technically remarkable about this movie is the 7.5 minute-long final, unedited, single-camera shot.  In this shot, the camera amazingly moves from a fixed rail to a crane-mount without the slightest vibration.  It also happens to pass through window bars while doing this!  To really appreciate this shot, one has to realize that this movie was made well before the advent of Stabilcams and Glidecams, and before computer generated special effects.  For the longest time this shot was one of the great mysteries in film-making until an interview of Antonioni surfaced in which he described how he had accomplished it.  I don't want to give anything away....but the guy was a genius!  He knew the limitations of the tools available to him and figured out a way to get around them.

This is Antonioni's second-last movie, not his last as some of the other reviewers suggested. Antonioni's last movie was Beyond the Clouds, which was completed with the help of Wim Wenders (Wings of Desire), because Antonioni had suffred a stroke.  Last I checked Beyond the Clouds was available only on VHS.
