As a serious fan of this movie I am completely pissed off at Walter Hill chose to put his comic book interpretation in this movie, without also adding the original verision so people can at least see the version that was released in the theatres at the time.  And in the featurette according to the principals connected with making this movie,the opening scene with Cleon talking to his girlfriend before going up to the Bronx,(usually shown on the cable versions of this film),this was left out since they thought that this scene was unnecessary since most of the movie takes place at night.  How stupid is that when we have a daylight scene at the end of the movie?  It would add value to the scene that starts of with Cleon talking about them going to the Bronx in the beginning.  And what the hell (?), how to you cut the part when Ajax, sees the Baseball Furies for the first time, go to another scene of Cleon, Vermin and Rembrandt getting on a different train, and then go back to the station shot with Ajax, Swan, Snow and Cowboy seeing the Furies?  WHAT THE HELL????  Thank god I kept the original DVD!  The only thing good on this DVD is the featurettes.  And while we are at it, why must you go through 8 previews before you can even skip to the damm movie????  And let's not even talk about the ending of the movie a freeze framed comic strip!??!!!!!  OMG!!! It's terrible!

I like the fact that the movie is clearer, and the sound is fantastic. And I also realize that this is the director's cut.  But if these artists and directors cannot realize that when you have a audience that loves your original movie to the point that it is a cult classic, and you don't even acknowledge it - DAMM!!! Thanks for showing some love to your fans!

I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!
