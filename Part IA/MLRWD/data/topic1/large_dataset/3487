Season 1.5 contains all of the rest of the episodes in Caprica (after the pilot movie and Season 1.0 DVD).  It includes the series finale.  There is and will not be a Season 2.  The story is complete in one season.  I mention these things because of comments in other reviews.

I wondered as I contemplated seeing this series whether it could be anywhere near as good as Battlestar Galactica, the reimagined version.  The latter was one of my favorite TV shows, and definitely my favorite Sci Fi so far.

I would not call the Caprica series essential to those who watched BSG, but it IS interesting.  It provides a background story on key plot elements from BSG, such as the rise of the robots and how and why the became enemies of the people of Caprica, as well as the rise of the religious conflict between the monotheists and the polytheists, who in BSG seem to be the robots vs the people.  In Caprica, the monotheists are also people, and they are regarded as terrorists.

Oppressed people, people who are not treated fairly, sometimes resort to violent means to change the system.  One can be sympathetic to the monotheists for being oppressed.  At the same time, they have a darker side, as you'll learn in this part of the series.

The writers sure love plot twists.  But the oddest thing of all was while watching the season finale, which for the first half seemed to be going at the same leisurely pace of the rest of the series, was how it suddenly went into warp drive (sorry) and gave us the highlights of the rest of the story.  But thinking back on this, I think it actually worked well.  And the story did add a couple of key pieces of the puzzle into place.

Very satisfying, even if it was not as compelling as BSG.  Recommended.
