This movie has nothing to do with the Friday The 13th series(the best slasher series tied with the halloween series). First of all the mvie  talks about how Jason comes back to life because he's a little slug-like demon, but we see Jason come back to life each time he does. In part VI lightning strikes a metal pole stuck in jason's body. Then in part VII a girl brings him back to life with her mental pwers and in party VIII a broken electrical cord shocks him underwater and he returns. So the demon thing makes no sense. Also In part I Mrs. Voorhess says her only son was Jason, so there could be no sister of Jason. And when this horribly painstaking film is done the stupidest thing happens, Freddy's hand reaches out of the ground and pulls Jason's mask underground. I'll admit that the melting and arm breaking scenes are full of great gore, but that only lasts about one miute out of the 90, so if you're getting into the Friday the 13th series avoid this one. I mean WTF happened. If you could give movies zero stars I would for this film.
