Ok first off let me star by saying how sad it is that movies like district 9 dont make as much money as they should or even enough time in the spotlight. I for one think this movie was the best movie of 2009 BETTER than AVATAR! Avatar was a great movie but in no means was it James camrons best (Terminator 2) but it was a fun and emotional ride. The reason i think District 9 was a superior movie is because it was much deeper and dealt with current situations and themes the world without rubbing political views in your face, I know it can seem anti big corporation and military but in no way does it have that stereotypical over the top and cheesy warmonger feel to the villains like avatar did. The Characters had depth and instead o fitting into a stereotype they were extremely complex, for example wikus  he starts off as an MNU public relations agent, when he starts transforming he abandons MNU for an alien (prawn as there called in the movie)  named christopher Wikus helps the prawn find the liquid that started his transformation but his motive are selfish and when told it would take three years to fix his condition Wikus betrays Christopher. as the movie progresses Wikus starts to realize that these Aliens need help and that they are living souls so he puts aside his selfish objective and almost sacrifices his life to save Christopher. NOW THATS A CHARACTER! Ill admit I Love Avatar and i enjoyed watching it but the story has been done a million times and the characters are the clones to the characters in camrons Aliens. Strong independent woman CHECK, military man with a heart CHECK, greedy corporate @ss hole CHECK, Butch woman BIG CHECK..... the list goes on. im just saying Avatar left me feeling like i just watch a recycled movie with blue aliens instead of indians, while district 9 made me feel like i could breath in an ocean of bad movies.
