To me, Vin Diesel is one of those actors who I enjoy watching no matter what film he does; be it macho men with glowing eyes...yummy...or a Navy S.E.A.L. in a Disney movie with a predictable beginning and end.

I happen to adore many Disney movies.  I don't care how predictable they are.  I knew this would be a happy, funny movie.  In these days, families, especially with young children, need to be able to see a movie full of positive messages.

I love Vin Diesel and while Lt. Shane Wolfe is the complete polar opposite of Riddick, I was not bored.  I enjoy seeing actors take a step back from what they usually do and explore other characters.  There are many similarities too.  They're both tough and nobody can beat them up.

I also enjoy seeing a man suddenly thrust into a world with children, diapers, and soccer-mom minivans.  It's hilarious when they have to do the Mr. Mom thing.  Oh, and seriously, the Peter Panda Dance Vin does for the little boy is absolutely worth it!  I was giggling, but really having fun.

All in all, Vin is one of my favorite actors and I like him even more now.  In fact, I'd never seen Pitch Black or The Chronicles of Riddick until after I'd seen The Pacifier.  That Disney movie made me want to see more of his acting.  Plus, the muscles are a very nice touch indeed.  ;)

BTW, if you haven't seen Pitch Black or The Chronicles of Riddick, please do so because you're missing out on one of the coolest characters to EVER come out of Hollywood....Riddick.  I'd like to have the cell block next him!!
