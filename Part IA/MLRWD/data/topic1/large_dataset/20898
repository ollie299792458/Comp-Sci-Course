Key points -watch what you buy - you need English subtitles throughout and I watched the shorter version - from other reviews the longer version 'wanders' and losses a strength of the shorter version - its focus on Senna and direct quotes from him or his family.

I found the shorter version wonderfully unfolded the story af Ayrton Senna life and carefully told/structured the way his life/career developed. Although I knew a fair bit about him I didn't reliaze the extent of his good work he untertook for his country and its people. His story on the track and his rivalry with Alain Prost was legend at the time and is pure theatre in retrospect. As someone else notes you get the sense he knew the equipment he was driving was quite likely to cause his death or serious injury - that weekend at Imola was a landmark for F1 and in credit to the sport they took on extensive changes after that race to ensure driver safety became a priority. His was the last death in F1 - 17+ years ago. It was not just Senna death but the extent of other crashs, death and injury at that meeting that changed F1 for the positive.

I highly recommend this film, its very well crafted and I am surpised I have not heard more of it. This man won 41 times in 161 starts, he held pole position 65 times and won the world championship 3 times. If you watch F1 try to see this film or at least watch the 1984 Monaco GP - Senna's win still sends chills up my spine - what a racer he was and this films tells us he left a legacy of honour, compassion and a credit to his Country. An estimated 3 million people turned out on the streets of Sao Pualo at his funeral.
