HUGE disappointment.....the idea of it was far better than the reality....but taking a peak at how Hollywood packaged its 60+ year negative characterization of any/all non white peoples Arabs have always taken a huge hit from those who own and create American film...and market it to the gullible public who absorbed and maintained the stereotypes .....as if it were a 'biblical narrative'....If you seek mindless entertainment set in an 'exotic' location with pretty Candace Bergen and rugged Sean Connery and prefer to not learn anything from your entertainment you'll like this one.  its the first time I've bought a film and could not bear to see it to the end...I stopped viewing it after about 30 minutes....bored and disgusted.  Just as other viewers who gave low ratings expressed this was just dumb.  The snapbox is the best part of this dvd.
Any other film with 'historical' characters and genuine narrative is more to my liking....Lion of the Desert wiht Anthony Quinn was BRILLIANT and timely for viewers now who want to put the Libyan struggles into perspective....the courageous leadership of Omar Muhktar, played by Quinn to a T....  or good old Lawrence of Arabia .(more history for comprehending the Mess O Potamia created by the US invasion of 2003....by a retrospective look at the British occupations).....and for sheer entertainment...the Paul Bowles story Sheltering Sky for a 20s 30s travel across Morocco and the Sahara....but wind and the lion ....pfffffft......blah.
