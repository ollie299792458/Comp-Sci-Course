I've read the original book version by Mario Puzo, and I must say the movie is suprisingly just as good if not better than the book itself.

The Godfather is one of the most realistic movies about the mafia ever created. Marlon Brando plays the notorious Don Vito Corleone, which became one of his most famous role ever played. His charismatic yet deadly look combined with his experienced acting skill made the character he was playing almost real. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone, the son of Don Vito Corleone who eventually gets involved with "family business". Though the Al Pacino in the movie was young, he displayed acting skills which would soon become unrivaled.

The movie depicts the power and corruption rooted in the society by the Mafia. Whether it is the movie and music industry, local law enforcements, or the vatican bank lived in fear under the reign of the notorious mafia at that time. Much detail was placed in showing how the mafia worked. But I believe that the movie was so successful because it tackled the most interesting and difficult thing to depict, which was the feelings and experience of people like Don Vito Corleone and Don Michael Corleone. The movie shows, im my opinion, unrivaled depiction of "realistic" mafia life, making us wonder even more and more about the true characteristics of these people in real life. The plot thickens as you watch, becoming even more and more emotional after each of the three parts, each part showing a different part of Michael Corleone's life and experiences.
