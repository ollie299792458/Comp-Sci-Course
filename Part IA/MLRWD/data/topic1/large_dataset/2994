Eventhough I learned of this film through the web and not the mainstream media, I am relieved to have found this wonderful adaptation called Noted on a Scandal.

It is clear why Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett were nominated for so many awards for this film.

They are simply stunning.

But Oscars don't always get it right.

The thought that Cate Blanchett won an Oscar for her not-so-great acting in 'The Aviator' instead of this fantastic performance is incredibly perplexing.

One can only assume the academy felt guilt-ridden (as they did with Judi Dench) and so awarded were with a 'guilt' oscar the following after passing her over for her mesmorizing portrayal of Elizabeth in Elizabeth the year previous.

Judi Dench received the same treatment.

Receiving a 'guilt' supporting Actress oscar for her 8 MINUTES in Shakespeare in Love after passing her for her brilliant work in Mrs. Brown.

(Helen Hunt won btw... still scratching my head over that one)

But make no mistake, these nominations were completely deserved.

This film is dark, and wonders into the darkest recesses of two desperately lonely characters.

The most stunning acheivement this film manages to make is conceiving Cate Blanchett's character Sheba Hart who has sexual relations with a teenage student and yet her portrayal is incredibly vulnerable and humane. This film also manages to show the concealed wretchedness of Barabara Covett (played by Judi Dench) as nothing more than a very thin veneer.

Once pulled back, it is this character that is exposed as the true villian.

If you enjoyed the film Dangerous Liasons, The Grifters and other dark character-oriented pieces you will enjoy this one.

I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.
