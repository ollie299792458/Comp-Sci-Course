Whatever cynical people say, it is the best movie about the complicated relationship between men and women, which fascinates us forever.  
Though Meg Ryan proved that she is a gifted actress who could play tough roles in "When a Man Loves a Woman" or "Courage Under Fire," she is always Sally to me; Sally whose hilarious fake orgasm is eternally fixed in mind of the audience of the whole world.  Haven't you seen that?  It's a shame if you didn't, because it is so hilarious, and makes all the men think about their loves.  
And Billy Crystal.  Though the script is written by Nora Ephron, you can find his trademark jokes all over the film.  See how he sings a song from musical "Oklahoma!" in front of a karaoke machine; see how Harry teaches Sally  pronouce "peeeeeeeacan" with his dead serious face.  Simply irresistible moments, I assure you.
But the most unforgettable thing about the film is its funny, clever, and most of all natural script by Nora Ephron.  Surprisingly, we have basically only four characters -- Sally, Harry, Jess (great support from foul-mouthed Bruno Kirby) and Marie (equally good turn from match-making Carrie Fisher).  Their dialogues and behaviors will all remind you of someone you know -- either you love or hate.  
With a smart allusion to, and analysis of, the classic case of love in "Casablanca," Sally and Harry never lets you down.  Especially if you think about watching something with somebody you care.  Or watching it, thinking about him or her.  Look at it, and enjoy yourselves. 
The beautiful photography capturing the seasons of New York is done by Barry Sonnenfeld, later known as director of "The Addams Family" and "MIB."
