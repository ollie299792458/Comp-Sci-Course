I'd known about The Cheyenne Social Club for years.  A classic comedy from 1970 starring Henry Fonda, Jimmy Stewart and Shirley Jones.  While not the subject material for youngsters (Jimmy Stewart's brother dies and leaves Jimmy the title to a whorehouse in Cheyenne, Wyoming in the 1870's), it is terrific comedy for teens and adults.  This movie was actually directed by Gene Kelley, the famed star of Singing in the Rain.

Fonda's character, Harley Sullivan, may be the number 2 fella in this movie, but in my mind, he steals the show.  The opening monologues that he has still crack me up, and I've seen the movie dozens of times already.

The surprise to this set is the flip side.  Firecreek is ALL drama and little comedy.  Fonda's character in this one is baaaaaad.  I'm not sure I've ever seen him portrayed as an evil man.  His character wrestles with these demons of his personality.  He recognizes what and who he is.  It seems there's good in him, but his life has always been a brutal one up to that point and he can't decide how to let go of it.  Jimmy Stewart's character is a bit staid, but is the good guy you want to cheer for.  I found myself rather upset throughout the movie at various points, but, like a car accident, I couldn't stop watching.  In the end, I was most satisfied at the outcome, and will watch Firecreek again and again.

Full recommendations for this pair of classic movies from 1970.  I hope, if you like westerns, you'll take the time to watch these.  It's time well spent...
