Walking into the theater, I honestly wasnt expecting much though I was looking forward to it. I thought I was about to see a predictable, episodic movie of stupid jokes and gross out gags. By the movie's end, I was thrilled I spent money on it. Not only were the jokes and situations funny but it was also acted well. Luke Wilson did a good job in a role that doesn't call for much, which is fine. It was easy for me to assume, even though I have aspirations for him, that Will Ferrell would recreate some whacky SNL character he has played before.  However, he was not only hysterical but he played his character with sincerity and proved he can do much more than a random SNL character. Fast talking Vince Vaughn was terrific as usual, his lines delivered with sharp and accurate timing and all deadpan.  His character, as well, was humanized and not a caricature or redundant character that a film of this kind could too easily churn out. Jeremy Piven gleefully waltzed through all his scenes as the antagonist dean with ease while making the audience hate him but be able to laugh at the same time as opposed to way too many comedic "villians." Ellen Pompeo adds just the right femininity to an otherwise mostly male oriented film to not oversaturate it and make her love interest into an obligation by the end of the film. 
Very funny, very worth it. Not a masterpiece but much better than many of the other comedies that would seem to be similar but are only so on the surface.
