This film is another wonder from the halls of Masterpiece Theatre. Brilliantly cast, it captures all of the wonderful aspects of the novel. Richard Roxburgh is particularly engaging as Sherlock Holmes. As the legendary detective he creates a cunning deeply sensual figure with a hint of eccentricity. His every movements evoke the illustrious haste sprung from of the bearing of intelligence, and his expressive bodily divulges reveal his sophisticated corporeal development. Indeed the only flaw in his character is that he is not shown more often in the story; this aspect is one of many things that makes the Hound of the Baskervilles a distinctive Sherlock Holmes story. The only outcast among the great performances is that of Dr. Watson, played by Ian Hart. He is portrayed as a small obnoxious discontenting person, far from his character in the novel. He moves about like a leech, and his physical appearance contemns all that he appends to.
 The film remains on the pulse of the novel until the conclusion. Some changes to this point in the story surpass that which was written, while others distort it rather gratuitously, and while some aspects of the plot are more easily absorbed by those who have read the story, a characteristic common to the features of Masterpiece Theatre, this film is perfectly shot and exquisitely acted. The Hound of the Baskervilles is also unique to the writings in relation to Sherlock Holmes because it is undoubtedly a story about scenery. These places are living entities in the film, shaping and moving the lives of men. The black moor smokes the screen of reality compromising the players in this tale, and weighing always heavily in their minds. In the novel it is written in every sentence, painting methodically the setting of events, but, quite adequately, the film's exotic backdrop heeds no ambiguous introduction.
