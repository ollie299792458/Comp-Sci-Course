If only more DVD's were this good!  Granted you may well get countless extras with more uptodate films (ala GLADIATOR, FIGHT CLUB, MEN IN BLACK etc), but films such as THE BIRDS often get overlooked in the extras department.  Not in this case though.
As one reviewer here so rightly stated, the extras here are quite staggering, particularly that documentary, which is the best I've seen on any film, ever.  You genuinely do learn more about the making of every aspect of the film than you could possibly have hoped for, especially in how Hitchcock brought his vision to the screen (the part where you learn that Hitch enjoyed the pre-production of the film more than the actual shooting, was for example something I didn't know).
As for the film itself, well it still stands the test of time as one of the most perfect examples of visual film making that you'll ever see.  Hitchcock's always treated the viewer with respect, allowing countless scenes of little or no dialolgue to tell the story.  It's a shame that more directors nowadays haven't the skill or guts to actually let the image tell the story.  True, some may have tried, such as the interesting but hugely flawed THE CELL, but it does seem that film makers like Hitchcock are a very rare species indeed.  
Huge plaudits go to the effects people too, particularly the genius of Albert Whitlock's matte paintings (that aerial bird's P.O.V. shot over the town of Bodaga Bay after the explosion at the petrol station is still a jaw-dropping moment), and it's a crime that their work failed to bring them an oscar.
The closest anyone has got to successfully matching or replicating Hitchcock's suspenseful style would be in Robert Zemeckis's jumpy and atmospheric WHAT LIES BENEATH, but at the end of the day there is and always will be only one true master of terror and suspense - Alfred Hitchcock himself.
A must have!
