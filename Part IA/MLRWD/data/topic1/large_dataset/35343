This set of the first 19 episodes from the first season of the Perry Mason TV show is technologically well mastered.  The sound and picture are top notch. The acting is extremely enjoyable.  I'm particularly charmed by the Tragg's relentless comic byplay with Perry.  The episodes are absolutely uncut.  The experience of watching these shows on DVD is at least as good if not better than it was originally back in 1957.

And if your primary if not unique interest in the shows is to capture an experience you were born too late to enjoy contemporaneously, or you're looking nostalgically recapture an experience of your youth (like this old boy-o) you'll be on cloud nine!

My only reservation about the set is the intrinsic "quality" of the stories themselves, once you get over your initial enjoyment of the period production values and the fine acting.  If I'm honest with myself I find the plotting of most of the episodes ultimately unsatisfying; they are simultaneously too densely detailed and full of holes at the same time.  Part of this paradox may stem, in these early episodes which are adapted from Gardner's original novels, from the difficulty of condensing the complexity of the ~150 page book into a 50 minutes tv show.

I'll grant that many of the greatest classic detective films require more than one viewing to piece together in your mind.  My frustration with Perry Mason here is that I'm afraid that repeated viewings will serve to point out the gaps in the story rather than fill them in.
