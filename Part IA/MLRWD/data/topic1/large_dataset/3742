This is a dvd that I keep going back to.  I remember as a kid watching after school and being entertained.  The slapstick style comedy is silly but keeps you smiling.

For me, one of the funniest episodes of the whole series is in season one.  "Diogenes, Won't You Please Go Home" is a classic.  Gilligan is tied to a tree and about to be shot from the Japanese Sailor.  The lovable and usually helpless Ginger appears from behind a tree to save him.  Since Ginger normally uses her looks to get what she wants, you think that she is going to do the same here.  But instead of sweet talking or smiling, she engages the sailor in a judo fight in which she flips him to the ground...several times.  I remember the first time I saw this episode as a kid, I was so amazed and off guard.  It was soooo funny.  The sailor would attack her several times, only to be fliped on the ground with a loud thud.  The scene keeps flashing to Gilligans facial expressions.  He looks like he can't believe what he is seeing.  She then knocks out the sailor with a karate chop and announces "So much for him".  I remember laughing at this days later.  I had never seen anything like it. Ginger - good looking and able to beat up men when necessary.  Whoever wrote that scene is a very clever.  It is still my favorite scene in the series.
