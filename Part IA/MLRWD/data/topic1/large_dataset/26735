Two words, modern western.  Remember the days of John Wayne?  When a guy with a gun chased another guy with a gun halfway across the country with minimal police involvement?  This is one of those movies.
The Way of the Gun (WoG)is most definately one of my favorite movies, not for it's over use of Colt 1911's or the amazing gun fight sequences, but for the religious and societal meanings laced throughout the film.  Ryan Phillippe speaks of god and mercy with Benicio Del Toro, and Del Toro replies with, "I'm gonna tell him I was Framed," upsetting Phillippe, but in the end, Phillippe doesn't know what he has to say in his defense.
Let's not forget the societal statements of this movie, it's based on the concept that money equals happiness.  Phillippe and Del Toro believe this and kidnap Julliete Lewis, a surigate mother, in hopes to collect on a ransom from the millionare parents of the baby.
But the plan doesn't play out and plot twist after plot twist end with blood shed and suprises.  But the only way to actually know what happened and who did what, the film must be viewed multiple times.  This is truely a modern masterpiece that was greatly understated and is required viewing for any person who watches movies.
