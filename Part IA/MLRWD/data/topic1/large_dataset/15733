When you put together Rick Moranis,Steve Martin,a giant plant who feeds off human blood,and a fabulous rock music score,what do you get?  "Little Shop of Horrors",that's what!  Rick Moranis is  Seymour,an orphan who wants nothing more than to get out of his drab  town("Downtown")and find love with his co-worker,Audrey.(Ellen  Greene)However,that's not really possible while working in Skid Row at  Mushnik's Flower Shop.(Mr. Mushnik is played by Vincent  Gardenia)However,that all changes when Seymour discovers a strange plant  during a solar eclipse and christens it "Audrey 2".Things pick up  at the flower shop when customers begin pouring in to see the plant-and  making poor Seymour's life a little more bearable.Until,that is,Seymour  discovers that his precious plant can only live on human blood.("Feed  Me")With nowhere to turn,Seymour must find a way to keep Audrey 2  alive,while getting Audrey 1 to fall in love with him.  Although Rick  Moranis and Ellen Greene are superb as Seymour and Audrey,the celeb cameos  sometimes steal the show.Steve Martin is perfect as the sadistic dentist  and Audrey's abusive boyfriend,Orin.His sole musical  number("Dentist!") is my personal favorite.Orin's hyperactive  masochistic patient is played by  Bill Murray in his prime.Some other  celebs pop up in the movie too,such as John Candy.  Levi Stubbs of the  Four Tops is the voice of Audrey 2,an excellent role with some showstopping  musical numbers.And last but definitely not least,three newcomers play  Ronnette,Chiffon,and Crystal,the Supremes-type singers known as the Doo  Wops.This cast and the script make it a perfect show.Enjoy!
