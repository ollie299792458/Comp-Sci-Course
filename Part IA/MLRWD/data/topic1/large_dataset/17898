This is so far the best CGI animated movie in Resident Evil series. Compared to ''Degenretaion'' it is so much better. I could not finish ''Degeneration'', but this movie has all the rights and no wrongs. Good story; very good animation and graphics; not too predictable; characters are given life, they don't feel that animated. Even when seeing Nemesis (which I saw like a real hardcore bad*ss), I felt like I was Leon himself and wanted just to run for my life. Besides that the movie is almost 2 hours long and quite often I felt like cinematics will end any moment and I will have to shoot BOWs. As the movie takes place right before Resident Evil 6, I wonder what will the game deliver. Will it be as enjoyable to play as seeing this animated movie? I hope.

Plot:
U.S. federal agent Leon S. Kennedy sneaks into the "East Slavic Republic" to verify rumors that Bio-Organic Weapons (BOWs) are being used in the country's civil war, which the U.S. and Russia are making preparations to jointly intervene in. Right after his infiltration, the U.S. government orders him to leave immediately. Determined to uncover the truth, Leon ignores the order and enters the battlefield to end the chain of tragedies caused by the BOWs.
