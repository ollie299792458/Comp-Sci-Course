...says Anthony Hopkins, speaking of the first time his agent mentioned "Silence of the Lambs" to him as a potential project. This comment comes in "Inside the Labyrinth," a documentary about the film that is one of the many nifty extras on this DVD. I almost fell out of my chair laughing at the answering machine message from Hopkins as Lecter ("...please leave a message. I insist. The last person who failed to do so, I ate his liver..."). There are plenty of teasers and trailers for the movie for people who like that sort of thing, as I do. You can spend all afternoon with this DVD, enjoying the complete "Lambs experience."
The movie itself? As sommeone on the crew said, it spans several genres...detective story, fairy tale, morality play, psychological thriller, horror movie. It excels at each of them in a way that no other film had done before, and few have done since. I can still remember seeing this in the theater when it was originally released, clutching the friend next to me and screaming my fool head off as Jame Gumb stalked Clarice with his green night goggles. So many things about the movie stay with you, and make it worth seeing again and again.
