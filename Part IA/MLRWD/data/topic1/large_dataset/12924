Won't argue its not good. Really I enjoyed the show. It is a very unique world and very enjoyable in style and presentation. Surfing mecha was something I hadn't considered before, let alone sky surfing mecha. The characters along with this are all quite enjoyable.

I will however give the series a thumb down for getting inspiration from Evangelion. I get it that EVA was an epic anime which defined a generation. But frankly, not everyone likes EVA or sitting through a psychotherapy session with a character that never seems to learn anything. This happens in the story very strongly with Renton. It gets to the point you just want to strangle the little brat. I get his anguish, really I do. But enough, time to move the story along. Thankfully E7 does, unlike EVA which even in the end never gets beyond psychosis.

The other thumb down would be involving the structure and storytelling of the second half. It is considerably weak. The backstory that sounded so epic as it was built up, seems to disappear when you find out what is really going on. What the lifeforms are and the scenes following that are quite anti climactic. Then as it finally comes to completion it leaves you mildly satisfied with a lot of questions and not enough answers.

Really its a great show, enjoy it for what it does right. But enough with the EVA love already. How much something copies or doesn't copy EVA should not be a standard of if it is good or not. Seeing a protagonist hero being presented as a human through anguish is one thing, but not moving past that and not finally learning how to cope just turns a show from a great piece, into little more watching a kid cower and whine over and over.
