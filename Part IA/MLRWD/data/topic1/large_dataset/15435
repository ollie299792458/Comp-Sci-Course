I won't go in to about the film, if you've already clicked on the link then you will know the jist of the film already.  I have to admit I've been looking forwards to this release qutie a bit since it was first anounced, and I'm pleased to say it doesn't disapoint.

the picture quality for a pre-hd era film is quite simply amazing, you can seen right down to the scuff marks on the biker jacket at the begining, and I'm please to say that compaired to the standard DVD edition the dark areas finally appear clear like they did in the cinema complex all them years ago instead of the mush that was hastly rushed out on DVD in the first place.

The only complant picture wise I have is it kind of looks a little soft whether that is a process of re-scanning the film or how the director intented I don't know, all I know is this is the best qualtiy I've ever seen this picture in.

sound wise has come into a complete revelation. their are times in the film where you just wonder if the sound was comming from outside instead of being on the disk, if your player can handle it switch to DTS6.1 and see what I mean, maybe its taste prefrence but the EX soundtrack didn't have quite the same bite to it.

All in all I'm very happy with it 4* if you haven't seen the film and have Blu-ray get this belive me you won't be disapointed
