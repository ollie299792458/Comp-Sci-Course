I have to say I am very disappointed with this work out dvd.  Although it will make you sweet I didn't really get a good worked out.  The camera people where horrible I don't think they have ever shot a work out video in there lives, I believe that part of what makes the choreography hard to learn is camera is never on what she is teaching you.  For instance if she is showing you a step for your feet the camera is on her upper body not very effective for learning. Julianne also goes way to fast and some of the choreography is fairly advanced, she says you don't have to be a dancer to do this which I am, and I found it a challenging to learn some of the choreography. Now I am not a professional but I have been in dance and theatre since I was four.  Julianne does tell you what to do before she does it but most of the time it doesn't really make sense once she does the move, I think she trying not to use dance terms but she doesn't know what makes sense to the general public. Overall I didn't like this dvd but its just personal preference I guess, I know there are some people who really like this dvd.  I hope this helps someone.
