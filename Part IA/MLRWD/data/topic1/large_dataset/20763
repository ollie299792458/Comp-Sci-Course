I am a gargantuan NIN fan.  I've seen them live four times now, and while this is was a great show, I have to say that I left it wanting more.  However, I know the reason for that is because I've seen all the live shows I have.  The setlist is just a little too hit-friendly for my taste.  I could've watched this show without regulars such as "Terrible Lie", "Wish" or "Closer".  Aside from the With Teeth songs, the setlist was identical to the Fragility Tour (and the subsequent DVD, And All That Could Have Been).  And that section in the middle with the screen is exactly (and I mean exactly!) what was done during the Self Destruct Tour in 1995.  While Trent Reznor is a musical genius in every sense of the word, I found myself disappointed that he repeated himself so much.

That being said, for someone who has never seen a NIN show, the setlist rocks, and the show is spectacular!  And, in true Trent Reznor style, the DVD quality is immaculate.  Crystal clear picture, tons of great extras (Trent is amazing to his fans!) and a sound quality that will blow you away!  I do not regret purchasing this DVD!  I greatly look forward to the release of Year Zero and the subsequent touring and videos that complement what's already a haunting and engrossing concept album!
