Flashbacks of a Fool is a totally engrossing film starring Daniel Craig as Joe Scot, a washed up actor addicted to drugs and sex (Advisory: extremely graphic drug and sex scenes featuring Craig and multiple female partners). Scot's career is in the tank due to his excesses, he is in danger of losing all human contact in his life and then suddenly a childhood friend dies causing him to take stock of his life. In an extended flashback sequence, Scot relives his youth as he struggles to understand why he has crashed and burned. The flashback is arresting, depicting Scot's initiation to sex with a married woman, a sweet failed romance and a horrifying personal tragedy that altered his life forever. The film is incredibly erotic, beautifully filmed and edited. The seduction scenes featuring young Harry Eden (Oliver Twist) as the teenaged Scot and an older woman will leave you breathless. Craig delivers a sharp and disturbing performance. This film is arty, hot, emotionally satisifying and will stay in your mind for days. And for anyone who grew up during the age of glam rock in the 70's, the flashback sequence is breathtaking . . . featuring the music of David Bowie and Bryan Ferry in a context that will take your breath away. Highly, highly recommended. Great cameo by Eve as Scot's housekeeper, one of the few genuine people in his world. See this film.
