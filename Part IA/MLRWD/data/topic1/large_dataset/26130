Faber College during fall fraternity pledge season is the place all young men want to be regardless of societal ranking.  The disparity between two of the fraternities is quickly evident when we see the wealthy white young men recruiting look-a-likes to join their fraternity and snubbing wannabe's who don't quite measure up.  The wealthy frat house has the approval of the school's Dean Wormer and he despises with a passion the characters who choose Delta House fraternity.  Dean Wormer wants Delta House off of his campus and he asks Omega House (the rich boys) to help him accomplish this task.  This is where the fun begins.
It doesn't take long for the viewer to realize that fun-loving, sloppy, middle-class guys inhabit Delta house and they live for pulling pranks on the Omega House fraternity and Dean Wormer.
This movie truly portrays college life on campuses during the 1970's.  The underdog Delta House is only looking for acceptance and they won't stop at anything to achieve it!  The pledge class consists of all the rejects from Omega House not only from this year but year's past.  Together this group works together to undo Dean Wormer's wish to rid their house from his campus.
Flounder's experience with the horse is hysterical.  The lunchroom scene with Bluto is classic.  Otter's "happy-go-lucky" love interests including Dean Wormer's life are characteristic of a young man's college sexual escapades of the 70's.  The closing of the Delta House and the road trip are comical.  And finally the parade of all parades allows Delta House to get their revenge.
Scenes from this movie stay with you forever!  Keep smiling as you relive quotes and replay scenes in your mind years after viewing this very funny film!
