Years ago I rented "Wings of Desire" after reading how wonderful it was. I'm sorry to say I was confused and uninterested from the start and did an extremely rare thing for me: I turned it off. It could very well have been wonderful, and had I invested a little more time in it, I might have become a fan of it. It's something I wonder about to this day--but honestly, not enough to rent "Wings" again.

I knew "City of Angels" was the American "re-make" of "Wings" and I chose to see it anyway. I'll tell you this: my house may be been burgled or burned while I watched. I'll never know. I was drawn in by "City of Angels'" imagery, it's music, it's quiet and careful pacing, and by the understated performances of Cage and Ryan. It is one of only a handful of films I can think of that I couldn't get out of my mind--for days!

The out of this world fantastic subject matter of an angel falling in love with a human and contemplating relinquishing his immortality could make this movie a bit of an eyeroller, but the filmmakers respect both the story and their audience and they make it work. This is a quiet, romantic, and melancholy film. It is almost like a dream and it is likely to draw you into it's unusual little world.

DVD features: Nice additional behind the scenes interviews and music videos (from a soundtrack that is equally familar and challenging and ultimately, rewarding).
