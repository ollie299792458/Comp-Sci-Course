Robocop one was the best out of the other 2.  The second one you had a question of why the glass on the cop car was replaced once the car took a rocket, fliped, and glass SHATTERED.  They replaced it to have the scene where the car gets shot up before Robocop comes out.  I didn't see any other problems with the rest of the movie.  Then the third one was OK, I feel Peter Weller was the best actor for the Robocop role, but it was someone else.  You could tell that there was problem with the voice over when you stare closely at his mouth and what is actually being said.  Then what's up with making his voice more robotic when he is fully suited (helmet on)?  When ever he has his helmet off, he sounds like a regular person.  Then you have these guys from OCP wearing funny ass looking uniforms and the guy in charge of Rehab walks around without any body armour?  He must be invincible, who knows?  Besides those, it does have some good points.  It was funny how the little girl, Mariko, hacks a ED-209 when the rebels were breaking into the Police armory for weapons then some of the upgrades to Robocop was pretty good.  I only wish that they were consistent and actually reviewed every detail of their shooting before they released this movie.
