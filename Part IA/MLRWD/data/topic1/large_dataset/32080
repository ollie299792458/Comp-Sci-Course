I first saw Joseph when my middle school put it on. I was a part of the set crew, but as i watch this video, and have further experiences in acting and singing, i wish i had been part of the cast. Ok, so its not the greatest thing Webber has ever done (that would be Phantom), in fact most of it is stolen, but this performance was excellent. Donny Osmond is just the perfect Joseph, the music, stolen or not, was very happy and upbeat (with the obvious exception of "Close Every Door" and "Cannan Days"), what you would want in a family film, and the singing and dancing will make a viewer glow with happiness. It had just about every known color in it, which adds to the fun, especially during "Joseph's Coat." Pharaoh rocks us into the second act very cool-like. The one objection that parents would have, with sharing this video with their kids, is Potifer's wife. I don't think its that bad, its a small part of the production, but if it bothers you, just fast forward through it and enjoy the rest of the show (its followed by the best song in the show). On a final note, the costumes were fantastic, especially Donny's coat (I only wish i could buy a coat like that here on amazon).
