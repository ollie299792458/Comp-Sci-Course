The movie is MEGA-nostalgic.  It recalls almost everything about the 80's from the attire, toys, and emphasizes on things that were hip at that time which makes the movie funny for those who can recall the 80's.
The DVD  adds a whole lot more to the nostalgia.  The artistry of the menu itself  was very 80's  - very COOL.  The Karaoke option is a bit crude but still  nice to have in the DVD.  The scene selection is one of those moving type  wherein each scene is moving and not just a simple picture.
The 80 trivia  game is fun to play.  Parts of the lyrics are displayed and you try to  recall the singer and the title, though they should have gotten lyrics from  all the songs from the movie before any other song.
The only thing  missing are the theatrical trailers and TV spots. 
Though you have the  option of the full screen or the wide screen version, this is one of those  very rare movies wherein full screen version is better.  This is because  the wide screen version cuts off some top and bottom parts of the movie  while showing the cut-off side parts.
