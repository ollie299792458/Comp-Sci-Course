I have to say that Jerry Maguire is one of the best performances by Tom Cruise.  He is so emotionally vulnerable as Jerry Maguire that everyone is completely relating to him.

Everyone sort of has this idea of sending out a memo to your colleagues to indicate what an ideal work life should be, however, when the reality hits about the memo and the people at the office are thinking what has he been smoking, then Jerry realizes that he is losing it.  When he gets fired by one of his underlings played wonderfully by Jay Mohr, then you know that you are on a wonderful emotional roller coaster called life with Jerry.

Cameron Crowe does a wonderful job of directing Cruise through the evolving process of his character.  Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., Regina King, Bonnie Hunt, Kelly Preston and Jonathan Lipnicki definitely make the movie even better as they guide Jerry through the difficult process of life.

Zellweger is great when she packs up her stuff and decides to follow Jerry into the unknown.  Gooding Jr. is great when he tells Jerry that he is the ambassador of "kwan".  Lipnicki is adorable as Jerry's new close little friend as Zellweger's son.

I could go on about how this movie is the evolving character of a man who has a problem with an intimate relationship, but with a little help from his friend(Gooding Jr.), he realizes that the best thing in life is a truly committed intimate relationship.  One of the better realizations about this movie.

If you like Crowe, Cruise, Zellweger, Gooding Jr., then you will have a great time seeing Jerry Maguire.  I have forgotten how many times that I have seen it, and it will always be one of the better movies that I have seen.
