Although I prefer "Jesus of Nazareth" over all the Biblical films depicting the life of Christ, this film comes in at a close second ("King of Kings" is enjoyable although loses most of it's luster  when compared to "Greatest"). Max Von  Sydow (with those piercing  blue eyes) turns in a notewrothy portrayal as Jesus and should have at  least gotten an Oscar nod for his performance. Charlton Heston with his  booming, commanding voice and rugged, masculine physique is the idyllic  John the Baptist and should have been an Oscar contender in the supporting  actor catagory, Dorothy McGuire is radiant as the Virgin Mary ( even if she  does have a small role--which should not have been so relegated) and Jose  Ferrer gives a wry, yet somewhat gruff portrayal of Herod Antipas while  Claude Raines is a terrifying Herod the Great. Telly Savales is rather  mediocre as Pontius Pilate, Angela Lansbury as his wife Claudia, should  have had more than one line and John Wayne should never have been offered a  part in the film. Despite the few minor flaws this is an enjoyable film and  does not lack the essence of the Gosples.
