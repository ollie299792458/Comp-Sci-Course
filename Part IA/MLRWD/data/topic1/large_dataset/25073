This review is ONLY for the pricing policy of Amazon for multiple seasons where Carnivale is an example.

Complete First Two Seasons: $98

Separately,

Season One: $24
Season Two: $24

Do the math-- buying seasons separately is less than HALF the price of the full two season set.  Come on Amazon, change your policies and do the checks so that we can TRUST your pricing policies.

Series is intriguing, excellent, and with superb music scores, although it is not for everyone due to horrific scenes in some episodes and some adult material.

DVDs are single-sided (good!) but in those HARD push-center-button holders that DON'T WORK and make it more likely that you will damage the disks trying to get them out.  Come on DVD manufacturers, you can do better than that!!!

Cases, although bulky, have excellent artwork and are arranged well both in the layout and the DVD menus that include previous scene, next scene, and scene selection.  Extras are interesting and show the expense at remaking the real sets on location.
