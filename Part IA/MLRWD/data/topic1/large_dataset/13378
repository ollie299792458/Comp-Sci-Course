Although I am now an intermediate level exerciser, I still use this dvd for light days when I don't feel like doing a hard-core toning work-out.  I think it's excellent for individuals who are starting-out with exercise, and need an introduction to toning. The exercises are straight forward and easy to accomplish. However, there are a lot of squats and lunges in the buns and thigh section of this dvd, so if you have bad knees, you will want to be mindful of this. Also, for the arms section of the dvd, she tells beginners to start off with 5 lb. dumbbells. I wouldn't recommend that. If you are a beginner, you should start with 2 lb. or 3 lb. first, then build-up from there (that's what I did when I was at the beginning level).

The only drawback with this dvd is that fact that it IS fairly simple. Therefore, you will probably master the moves quickly, and be ready to "move-on." To help build upon the intensity, I use hand weights for the buns and thigh section. You could also use ankle weights for these sections, but I don't. I rather use my dumbbells. With the abs and arm section, however, there is no way to intensify these sections, so once you master the routine, they will strictly be used for your light days only. I also wasn't overly impressed with the cool down stretch on this dvd. I found it a bit dry and dull.

The instructor, Cindy Witmarsh is pretty good. Her instructions are clear and precise. Her personality, at first, was a bit annoying for me, but she is not overly cheery and smily like Denise Austin.

Overall, this is a good dvd. I wouldn't recommend it for intermediate level or above exercisers because you would become bored with it all too easily. However, I did get results with this dvd during my beginning stages of exercising, and I noticed a difference in my thighs and buns (the sections I use the most off of this dvd). So, it is effective, just not for the long term because your body will want something more challenging in the later stages.
