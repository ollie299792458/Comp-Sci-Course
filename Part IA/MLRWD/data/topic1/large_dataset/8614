When I see a movie, it's not often that I'm blown away by the sheer imagination of it. Most movies forget to be imaginative. Heck, most movies don't even make you think. This one is an exception. First off, the visuals  are spectacular. The city scapes are dark and gloomy, but what sets them  apart from movies like "The Crow" or "Bladerunner" is  that "Dark City" uses the style of the 30's &amp; 40's. There are  some inventive special effects during the "tuning" of the city  which are wonderful. Some of the characters could have used more fleshing  out, particularly Emma Murdoch (Jennifer Connelly), but if you spend the  time listening to Roger Ebert's commentary you will understand why they  weren't. Other characters are made memorable simply because the story  allowed them to be.  Watch for the mad detective who has figured out the  "tuning", and Richard O'Brien (Riff-Raff from Rocky Horror) and  Bruce Spence (Gyro Pilot from Mad Max movies) as Mr. Hand and as Mr. Wall,  two Strangers. Alex Proyas has certainly set a high standard for himself  and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next. If you missed this one  at the theater, you missed out. The opening bathroom scene was gorgeous.  Not because of Mr. Sewell's behind, but because the colors were so vibrant.  This movie is likely to end up as one of those classics that is studied in  every cinema class.
