I remember first seeing "The Exorcist" years ago. It scared me then, it still scares me now. I applaud the use of brilliant special effects, superb acting, and a screenplay that takes all the best elements  of the novel to create a tightly wound, disturbing and see-over-and-over  movie.

This is in the top 10 of my all-time favorite horror  films. This is not a splatter film by any stretch of the imagination. It is  powerful with vivid images, dialogue and characters. At the heart is a  basic good vs. evil tale. Anyone who appreciates good cinema should check  this out. But be warned: few can watch this film without being haunted by  it afterwards.

This edition of the film features behind-the-scenes  footage as well as interviews with the actors and crew members. The  documentary is fascinating just by itself. Very few movies, and even fewer  horror movies, stand the test of time. This is one that continues to  captivate audiences, and it belongs on the shelf of every horror fan.
