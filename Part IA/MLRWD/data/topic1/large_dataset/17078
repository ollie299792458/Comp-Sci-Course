this movie is somewhat cheesy but, BUT effective. once again I wish to tell people the greatest performance are not from those actors just seemed trying so hard to spray that so "wow" performance of their on screen, but from those who play so involved with their character and so make them fun while you are watching them play. I admit I'm toward to like Dunst's movies but she always allow me to like her be in her role as she pretty much deliver her "involveness" on her character most of times ( may be except for spiderman series). You must admit in usual terms american stars and british stars don't look quite bright toghether, its either the american actor try too hard to be british or the other way around. In this one Dunst jsut play herself all the time which WORKS. The movie doesnt really ask you to think of the possibility how those2 actually loves each other but it simply telling you they speak differently and they do like each other and that's just how it works, even Notting Hill that got me doubt about the2 but this one is essential enough. Works on me.

matching scene are predictable but the camera works quite well and I didnt raise any complaints. What I dont like is the story is very very apparently benefits the male side, I'm a male I do like to be the hero all the time but I guess I'm decent enough to see that the movie pretty pity on the prize is not just as important for the girl as for the guy. IT is not the question whether which racial side but the problem is Dunst's character doesnt seem like one taht would give it up so easily, the only flaw in the movie, overall is jsut enjoyfull
