Ok! I absolutely love this movie! It has every aspect of a great movie(for me at least) Great music, true love, drama, and lots of fun! This movie, has had my heart since I saw it as a small girl on tv. I bought the movie and I wore it out, kind of. I then decided to buy the DVD and WOW! I was so surprised by how much better it made the film. The film is about Baby and Johnny and how they meet and fall in love in Baby's "last summer" as an adolescent. They fall in love obviously and there are so many aspects about this movie that are just wonderful and lovable. Every character is lovable in their own way! I love Patrick Swayze in this role, he is very sexy and just so dangerous. You know your typical bad boy persona, but you know bad boys, he really isn't, he is a sweet lovable boy in the body of a bad boy. As for Baby, well she is so innocent and child-like that all you wanna do is just hug her! As for Baby's father, i must say some parts of the movie, I just wanted to kick him, but he is a father, and you know dad's. Well, that's about it, it's a great movie!! It's just so hard to explain the effect! Good Luck!
