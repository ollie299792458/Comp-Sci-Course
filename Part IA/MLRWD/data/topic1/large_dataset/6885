I remember the first time I watched this masterpiece of suspense. I was 9 years old, and my mom had seen it at the theatre, and was freaked out and wanted to watch me freak out. It was great. If you love scary or suspensful movies this is a must see. Yeah, it may be dated as far as clothes and hairstyles, but so what? If it's well written and acted it's worth watching, and this film definately is.
This is one of Brian DePalma's best films, next to "Carrie" and "Sisters". It was completely unpredictable and frightening.
The story concerns a middle aged woman(Angie Dickinson, in her best film), unhappily married to a man who "stinks in bed". She sees a psychiatrist(Michael Caine) to deal with her passionless marriage. Sexually frustrated, she decides to have an affair, which leads to a horrifying discovery AND THEN an unexpected, gruesome surprise for her. Nancy Allen plays a high priced call girl who witnesses "a tall, blonde woman wearing dark glasses" in the aftermath of a murder and Keith Gordon plays Angie Dickinson's son who, in cahoots with Nancy Allen's character sets about discovering the identity of "the blonde woman" before Nancy Allen's character is charged with the murder.
It's high voltage suspense throughout, and will keep you guessing. And now isn't that what all great mysteries are about? Check this one out, it's worth it.
