Either you enjoy Barbara Streisand's singing or you don't. I don't. That is the reason I wasn't particularly eager to see Hello Dolly. Then I found a copy of it on vhs at a yard sale and figured "eh,why not?". After all, I have seen a number of actors who I ordinarily do not care for give what I consider to be excellent performances.
  Well,this is not one of those performances. There is nothing about Streisand's singing or acting that I liked. Luckily,I liked just about everything else about the film. All the other actors were delightful. Some of the songs were hilarious,and I enjoyed Gower Champion's silly,energetic choreography (which is no surprise considering that I loved his dancing in Show Boat). The film is upbeat and few of the jokes fail to elicit a chuckle. It doesn't take itself too seriously and that is what makes the absurdity of the plot work. Honestly,the lead is pretty much the only low point in my mind. What saves the film for me is that many scenes have little or nothing to do with Dolly. I do not know who I would prefer in the lead role,although it probably would not be Channing.
  I liked the film so well,I plan to buy it on dvd and possibly make watching it a summer tradition. I am disappointed that the dvd has few extras and no commentary,but I will likely buy it anyway. I just can't help but imagine how much more I would love the film if I actually enjoyed Dolly herself.
