L'Atalante is one of the most beautiful films ever made.  If you're considering buying it, then you probably already know this.  
But the DVD is a little disappointing.  It's great that the film's been restored, but why isn't there a "letterbox" option on the disc so we feel confident we're seeing the full frame as shot by Boris Kaufman?  This always bothers me.  If there's some reason why the film must be reformatted, then an insert or some commentary should provide an explanation.  
Another problem is that the title of the featurette included on the disc, "The Making of L'Atalante," is a little misleading.  It focuses mainly on the actors and there's very little information about Vigo himself or the actual production of the film. I found it disappointing.  
Still, Vigo is such a wonderful, tragic figure, and everything he touched is so unique and beautiful, that there's no way to give less than four stars.  And I think the DVD is much better than any of the VHS copies that have been released.
