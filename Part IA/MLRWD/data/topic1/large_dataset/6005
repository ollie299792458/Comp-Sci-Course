When this film was released I was still serving in the U.S. Navy. At that time I was very much against the Vietnam War as many of my generation were. I didn't see this marvellous film in the theater.

Years later I saw the film on VHS and was amazed at what I missed. Now that I have the Blu-ray release I have to say it is more stunning than ever. In fact, it may be too good on Blu-ray because the make-up on George C. Scott's eyebrows is quite visible in the famous opening speech. You can actually see the fabric on which the eyebrows are mounted!

The audio is better than ever in Blu-ray. I especially like the music. The sounds of battle are very realistic and very loud.

I would advise anyone interested in this film to buy the Blu-ray version. It comes with the regular DVD in the same box. On a larger screen HDTV this is simply an astounding viewing experience.

The screenplay is also extremely well crafted. It tells an amazing story.

George C. Scott cannot be praised enough for his work in Patton.
