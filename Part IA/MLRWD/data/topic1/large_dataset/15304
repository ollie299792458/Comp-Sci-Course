ECW's first PPV was excellent. Also, if I like it now, imagine how it was five years ago. .... Well, here is a match by match analysis.
Eliminators vs. Dudley Boyz
Great match. Killer opening, both guys did alot, and didn't even use weapons of any kind. Only real bad part was that the Eliminators were wearing some fruity ... pink tights.
Rating: 8/10
Lance Strom vs. Rob Van Dam
Before RVD went soft. Good match. Some good high flying moves and much better than I expected. None of that boring technical crap where they put on minute long submissions, more of a quick paced match.
Rating: 7.5/10
Michinoku 6 Man Tag
Oh My .... These guys put on [a good] a match. So much stuff you have to watch it several times to fully get everything. These guys ruled.
Rating: 10/10
Pitbull 2 vs. Shane Douglas
BORING! This match would've been better if there wasn't so much stupid stuff. All it the match was, was Pitbull 2 trying to break Shane's neck and kicking him in the groin.
Rating: 5/10
Taz vs. Sabu
This match was pretty good. Also, alot of cool stuff happens afterwards thats cool to watch. Too bad both guys couldn't put more into it, I guess Taz had arm surgery or whatever. Still, they brawled all over the place and had some great spots.
Rating: 7/10
Sandman vs. Terry Funk vs. Stevie Richards
Great three way hardcore match. You also get to see the silly and goofy bWo. Awesome ladder action that the WWF stole. These guys really put on a good match.
Rating: 8.5/10
Raven vs. Terry Funk
Most of the stuff happens outside the ring. The Nest gets involved as well as Tommy Dreamer. Terry bleeds like crazy, a doctor had to come in right in the middle of the match. Too bad not too much wrestling happened.
