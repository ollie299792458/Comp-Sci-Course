Filmmaker Tim Burton was the perfect choice to bring this adaptation of Washington Irving's creepy classic to the big screen.  No one can match his ability to create an atmosphere that is both creepy and whimsical, and you can see it in full force here.  The sets and designs in Sleepy Hollow are just as much stars in the movie as are the actors.
Of course, the stars are hardly overshadowed because Burton also has a talent for getting actors best suited for his projects.  Johnny Depp is a great actor who enjoys taking unconventional roles, and he manages the fine line between Ichobod's timidity and his nobility extremely well.  Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson are great, too.  Plus, any fan of Burton's movies will find a lot of familiar faces here as well (most notably Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and Martin Landau).
There were just two minor problems I had with the movie.  First, the beheadings turn out to be more deliberate than I would have hoped (random killings are always scarier), and Casper Van Dien's role should have been banished to the cutting room floor.  Still, these are minor quibbles compared to the quick-moving plot, haunting visuals and really good casting that make Sleepy Hollow an unforgettable movie.
On the other hand, Paramount's tradition of weak DVD extras continues unbroken with this offering.  The "Making-Of" documentary is little more than a 20 minute commercial, and Tim Burton's commentary is boring and not the least bit insightful.  It's enough to knock my rating down a notch, but the DVD is worth owning based on the movie alone.
