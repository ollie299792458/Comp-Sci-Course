I watched this movie on Netflix and finally ordered it through Amazom. To understand the message the movie imparts, one must understand the Cold War and Christianity, especially after a devastating World War in Europe and Asia. The Soviet Union had enslaved many free nations in Eastern Europe as a result. Sci-fi was becoming very popular, especially that which concerned contact with other planets, most notably Mars. The movie is quite well done for being somewhat low budget, not a lot of special effects. There are no creatures from another planet nor space craft but rather a message imparted to the world, supposedly from Mars. This message, which is a religious one from the Bible causes an upheaval among the enslaved people and a religious revival in the US. It is actually what many people believed at the time as the way to end oppression and other ills rampant in the world, presented in a popular subject matter. Anyone who is offended by this movie should rethink their own values and ask themselves why they are offended by something like this. As for myself, I found this a very pleasant movie with a lot of positive meaning, though I am not what you may call a very religious person. I would reccomend this movie, not only from it's historical aspect but one of hope for even today.
