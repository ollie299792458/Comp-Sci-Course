Having read the book Game Change closer to the time it was published and not having read many reviews for the HBO movie before viewing, I did not realize that the movie was primarily about John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and how Sarah Palin fit into it.  The book discusses all of the 2008 presidential players, so the movie was a bit of a surprise for me on that front.  That said, it was a riveting surprise - lol!  The story is told through the eyes of two former McCain campaign aides and the story they tell is one of negligence, confusion, unpreparedness and high stress as it pertains to how they picked, vetted, and ultimately threw under the bus former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.  The movie is very good so I don't want to give too many details.  What I'll end with is that it made Sarah Palin appear human - not a ridiculous caricature of herself which is often how she comes across via the media.  Personally, I don't like or agree with her politics and believe that the McCain campaign should never have chosen her to be John McCain's vice president in the first place, BUT ... if HBO's Game Change is a true account of how John McCain's final presidential run imploded, I can honestly say that Sarah Palin was thrown into a pool of quicksand with no reasonable or easy way of getting out!

Excellent film by HBO, awesome acting by entire cast... 10 stars easily.
