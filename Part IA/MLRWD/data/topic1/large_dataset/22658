Judging from the bad reviews, people went in expecting "Bridesmaids" and instead got "There Will Be Blood".  Looks like the marketing dept failed, yet again, by portraying a movie as something it's not.  They sell a movie like it's a mainstream popcorn flick to get the butts in the seats, but then many of those butts are understandably pissed that it's not the formulaic comfortable feel-good comedy they were looking for.  This backfires because it creates instant bad word of mouth, rather than the slow, building, good word of mouth that happens when a film isn't hyped the wrong way and is allowed to find its audience.  So sad that the movie business just can't work that way anymore.  If "Chinatown" had come out now, the idiots in the marketing dept would have tried to make the commercials look like "Basic Instinct."  Fools.  As far as the movie goes, it's spectacular. It's a beautiful, dark, little character study.  And I HATED "Juno" and wasn't expecting much from this but was so happily surprised.  Give it a fair chance. Keep in mind that it's not a raunchy, uproarious comedy, and that if you're in the wrong mood the movie can be depressing.  But in the right mood, the movie's like a shot of some damn fine smoky bourbon.
