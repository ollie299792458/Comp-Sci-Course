What's to say? It's episodic, melodramatic, over-wrought, over-done - even over-cast and yet, it's a must. After 4 years of 'holding it back' in A Picture after A Picture, Bette Davis explodes all the nasty, evil, selfish, juicy goodness that only she can truly deliver in a performance Jane Hudson and Margo Channing would applaud. Who makes movies like this? And why? I guess because as it turns out, I'm not the only person who finds this a devilishly guilty pleasure of the highest order. Forget the story, the direction or the men in this film (except Charles Coburn) and sink your teeth into the performances of Davis, De Haviland, Hattie McDaniel and in a superb change-of-pace, Billie Burke. Forget that the film was a gigantic hit in it's original release and garnered much better reviews than I imagined.If you need justification to buy an old movie - it's the earliest film I can think of that deals with modern civil rights issues (although only as a sub-plot - why deal with bigotry when there are husbands to steal???? Run, don't walk to this one. Definitely a Top Ten Bette Davis Film - that's saying a lot considering she did 50 plus films and had 10 Oscar nods.
