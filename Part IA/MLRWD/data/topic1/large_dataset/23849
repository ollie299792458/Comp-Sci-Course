"Keeping the Faith" (2000) is generally regarded as a light comedy romance movie. However, we believe that both Norton and Stiller would argue that "Keeping the Faith" is the suspenseful follow-up to Hitchcock's "I Confess" (1953).

Obviously, Edward Norton is Father Logan (Montgomery Clift's character) who's back on the streets. After the insanity of "I Confess", Logan has changed his name to Father Finn and teamed up with a rogue Rabbi in New York City. Now they've devised a murder plot against a young female executive named Anna Reilly! But she's on to the Rabbi after he starts an electrical fire at a Chinese Karaoke bar in Queens. We must stop here, for to go on would give away too much of the suspenseful plot.

Will Father Finn beat the rap? Can he stop the rogue Rabbi from destroying what's left of Queens before Reilly goes public?! "Keeping the Faith" is a film that we have observed but are unable to officially recommend (Norton's directing debut is well done). We will always believe that it is a sequel to "I Confess".
