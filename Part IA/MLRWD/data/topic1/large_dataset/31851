Despite the obvious limitations inherent to this DVD, this  film "shines" through. Kubrick delivers an absolutely brilliant interpretation of King's novel. The film itself continues to be a personal  cult favorite, but the Kubrick touches should cement this opus in the  pyschological horror hall of fame. Kubrick manages to film at  simultaneously alternative depths. The soundtrack is superb -  excrutiatingly effective. Casting is sublime. Jack 's role requires no  comment: what scene has been more memorable in this actor's entire  repertoire than his axe wielding confrontation with Wendy? Ms. Duvall,  while mildly abrasive, is effective at creating support for Jack as the  anti-protangonist. Danny Lloyd nearly steals the show (if it weren't for  Jack) as the innocently attuned lad who survives the madness. Scatman  Crothers also delivers a memorable performance as Danny's extra-sensory  mentor. This DVD's faults include a lame audio/video duplication and no  option, at least, for the 1:66 to 1 format; nonetheless, I am thrilled to  own this film on DVD and am infintiely pleased with the inclusion of Vivian  Kubrick's "The Making of..." which will prove incredibly  insightful for any Kubrick fan or The Shining fanatic.
