is the closest bottomline I can draw for this film. Made in 1984, This is Spinal Tap is a great mockumentary that shows the rise and fall of a great but imaginary band. It represents bands of all times, and no band at all. Anyone who listens to, or has any vague idea of classic Rock 'n' Roll, would see their parody from The Beatles to Ozzy Osburne at some points in the movie. I particularly love the parody with their early song "Flower People".

The characters are well-developed and realistic (if you're a rocker you may agree with this more =)). They say funny things and do ridiculous actions. Some of the jokes are real close to hitting "dumb" but it gracefully misses. Laughs are inserted everywhere throughout the film, though again, it's better if you know some rock 'n' roll knowledge to get the laughs.

Criterion disc contains an extra of 60-minute cut scenes add alternative "footage" and further completes the story with more laughs. It is long out-of-print but it's the definitive edition of this great movie. Get it if you can. But hey, enough of my yakkin', what'd ya say? Let's boogie!
