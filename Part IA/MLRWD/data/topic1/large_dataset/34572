I will leave the pomposity of the movie critics where it belongs.  This review is that of an ordinary person who has seen the movie many times.  Long before the days of cable TV, this was traditionally shown around Easter on network television.  It is a story of a Roman Tribune who officiates at the crucifixion of Christ, and is transformed by the physical touch of the robe He wore.  Filmed in 1953, it would be done differently today (the same can be said of almost all movies from the 1950's.)  Today's teens will be bored within 5 minutes--given their attention span and need for constant stimulation.  However, if you enjoy historical pieces, in this case Roman civilization in the first century A.D., you will enjoy this movie.  Richard Burton plays the main character, Victor Mature plays Demetrius, his Greek slave.  The story involves Burton's personal inner transformation after overseeing Christ's crucifixion.  Jean Simmons plays his love interest.  Jay Robinson does a great job as the mad Caligula (try to recognize him in a 1992 movie--"Bram Stoker's Dracula").  I found the costumes and sets delightful.  The transfer to DVD is of reasonably good quality and is in widescreen, which I prefer.  The transformation undergone by Burton's character is of course directly related to the Christ and much of the movie relates to the early christians of that time.  Those who are not religious will still find the movie entertaining.  It is not the best acting I've seen Burton do but is acceptable.  Overall, this is a production which can appeal to a wide range of viewers, but those looking for an "American Pie", Teen-Slasher, or "Gladiator" type of movie will be disappointed.  You may also be interested in a movie released a year or two later, "Demetrius and the Gladiators" which is a sequel starring Victor Mature.
