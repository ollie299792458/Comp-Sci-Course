Pros: Beautiful cinematography, great cast, powerful imagery, innovative soundtrack
Cons: Few (very few) scenes have alittle overacting

"I could tell just from the trailer I was going to like this movie. I read some of the book, however, only to the part where the accusation was made against James McAvoy's character, Robbie. I did not want to ruin the movie experience and ending for myself.

The movie was beautifully made, with great and majestic scenery, and the several-minute steedy camera shot through the evacuation camp in Dunkirk. The music is phenominal, something you have not heard yet in an epic or romantic epic. The cast, while few scenes were alittle overexaggerated, was consistantly strong. The most impressive cast member was Saoirse Ronan, the 13 year old Briony Tallis. She was so mature and immature at the same time. The character has an impressive mind, but, also, an imagination that disrupted the lives of people around her.

The ending, (which I will not give away) for someone who has not read the book, is unexpected. The movie, having gone full circle, really encompassed the title 'Atonement' and in what ways a person would go to atone for their actions.

A MUST SEE AND OWN, the soundtrack as well, AND SHOULD HAVE WON MORE THAN THE OSCAR FOR BEST-SCORE."
