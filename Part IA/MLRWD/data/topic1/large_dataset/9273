This film is as valid today as it was when it was first made; perhaps even more so. I used this film in my Sunday School class to portray the issues of fundamentalism and its impact on mainline education and culture.
Though there are some digressions, understandable in movie making, much of the dialogue is right out of the trial transcripts and the characterizations of Darrow (Tracy), Bryan (March) and H.L. Menken (Kelly) are close to the truth.
Contrary to one reviewer, who probably got his information from a fundamentalist/creationist preacher or the popular overweight draft dodger's radio program, Darrow's request for scientific expert testimony was rejected. (See Scope's memoirs as quoted in "Clarence Darrow, The Creation of an American Myth" by Richard Jensen, p 99).
The acting is superb, the directing outstanding, and the script excellent and thought provoking. Thought provoking is the goal of this film and what those still writing these Salem-style laws in the states of the old Confederacy(not to mention the judges of the Kansas Supreme Court) are against.
