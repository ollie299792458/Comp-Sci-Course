How much you like or dislike this movie is, obviously up to YOU.  If you are looking for an Academy Award worthy movie, you won't get it here. However, if you are looking for and hour and a half of fun, fast-paced escape from reality in a movie that has a few plot twists and a medium amount of humor mixed with drama, then I'd seriously consider watching this IF the price is right.

I paid $9.99 to view it.  I over-paid.  It's good, but not $10 worth of good!

Don't look for this movie to tie up loose ends since it's SO unrealistic.  So people who like to analyze movies and get messages from them will be disappointed. I won't go into details since they may be spoilers for some.

The bottom line is what I wrote in the first paragraph. For pure fun, laughs, and some fast-moving, twisting drama, this comes through.  But I doubt it will be a movie you give much thought to 30 minutes after viewing it.
