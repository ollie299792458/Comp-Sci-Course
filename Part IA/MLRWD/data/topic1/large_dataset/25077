Bravo! More often than not, watching a movie after reading the book is a disappointment.  Whether the casting was off, the director failed to translate the story from page to screen, or too many liberties were taken with the plot, movies usually always pale in comparison to the book they were based on.  After watching The Feast of Love, I feel compelled to write a review for a movie that stands apart from the rest.  This is not the typical movie.  Despite the stellar all-star cast, this movie received very little notice in the box office.  For whatever reason, it never even came across my radar.  While reading the book, I felt like the story lines could make a really good movie, so after finishing (and loving) the book, I went out and rented The Feast of Love.  I was (and still am) pleasantly surprised with how great it was.  Chances are, viewers of this movie will be strolling through the video rental aisles and an unfamiliar movie with an all-star cast will catch their eye.  To answer the question running through their minds- you "haven't heard of it" not because it's a bad movie, but because it wasn't a monster big budget film.  The Feast of Love is a hidden treasure- RENT IT!  If you're in the mood for a funny, heartwarming, emotional flick about love and the people whose lives it intertwines; if you like great acting and an overall well made movie, you won't regret renting The Feast of Love. (Note, there is quite a bit of nudity/sex), so this is not one to watch with the kids.
