To the poster GS. The Testament of Dr. Mabuse is not an UFA film! Lang left UFA before he made this movie. This was made by a studio called NERO. Now, the film is undeniably very good. But the actor playing Inspector Lohmann (sp?) in the German version doesn't click enough. He's nowhere as distinct as he should be. He actually gets lost in the movie. Every other actor and actress in this version performs their role extra well. As for the story sorry but it really misses a little as it is way too vague, if not uneven, in too many parts. Like this: Does Mabuse's ghost actually go into the asylum doctor's own body and possess him? Or does the asylum do√ßtor just hallucinate and believe it is possessing him? Based on deailed, empirical evidence the answer is definitely no. But nearly everyone watching will merely be conused. The asylum director has obviously just gone crazy (probably from hanging with loonies like Mabuse too long).What happens exactly in the last scene? The vagueness is irksome. Does the writer of this movie even know?As for the DVD. Problems are easier to discern. 1) The English dubbed version of The Testament of Dr. Mabuse is sadly not fully on the two disc DVD as well. Portions of it are in a DVD documentary, but again not the whole thing. Those who only speak English would have probably enjoyed the option of being to view this without subtitles. 2)The French Version of Mabuse doesn't contain an audio commentary (just the German version does).3)The French version suffers terribly from really bad visual problems too.
