This is without question one of the worst movies I have even seen.

I know---you're saying: "Aw, where's your sense of fun? It's a comedy. You know, it's a parody of spy movies."

Wrong. "Our Man Flint" was a parody of spy movies. "In Like Flint" is a parody of itself---a mindless, talentless puffball of a movie floating along on its predecessor's slipstream.

The producers must've been so high on the first movie's success, they thought they could do no wrong. Or maybe they just flew off on vacation and left everyone to do whatever they wanted. Watching this mess, it's entirely possible.

A ludicrous, unfunny plot (women try to take over the world, then the men who were helping them decide they want to take it over instead, completely invalidating the first premise, zzzzzzzzzzzz...); positively awful dialogue; home-movie-style cinematography (not one creative shot in the whole picture); squirmingly clowny fight sequences; high-school film-class lighting; sets positively cluttered with wooden non-actors; a maddeningly lilting, cloying score that defies anything happening onscreen...

And through the whole thing, there's James Coburn strutting around giving us his "It doesn't matter how bad this movie is, I'm so cool" smirk, like a smarmy lounge singer on the Titanic.

A parody needs some semblance of intelligence, of imagination, of planning, of technical proficiency. Oh, and of humor. This has none of that.

Proclaiming a movie a parody isn't an excuse for plain bad filmmaking. This is just a bad, bad, movie. Bad.
