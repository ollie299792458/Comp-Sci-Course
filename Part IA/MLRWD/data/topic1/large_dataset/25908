I've seen "Grapes of Wrath" many many times, and I bought the DVD to show my grandchildren what life was like and still is for many farmworkers. The Mexican farmworkers also went thru alot of hardships trying to survive and barely exist on what little they earned by harvesting the crops in California, Texas, Idaho, etc. etc.  I show my Grandchildren this film to show the importance of getting an education, so as to break the cycle of living impoverished by working in the fields.  Also, the more education you have, then you can do more to bring about justice to the lives of FarmWorkers by getting involved in making changes, and sometimes taking risks. I lived that life, so I know what I am talking about when I mentioned the hardhsips one had to endure in order to survive! and I enjoyed the way the film is told and Henry Fonda has always been one of my favorite Actors , as well as his daughter Jane Fonda. I recommend this movie to anyone that wishes to understand the plight of the Farmworker, whether they be "Oakies","Mexican",Filipinos", etc.

Its a great !! Movie. This Movie will open your eyes.
