Yes, this movie is as bad as it is reputed to be.  Like one movie critic says, "This cat is a dog."  The elegant cat in Dr Seuss's book is now an obnoxious, offensive character who does every stupid act known to TV history to get a cheap laugh.  So why am I allowing my kids to watch it?  Because I remember when I was young, I watched some dumb show that made me laugh non-stop, until my parents took it away.  It was worthless, they said.  It was; people were throwing pies into each other's faces.  For some reason, that just tickled my little mind and I laughed until my side hurt.  I saw the same show when I was older and could not believe I laughed at such moronic jokes.

I knew my kids would love this show, so against my husband's bidding, I let my 5 and 3 year old watch Mike Myer's performance.  They loved it!  My 5 year old son squealed in delight throughout the show.  Then he watched it again and again, more than he did Finding Nemo, Monster Inc, or any other kids movie I got him.  He also knows the original book by heart, but as I expected, this dumb movie just tickled his brain perfectly.  He rewound the part about the Cat cutting off its tail so many times I lost count.  I have other new cartoons waiting for him to watch, but he just wants to rewatch the Cat movie.  I think this movie is stupid and not funny and has inappropriate adult content (none that kids can understand), but it is doing the best job at making my kids laugh, so I feel like I have to give it a good rating.
