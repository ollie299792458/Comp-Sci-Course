I'm a huge DC Comics fan, with special attention going towards Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps.  Hal Jordan brought the Corps into my reading list way back when, but my favorite GL will always be Guy Gardner.  Enough talk about me though.

WOW!  WOW!!  WOW!!!

The voice casting was really good.  I wish we could have heard more Kilowog though.  Michael Madsen didn't really get a chance to show off his vocal chops in First Flight.

I'm sure the JLU cartoon fans are screaming bloody murder that John Stewart wasn't in the film, but I'm overjoyed they decided to start the GL animated franchise off with Hal Jordan instead of anyone else.  If you don't count Alan Scott, then Hal Jordan was the first human chosen as Green Lantern to patrol the universe after all.

After seeing First Flight at least five times already, I can barely wait for the sequel.  Hopefully, we'll get Sean William Scott to voice Guy Gardner in the followup.  I've rambled enough already, so I'll shut up now.
