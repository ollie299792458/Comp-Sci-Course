El Haj Malik El Shabazz is a personal hero of mine; a man I admire and consider to be a truly great human being.  This might not be anything out of the ordinary were it not for the fact that I am a 45 year old white man with a now deceased Italian Mother who said "he never said anything I didn't agree with".  The Power Of Truth in the words one speaks is an awesome thing.  Upon reading the Autobiography Of Malcolm X in the early 1980's I really couldn't relate to it or understand it until the Spike Lee Movie brought it to life for me in 1992.  As I watched with great interest on the screen what seemed to be even more removed from what I had read in the book I began to realize that I was ignorant of the facts of the Man's life thanks to the media in this country who had only shown me the Pre-Mecca Malcolm, bombarding we paranoid whites with "hate speech" sound bites on black-and-white film, while at the same time totally ignoring the wonderful and inspiring transformation Malcolm underwent on his 1964 trip to The Holy Land.  As I see it, what makes a man great is his capacity for positive change at any cost when the end goal is the welfare of ALL people.  I'm quite sure at his most basic human level, like all of us Malcolm desired to live a long life, but like others before and after he chose the more dangerous and eventually fatal path of exposing to the world the ugliness of American Racism.  We were preaching to South Africa, Cuba and the Belgian Congo about the righteousness of our way of life while we were treating our African American citizens like sub-humans.  After all, all Malcolm was asking for was American Justice for his People, and like others he paid the ultimate price for it, but his legacy vindicates his efforts.
