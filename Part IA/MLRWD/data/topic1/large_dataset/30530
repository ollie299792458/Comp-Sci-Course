Wow harsh reviews, I didnt think it was that bad, yes, the story isnt original and the acting cant be compared to Shakespearean standards, but it did entertain.  
We follow a Selvage vessel, Captained by Donald  Sutherland, and crewed by Jamie Lee as navigator, along with various Deck  hands who become marooned in the eye of a storm, there they find a Research  Vessel lying dead in the water. They soon discover that all is not well  within this seemingly empty Russian ship. this is when the action takes  place.
Jamie Lee our Lead, takes control of a situation developing on  board.  It soon becomes clear that the ship is over run with biomechanical  creatures connected to a Space born lifeform of unknown origin. Jamie is I  suppose our Ripley (from Alien) type character who tries to survive and  battle an unstopable creature who thinks humanity is a virus that needs to  be purged.  There are battles within their group as greed and a desire to  survive and escape becomes opposing goals. 
I thought the action scenes  were suspenseful exciting and not as gorey as some splatter movies out  there, I compare this genre to Mc Donalds you know what your going to get,  its familiar and satisfies that particular urge you get at lunchtime.  So I  hope you dont go in expecting a Gourmet meal because youll be disappointed.  Enjoy anyway!
