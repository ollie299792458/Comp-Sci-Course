Happy Holidays Chasites, here is the all time Christmas classic: Jack Frost ! 
If you think this is the Michael Keaton family friendly piece of crap....... STOP READING HIS REVIEW AND RUN HOME TO THE DISNEY CHANNEL ! For the SERIOUS horror/comedy fans reading this.....get ready ! 
Jack Frost is a norotious serial killer. How notorious you say ? 37 bodies in 11 states notorious ! Good thing he's being taken to be executed right.....WRONG ! When the prison truck collides with a chemical truck.....HELL FREEZES OVER ! 
Killer tomatoes.....Killer condoms.....Killer tounges..all are NOTHING when compared to JACK FROST: THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN ! 
Michael Cooney really delivers with this non-stop, in your face, horror comedy masterpiece ! Scott Macdonald really does a good stone-cold (or should I say snow-cold) B-Side to Evil Ed. Both of those A-Pix titles are probably the best to come for a company deemed the next Troma (trust me, thats a compliment)! Although if you buy Evil Ed, don't get the DVD, it claims to be unrated, but is missing LOTS of scenes. 
Anyway, the non-stop right-down-the-middle horror/comedy style is very similar to Peter Jackson and Pericles Lewnes so if you enjoyed Dead Alive, The Frighteners, Bad Taste, or Redneck Zombies, pick this up.
