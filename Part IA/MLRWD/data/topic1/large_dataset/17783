My daughter turned me onto this movie, which was required watching in her college Italian class.  I was sold when she told me she involuntarily cried a bit in class.  The fact that someone under age 21 could be moved by an old black & white movie in a foreign language sold me.  I'll admit up front that we are an Italian-American family but I don't think you need that ancestry to appreciate this movie.  In its own quiet way, it paints a clear picture of post-WWII Europe -- no food, no jobs, no hope.  When the main character goes to the pawn shop to retrieve his bicycle and you see cavernous rooms full of sheets and other household and personal items that people had to sell in order to survive, it is beyond comprehension for those of us who have grown up in comfort and the relative affulence of the US.  And the little boy in the movie is simply amazing.  He is an old soul occupying a child's body.  Whether he is at his job pumping gas or running around Rome after his father, his little face moves seemlessly from adoration to worry to hurt.  When he is mopping the tears from his face with a handkerchief, I found myself doing the same.  Movies like this should be required viewing so future generations don't lose sight of what happened during the world wars.  When I see all these various "Occupy" groups camped out in public places in major cities around the US, pretending to be roughing it in protest against corporate entities, they are still working their modern conveniences of cell phones, ipads and propane stoves.  Suffering and pain depicted in movies like the Bicycle Thief gives you a whole new perspective on your good fortunes.  A great companion piece to read after watching this movie is the book "Christ in Concrete" -- the timing is off a bit, but it almost picks up where this movie ends in 1931 New York with the flood of immigrants looking for work.  Another thought-provoking piece.
