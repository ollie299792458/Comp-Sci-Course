Take the emotional desperation of "The Killing Fields," the gritty rawness of "The Pianist," the nail-biting intensity of "Black Hawk Down" and place it in a modern "El Norte" context, and you have "Sin Nombre," which is by far the best film I have seen so far this year, and may be the best film I have seen of the journey numerous immigrants embark on every day in search of a better life.

The film traces a young woman's (Sayra) journey from Honduras to America and how she crosses paths with Willy/El Casper, who is fleeing from the brutal Mara Salvatrucha gang. There are many moments of heartbreaking realism like one that takes place at night, where Sayra and her family stay on top of a train (that looks like it is entering a concentration camp out of WWII), not knowing where they are even going or even if the train is running.

The acting is superb on all ends; Gaitan (Sayra) keeps Sayra from being a flat, one-dimensional character. Flores (Willy/El Casper) has a wonderful presence, a brooding coolness that reminds me of a young Steve McQueen. The photography is lush and effortlessly places us on the train; we feel the rain, the heat, and all the different terrains. Also, the music by Marcelo Zavros (like a Nick Cave/Warren Ellis score with its organic use of unique instruments) conveys the melancholy desperation of each and every character, while ominous chords always loom in the background.

I recently saw "Victoria para Chino", a short film made by Fukunaga which chronicles the true tale of a truck full of 80 illegal immigrants who met their fate at the border. It is available on iTunes and I highly recommend it, as it serves as a wonderful precursor to this film. In "Sin Nombre," (the finest first feature I have seen as of recent), Fukunaga has created an uncompromising work of art that will stick with you for a long time.
