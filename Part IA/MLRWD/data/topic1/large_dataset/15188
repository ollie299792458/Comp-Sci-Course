DETOUR (1945) directed by Edgar G. Ulmer
****SPOILERS******

At a running time of 67 minutes this great little "poverty row" noir had the distinction of being the first of its kind to be chosen by the Library of Congress for its National Film Registry.

Poor Al Roberts (Tom Neal) just can't catch a break. He plays piano in a New York dive so that he can scratch together enough money (in his words money is a piece of paper crawling with germs) so that he can get married to his girlfriend Sue (Claudia Drake). But wait! She has dreams of going to Hollywood so she decides to postpone the wedding indefinitely, and off she goes in search of her dreams.

I don't want to give too much away but things just go downhill from there. Either this film is the nightmare of a bum wallowing in self-pity or, if real, this cat is the unluckiest slob in the world. Just when you think his luck couldn't get worse he runs into a trainwreck named Vera (Ann Savage). Undoubtedly the most venal, selfish woman on the planet.

Vera: "Say who do you think you're talking to - a hick? Listen Mister, I been around, and I know a wrong guy when I see one."

Edgar Ulmer slipped into doing poverty row pictures but if you look real hard there are some gems out there. His 1934 movie "The Black Cat" with Karloff and Lugosi is one of my favorite horror films. In 1946 he directed a great film "The Strange Woman" based on a novel by Ben Ames Williams (Leave Her To Heaven). It starred Hedy Lamarr, George Sanders and Lewis Heyward.

Low-rent movie or not, "Detour" contains some dialogue that could serve as the Mantra for all "noir" films:

Al Roberts: "I keep tryin' to forget what happened and wondered what my life would have been like if that car of Haskell's hadn't stopped. But one thing I don't have to wonder about. I know. Someday a car will stop to pick me up that I never thumbed.

Yes -- fate, or some mysterious force can put the finger on you or me for no good reason at all."
