Star Trek "The Original Series" originally aired in the late 1960s but really picked up its base of fans in syndication.

This book is the recount of star William Shatner (Captain James T. Kirk) of how the series came to be, the struggles, the relationships, the victories, and ultimately the cancellation of the series.

Some myths are confirmed while others are completely busted.  The jokes on the set were beyond belief, yet the first TV interracial kiss was a fake.  Did you know that the men of "The Menagerie" were all women?  The book is full of set drawings by Matt Jeffries and first-person interjections by Magel Roddenberry, Nichelle Nicholes, Leonard Nimoy, and many others.  William Shatner is helped by Chris Kreski in telling the tales of the series that broke into frontiers where none had gone before.

The retelling is warm and welcoming, heart-felt and sometimes regretful, and in all respects easy to read and embrace.  It's the first book I've read from cover to cover in over a year and I thoroughly enjoyed it!
