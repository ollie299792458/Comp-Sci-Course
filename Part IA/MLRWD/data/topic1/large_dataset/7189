This is the only review of the "Omega Man" you ever need to read.Yes I am Legend has gained alot of attention in the past 6 months or so but Will Smith can not compare to the super cool Charlton Heston as Robert Neville.The action and pace of this movie is beyond belief.The music(Ron Grainer)is up there with the greatest soundtracks ever put on to film. Scenes to watch for,Neville playing chess as "the family hurls a fireball thru the window Heston politly excuses himself pics up the ifrared and snipes out a few of the family,as he returns to the table he calmly wipes his hands hardly being fazed by the event and says "you move"? The begining of the film is just too cool.About a minute or two into it Neville just cruises L.A. while a "Summers Place" plays on his 8track and as you just start to relax the car comes to a screaching hault and Neville whips out the sterling and blast away at one of the family in a upper window now you know what your in store for.Ive been wanting to remake the Omega man since the early eighties and well its too bad I am Legend fell short of what could of been a action packed once in a life time movie.Can we ever forget the haunting words Mr.Heston always spoke in all his scifi films "Oh my God"?See this movie and Im sure you will also like it better then IAL.You just cant beat Charlton Heston in this film.I will miss him for there will never be another in his class.Hollywood should learn alot from this man but instead they knock him put him down just minutes after he passed.Sad really very pathetic.Enjoy this fim for It is a classic that will live on forever.Cory Wong.
