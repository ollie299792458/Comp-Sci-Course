This documentary is not about disproving evolution and it is not about proving the existence of God.  The documentary attempts to do neither thing.  Similarly, it is not accurate to suggest that Ben Stein is presenting a conspiracy theory.  Rather, this documentary is about the quashing of academic freedom.  It represents, and correctly so, that there is a scientific theory for which there are differences of opinion in the academic community, including well educated scientists from Ivy league schools, but due to the hostile climate regarding the theory, scientists are afraid to raise any question which could be deemed a challenge to the theory, and that those who point to unanswered questions regarding the theory,  are met with the termination of their jobs, rather than a professional open debate as to the potential answers to the question.  Anyone who lives in an allegedly freethinking society should find that disturbing, regardless of your opinion on the theory of evolution, and should disfavor the suppression of open debate. Contrary to the representation of other reviews, Ben Stein specifically states in the documentary that it cannot be said that all proponents of evolution are Nazis.  To put the comment in context, a scientist who was a proponent of evolution stated that evolution would disprove religion leaving only science in its place and would end all wars.  Ben Stein reminded his audience that science, like anything, can be abused by humans, as evidenced by Nazi's inappropriate use of science to murder those deemed inferior.  Any scientist or other person should favor the dissemination of all scientific information and the promotion of open debate, even if the debate involves a minority view to which the individual does not subscribe. It is not about the existence or inexistence of god, but the necessity of academic freedom for the furtherance of a freethinking modern society.
