This was a horrible waste of $9.99 for a "pre-theatrical" rental.  If this movie ever comes out in a theater, I'd be quite shocked more by that than anything in the movie.

It was so stupid and poorly done on all levels, that I watched most of it on FF just to get through it in case somehow all this tied together with something more than the ending it did have.

As someone else aptly put in the title of their review..."This movie sucks".  I agree.

But to each their own.

I've seen several posts praising this movie for being "daring", "innovative", "superb" even.  Did we watch the same movie?!?!  Wow!

Now THAT would be a terrific gimmick...Different movies all under the same title, and a random pick by a computer which one you actually get to see.  This way you'd have to find out how many different ones there are, and then hope you rent enough times to see them all.  I'm fairly certain the movie "Clue" did something like this in the theaters each having different endings of "whodunit".  The DVD shows all the endings the movie actually had.  Now that was a well done fun movie based off of a fun board game.

There ya have it...simple and to the point.  Let's see how many call me names for writing this review?

I guess based on those other reviews we'll all just have to wait until Hollywood finds a well-written horror comic book to make into the next awesome movie.  Why not do a GOOD Vampirella movie since we've got the whole supernatural being thing going hot & heavy with True Blood, Supernatural, The Vampire Diaries, etc., etc.  The original was terrible, but it is a cult classic.  Just sayin'...
