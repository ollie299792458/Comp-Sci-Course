Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?  is an excellent film. The transfer to DVD is top notch.

The bonus feature documentaries are all better than usual.

But it is unforgivable that Warners has used two commentators whose ONLY qualification to comment on this film appears to be that their flaming queens.

They don't know who Dave Willock is (he plays the sisters' father) except to know he was on TV a lot.  (Gee, couldn't they look it up?)  They do not seem to know ANY inside stories or Hollywood history connected with the stars or the film production.

This is a great disservice.  Warners should have hired either people who knew the stars or who took part in the production, or real reviewers, like most classic DVDs have, or a combination of the two.  At least a serious student of the movie who actually did some research would be infinitely better that these 2 birds.  One of their main forms of comment is mentioning that the other one likes more girly films.
