Few feature films can boast this movie's depth and breadth of hot breath. Its first two hours have no action, little plot, less story and are nothing more than Chaplin pontificating about nearly everything, blah, blah, blah. You might find yourself fidgeting for, not just a moment here and there, but every minute of those first two hours. It's dreadful.

But wait, here's the shocker, it's all worth it. Suddenly, after talking at the audience for two hours, Chaplin ends the film with brilliance. Yet, this film's closing scene with Keaton only pays off if you sit through the first two hours leading up to it, so don't rob yourself. In short, there is no scene in any film ever made that betters this one. Being brought to tears of laughter and sadness simultaneously is a rare and luscious experience. And here it works on multiple levels with the scene all at once capping off the film's point while also documenting a very real truth about the lives of Chaplin and Keaton.

The talk about Keaton's best stuff being edited out of this scene is mostly frustrated affection for the brilliance of what the film has. All this wondering about what gems might have been discarded, for all time, is simply a loving embrace of the final scene's wonderful humor and sadness. It's so good that everyone wants more, please, just another few moments of these conflicted, exciting emotions.
