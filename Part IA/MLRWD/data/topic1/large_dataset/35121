My husband brought this DVD home from the video store this weekend.  He sometimes brings home odd things and certainly the title and cover of this DVD were no exception.  I took one look at it, turned up my nose and said "Uggh, I have no interest in seeing this.  What in the world caused you to pick it out?"  He said, "Oh, it's some British movie and it's supposed to be funny." I gave him a good eyeroll.

I actually missed the first 15 minutes of the movie because I wasn't interested in watching it at all, much less being there from the beginning.  Within a minute of sitting down with him though I was laughing hysterically.  So hysterically in fact, that our daughter came in from the next room where she was sitting with headphones on, music blaring in her ears, because she could hear us screaming with laughter.  When she came in to the room, my husband and I were balled up in fits of tearful laughter and couldn't even talk to her.

When the movie was over, all I could say was "Oh - my - gosh!  That was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.  I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe and thought I was going to throw up.  Then I couldn't sleep because I kept laughing.

Of course, it's not a movie you can talk about at the water cooler because people just won't understand why playing with toilet paper, talking to a deceased man's dwarf lover, or walking on a roof naked are funny.  You just have to see it to understand.
