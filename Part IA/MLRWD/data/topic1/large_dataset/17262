There seem to very little competition to good Civil War movies made in the modern day.  Gettysburg is indeed the most famous but yet when it comes to the fighting, I would have to say Glory takes the lead!  Glory is a great movie that captures the nations thoughts and ideas about a black regiment coming to arms to fight for the Union.  It certainly is very accurate to history and follows the path of the 54th Massachusetts from the beginning of muster to near decimation at Fort Wagner. The cast is a wonderfully set group featuring Matthew Broderick,Morgan Freeman and Densel Washington. Each offers excellent acting and Morgan Freeman I would have to say was at his best!  The story is bit off of history as the character Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) was bit off from history as he wasn't as nice or thoughtful to black soldiers as the movie may portray.
Undoubtedly, this movie has the best fighting scenes I've ever seen in a Civil War movie.  The first large scale battle scene at Antietam was absolutely outstanding and deserves a lot of credit as it captured the hostilities of war.  I wished I could have seen more, but the movie wasn't about Antietam, it was about the birth of a new idea in fighting and how black soldiers with odds stacked against them gallantly fought.  5 STARS!
