I ordered "Strapped" based on reviews from others and just received it today.  Having just finished it tonight, I now wish it had been on Blu-Ray, but honestly, once I hit Play, I never until now thought about it.  For the first 10-20 minutes, I thought it was going to be disappointing and be like a B-rated movie.  However, I stuck with it, and became very absorbed by the plot within 30 minutes.  The lead character, Adam, played perfectly by Ben Bonenfant (do watch his great commentary in Features), is a sociopathic hustler (aren't all good hustlers sociopaths?).  He morphs his behavior as he meets one person or group of persons after another in the same building, all to impress them and make some bucks with his good looks and sex.  But surprising and touching events begin to happen along the way.  Some great pulls on heartstrings here.  At the end, I was about in tears.

This movie makes me think of a mashup between "Where The Day Takes You" (compare Dermot Mulroney's character, King, with Ben Bonenfant's character, Adam) with a young attractive man trying to control his life and the movie "Four Rooms," which has multiple stories within one building.

After submitting this review, I am most definitely going to look for more of actor Ben Bonenfant's (I'm now a fan and thanks for playing a gay role, you HANDSOME DUDE :-) and writer/director Joseph Graham's work.  And THANKS to all of you who wrote previous reviews that influenced me to buy this movie.
