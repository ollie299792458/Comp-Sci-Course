Well I've always loved the Sound of Music, since I was a kid. And now finally it's on Blu-ray at last.
As soon as you pop it in (It does take a LONG time to load on my LG BD-390 which in normally fast),
you will notice a HUGE difference from anything you've seen in the past.

This Box Set is very nice. The kids got a kick out of The Hand Painted Music Box included.
Everything else is great too ... Souvenir reprint, Snapshots (Postcards), Hardcover Book.
Very nice presentation when you open it up, and it was shipped in it's own special box
to insure a safe delivery.

One little gripe .. The CD that's included does not match the one being sold individually.
The box says there are 16 tracks, but there's actually 17. The unlisted track is My Favorite Things
which I think is by Lea Michele. On the disc being sold individually there are 24 tracks.
Some are reprise songs, so maybe that doesn't matter, but we are missing Laendler, Entr acte & Finale.
Since this is the Super Box Set, I wish that they had included the full CD as well.
