It was always an event with Grant and Hepburn paired.
This is their third film together.
Sylvia Scarlett, while a cult classic many years after the fact, was a terrible failure at the time. A shame, because the performances of it's leads and the great direction from George Cukor (one of old Hollywoods most underrated geniuses) makes it a delight to watch.

Cukor works his magic here as well, working from a Philip Barry play.
Grand and Hepburn are well cast and work well together as always.
The film itself is in parts, hilariously funny. But as with many of Hepburn's films, has that perfect blend of the comedy with drama as well.
The only downfall of the film is the sorry, simpering actress who plays Julia Seton (sister of Hepburn in the film).

But other than that, an excellent supporting cast help make this a classic, and here, in a superb DVD release, it can be enjoyed over and over.

A much recommended classic, in my humble opinion.
