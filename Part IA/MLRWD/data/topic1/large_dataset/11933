Life Lessons is a story of renowned painter, i.e. far from me.
Life without Zoe is a story of a daughter of super rich, i.e. far from me.
Oedipus Wrecks is a supernatural story that never happens in our daily life, i.e. far from me.

Yes, they're all far from my life, but Life Lessons depicts the loneliness, the egoism, and the great desire for a young woman that is common to, at least, one-tenth, I guess, of all men.  Though not so famous as him, I can feel the big sympathy for such an ego-centric world of a man.

Life Without Zoe is just a simple and flat description of the life of a young girl.  I guess Francis wanted to project his loving feeling to his daughter Sofia onto the film.  But the description is super-superficial.  It's a fairy tale that has nothing to do with me.

Oedipus Wrecks digs up the complex in depth feeling of man toward the mother.  She annoys the grown up boy and the big boy want to leave her but cannot.  Mother is a dominator in the mental world of man.

As a result, I would rate Life Lessons as five stars and Oedipus Wrecks as four stars, but just one star for Life Without Zoe, thus the average of 3.3333333.
