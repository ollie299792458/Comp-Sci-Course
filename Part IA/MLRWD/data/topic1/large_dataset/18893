After seeing (and absolutely loving) Donnie Yen in Hero and Shanghai Knights, I had to have more.  Iron Monkey seemed like a good bet, so I bought it.

WOW.  I hit the jackpot!  Rough and comic unlike the serious and elegant Hero.  Chinese, Chinese, Chinese unlike the Hollywood Jackie Chan Knights.  Plenty of martial arts and good natured humor.  From the corrupt Governor and his many giggling wives to the evil monk who -- opps there go the many giggling wives -- to Master Fox, the heart of gold police chief, all the bad guys are comics.  When the Governor orders that Iron Monkey must be arrested, the police round up an acrobat who jumps like a monkey, a man who sneezes like a monkey, a man selling...someone leans over and whispers, "Don't even say the word Monkey," but he gets nabbed, too.  Even the serious Donnie Yen and Rongguang Yu have a playful chopstick fight over a piece of roasted duck.

For those who love flying, there are many scenes with the beautiful antigravity choreography of Woo-Ping Yuen.  Probably the most lovely is the first, when the Doctor (Iron Monkey) and Miss Orchid (the nurse) go flying around the room to retrieve a stack of papers which has blown out of their hands at the end of a busy day at the clinic.

Although Iron Monkey's father had been killed unjustly and Miss Orchid's son, born of her work as a prostitute slave, dies at birth, in the present tense no one dies which is as it should be with a good old fashioned folk story.  Five stars!
