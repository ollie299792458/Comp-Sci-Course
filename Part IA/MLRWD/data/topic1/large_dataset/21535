This movie, I suppose, has been labeled as a 'teen-movie', but it seems to be one of the better ones, especially since (few?) people have seen it, but if you do not want to rent it, VH1 occasionally plays it, but of course you get some wonderful editing (which just seem to ruin movies, anyone seen Me Myself and Irene on TV?).
The movie takes place in Empire Records, which is essentially your local record store, and, go-figure, has some interesting things going on during the day. Who would have seen that coming?
Anyways, one of the employees, Lucas, is asked to close the store, with simple instructions from the boss, Joe, to just keep his hands off his beer, his cigars, and his drumsticks, and to count the money twice. Well, Lucas finds how Mitch (the top-guy) wants to change Empire to a Music Town franchise. So, Lucas takes the $9,000 from the store and goes to Atlantic City, plays craps, wins the first time, plays a second, and loses it all.
And that sets up the rest of the film.
I won't say anything more about it, because I will wind-up being repetitive, so if you want to see a movie that is actually decent in these years of cinematic [pooh], see Empire Records.
