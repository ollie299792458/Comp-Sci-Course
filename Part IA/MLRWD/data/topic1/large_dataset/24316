One might say that this is the same old Will Smith, but that's really not a bad thing at all. Many people enjoy the smirking, cocky,  confident Will Smith. I too, am a big fan of this type of Will Smith acting. It's quite a joy to watch and entertaining, especially when he nails one-liners or catchphrases.

Action in the movie is surprisingly well done. You'd think CGI wouldn't give you that full action feel, but producers and the crew did a good job meshing real life and CGI together. It was almost flawless, quite realistic really. I loved the intricate details, like the streets, TV segments, futuristic interfaces and items. In the movie, the future doesn't seem too far off. It's just filled with more technology. Values, cultures, etc. seemed to be relatively the same, which was cool.

I found it impressive how well the sound and audio contributed to the movie. With some speakers or headphones, this movie really comes alive because of the impressive use of symphony, music, musical instruments, and many other sounds. The sound alone was thrilling and pulse pounding.

The animation and CGI work of the robots was astounding. I've never seen facial and animated behavior looked so fluid and believable. Even in 2011, the work accomplished in I, Robot still stands as great CGI work.

This movie is great for sci fi enthusiasts, action flick fans, Will Smith fans, and the general alike. There may be some crude jokes, but definitely tolerable.

Check this movie out or watch it again, you'll be in for a fun and thrilling ride every time.
