I have to say that the impact of Heather death in real life made me a deeper fan of this movie and Heather's Work as an actress. Hope God have you in his Glory beautiful...No doubts that first movie it's between my favourites!
The sequel was just as exquisit as the first, improved, tender, unique, most horrifying, a great sucessor for the first one. Carol Anne's gift for purity, her angel, smile and love for her family makes this movie unique.
The creators went far far away with the story showing us why the spirits want Carol Anne and why the house of the Freeling was damned. Great storyline, Taylor and Tangina, great duet.
The 3rd part was too decepointed, they took the most valuable treasure away from Carol Anne, her family. The story get lost in the forgiveness. The cruelty and cold of her aunt and cousin makes a fall down of the basics in the movie. Tangina can't die! She's the only link with Carol Anne background.
Why the Freeling give Carol Anne away from home? Kane played for another actor, all was a fall down of the trilogy. But it's a must....
