I'm usually not one who much enjoys musicals; as result, I waited a while before seeing Dreamgirls. And I have to admit, this film was a pleasant surprise! I must say, Fantasia must be one hell of a vocalist if she beat out Jennifer Hudson to win American Idol because Hudson's performance was huge. It's safe to say, "A star was born." And apparently, there was a since of reciprocity attached to this role because Jennifer Hudson thumped Fantasia to win the role of Effie and the rest as they is history. She became the first African American woman to win an Academy Award (Best Supporting Actress) in her debut appearance (not that race is an issue). Eddie Murphy also turns in the best performance of his career as Jimmy Thunder. It was refreshing to finally see him in something besides an Urkel-like character. Although I did love this film, I have to give it three very strong stars because I think both Beyonce Knowles (although it was a passable performance) and Jamie Foxx were poor choices for their respective characters. I'm not sure Knowles has enough acting experience to pull off poignant performances yet, and Foxx (except for his Ray performance) simply always looks like he's on the verge of telling a joke or making a funny face. With that said, I do recommend adding this film to your library - it's a winner.
