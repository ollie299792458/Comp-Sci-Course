Many of the modern day's horror movies suffers from a very serious problem ....Clishes which means taking some successful elemnts or themes which was implemented in previous successful movies in the past and applying them again , this results in the movie being a very pale copies of the past shiny one , and unfortunately (FearDotCom) is a very clear example on the above lines .
The story focuses on a bizzare website filled with strange images of torture and death , any visitor for this site suffers a deadly bleeding to death within forty eight hours of entering the site , a local Detective (Mike played by Stephen Dorff) teams with one of the staff of Health Department (Terry played by Natascha McElmone) to solve the Mysterious deaths , the blood trail leads them to the Doctor , a strange character used to torture his victims and broadcast the whole process on the Web , and in order find the answer to their questions they have to visit the doomed site themselves , means they have only less than forty eight hours to solve the mystery and save themselves . 
the main problem of the movie aside of the Clishes is the almost unexisting plot , the plot is very tiny , with a very weak building up for events , Stereotype characters which is impossible to care for, dumb characters driving themselves foolishly in the wrong situations and all the other sort of the low qualities of the cheap horror flicks(which in my opinion includes an Unnecessary usage of nudity ).
the casting was satisfying with typical performance from Dorff and McElmone , you really feel their effort to deliver a good performance but unfortunately the movie hasn't helped them , the photography needs to be mentioned here , it really was great and added some value for the movie , the director of the photography ( Christian Sebaldt ) have done a good job in capturing the haunting atmosphere required for this kind of movies , with a good use of colors and shadows and strong scenes of torture made with different techniques , the Director (William Malone who did a commentary for the DVD along with Christian Sebaldt ) tried and tried but with this kind of scripts you can't deliver anything whoever you are .
FearDotCom wasn't really that bad as many reviewers said , it has some good moments with one or two jumping moments but all of that had fade to black like their black website .
