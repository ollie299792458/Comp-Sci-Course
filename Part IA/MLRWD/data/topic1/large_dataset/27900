Thasnk you, Zhayany for the only nongushing, honest review of "Lady Sings the Blues."

It's so right to judge the film first on the word "biography." LSTB is as much a biography of Billie Holiday as the Cary Grant starrer "Night and Day" was of Cole Porter. So much for accuracy as a biography.

Diana Ross has to pull out all stops to get some drama into the most wooden, schlock-inspired piece of pulp fiction [almost to the point of being science fiction] that's visited the screen in decades; that she almost succeeds in satirizing Bette Davis at her worst is NOT a tribute to her acting skills.

The other characters are caricatures of the people they were supposed to be in Holiday's life. Some such as Richard Pryor are playing 10 or 12 such people; Billie Dee Williams plays all her husbands, and none of their portraits are accurate: It's as if the script was a picture of Williams as Dorian Gray and he was the live version of it!

So many of the reviewers on this site open their commentary with words to the effect of "OK, so the picture is not accurate, but it was entertaining!" Concerning Billie Holiday, her records entertain me more than does this claptrap! They are real; they are Billie Holiday. Any semblance between Ms. Holiday, her life, and her voice disappears after the opening credits of this film. Oh, yes, goodie that so many of the "little touches" are there: the flower, her singing slightly off the beat, etc., but they're incidental window dressing. The persona of Billie Holiday is many continents away from this still-life.

Want a biography that tells the story of its subject? Try "Pollack" or "Frida" or "I'll Cry Tomorrow" or "With a Song in My Heart" or even "The Man of a Thousand Faces." If they're not 100% there, they are at least honest efforts! But avoid the wildly fictional LSTB [abbreviations for the tremendously abbreviated, despite its length].
