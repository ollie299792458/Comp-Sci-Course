The soft-focused, noir-esque, 1930s-style retrofuture of "Sky Captain" is a visual feast to behold, unabashedly revelling in obvious influences as Lang's "Metropolis" and B-movies of the 1930s.  Amid some viewers' complaints of underdeveloped characters and dialogue, here's a movie for those us who truly "get it."  Granted, this movie is not for everyone.  But quite frankly, it has a lot of balls.

And dirigibles!  And exploding dirigibles, at that!  And giant robots!  And...

But I digress.  The Question is: Why should you see this movie?  To put it simply, it will be unlike any other movie you've seen recently.  I want to see more movies like this.  I want to see more movies that take chances.

This is a movie for those who enjoy dirigibles, giant robots, ornithopters, dogfights, Manhattan, searchlights, Gwyneth Paltrow's cute over-bite, "larger than life" heros, the German language, mad scientists, industrial complexes, ray guns, dinosaurs, B-movies, film noir, steampunk, Ridley Scott's Los Angeles, the aforementioned "Metropolis", "The Wizard of Oz", Terry Gilliam's "Brazil", China Mieville's New Crobuzon....The point is that this movie takes you somewhere quite different.  "Sky Captain" harkens back to a particular time and particular genre of truly escapist movies.  And plus, the exploding dirigibles were just freakin' cool.
