First of all, I have to apologize because my level of English does not reach to the point where I can trully express how bad this movie is. When I left the theatre I wanted to punch director Alex de la Iglesia's face. I have seen ALL his movies, bought his novel (yes, he wrote one years ago), and I have even meet him personally a couple of times, but this guy's career is going downhill. Each movie is worse than the one before. He started with a masterpiece ("Acci&oacute;n mutante"), then an excelent one ("El d&iacute;a de la bestia-the day of the beast"), then an ok one ("Perdita Durango-Dance with the Devil")...and then we did crap after crap (specially painfully terrible were "The perfect crime" and "800 bullets"). He, however, did another very good one: "La comunidad-common wealth".
But "Balada triste" ("The last circus") should have been called "Cagada triste" (there goes a joke for the Spanich speaking people). It puts Ed Wood films to shame, with a number of mistakes, flaws, and plain nonsense too long to list here.
Anyway, here's a few:
-A hot chick can pick any guy... and chooses a shy, ugly fatso, even when that puts her life at risk
-A guy puts a red-hot iron on his lips...and keep on talking for the rest of the film, like nothing has hapened
-A guy in terrible condition leaves the hospital (?) naked (??), crosses the whole town of Madrid by foot (???) and ends up in the mountains (????) where he ACCIDENTALLY stumbles with the guy who has been looking for revenge for 20 years...and recognizes him (??!!!) even though he was just a boy the last time they saw each other (??!!!)
-A guy puts together some sort of "batcave" out of nowhere and without explanation
-This same guy goes to the movies, and when the film is over, returns to the "batcave" where he has... a copy of that same movie (!!!???).
The scene of the hot lady of the circus, when she's on top of the cross of the Valle de los Caidos, and she HAPPENS to find a EXTREMELY LOOOOONG ribbon she can escape with is just too much.
The film is supposed to be funny, but as I said before, brought violent, revengeful feelings instead.
The worst movie of 2.010, and one of the worst I've seen in my life. And believe me, I watch A LOT of them.
