As a gay man, I have to say the plot of this film takes me back to a time when I first started to find myself and, eventually, came out. "Some things are just hard to say", says Jamie (one of the teenagers in the film), effectively coming out to his mother. I remember saying that or something not unlike it at the time.

Jamie and Ste live next door to each other, and when Ste's father and brother have physically abused him (an ongoing problem), Sandra (Jamie's mother) takes him in for the night, whereupon he and Jamie begin their self-discovery.

Perhaps my favourite scene is when Jamie and Ste are running through the woods together when they finally stop to begin a long, passionate kiss. It always brings tears to my eyes because I feel so happy for them, not to mention deliriously envious.

I think the gay theme of this film is mild enough as to not offend too many people if they are already open to viewing a film covering such a topic. However, some of the language is quite crude - the "C" word appears a number of times. I've read many American reviewers stating they have trouble with the accent so I suspect British TV and films are not widely shown there (perhaps there is little interest). Being Australian I fortunately have no trouble understanding both accent and colloquialisms.

I've seen plenty of gay films before. Most have not had that great a storyline or lasting feeling to them. Beautiful Thing has genuine effects on the emotions, especially if you can relate to the main characters. It is definitely my favourite film in this genre. I just love it!
