Too real was the plot/story. Back then, a single woman single-handedly raising a half dozen kids and trying to keep her sanity at the same time was a common occurrence. Then a man steps into the picture and she's faced with several dilemmas; one question that she's asking herself if she should give the kids a step daddy or not. Although times are tough for her, she still loves her children enough to consider their point of view. And she's faced with the possibility of losing public assistance if she does marry. So true is how the government treat under-privileged people. They don't want you to have too much. One thing I've always wondered was what did a man buying a woman something with his own money have to do with whether or not she qualified for government assistance. I'm so glad those days of social workers showing up at a woman's house and snooping around are gone. That invaded their right to privacy, which to me says their constitutional rights were being violated. And this mess was going on just as recently as the mid-70s. Shows that blacks still haven't gotten THAT far yet.

I vote 4 stars for this movie. Some of the sexual scenes were not necessary. But the characters and plot were real. Loved it!
