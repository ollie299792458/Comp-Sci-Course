I watched this film again after some years, and I am still struck by the artistry of the camera work. This film has also always had an instant comedic appeal for the absolute madcap moments and the bizarre story line that weaves the lives of three women and their crises together. Yet, after a number of viewings and the passage of time, I am more than ever struck by the subtle strength the lead character, Pepa, conveys in a world of machismo. I believe it takes several viewings, or perhaps a little bit more cultural knowledge of Spain than I had before, to understand how subtle this expression of strength and perseverance actually is. This is a sort of subtle protest film, not anything like an outspoken American feminist would create or expect. Instead this film is simple, sincere, and subtle. Under all that simple and wry hilarity is a deep expression of women truly struggling to express themselves, be themselves, and find themselves, in a male dominated society. I believe that it is an excellent film both men and women can appreciate and enjoy.
