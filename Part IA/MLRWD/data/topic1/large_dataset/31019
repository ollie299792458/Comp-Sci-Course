I was stunned to read that as the French New Wave directors began their ascent into the filmmaking business, Henri G. Clouzot denounced several of his works, ie. Les Dioboliques, due to their very public ridicule of his works in the Cahiers du Cinema. Shame on him... He was one of the greatest filmmakers that ever directed a movie. Les Dioboliques was sexy, scary, thrilling and still is a fresh of breath air, even after the new wave has come and departed. Thank goodness! Any more new wave and I would have never found this wonderful film as I would have simply shut the door on french cinema and never look back (there are a minuet few that I have taken a liken to). Although, I do no know what has happened to french cinema, since the New Wave. This story for another time...

Onto the film...

This film is riveting. It is a very intense psychological drama. If you have blood pressure problems or any due to the heart, please beware. As I watched, I had to pause several times to get a grip on myself. Yes I was thrilled and the visual element of this film is breath taking. The actors are more than wonderful owing to the belief that this drama is really taken place and you are on board for this ride. As I do not care for retelling a story that has been told, by other reviewers, my review will end... If you want to be chilled to your bones and see a master at work, I highly recommend this film. For filmmakers and storytellers alike, this is where the real education happens... Enjoy!!!
