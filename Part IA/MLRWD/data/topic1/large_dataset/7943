I ordered this Blu-ray from Acorn because it was listed as the 7 part version (324 min plus bonus features), and available immediately (with free Smiley's People DVD).

The picture is better than the previous six-part DVD release I borrowed from a friend.  I do not have timings on his older DVD.

Because I read so much conflicting information on the six-part vs seven-part versions I recorded all the timings on the new Blu-ray (US version).  IMDB lists the six-part PBS version as 290 minutes and the seven-part UK version as 315 minutes.

The new Blu-ray release is six-parts lasting 322:30 plus bonus features of 11:26 deleted scenes, 29:56 John Irvin interview, and 19:33 John LeCarre interview.
Disc One has Part 1 (51:28), Part 2 ( 54:25), and Part 3 (54:23) for a total of 160:16.
Disc Two has Part 4 (54:23), Part 5 (54:16), and Part 6 (53:35) for a total of 162:14 plus the bonus features.

If the preview at the start of each episode is subtracted, the six parts last 312:33.  I don't know if this is a newly edited version or details beyond the timings.

As all reviewer have mentioned, this is a superb and highly respected series of a great spy novel.  I hope the information listed above will prompt others to explain how this version differs from the earlier broadcasts and DVD versions.
