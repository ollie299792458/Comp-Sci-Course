Everything was very well explained and demonstrated throughout.  I like the progression of drill sets for two reasons.  First you can work through the items in the 15 min set and get them down pat before proceeding to the 30 min set which builds on them, and so on to the 45 min set.  Also, even when you're familiar with and relatively comfortable with all the moves, you can still go back and do a shorter set if you only have limited time on a given day.

The one thing I really did not like was the way Rachel's performance was edited.  The cuts were, as a previous reviewer said, chaotic, and really detracted from her dancing.  Someday, the world must produce a film editor who understands what a bellydance student wants to see in a performance, which is not an overproduced piece that doesn't let you see all the performer's moves.  I'd rather they kept a steady cam on her with a full-body shot throughout, and perhaps threw in a decorative mirror or two into the set so you could see different angles that way.  If a strobe effect is wanted by the performer, Rachel in this case, do it with lighting, not lightning-fast edits.  Then again, that's my preference in general for bellydance performance videos/dvds.
