Let me first preface my review by stating that the Fall of the Roman Empire is a wonderful movie. The cinematography and art direction are gorgeous. Sophia Loren is radiant. Stephen Boyd properly heroic, in spite of the bad blond hair dye. Alec Guinness, James Mason and Christopher Plummer are extraordinary.

No, my one star is not for the movie. It's for the limited edition 3 DVD set. The extras included can not justify its $39.95 price tag. The "extra" DVD (included only in this set) is nothing more than a collection of Encyclopedia Britannica movie shorts on Ancient Rome.

Do you remember those old (16mm) movies you watched in grammar school ? That's what they are. Those old movies. There's nothing new.

Also included are 4x6 replicas of the movie placards and program.

Are they interesting ? Yes, they are fun to look at. Are they worth the price of $39.95 ?

NO ! That's why the 3 volume limited edition set is a rip off !!!

If you are interested in this movie (and it is a good one), buy the 2 DVD  special edition DVD instead. The limited edition set is a waste of money.
