"Problem Child" has made my top ten worst movies list.  How could anybody enjoy it?

"Problem Child" paved the way for Little Monster movies.  In its footsteps would come "Clifford," "The Good Son" and more recently, "Are We There Yet?"  In this genre, children are little sadistic monsters who stop just short of killing their adult supervisors and cackle maniacally.  Usually, these movies are billed as "comedies."  In this one, this kid could have a tea party with Damien from "The Omen" and Samarra from "The Ring."  He's not funny, he's not charming or cute; he's a scary little creature.

Plus, are we supposed to think it's funny that his idol is a serial killer?  That he writes letters to him?  That the serial killer comes to visit and "takes him away," therefore putting him in danger?  That the father proves himself at the end by battling the killer and rescuing the kid?

Horrible, cringe-inducing stuff.  The filmmakers should have had a long discussion before making "Problem Child."
