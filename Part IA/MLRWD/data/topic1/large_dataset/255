After reviewing for 8 years, it seems few films incite me to say much anymore, even those I really like.  Though I ultimately enjoyed A Perfect Getaway, I guess it's one of those rarities that manages to bring out the worst in me.  But, I'll try to keep my criticism brief.

Someone needs to teach the screenwriter that lying to your audience for two thirds of the film and then changing your story does not constitute a plot-twist.  It's just plain lazy writing that disparages the audiences willing suspension of disbelief.  The films direction moves what is ultimately a very trite canard with intrigue, lots of eye-candy, and gory intensity; and it commendably tries to make up for the unfounded absurdity of the plot.  The casting is also absolutely perfect for a story reliant on such blatant misdirection.  And the writing isn't all bad.  There's some fun banter; it just doesn't quite make up for the abuse of trust that befalls the stories plot.

As for the Blu-ray, the presentation is exceptionally crisp and dynamic with a somewhat exaggerated color palete typical of the post production sensibilities of many modern films.  And I didn't detect any distracting ailments of compression.  The inclusion of the theatrical cut seems a little pointless, but it's good to see Universal making the effort.  There wasn't much point to the discs only physical extra, the unscripted original ending, as it's basically the same ending as in both versions of the film, minus the epilogue.

One last word of warning: for any Blu-ray owners with players slower than the PS3 (ie. all older players and many newer ones, including most, if not all, Panasonic players), due to Universal's exploitive use of BD Live for self-promotive advertising, this is a VERY slow loading disc.
