After supporting this trio for over thirty years I have finally had enough of throwing my money away on and endless parade of Live CD's and now DVD's put out more often then studio albums by this Ayn Rand influenced selfish,self indugent trio who sing about living for themselves and ignoring the hypocrisy in coming from a country that has socialist programs to take care of it's citizens (unlike the USA). Yet Rush has capitalized on the USA and here we have them paying homage to the hometown who gave them their start. Well how unselfish of the three of you to acknowledge that the very people who have made you rich (people like me),don't ever deserve a begging hand or someone with a bleeding heart who will only cry out for more.

So keep on living for yourselves,as there is no one more worth living for and keep sucking the money with live albums and DVD's that keep Geddy collecting baseball goodies and Alex purchasing golf courses and I am sure that Neil needs another fleet of BMW's or motorbikes.

After all we are just the working men you claim should just pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and yet spend a whole weeks pay for a concert ticket!

Why don't you all,Take off to the great white north and stay there.
