I am NOT giving ET 1 star based on the quality of the movie. Fantastic 5 star film. Universal's horrible collector's DVD is why I am giving it 1 star.
1. This DVD is not a typical snap case like most DVDs. It is made of cheap cardboard paper that folds, it doesn't snap shut. It has 3 "Security Device Enclosed" stickers on it's top, bottom, and left sides, when you taken them off the cheap cardboard it takes the paint with it and you are left with 3 ugly, paintless, white sides.
2. I bought this movie to see the original theatrial version, as others have stated the CGI ET and walkie talkie cops are pretty lame additions. I got the "Widescreen Collector's Edition", but when I put in my theatrical DVD it was full screen! I want to see ET the way people did in the summer of '82.
3. Universial blatently put in lame promotions of their other movies. One of the "bonus" editions is the theatrical trailer for the Back to the Future Trilogy.
I recommend the film highly, but not the 20th anniversary edition.
