I won't bother to recap the plot of this movie in my review, because many other reviewers have done that quite nicely already. All I will say is that this movie could have been really great. There were lots of scientific theories and deep subject matter in the contents of the story.. There were moments in the script that could have launched this tale into new levels of weird and satanic creepiness.

HOWEVER... the deeper subject matter is a little skimmed over, and the machine that actually allowed Crowley's spirit to possess a University Professor should have been explained in more detail. The story got jumbled after while and we saw too much of reincarneted Crowley just walking around, doing clever swearing and urinating on people. Maybe the writers tried to cram too much into the script by trying to be too deep and blasphemous. But instead of creating a movie that was an attention getter that left an impression.. the end result was a movie that could have been great, but felt rushed, a little shallow in parts, and leaving the viewer waiting for something awesome to happen and it never does. I appreciated parts of this movie and bits of it stuck in my head. But I don't think it was enough to carry the movie over the top.  I will perhaps watch this DVD again some day, because maybe it is like some of those metal albums that grow on you after two or three listens and then you think its superb. And seeing how Bruce Dickenson co-wrote the script.. maybe it is just a just a masterpeice waiting to soak in.
