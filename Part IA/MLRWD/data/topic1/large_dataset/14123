Thanks to other reviews for this item I was aware of both the difference in image quality, what constituted the various "seasons" of this series, and the mismatch in cost of the sets between Amazon US and Amazon Canada.

Having ordered all 4 of the Canadian seasons I can say there's no question the image quality on these sets is terrific.  By getting them through Amazon Canada I got them for a comparable price to the other US sold sets listed on Amazon (and available through Best Buy).  It took maybe an extra week to receive them but this was mostly due to availability so otherwise it was still pretty prompt.

As to the show I am still going through the seasons but Season 1 has been a delight.  Unfortunately the pilot episode is available only on the Season 3 box set.  While it helps to have seen the pilot, if you only want to try out the first season it's not critical to have seen it.  I'm betting though that you will want to see more after the first set so a purchase of both seasons at the same time will not be a bad bet.

If you do buy Season 3 at the same time, this is the only one of the 4 that did not use double sided discs.  For some reason the discs were also very loose meaning all 4 had moved all over the box when it was opened.  So far it doesn't seem to have damaged the discs, but you may want to check them as soon as you receive the package.
