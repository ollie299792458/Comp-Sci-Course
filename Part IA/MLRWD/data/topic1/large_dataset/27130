Sons of Anarchy started off quite strong in its first season. The characters were compelling, the pacing was just right, and the story was focused without ever becoming too convoluted. Season Two abandons all of those positive qualities.

Most characters were developed into solid, well-defined personalities in the first season, only to be completely unraveled in the second. The show has no problem having a player act uncharacteristically if it helps propel an utterly contrived subplot.

The pacing is excrutiating for the majority of the season. Most of the episodes are what would be considered "filler", a litany of subplots with very little impact on the main story other than to extend the season into the finale. The best example of this is the extreme division between Jax and Clay that develops, only to magically disappear towards the end like nothing ever happened. If only all disputes, regardless of their severity, could be resolved with a couple of bro-hugs.

Worst of all is how the story becomes insanely contrived towards the end. There are so many overly complex schemes at play at once that the viewer will be left frustrated by all of the plot threads that he's expected to keep track of. All of it leading up to an unsatisfying, cheap cliffhanger ending that's become all to common in TV series these days.

It's unfortunate that the quality of the first season wasn't carried into the second. With SOA's foundation of strong characters and backstory, it truly had the potential of developing into a long, interesting drama. Instead we're left with a series that trades well-paced and engaging storytelling in exchange for cobbled-together, throwaway narrative.

Just like Sam Crow, this series has lost its way.
