Ah here is a classic movie and you won't looks at bugs the same way. This takes place centuries in the future (23rd century I think) and earth is all under the Federation and in order to become a citizen (have a baby, be a teacher, etc) you have to serve in the military.

You have these three High school students that eventually go off and join the military, and all go into separate branches and you get to see what each one does further along in the story, with Johnny Rico as the main person. The story is put together well, and goes together with the intense fighting with the bugs.

One of the people that did annoy me was Carmen. I didn't like her decisions she made in the move (Carmen spoiler: Tells Johnny she wants to go career and broke up with him, but then goes in for a kiss shortly after with the other football guy in the beginning). It seemed like she had double standards, but in the end this is a movie about killing bugs under an all controlling Big Brother government.

For its time, the graphics are pretty good. I like the shots with the ships in space and the planets, along with the CG bugs. You do notice certain things are pretty outdated, but there are only a few of them so it doesn't take you out that much. The gun fire sounds pretty good, and the bugs remind me of dinosaurs in a way, and the sounds portray that well.

The commentary was interesting to say the least. The director and writer give their insights to the movie, and their ideas on this movie. While it was interesting to get their insight, it got annoying fast how Paul kept calling USA a fascist nation, and even mentioned they it might be fascist that wanting the movie to speed up to war to see action. Also it seems that Paul always talked over Ed, but Ed is a lower talked so maybe he didn't notice him. Besides those things, the insight to how they did some of the shots and the locations they visited was pretty cool. Especially since this is the only way to find out how they did these things.

I recommend picking this movie up since it's a pretty cool movie, and a definite classic. While the commentary and Carmen was annoying at parts, it doesn't take away from the movie itself.
