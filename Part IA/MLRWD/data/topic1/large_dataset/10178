All versions of this movie are great. But the best one in my opinion is the Double Digipack (white box) edition. Like T2 (Ultimate edition) there is an almost endless amount of material on disc 2. More information than you would ever want to know about the movie and its beginnings.

Sadly no DTS, but then again this isn't quite an action thriller. The DD works just fine. I am a big fan of widescreen movies (it's the only way to see the whole picture) but have noticed Cameron shot this movie in Super 35mm film to make the transfers. The widescreen transfer is just like any other movie. But the pan & scan was made directly from the film rather than lopping off the sides of the widescreen print to make a fullscreen. This is why there is a pan & scan version of the movie named: "Cameron approved full screen".

What inspired me to buy this DVD:

1.) I have the "Special Edition" of the movie on Laser Disc. Despite what people think, the quality is almost that of DVD. I liked it so much, I decided instead of moving my LD player around everytime I wanted to see the movie and or extras (because there are so many) that it would just be easier and safer to get it on DVD since it can be more easily transported now that nearly everyone has a DVD player these days.

2.) I had a 30% off coupon for Borders (Amazon does Border's web purchases) so that made it worthwile right there.

This is a classic that I can never get tired of.
