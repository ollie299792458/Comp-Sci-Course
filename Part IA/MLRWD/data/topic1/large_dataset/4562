One major misconception about It's a Wonderful Life is the nature of exactly what it is George Bailey learns that turns him from death.  It's blatantly obvious to us and to him how important he is to Bedford Falls.  We are made increasingly aware of this as the film progresses.  Clarence  the angel in trying to convince George Bailey how important he is to  everyone, exactly misses the point.  What George finally needs to realize  is how important Bedford Falls, his friends, his wife and family are to  him. This is something in all his fantasies of travel and fame he has never  allowed himself to acknowledge.  Home sickness was not an option.  I  believe this one of the main reasons the story of George Bailey is so  powerful. Self sacrifice alone is not enough.
I have also always been  impressed at just how dark all the undercurrents of this film are, despite  the "CapriCorn".  In the end Disaster is averted (for now), but  one imagines Potter will get to keep the money that was the source of  George Bailey's most recent woes, and will remain the threat he ever was.  Attempts to create Light without Dark have spawned the worst kinds of  sentimental trash, but It's a Wonderful Life is decidedly not in that  category.
