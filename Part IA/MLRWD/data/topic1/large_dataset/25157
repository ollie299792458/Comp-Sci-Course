ox Films should not be rewarded for animal cruelty! The horses that died did not die by accident! They died of greed and neglect! I witnessed one of the deaths first hand. I was an extra on the set of Flicka and watched in horror as Fox Films orchestrated a chaotic scene of a wild horse race, terrifying the horses involved, driving them into the stadium wall, all the while the horses were dragging lead ropes behind them. Only someone who didn't care about the horses safety would have allowed such a thing! An idiot could have predicted what happened: A horse tripped on its lead rope and crashed to the ground! As it went down it was kicked in the head and then trampled by other horses. It took the horse five miutes to stop convulsing before it died. When I protested and demanded to know why they allowed such inhumane treatment, I was fired by Fox Films. When I broke the story to the media, Fox offered me $2500 to keep silent!

The cameras were rolling when that horse was killed. Yet Fox lied about how the horse died and then refused to show outtakes to either the media or investigators for the City of Los Angeles! If ever a film warranted being boycotted it is this one! If you would like to know how the story plays out, buy the original My Friend Flicka, made in 1943 without killing or harming a single horse! If you want to reward corporate greed, animal cruelty and arrogance, be sure to buy this DVD!
