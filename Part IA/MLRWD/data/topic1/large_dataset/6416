The plot is good, the acting great, the direction superb. It is an extremely interesting story line, different than most westerns. No usual fights in a saloon etc. Eric Schwieb(sp?) was incredible as the evil one. Tommy Lee Jones portrayal of the father was rich. Most would agree he was the repentent father but no, he was still the selfish man who deserted them years ago, still looking out for number 1. He eventually finds that he cares, in his own backwards way. Cate Blanchett,one of today's greatest actresses is convincing as the distraught but determined mother. The fact that she is a Dr. should speak volumes for those days when women in medicine were rare. The appearance of Val Kilmer was such a waste. It looked to me he was either doing a favor for Ron Howard or vice versa. But the attitude of the soldiers is an important aspect. Great cinematography! Definitely worth buying which is exactly what I am doing. Oh, & the reviewer below (M.Willis), are you sure you watched the same movie? Plenty of supernatural in there to me.
