First,
This was a pretty good movie. It was not as good as the first but much better than the second. For 1.99 it was a good deal.

Second, Do not believe what these other people are saying. Amazon Unbox is a good service. What is so hard about this Mac users? I thought you were supposed to be tech savvy? But if you cannot operate a simple program like Unbox then maybe you should not be using any computers at all! This is very simple. You go to the movie you want, with one click you click rent, and wait for the Unbox to download it and say ready to watch (which takes just a few minutes with my internet connection). When that is done, all you have to do is click PLAY.  VERY SIMPLE. I can teach a five year old how to run this program and yet you keep crying about your ITunes which is a horrible program and sells music and video files that can only be played with MAC software. So why are you complaining that Amazon is doing the same just with Windows? Oh yes, you are okay so long as it works for you, but you through a 2-year-old tantrum if it does not go your way. Get over it. AMAZON UNBOX IS A GREAT SERVICE.

Third, The only thing I would ask Amazon to do in the future is this: I hook my computer up to my TV to watch the movies and TV shows. I would like some HD options and better audio channels. Currently you only get two channel audio. Not bad for rentals, but it I am going to buy it then I want 5.1 audio.
