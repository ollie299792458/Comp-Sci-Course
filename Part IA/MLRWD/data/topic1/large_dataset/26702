Rocky IV is a redemptive Cold War tale of a Soviet citzen named Ivan Drago, who dreams of being a professional boxer. As the Soviet Union was a Communist state, there was no professional sports per se; rather, athletes were considered another worker in the Soviet "workers and peasants paradise." Thus the boxer finds himself to be Captain Ivan Drago, a boxer cum professional soldier. Drago's passion for boxing is subsumed by the Soviet government's need to use him as a poster boy for the Marxist-Leninist dialectic.

It is within this context that the Soviet state sets Drago up for a fight against the US boxing champion, Rocky Balboa. With brilliant imagery, the Cold War is distilled to its symbolic essence as a heavyweight prize fight. As viewers, we know that Drago will lose the boxing match--the same as we know that the Soviet Union will ultimately collapse under its own inability to provide for the aspirations of its citizens.

For the 91 minutes of Rocky IV, we find ourselves torn between rooting for the American Rocky Balboa and the Soviet Drago. As the fight progresses, we see the spark of humanity in Drago's eyes as he fights not just to defeat Rocky, but to hold on to his dreams of boxing glory.

It is interesting that most fans of the Rocky franchise can quote Drago's line "I must break you." But much more fitting is Drago's line spoken to Rocky in the middle of the ring, before the final round: "To the end." With this dialogue we see past the Cold War hysteria to view a transcendent Ivan Drago who is fighting not to prove Soviet doctrine, but to assert his own place in humanity.
