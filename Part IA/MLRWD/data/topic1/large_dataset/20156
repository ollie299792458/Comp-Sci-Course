I can't tell you how great it is to finally read wonderful things about the feature film "MAME" and Lucille Ball.  I have been praising this film for such a long time that I got to thinking that I was alone in  my admiration for the film.  I love Lucille Ball but that is not the only  reason I love "MAME".  The whole cast makes the film a joy to  watch.  Bea Arthur and Lucy share an on-screen chemistry that is pretty  hard to beat.  The film is really a treat and I think if you can get past  the fact that Miss Ball's singing voice wasn't great then you will  absolutely love the songs.  I really liked her singing voice and when I was  10 years old when the film came out in 1974 I remember buying the  soundtrack and listening to it over and over.  When you watch  "MAME" don't expect to see Lucy Ricardo because you won't.  What  you will see is one of the most talented actresses in history giving a  really incredible performance.  It still baffles me that some people still  make unkind and hateful remarks about Lucille Ball in regards to  "MAME".  I will  never understand it but if you have never seen  the film and are wondering if you will enjoy it...trust me, you will love  it!  Some other great videos for sale with Lucille Ball are "Stage  Door", "The Big Street", "Sorrowful Jones",  "Facts of Life" and "Yours, Mine and Ours".  Again, if  you haven't seen "MAME" then you are missing a very magical and  wonderful film.
