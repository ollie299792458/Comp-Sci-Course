The Japanese audio track and English subtitles actually play out a shade better than the English dubbed version, but the English dubbed version is still very good==  this combines elements of time travel, alternate reality, and Alien Invaders with shape shifting mechanical fighting devices, something like taking elements of several science-fiction and fantasy stories to blend it into one pretty good "a whole lot less money spent than it looks like on the screen" action movie.

The spoilers would include the advertised fact it is science-fiction, time travel, and Aliens Attacking Earth (all in caps) with a totally unprepared young woman as the ultimate hero of a battle to save our world.

The actors are well chosen, and when you watch the DVD extras it only makes you realize how good they are-- there was almost no wire work, and the impossible leaps are shown in the practice sessions so you can see how they did them.

Okay, it may not be the best movie of this kind ever made, but even if the movie isn't a world beater, the DVD extras are worth the cost as you get to see how they made X yen look like X time ten yen on the screen.
