A magnificent film, fragile and delicate as a paper lantern. It seems to be a gentle story about parents and children, but there are undertones of something deeper. The fixed camera, so low to the floor as to keep the ceiling constantly in view, would at first glance appear to be a regression to the earliest days of cinema, when directors were still locked into the structure of a stage play. But Ozu frequently reverses the angle of the view, deliberately and jarringly cutting across the line of action... and so the stage becomes a box. Almost unbearably claustrophobic, the confined visual composition (even in the exteriors) gives us the constant impression of being smothered. Throw in the occasional (but never heavy-handed) references to American culture, and the message is complete.

However, I hasten to add, I'm a bit puzzled by this film's inclusion on so many short lists of the greatest movies of all time. There is plenty of room for disagreement on this. I'm sorry to see some reviewers are not able to voice an honest opinion, without being bombarded with ridicule. I doubt that is what the director would have wanted.
