This review is not for the movie itself but for the Blu Ray quality.  I first watched this movie as a kid 23 years ago on TV and was instantly hooked.  I have since owned the VHS and DVD versions of the film and have watched them repeatedly many times over the years.  I decided to purchase the blu ray version after reading all the positive reviews about the excellent video and audio quality.  Before buying the movie I had to decide whether I wanted to get the much more expensive 3-disc edition or the less pricey 2-disc edition.  From my perspective, I only cared about the movie and didnt really need all the extras so the 2 disc edition was perfect for me.  I was very happy to find that this edition also includes Apocalypse Redux and the extra disc contains a bunch of special features.  So not only did I save a ton of money buying the 2 disc version but I still got some good bonus material on top of that!  As for the video and audio quality, all I can say is hats off to whoever supervised the blu ray transfer.  It is truly a masterpiece and the movie has never looked and sounded better.  If you are in any way a fan of this movie and don't own a blu ray player its almost worth buying a blu ray player just so you can enjoy this film in high definition glory.  I have a mid-range home theater system with high def video and audio setup so the boost in quality was huge for me when compared to the DVD version.  This blu ray version is highly recommended for older fans of the film as well as anyone who has never seen the movie before.
