Ok so here goes nothing. I am a big fan of godzilla. most people love him or hate him, or think hes just a big pile of cheese. while yes the films can get cheesey and have over simple and over the top plots, godzilla has always been fun. Accept for Gojira witch to me is more of a tear jerking horror movie more like grave of the fire flies meets king kong. So loving the big G i made my dad take me to see this opening day at our local theatre. I was 9 years old and i was waiting to see him mess up tokyo, not seeing any preveiws. I was ok with it being new york, i love that town and it shocked me to see it get the S@#T kicked out of it. Then we see godzilla, for me being nine i should have loved the t-rex look, but i  wanted godzilla. I would watch this movie allot on video cause this is the only G movie my father liked. i hated it for years cause to me it was not godzilla. But looking back as i am no 20, i have this in my dvd collection. It does take in allot of aspects of other g films. it is kind of close to the original american release of king of the monsters, and 1985. and has aspects of other monster films the beast from 20,000 fathoms. But this is a good movie, its fun, its action packed. and it could have been godzilla, but its just zilla. its a good movie and fun. i love it and i love all the other godzilla films, i have em all on dvd, three of em i own on region 3 cause america hasnt released any copys yet. that being said this is a good movie and worth the price. the features are just good, better than others worse than others, but its sounds and looks great. get it and eat allot of popcorn cause thats what this is. its a popcorn movie.
