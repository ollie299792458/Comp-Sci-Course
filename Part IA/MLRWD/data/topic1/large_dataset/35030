Why do people pan a movie so harshly when they haven't even seen it yet?  I have seen VAN HELSING in an audience preview, and I will tell you that the trailer doesn't come close to describing the film.  As the Universal folks said, the special effects weren't finished in time for the trailer... but the final product is absolutely stunning.  
No, critics will probably not like this fun romp through Van Helsing's monster adventures.  It might not win an Academy Award for its script.  But if you liked The Mummy or other epic adventures of its type, you ARE going to be the right audience for VAN HELSING.
This movie is just plain fun.  The story pays homage to the classic monster legacy films in Universal's vault, as well as many modern day adventures.  Van Helsing is a James Bond character of dark Transylvania.  And his battles against Dracula are a roller coaster ride with non-stop action and vivid, beautiful scenery.
If you're an art film snob or the type who overanalyzes everything, forget about VAN HELSING.  You've missed the entire point -- badly -- and you'll spoil all the fun.  If you like the occasional mindless, delicious, sit-back-and-hold-on entertainment, this is your kind of movie.
