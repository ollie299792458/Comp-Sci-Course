Will Drive Angry win a Best Picture Oscar? I hope not.  Did this movie touch my inner humanity, causing me to expand my intellectual and emotional horizon? If it did, I didn't notice.  But as an avid movie goer, did Drive Angry meet or exceed my expectations? Absolutely.

Drive Angry has all the following characteristics of a B-Movie:

1.) Nicholas Cage is in it.
2.) A very attractive Amber Heard displays a delightful quantity of cleavage and leg on the movie poster.
3.) The title is reminiscent of Golden Age pulp fiction.
4.) The plot involves a backwoods cult, the Devil's emissary, and an escapee from Hell.

When you're awake at 2:00 in the morning and fending off sobriety, this is the kind of movie you hope to find on Cinemax or HBO.  Unfortunately, while many B-Movies sound full of promise, their entertainment value ultimately collapses under the weight of bad acting, a low budget, a very annoying script, and even more annoying plot holes and dialog.  Does Drive Angry have these same shortcomings? Sure.  Did they stop the movie from being entertaining? Hell no! Do I have too many rhetorical questions in an Amazon movie review? Of course.

While Drive Angry is no Evil Dead or Army of Darkness, it's the most recent movie I've seen, that captures the heart and feel of that genre for many years.  Plus, you get to see Nicholas Cage drink beer from a skull.  Five Stars!
