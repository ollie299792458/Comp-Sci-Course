This film got me going for quite a while. I have a positive view towards passion. I also think that, passion being rare and men being inept, there may be a lack of fulfillment in many lives. In this film, the hero serves as a member of the English Parliament. He is close to power but does not relish the tedious nature of his work. He loves the comforts of the family but does not relish the family life either. The wife is there just like the daughter or the son is there. No element of surprise: all is tedious and monotonous. The woman who finds his emptiness compelling had to be a damgaed figure. She is the one who had spilled out the word damage. In this damaged woman, the political man seeks sexual fulfillment. In this sexual fulfillment, the man is altered. The fulfillment has not come to him like a liberation. It has come to him like a curse. He is at the end destroyed and yet with no regret. The destruction of the man shows the depth of unfulfillment in a happy married life. Now I look at every married man and look for Louis Malle hero's expressions. I still view passion as something very grand and also confirm Louis Malle's view that passion has nothing to do with the damaged figures.
