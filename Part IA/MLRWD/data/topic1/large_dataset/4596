I never got to see this film upon it's initial release, however I felt it's shock waves even at the tender age of 7.  It's the type of film a young lad would sell his entire comic collection to see based on the hype alone.  (Not ulike THE EXORCIST whose hype was still being felt upon this features release.)  I did however develop an irriational fear of going into the water for fear of becoming DEVOURED, and I had, at the time, never even seen the movie!  JAWS works on so many levels, that it apeals to ANYONE who loves movies. "Classic", "Thrilling", "The First Blockbuster", "Jaw Dropping"; and GENUINELY SCARY, are terms rightfuly aplied to this 5 STAR FILM.  I agree. This movie inspires awe the first time as well as the 20th time viewed. John Williams score is simple and sublime. It's all been said before, perhaps more elequenty than me, But JAWS ROCKS!  P.S. "I'll never wear a lifejacket again." Jaws Gets 5 Stars because, it is in fact, a flawless film. P.S.S. If you say the shark looks fake...Think again.
