Peltier is an otherwise forgettable Native American activist who ought to be grateful for the fame his incarceration has brought him through the years.  Clearly, his voice prior to Pine Ridge has been amplified a million fold since Pine Ridge.  Do I think he's innocent?  No.  Do I think he's guilty?  Probably.  Yeah, maybe he is "innocent" of the murders themselves, but sometimes if you're standing close to the burning building, and the fire marshall sees you with matches in your hands and the smell of petrol on your clothes, you're liable to go down for arson.  Perhaps you didn't in fact burn the building, but man, what the hell are you doing there with matches and gasoline?  Such is the Peltier case, and the politics and heated emotion surrounding this case make it almost impossible to examine impartially.  Many cry that this is just another example of big bad government sticking it to the Indians.  I'm not so sure.  As Lincoln said of militant abolitionist John Brown, there can be no excuse for murder and treason, no matter how just the cause might be.  If we forgive a guilty Peltier (or Abu-Jamal for that matter) of his crimes simply because we are sympathetic to his cause, what does that say about us, or our dedication to a just America?
