I have to agree with other users in saying that Donny does portray a great Joseph.  However I've never heard a weaker performance by a narrator.  For a true treat to the ears check out the cast recording starring Michael Damian and Kelli Rabke.  Kelli puts out the best performance as the narrator in this recording that i've ever heard.  I've watched the video, listened to many of the cast recordings and seen the show live countless times and none of the performances stand out in my mind as beautifully as Rabke's and Osmand's.  What a treat it would be to see and hear the two of them together instead of the weak performance of the narrator in this video.  I have to give the video five stars for creativity though.  Recording the show as a performance to a grade school was a great way to easilly incorperate the children's chorus without them looking out of place or loosing screen time in the shadows of the stars.
Overall the video is well worth seeing especially as a precurrser to seeing the live show.
