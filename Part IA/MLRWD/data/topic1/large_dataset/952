I am a fan of Night of Dark Shadows.  Always have been since I first saw it on TV probably in the early 80's.  It is especially a good movie to watch during a dreary rainy afternoon.  I give it 4 stars and not 5 only because it is not quite as good a movie as House of Dark Shadows.  I have been waiting for these two movies to be released on Blu- ray/DVD for years (I have both the Laserdisc and VHS versions.) I was saddened to read that this does not include the cut footage, but I still like this movie anyway.  Maybe someday there will be a restored version released.  I love the cover art to both movies, House having a red tint and Night having a blue tint with beautiful Collinwood in the background, but how can this movie be released without having Angelique on the front cover?  Lara Parker was never more beautiful than in this movie and she should be front and center on the cover.  Big mistake!  I think the back cover has Angelique in the background, but I could be mistaken, because that isn't what she looks like in this movie.  Anyway, I'm very much looking forward to this movie being released.
