For those who think that they haven't seen "Time Bandits": you're probably wrong. I was surprised at how many of the scenes I remembered and remembered loving: Robin Hood misenterpreting the gang's spoils as a gift for the poor, teaching the monster that stretching can help his bad back, little people and a small child hanging in cages over infinite blackness in the dungeon of Evil, and the final military confrontation with Evil in his weird red outfit and hat/helmet. Terry Gilliam has a way with fantasy and a way with humor not to be matched. Nothing that happens is ever expected, the humor's always a bit odd, and all the while the magic of the story and its varied fantastic settings leaves the viewer spellbound. "Time Bandits" is fun for kids and even more fun for twisted, cynical adults.
Follow "Time Bandits" with a quick hit of "Brazil" and then a viewing of "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen." Terry Gilliam calls the three his dream trilogy, and I must say that those three films are better than any trilogy that George Lucas has yet made or plans to make. The movies leave a person with the feeling of being in an off-center waking dream, and when the ending credits are reached the disappointment of losing that little fantasy world is palpable. Gilliam is a master of the craft of film-making.
