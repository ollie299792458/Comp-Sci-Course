As others have commented, this movie was extremely pc in including actual special olympics athletes and mentally/ physically handicapped actors in the film.  What most people seem to be overlooking here, when slamming Johnny Knoxville's completely unconvincing performance as a mentally handicapped man is that that is how the script was wrote.  It's part of the fun of the movie, the only ones smart enough to figure out that he's not really mentally handicapped are the ones that he's there to compete against.

All of that aside, Johnny Knoxville is his usual comedic best with the physical slapstick comedy in this film, be it falling from ladders, or in the late night 'training' sessions his new athlete friends put him through.  The romance is a little forced and feels kind of thrown in to appeal to the chick flick crowd, but it still works all right in the film.  Truly, the best part of this film is those showcasing the mentally challenged actors who almost completely steal the show, the funniest dialogue seems to have been reserved for them and they perform it beautifully.

To sum it up, if you're just looking for some not too serious fun to pass the time then I highly recommend this film.  If you're looking for something art house or dramatic, well then, you probably aren't reading this review anyway so it's not important.
