Resident Evil is a stylish ride, a battle between the festering evil let loose inside the Hive, a high-security Umbrella Corporation research facility; the Hive's system defenses; and the few, the unlucky few, the terminally unhappy few trapped in the Hive who need to go in to discover what has gone wrong and then find a way out...
I can't attest to its faithfulness in translating the video game franchise to film.  It does succeed in being attractive, stylish.  Michelle Rodriguez (seen on the cover next to Jovovich) rocked, giving one of those performances that will make you remember her name and look for her elsewhere.  Milla Jovovich delivered, refashioning herself again so that she looked nothing like she did in The Messenger or Fifth Element, balancing her character's vulnerability with ferocity and sex appeal.  The male characters were, for the most part, short-lived and forgettable.  Not that they gave poor performances, just that they were (mostly) supporting roles that doubled as h'ors-douvres.
The special effects were good.  The computer controlling the Hive 's defenses -- The Red Queen, seen in the trailer -- made a good character in the movie.  Resident Evil made good use of the state of the art for 2002-3.  The music melted into the movie, adding to the action sequences without otherwise interrupting the flow.  Action sequences were nicely choreographed.
Resident Evil works.  It goes up, it goes down, it goes around and around and comes out ... and then you see the trailer for the next installment (the cosmetic ad) and you line up for the ride all over again.
