I cant doubt it: this is one of the most must have movies that anyone could buy, even more on blu ray format. However the Question is: Whats Wrong Between Disney and Latin Fans? just simple to explain the question: Pinocchio for example, included the blu ray format movie and a digital copy on DVD. DVD had spanish language track, but Blu ray. Same for Sleeping Beauty. Also, the bonus features do include subtitles, and even games include spanish track. Taking the fact that bluy ray format was meant to be the same for Canada, USA and all latinamerica *and not DVD*, why disney is excluding Spanish Language Track, even when they did have the sources to include it on DVD? as far as i know, A Bug's Life wont include Spanish Language Track, just as they did for DVD before. I don`t think it is for business reasons, or to protect the latinamerica market. I just hope they include in this fantastic movie all the sources they can include, to make bluy ray disc "A" region, just what it was meant to be: A Global Choice for all the Americas.
