This was by far one of my favorite movies as a kid, and I still catch it as often as I can on satellite.  The story line is faithful to the plot of the classic novel, albeit being updated to reflect the world of the early 1950s.

The acting is pretty good overall.  Dr., Forrester's character is ably played, as is his love interest Sylvia and her kindly old uncle the Reverend.  There is a powerful if somewhat melodramatic scene where the minister tries to make friendly contact with the Martians, with less than wonderful results.  The last 20 minutes will keep you glued to your seat - very good use of dramatic climax.

The special effects are quite simply fantastic, especially given that the movie was made in 1953.  The Martian war machines, updated with force fields and flying ability, look quite realistic.  The destruction of Los Angeles, the scenes inside the churches, and the shots of Dr. Forrester searching the ruined city for Sylvia are all very good.  The sound effects (death rays, etc.) are chilling.  There are even a couple of parts where we get to see the Martians outside their war machines.  They are reminiscent of reptiles, which increases the sense of them being totally alien to us.

All in all, this film is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. It entertains and even makes you think a little.  Makes a great triple feature with "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers."  Get some soda and popcorn and curl up for a classic SF treat.
