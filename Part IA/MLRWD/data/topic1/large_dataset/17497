One of the best love stories of the twentieth century. This was originally just a low budget film produced by Warner Bros in the 1940's, and wasn't expected to do too well at the box office.
  This is the one film that Humphrey Bogart starred in with Ingrid Bergman, but together they light up the screen like no other screen couple has since. He is Rick Blane, he owns a nightspot in Casablanca called Rick's Cafe ( the original title of this movie was 'Everybody Comes To Rick's'). Rick spends most of his time running his saloon, or sitting in the dark drinking bourbon and dreaming of memories past. Into all of this comes Ilsa Lundt, a woman he fell in love with in Paris, but who mysteriously stood him up at the train station when they had planned to elope.
Rick has never laid eyes on her since that day when his insides had been kicked out, but here she is again in the company of Victor Lazlo, a freedom fighter considered an enemy of the Nazis. And they have come to Casablanca seeking safe passage to America, and Rick may be the only one who can help. But will he let his feelings for Ilsa (feelings he has long denied having)interfere with what is best for the woman he loves?
This is a standout classic not just for some of it's lines "We'll always have Paris", or Dooley Wilson's dulcet tones crooning 'As Time Goes By' just for the two star crossed love birds. But also for the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman who lights up the screen each time she walks on, or for the brooding Humphrey Bogart as he cries into his bourbon for his torn heart. This film will certainly prove that sometimes you just have to let love go, that sometimes even though it feels right, you just have to say "We'll always have (fill in the blank)' A film not to be missed.
