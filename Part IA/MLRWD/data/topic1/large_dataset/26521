I don't do loooong reviews, so here is the short and sweet:  The movie is a decent sequel, but still falls short of the original.  Most people seem to agree that the early demise of Marie is dissappointing, to say the least.  And about the most notable feature of the rest of the film is that it really isn't notable.

If I had never read the actual novel by Ludlum, I probably wouldn't have been as let down by this film.  The beauty of the books is the fact that they each have their own plot-line while simultaneously revolving around Jason Bourne/David Web's rivalry with Carlos "The Jackal."  This film actually has NOTHING to do with the actual novel, having only used it's title (as was admitted by the filmmakers).  For instance, in the book, instead of being killed of early, Marie actually has a whole plotline that revolves around here exclusively, and in the end nearly single-handedly saves Jason/David's life.  Ummmm... just a tad different than we saw on the screen.  Too bad...  the plots of Ludlum's novels were awesome, and would have really translated well to the big screen.  As it is, they fall far short.

It's been a gorgeous summer.  My suggestion... skip sitting inside wasting 2 hours of your time.  Grab the novel, head outside, soak up some rays, and enjoy a great read!
