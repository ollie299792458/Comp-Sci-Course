Well, Wes Craven has obviously turned his back on devoted horror fans in order to bank off of loser thirteen year olds.  I'm not just talking about the PG-13 rating, in fact I thought the film was bloody enough to get an R rating. Not because it was overly gory by any means, but just because the MPAA might look unfavoriably on any film by a man like Wes Craven.  Oh wait! That's right! he's sold out and is working for the same Nazis that run the whole hollywood riech!

I know what your thinking, "another underground cult cinema gorehound is trashing  us common folk who like to dabble occasionaly in the genre of horror just for a cheap thrill."  Well that's true, but even with that aside, this is just a terrible film.  The characters? who cares.  There are only about four that exist in the film for more than thirty minutes,  and you don't even care because the time that should haver been spent developing these characters is devoted to making use of enough computer generated effects too make you think your watching a 50 minute cartoon spliced into a film.  And wow, who would have thought that it was the boyfriend all along. I think Wes Craven deep down in his heart just wants to go direct episodes of Dawson's creek and The O.C.  This is just his transition period.
