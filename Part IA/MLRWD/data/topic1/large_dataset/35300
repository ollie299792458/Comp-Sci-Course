I finally decided to buy this because Amazon had a great price on the blu ray. I waited until now to get this movie because of all the bad reviews. I wanted to go see it in the theater but the reviews scared me. I had the impression from the reviews that it was a really low budget movie filmed with video cameras. This is definitely not the case. The characters in the movie are the ones with the video cameras.. lol .. The characters in the movie are actually filming the events that unfold here. The way it is filmed does not bother me like it did other people that gave it unfavorable reviews. What I like is that it starts back in the beginning. Right when the original zombie outbreak occurs. So people don't really know what's going on yet. It's definitely got George Romero written all over it. I really enjoyed this movie. It goes well with all the other George A. Romero stuff. I am glad I finally watched it and bought it for my collection. Yes, it's filmed different that the other movies, but I am pleased with the way George made a "different" film than all the others. There are a few surprises that I liked as well. I won't spoil it for you, but George has always had unique ways for the Zombies to get killed. Take the helicopter blade to the head part in "Dawn of the Dead" for instance. Well, let's just say that in this movie there is a scene that equals or betters that scene. It will shock you if you don't know about it, and to my knowledge it's never been done in another zombie film. Thanks for another great "Dead" movie George!! Oh, and it looks and sounds great on blu ray! I give it 4 and 1/2 stars and one half extra to help balance the bad reviews for people who really understand what kind of film George was trying to make.
