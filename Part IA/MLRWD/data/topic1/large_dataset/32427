Kareshi Kanojyo no Jijyou (the lengthy Japanese title) is one of the most truthful looks at high school and teenage life I have ever seen. The characters aren't perfect: they worry about grades, parents, relationships, and they're self-conscious. Studio Gainax (Evangelion, Nadia) adds a new drop to the shoujo formula, blending character developement and experimenting with different styles to present this genre. And surprise! It works wonderfully! Instead of providing just the female or male's perspective, they show both. Some episodes are devoted to one character, giving them a in-depth explanation as to why they act the way they do. An excellent example is Shibahime Tsubasa, a petite cutie pie of a girl with a bad attitude. The problems she has with her family present a clear look at her other side. As the episodes progress, you begin to notice how each person matures into something they wish to be, not putting up a facade and throwing away their mask. The message of this Japanese anime is clear: be yourself for your own true happiness. This is reinforced through beautifully-drawn manga stills, cut-up paper dolls, and super deformity. Gainax has succeeded yet again in creating a thoughtful anime enjoyable for everyone. Sadly, there will be no more episodes (26 was the last) due to conflicts with the manga author Tsuda Masami. However this classic is not to be missed.
