I watched this movie for the first time while surfing through my HD Channels.  But I'll admit that I wasn't interested in watching this movie when it was first released or any other time it was available on premium channels.  However, more recently I have become more intrigued by Brad Pitt and it's probably because of all the current media hype he's recently received as half of the hottest Hollywood couple.  Aside from wanting to see more of Brad and his acting, the picture quality was quite amazing and enough to get me into the movie.  Each scene was like still life photography.  From the rooms of the Parrish mansion to the boardroom, the color and tone of the set was just beautiful.  Even some of the elements such as the cake samples were unique and colorful and lend such timelessness to this film.  Although the sound editing put me and my remote to work with its highs (Music) and lows (Voice), the video quality fared much better as HD made for some wonderful viewing, especially of Brad.  The early scene of Brad's freak pedestrian accident was so unfortunate, but convincing enough to link him to his Death character.  I anticipated every scene and found some scenes and acting a bit quirky (peanut butter), while other scenes, particularly the intimate one, simply enthralling.  Needless to say, I became a willing hostage up to the party scene, at which time I had to pull myself away for another urgent commitment.  However, I will have to savor the rest and probably the best parts of the film for when I purchase the DVD.  I really look forward to viewing it again from beginning and to the very end.
