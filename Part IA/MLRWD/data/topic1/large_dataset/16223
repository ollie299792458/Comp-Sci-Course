Any normal understanding of redemption is the necessary implication that something of equal value is to be exchanged to acquire the object sought, e.g., a mortgage is redeemed by paying it off with an amount of money equal to the mortgage's value.  Writing two kiddie books that sell in the triple digits and single digits respectively doesn't quite make up for shotgunning four people in the back, at least to me.  Particularly when you deny you actually committed the crime.  But maybe I'm the one whose values are out of whack.  However, when your own life is taken, that does seem to even up the score somewhat.  I'd certainly say Mr. Williams has achieved much more toward paying off his psychic debt to Albert Lewis Owens, Thsai-Shai, Yen-I-Yang and Yee Chen Lin by being put to death than if he written another kiddie book or given another 60 Minutes interview.

As for the movie itself, if you're into hagiographies (what normal people would call ***-kissing) of mass murders, then "Redemption" is for you.  Mr. Foxx is a good actor and provides a reasonable accounting for Mr. Williams' spiritual awakening, such as it is while protesting your innocence.

Jamie Foxx's actions surrounding the death of the real Tookie, including his race-baiting and truth-twisting, have caused me to swear off Jamie Foxx films for the rest of my natural life.  Sometimes it just becomes too difficult to mentally separate the actor from his cause.
