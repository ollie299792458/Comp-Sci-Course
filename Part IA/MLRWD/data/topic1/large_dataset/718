I paid $5.00 to see an early showing of this at an AMC theater and thought it was worth it.  It definitely has some funny scenes and material in it.  There was some scenes that should have been funny and didn't quite work.  The fight scene between Mark Wahlberg and Ted should have been funny.  However, by the time it comes in the movie and context in which it was done, it lost something.  Still, if you like crude and even raunchy humor, you will most likely enjoy this.

One thing I have to say about this movie and Seth McFarlaine.  I was pleasantly surprise that his style he has taken up with Family Guy in recent seasons did not spill over to this movie.  In Family Guy, his liberal views have become vicious and hate filled towards conservatives, religion and generally anybody who doesn't agree with his liberal and political views.  This movie only made slight references to those groups but generally stayed politically neutral throughout the movie.

As for it coming out on DVD, I am still undecided as to whether it is worth buying to keep or not.
