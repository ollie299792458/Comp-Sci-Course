Fans of the original Lost in Space television series will enjoy certain episodes in this collection (maybe most of them), especially "Trip Through The Robot" (giant-sized robot explored and rescued from the inside), "The Phantom Family" (a cold-hearted alien captures the family and replaces them with duplicates), and "The Cave of the Wizards" (where the character Dr. Smith slowly transforms into an alien and loses his sense of identity.) For fans like me, who appreciated the occasionally more serious attempts at drama and sci-fi in the 2nd season of the series, but who also enjoyed, within bounds, the humorous interaction among the characters - only certain episodes will stand out as favorites in this collection. Other episodes will seem clearly over-the-top and silly. Die-hard fans will nevertheless feel a need to have this set in their collection, along with the other seasons.

Brand new viewers to Lost in Space may find the series to be an acquired taste, but it may well be worth their time. The series has become something of a phenomenon in pop culture. Find out what "Warning, Warning!" is all about and follow the exchange of clever insults between the characters of Dr. Smith, Major West, and the Robot. There is a lot of entertainment here - humor as well as some occasionally serious drama and sci-fi material. Give it a try!
