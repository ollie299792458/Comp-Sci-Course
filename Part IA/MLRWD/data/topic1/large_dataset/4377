these are comments on the movie, not the dvd.  i saw minority report 4 times and i am firmly convinced that it is a truly great film.  it's one of spielberg's best and reaffirms his greatness after the lukewarm ai.  tom criuse gives an impassioned performance as john anderton and samantha morton, in limited screen time, makes an impression as a tortured pre-cog.  needless to say, john williams provides an understated but great score.  spielberg's dp, janusz kaminski, gives the film a color scheme dominated by blues and greys, much like ai.  the editor, michael kahn, provides his most important contribution in the films chilling, suspenseful opening sequense.  probably mismarketed as an action film - don't get me wrong there's action - just not as much as you'd expect from seeing the trailers and commercials, minority report is really a film about destiny - whether or not people have the power to alter thier path.  one minor quibble is i would have liked more discussion on the legality of arresting people before they've committed a crime.  overall, one of steve's best and most powerful films.
