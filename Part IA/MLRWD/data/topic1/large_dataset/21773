The first half-hour of the movie opens strong.  We are presented with Kevin Costner's strong, rogue character who doesn't take anything from anybody.  He's strong as both a character and Costner himself pulls off the job superbly.  And then comes the action!  GREAT stunts and special effects!  And the movie is accompanied by a superb score by wizard James Newton Howard.  But, then the middle comes:  Dennis Hopper (one of my least favorite actors) appears as the bad guy, the lady (whatever her name is) shows not only her bad acting skills but her completely cheesy character.  The little girl is bearable, but still unnecessary.
  As far as costumes, action, and music go, this movie is pretty good.  You won't find much better for shear scale of action!  But, as far as story, plot, dialogue, and acting (except for Costner) goes, this movie leaves you wishing it were something more.  The ending is bad and sappy and towards the middle the movie slows down almost to a snails pace and begins to do nothing more than bore the heck out of the viewer with ridiculous and unnecessary additions to the already paper-thin story (the crazy seamen who will trade his maps to Costner just for a half hour of sex with the woman was stupid, stupid, stupid).  
  All in all, rent this on DVD once and if you like it, fine.  But, my opinion stands.  This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen in my entire life.  Avoid buying it at ALL costs.
