Obviously, Sandler rewards his fans and doesn't care about his critics. So, if you aren't too enthusiastic about his previous films, don't bother. I thought the movie was very funny, but it is best enjoyed when you watch it once every now and then. It definitely wasn't as funny the second time around because all of the unexpected gags became expected. I still enjoyed it, but be warned that viewings must be spaced out over time. The cast is the usual gang plus a few surprises. I'm a little disappointed that Steve Buscemi didn't make a cameo, but they still have a great bunch of actors and actresses. The story is slightly better than average, but it plays well with the various characters. My only major problem with the movie is the Heaven scenes (Did they HAVE to make the angels so annoying?), but those are quickly forgiven by the climax of the movie. As for the DVD, there are plenty of extra things to delight fans of the movie. The documentaries are interesting, and the deleted scenes range from abysmal (no wonder they deleted it) to hysterical. As for the commentaries, you have a choice between the funny one that provides useful or entertaining knowledge (The one with Adam Sandler, Tim Herlihy, and Steven Brill) or the Cast commentary, which is basically all of the actors saying the same thing over and over again - "I enjoyed making this movie." So, it's a good movie with a few faults, but a worthy addition to any Sandler fan's collection.
