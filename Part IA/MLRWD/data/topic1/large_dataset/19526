I want to qualify my review by saying that I'm a Caucasian American that loves Bollywood, not someone steeped in Indian culture. This is obviously a cult classic, so I hesitate to not write a glowing review. I'm a fan of SRK and Kajol in other movies they've done, but this one was just a little too over the top for me -- even though it was a foundational movie for them. For starters, there were too many obstacles to resolve in the movie. I've noticed that many Indian movies have problem after problem thrown at the main characters that they have to resolve, so maybe some people really like this, but for me, it went on too long. The chemistry and relationship between the two main characters was sweet and the storyline would have been a dream come true for a young girl with all the situations the two get thrown together in. I didn't mind it myself, and I'm in my 30s. However, the ending wasn't entirely satisfying to me. The father of the bride was quasi-demonic, and SRK's character's love for Kajol's character was plenty developed without the "proof" of the crazy ending. So in summary, it was a bit much for an American like me, but if you like drawn out, complicated plots with some happiness at the end, you will probably love it. It reminded me of Chup Chup Ke -- funny and light, but with one problem after the next. My favorite Bollywood movies are Jab We Met, Rab Ne Bana di Jodi, Dil Bole Hadippa, and The 3 Idiots to give you an idea of my style of movie.
