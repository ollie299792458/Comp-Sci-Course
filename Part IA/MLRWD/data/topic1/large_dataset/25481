when i bought the DVD, i brought it in to my thology class in my school, and we watched it.  the movie was hilarious in many ways, and it had my class rolling on the floor.  the movie really grips you and makes you want to continue watching.  my theology teacher enjoyed the movie and had us write a paper on the central theme. We are gods arms and legs.  be the miracle.  the movie is about a news reporter who is a little down on his luck.  He begins to grow angry with G-d because he felt G-d was ignoring him.  He little by little begins to go insane, from bottling up his anger.  When he gets promoted to the live news, he lets it all out.  Because of this, he looses his job.  That's the last straw.  He throws the prayer beads his girlfriend gave him into the ocean and begins yelling at G-d.  He then gets continuous pages from 555-0123, telling him to go to a warehouse to relieve him of his problems.  He meets G-d there and receives g-ds powers to show bruce that its not as easy as it looks to be g-d.  when havoc breaks after bruce avoids the peoples prayers, he surrenders to g-ds will!  really a great movie.
