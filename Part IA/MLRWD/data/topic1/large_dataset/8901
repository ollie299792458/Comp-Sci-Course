I was channel surfing a few months ago and just happened to arrive at the right channel at the right time to see this absolute gem of a film.  I thought I'd try it out and go on, but I was almost immediately entranced and couldn't look away.  I even set my clock and got up in the middle of the night to record it so I could watch it again the next day (which I did).  I had never seen any of the actors before, with the exception of the American, whose role as an observer and as a pointer to their eventual destination, seemed key to the story.  I was very impressed by every performance, each of which was so low-key and nuanced as to be a thing of beauty.  I was also knocked out by the honesty of each of the characters.  The dialogue was rather sparse, so the story had to be told in many scenes by the actors' faces, the tension in their bodies, and I have never heard such a wealth of meaning conveyed in the many one-word lines.  Such unflinching honesty is a rare thing in any age, but in this time period when so many people used words as a screen to hide their real thoughts, it must have been quite out of the ordinary to speak the truth as each character did, no matter the consequences.  I fell in love with all the characters - the lovers and their child - his sister-in-law and father - the young American - even the maid and the elderly butler who couldn't bend to the fire because his wig would fall off.  And the scene where the little girl asks her mother why she gave her away?  I've seen this movie half a dozen times and I still get goosebumps just thinking about it.

Yes, I found this to be the absolutely perfect love story.  I wouldn't change a word or a look, and the photography and the music simply rounded out the whole.  I will undoubtedly watch it again, and again, especially now that I have it on dvd.  It touched my heart.
