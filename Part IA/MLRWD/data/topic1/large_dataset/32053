None of you need the review of the film itself; those who haven't seen it can find excellent reviews of it here and in every film-related resource known on the planet. I'm here to speak to the Blu-Ray DVD version only, and what I am compelled to say is -- WHAT A WASTE.

Blu-Ray has been out for years, but I've been slow to adopt it. Even once we got our Blu-Ray player (a Samsung for which I'll write a glowing recommendation another day), it took us several more months to get around to renting any Blu-Ray discs to view on it. The one Blu-Ray product that really motivated me was the Coppola Restoration. The idea of an *even better* version of two of the finest cinematic achievements of all time was a major selling point. However, now that I've finally seen the Blu-Ray version, I'm left to wonder if there's someone out there who sees any improvement in visual or auditory quality. What I see is the same image, possibly a little lightened up. It's no clearer. It's no deeper. It's no more saturated or nuanced. It is the same movie I already had on standard DVD, so nearly as I can tell.

If you're thinking it's my other equipment falling short, think again. We have a recent Samsung HD TV and Samsung BLP, and both are proven and highly rated. Neither is it a question of not being able to appreciate subtle enhancements; others in the household recently rented other Blu-Rays and were lavish in their praise of the improvements. This DVD simply does not increase viewing pleasure over and above what the existing full-featured standard DVD already offered.
