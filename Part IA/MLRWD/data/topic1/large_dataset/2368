"Now where was I?"............Memento is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time and maybe the best movie of the new millenium.  It's originality, and phenominal script out do any other movie I have ever viewed. Its backward chronological order is ingenious leaving the audience clueless and full of suspense as to how the protagonist Leonard Shelby wound up where he is in the present scene.  Guy Pearce and John Pantaliono give amazing performances and Christopher Nolan's abilitys as a director and screen writer portrayed in this movie are simply unfathomable.  This story of "memory man" Leonard Shelby's quest to find the man who raped and murdered his wife, is a twisted rollercoaster ride, leaving the audience thinking for days about what EXACTLY happened, and how.  I suggest this movie to EVERYONE!! who appreciates GREAT film and a good suspense story. God, why does Sept. 4th have to be so far off.  Maybe I should tattoo the date on my arm.  What do you think Lenny?..............oh thats right, Leonard, i must have forgot.
