Godzilla once again shows up in Japan and wreaks havoc on several cities. The army fights him, using bombers, tanks and helicopters, while scientists discover an ancient meteorite under the sea. But this meteorite is really an U.F.O. and soon flies towards Tokyo! Godzilla too arrives there and attacks the U.F.O. To fight Godzilla, it creates an alien lifeform, the giant space monster Orga. Now, let the battle start...!
After Mr. Emmerich's try in 1998, Toho Eiga Company brings back the real Godzilla to make us fans happy! It's wonderful to see a legendary monster back on the big screen, even if this new film has it's flaws: Takayuki Hattori's score is by far inferior to the fantastic music of Akira Ifukube, and they use already too much of CGI effects. The model tanks and battles BELONG to Japanese Godzilla films and are an important part of the charm that made this genre last for 47 years. Please stop to fill Godzilla movies with lots of boring CGI! So GODZILLA VS SUPER-MECHAGODZILLA (1993) and GODZILLA VS DESTOROYAH (1995) are better movies, but GODZILLA 2000 MILLENNIUM still ranks as one of the top Godzilla films. Godzilla's new design is a standout!!
5 stars for the movie, but not for TriStar's version of it: There's no Japanese language track, atrocious dubbing, an almost unbelievably bad DVD cover, a stupid tagline, and - worst of all - about 9 mins. of footage have been cut from the original version which runs about 107 mins. It's uncut on Japanese DVD, but without subtitles. Hong Kong DVD version is uncut too, has a surprisingly good quality and includes English subtitles.
Both are much better that the TriStar DVD version.
