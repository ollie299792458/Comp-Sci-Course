I have three films on Queen Elizabeth I in my library and this is by far the best in my collection.  I have not see the one with Glenda Jackson to date and it is on my Wish List.

First off, I found the use of language to be intelligent, not like the Hollywood Elizabeth that seems to lack true English wit.  I am caught up every time I watch this with the casting, scenery, and costumes, which in turn merely embellishs the script.  Some reviewers mentioned that this production left out Queen Elizabeth's other accomplishments by focusing on her relationships.  Quite the contrary, I found it just as intriguing due the fact that it showed the human side upon which every leader or monarch has had to endure.  This film showed the "frail feminine side and the body politic" Queen Elizabeth struggled so hard to balance, a difficult feat for anyone.  It is mentioned in the history books that as she got older she suffered terrible headaches likely due to immense stress. I see there is nothing wrong with highlighting this part of her life, if so however accurate or inaccurate it is nothing but captivating performances, strong content, and true human emotion.

Tom Hardy's performance in this film has made me a fan of his and will continue to look for other works of his.  His character as the Earl of Leicester seamlessly transitions from a young suitor to an older, wiser man faithfully standing by the queen's side until the day of his death.  Duff's performance of the Queen encapsulated her joy's, frustrations, struggles, love and loss spot on.  The end of the film was the pinnacle, as was Elizabeth's life, I actually held my own breath as if it were my own life reflecting upon.

You will not be disappointed.  It is not often for me to be so taken in with a movie that I forget I am watching a film on a 15" laptop.
