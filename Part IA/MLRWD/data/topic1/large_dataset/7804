Reading this movie's summary I was excited to see this movie as I had successfully had a long-distance relationship myself, but this movie was pathetic.  The characters were never fully developed, the language with the F bomb every 2 min was ridiculous and unnecessary, the potty-humor throughout the movie appealed to only the youngest of audiences (my tween, for example, was the only one who thought it was funny) and there was absolutely no chemistry between the characters to make the story even slightly believable.  It was so bad that after watching 3/4 of the movie I couldn't force myself to finish it.  My tween and husband finished it, and it was predictably the exact ending we had forecasted after the first 15 minutes or so of the movie.  Drew's sister in the movie (Christina Applegate) was also completely unbelievable: she allows her sister (Drew) to live with her in CA while going to school and doesn't have a fit when Drew has loud sex throughout the house including in front of her and in her kitchen destroying her fresh baked/frosted cake and when Drew passes out drunk on the stairs so her sister's daughter can draw a cat on Drew's face (one of the high points of the movie, sadly).  Drew Barrymore was playing a 31 year old student (which was fine given she's only 35), but in some scenes her bleached blond hair and over-done eye makeup was disturbingly ugly, she looked like a street-walker, not an aspiring journalist going to one of the top schools in the country and working at a reputable NY newspaper.
