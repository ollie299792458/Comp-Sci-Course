I have to say seasons 1&2 are just great and I find myself watching them over and over and with the weather getting colder these make for a great tv night. I hope this show is a long lasting one because season 3 is absolutely amazing so far. I can't wait for the twists and turns I know there's to come from JJ Adams and the other creators. So if anyone is out there on the fence about buying the fringe series don't be just do it you won't regret it I promise. UPDATE TO FIRNGE SEASON 3. I'm in agreement with all the other reviews this is by far one of the best shows I've come across recently. At first I just blew on past it then for some reason I bought the first season and that's all it too I was hook. I was a little sad to see fox move it to Friday nights because to be honest it's hard enough having to wait till Thursday to get my dose of Fringe. Like the other reviewers I so hope that there are more seasons to come because it will be shame if it was to end I mean maybe moving it to the syfy channel will help it but I hope more folks start watching it.
