"Our heroes have always used steroids ..."  Or is that how the song goes???

I expected this to be an anti-steroid film.  It was neither that nor a pro-steroid commercial.  Instead, it is a thoughtful and thought-provoking documentary of the role of performance enhancers in our society.  It seems to imply that steroids are wrapped up in the American culture (though elsewhere the film implies that the American sports establishment started using them to ape the Soviets, echo were kicking our butts in the Olympics.)

Focal to the story is the tale of three brothers from Poughkeepsie, NY.  Adolescent chubbies, all three grew up to worship weightlifting, which took them on common paths of anabolic steroid use.

(Any film that makes Rep. Henry Waxman look like an idiot can't be all bad, not that that is such a difficult task.)

This film will grab you by the biceps and pecs, command your attention and make cause you to re-think much of what we have been conditioned to decide about anabolic steroids.

A good film!
