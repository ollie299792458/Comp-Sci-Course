I am very excited about this release although I do have manos hands of fate already.  santa clause conquers the martians is said to be one of the best episodes and I have always wanted to see it.  also for those big fans out there if you dont mind paying full price and five dollars shipping you can get a bonus disc of shorts volume 3.  go to the mst3k info web site for full information.  but if want the discs cheap buy em here then hope they will release shorts volume three for seperate purchase.
also they have just announced a new four disc set with 3 commedy channel episodes and a new collection of shorts.  cant wait!
update august 26:  i just got mine early from the website so that was cool.  however the packaging leaves something to be desired.  it is just a plain dvd case with the two discs held on both sides of the case.  unfortunately that means the chapter guide is just a piece of paper with nothing holding it.  also the bonus disc is just sitting in there as well in a paper sleeve.  the should have made it like the four disc boxes with a larger description of the episode inside and a slit for the chapter guide.  also it would have been really cool if there was a whole extra slot for the bonus disc.  also im annoyed that it doesn't say the episode number or have a larger description of the episodes.  but still it gets five stars because of the strength of the episodes.  you must get this.
