By far the best film of 2007! The only one I immediately watched a second time. I'm not a fan of a lot of Coen Bros. movies, but this one is their best since "Fargo". (The two films share many themes, as well.) There is a lot of black humor in "No Country" as in Fargo, but this film is far bleaker and darker. The "Old Men" of the title are also the good men, and unlike Margie in "Fargo" the future offers them little hope. The pure evil of a hired killer, and the culture of violence spawned by the drug trade is simply too much for the once mighty lawmen. The film is deliberately downbeat and pessimistic--so those with a Pollyanna-like world view would do well to avoid this one. For viewers who see the ever increasing amorality of our culture, however, this masterpiece will hit home. The controversial ending is the only logical outcome for this sad tale of a world gone mad--a country taken over by the likes of the unstoppable, inhuman serial killer played brilliantly by Javier Bardem. The average man or woman becomes merely a minor obstacle to the tidal wave of evil that destroys everything that once was decent society. A harsh message, but one that is all too true.
