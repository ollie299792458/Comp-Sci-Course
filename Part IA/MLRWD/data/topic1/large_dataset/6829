I thoroughly enjoyed the backdrop of Ancient Greece as it was portrayed in this movie. There were also neat little quirks in several of the early scenes like the Macedonian games of spear-throwing and boxing, as well as  the array of famous statues in Athens. Richard Burton brought to his  character of the King the predictable level of heavy drama and emotional  instability that he was famous for, and although quite overbearing at  times, he was nonetheless a master of his art and of the many problems of  this stupid film, none were directly attributable to him. For one, there  were way too many historical discrepencies in the plot, which would've been  more excusable only if there had been more plot to go around it all! Most  of the movie is dedicated to Alexander's young life and his conflicts with  his parents, while very little attention whatsoever is paid to his famous  eleven year conquest of Persia, Egypt, and India. In fact if I'm  remembering correctly -- for it has been some time since I last saw the  film -- almost the entire Indian campaign is summed up as we watch a red  line being drawn across a static map on the screen, while a voiceover  announces something like, "and then Alexander moved through  India..." The mass marriage at the end of the film was interesting for  me, but then Alexander raises his cup in toast and -- whammo! -- he falls  over, is taken to his deathbed, and that's that. A very disappointing  climax for any motion picture, let alone one about the greatest military  general of the ancient world. Alexander deserves to be honored by a  terrific film, but this is not the one.
