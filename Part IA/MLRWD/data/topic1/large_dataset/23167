I saw this film in the theaters when I was a teen and loved it!  And when I got the chance to buy it, although at the time cost a pretty penny, it was worth it and I bought it on the spot!  This is the funniest movie of that time period and yet never got the acclaim and popularity (that it deserved) that other films during that time got.  This movie is unpredictable and never falls into cliches.  It used comedy, anxiety and excitement to perfection.  The story, cinemetography and direction was very creative and unlike any movie at that time.  And the subtle metaphors in the movie, added to the comic genius and the main characters anxiety, especially the scene where the main character is watching the film in class and he watches the little insect get eaten by its predetor!  This movie had one suprise after another.  It includes the tesion and fear from horror movies and thrillers, the wit, sarcasm and slapstick from comedies, and the tesion and creativity in the camera work and each individual scene that was popular in old westerns... and all this in the backdrop of an 80's teen genre that excels by deviating form the norm.  The actors are perfect in this movie, especially verteren actors Casey Siemaszko, (Back to the Future, Young Guns) and Richard Tyson, (Kindergarten Cop, There's Something About Mary) in his movie debut, who captures the intense Terminatoresque role of the bully that will not give up his mission to destroy to fearful perfection.  This movie deserves 6 stars!!
