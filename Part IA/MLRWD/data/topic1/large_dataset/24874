The Haunting still remains the definitive haunted house story-- a weird assortment of people gathered together to spend the night in a large, extravagent house with a gruesome history.  The movie gives us many strange images and leaves the main question intact: is the house really haunted or not?  Although I can't say I was moved by Julie Harris' performance, she does her job in making us question the motives of an unlikable character, which is what the other characters do.  The real stand-out in terms of acting is Claire Bloom.  This was the first movie I'd seen her in and her character is such a seductive earth-mother you want to get to know her better.  The implied sexuality of her Theo is still there, but probably bogged down by the censors.  The main complaint I have of the movie is the voiceover.  We don't need Julie Harris' Eleanor to constantly tell us what she's thinking because we can see it in her hypnotized, and sometimes terrified, expressions.  But it is a great story, complex, and the eerie music and awe-inspiring house are icing on the cake.  A must-see for anyone interested in ghosts, writing ghost stories, or psychological thrillers.
