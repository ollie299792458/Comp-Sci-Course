I never saw this movie until this year when a friend brought the DVD to my place saying how much he liked the movie. I thought it would be more of a sappy melodrama, but I ended up liking it so much that I have added it to my library of favorites. Three brothers, the love of a father and being in love with the same woman mix together in this movie to form a bigger than life story that merits the title - Legend.

The filming is excellent, taking us through some beautiful country and I think Brad Pitt's performance is one of his best. The emotions he goes through to show his character's passion for living and for his family drew me in until I was completely wrapped up in the story. I liked how it is told in the voice of a Native American in the tradition of his people, thus forming the legend of the man who's spirit is kindred to a Grizzly Bear. I would have liked to see the love interest, Susannah be a stronger woman, but then the trials that the family goes through would not have been the same if such were the case.

Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors and this movie shows off his skills well, infusing the character of the father with both humanity and a toughness that provides depth and interest throughout.
