The Case Closed Season One DVD box set is a four-disc set that contains the first twenty-six episodes of the Case Closed anime series.  The first two discs have seven episodes, the third disc has six episodes, and the fourth disc has six episodes and the bonus features.

Case Closed is a mystery series done in a "whodunit" style, and a number of the episodes on this set focus on murder mysteries.  Unfortunately, in most of the episodes on this set, one element of this style is usually missing: the "denouement," which is an epilogue that shows what happens to the characters after the case is solved.  For many of the stories, the episode ends right when the case is solved; this weakens some of the stories, because as a viewer, I became invested in what was happening, and I felt cheated that I didn't get to see what happened to some of them in the aftermath of solving the crime.  Overall, Case Closed is a decent series, but I do wish more of the episodes ended with a "denouement."

There are only three bonus features included on the fourth disc.  The first is a "Character Spotlight" for Conan Edogawa; this is one screen of text with a picture of the character to accompany it.  The second is "Conan's Gadgets," which is one screen describing Conan's Super Sneakers; this is accompanied by a picture of Conan wearing the sneakers.  The final extra is a page with a menu for trailers.  I was a little underwhelmed by the bonus features, but knowing that Case Closed didn't perform all that well for FUNimation, I can understand why the company didn't go to a lot of effort when it came to bonus features for this set.

The Case Closed Season One box set is a decent release, and is worth adding to your DVD library if you're a fan of the Case Closed anime series.

I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD box set that my husband gave me as a gift.
