Hey there, what can you say about Tron but "Fantastic!".  Jeff Bridges stars as Kevin Flynn, a former computer programmer who is trying to hack into his old computer companies' data files in order to find the proof he needs to bring down Ed Dillinger, played by David Warner, who also has a dual role as Sark, his alter persona in the computer world.  As Flynn tries to crack the MCP's unbreakable codes, he zaps Flynn into the computer world through a laser that can take apart matter and place it anywhere it means to.  Flynn is forced to wander through this world and try to find a program named TRON to help him destroy the MCP and liberate the computer world from tyranny.  Tron is played by Bruce Boxleitner, also in a dual role as Alan, Tron's user who helps Flynn find the files that will prove that Dillinger stole Flynn's files as his own.  Tron is not CGI made so the special effects aren't amazing as the new Tron Legacy movie but it's still damn spectacular for what they had to work with.  The DVD is a special edition and comes with some extras such as the making of Tron, an interview with the cast, both old and new.  The trailer is also included with previews of some other movies.
