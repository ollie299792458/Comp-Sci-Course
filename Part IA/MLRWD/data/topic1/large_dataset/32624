This is a challenging set and a challenging technique format.  Suhaila's technique is a modification and innovation of the traditional belly dance format crafted by dancers over hundreds of years.  Her format is very athletic and sensual, and is the basis for a great many belly dancers today, to include Rachel Brice, Asharah and others.  I would call Suhaila Salimpour the Vaganova of modern belly dance.

Keeping that in mind, this isn't a fitness video, but rather a series of toning, stretching and strengthening exercises needed by serious belly dance students in preparation for more intensive study in the Suhaila Salimpour format (she offers classes, workshops and certification at her studio in CA and occasionally on tour).  This is an absolute must have for the serious belly dance student, particularly fusion dancers.

The DVDs are enjoyable to work with and are laid out pretty well for the user.  Many of the workouts are not 100% achievable right out the gate, but that is why they are for beginners: this is what you need to work up to.  The isolation exercises on the Buns DVD in particular is very difficult, but I replayed the section until I was comfortable isolating those muscles and then moved at my own pace.  I am not up to the same speed she is, but I'm improving quickly.  Moving at your own pace is key here, so don't get frustrated.

My only critique of the series is that Suhaila doesn't break down for the dancer what the isolations are supposed to feel like; what should it feel like if I am isolating my gluteal muscles satisfactorily?  Where would she recommend I target when isolating those muscles (tighten here, not there etc.)  That would have been very helpful.  A good way to over come that is to set up a mirror ($20 stand alone set up against the wall from Walmart is fine)...do you like like they do in the video?  If you do, there's a pretty good chance you're doing it correctly.
