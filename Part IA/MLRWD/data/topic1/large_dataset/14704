I finally got to toss the TERRIBLE DVD of this fine space-western. I've always loved it, though my wife scoffs at me.

If you're buying this, you don't need a review of the film, so I'll tell you about the product.

Picture is beautiful, even on a 60" dlp projector. It has English subtitles available if you don't want to miss a word of dialogue. The aspect ratio matched the original theatrical widescreen beautifully. Special features? Heh. Ya get what you pay for-- even though this is a big name cast, it was a widely disliked film at the theater and didn't fare as well on video either, so don't expect much. I, myself, like... no, love... deleted scenes, but alas this release leaves me DENIED. Just enjoy the pristine beauty of the film is all the comfort I can offer.

I don't know how much of this glowing review is a response to how much I despised the DVD (which looked like it had been copied from an old, rented VHS), but I don't care now that I have this.
