I had never seen this movie, and looked forward to viewing it, in part because I think that Howard Hawks may have been the grestest American movie director. I began to worry during the credits which played to possibly the worst movie theme I have ever heard. When I saw the theme was credited to Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini, I was stunned. Then the movie began, and I suppose it was okay if you like comedies that never make you laugh. The movie almost seemed to be an in-joke on Hudson's double life, but I don't suppose that can be proved. Why did the writers have Hudson reveal his secret to Prentiss in the first few minutes? Wouldn't concealment until near the end have given more comic opportunities? Was the fake Indian chief funny even in 1963? I think Hawks forgot at times that he was not directing Cary Grant, whose subtleties and physical grace (with him the scene of climbing upside down into Prentiss's car might actually have been funny) would have added some humor on their own. Hudson was not without a lesser talent , but you don't see it in this movie.
