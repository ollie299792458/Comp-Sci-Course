Of all the apocalyptic, pandemic films I have viewed, this is one of the best and more believable films among the genre. You are not going to see a zombie gore-festival ala "28 Days", nor are you going to be delivered a miraculous cure to the scourge of the human race an hour into the movie ala "Outbreak". Don't expect an action movie or a happy ending.

This movie simply takes you on a road trip, in which you are a tourist observing the realistic interactions between people trying to survive the end of the world. The best part of this movie, in my opinion, is that it delivers a realistic portrayal of human emotions exchanged between people who care for each other, but are existing in morbid fear and just trying to make it through another day...whatever that day may bring. And whatever that may do to their relationships. The actors in this movie have to make some very difficult decisions in order to survive, and they do it in a convincing way.

If you are looking for a more emotionally driven pandemic movie and don't necessarily need the constant mental adrenaline fix of zombies versus shotguns, I highly recommend this movie.
