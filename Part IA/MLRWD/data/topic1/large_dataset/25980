After watching this DVD collection of Sullivan shows featuring the Beatles, I'd forgotten as an adult what the commercials of that time were like and the length at which they were shown in between the live show. What a trip back into time! But the stars were of course, The Beatles! The first shows(three in all)took place in February 1964. I was nine years
old at the time and what a time it was. This DVD set is a must have for anyone who is a Beatles fan, and while there's one point in the second show from Miami Beach where the mic for John is way too loud on one of the songs, eventually they get it fixed and the vocal blend is back where it should be. However, don't over look the fact that there are other guests on these shows too. In fact, Davey Jones (of Monkees fame), is in an appearance right after The Beatles perform. In the Sept. 1965 show when they perform Help, Yesterday, I'm Down, & A Ticket to Ride, it's all right on! What a Great performance by a band I never got to see live except on Tv, but nonetheless, I was a fan from the beginning. All in all, a great collection for any fan of Sullivan's or The Beatles.
