This was recommended here as something a person would like who liked the classics in the line of Pride & Prejudice or Wives & Daughters. Nothing could be further from the truth. If shallow, self-centeredness as well as lack of morality & likable characters are entertaining to you, then there is a lot here to enjoy. Otherwise, be warned, that this movie will be depressing & destined for the trash can. If you are the type of person who does not watch soap operas, ask yourself why you choose not to make soap operas a part of your life. Those reasons will all apply here except maybe the ability of some soap operas to draw you into the characters to a point that you really want to know what will happen to them. This movie does not do that, yet it shares all of the other negative qualities of a soap opera. Read other one star reviews if you still think this may be worth your time & money. I generally read reviews, but did not take the time to do so for this movie. The reason it was recommended & the rating tempted me, & when the price was shown as so much lower than the retail, I foolishly thought it was worth the risk. So many upsetting & depressing elements, scenes & messages in this movie have pushed me to make what is probably not a very helpful review, since it lacks specifics, but I wanted to at least put a little effort towards sparing others the experience & aftereffects of this depressing movie.
