This thriller starts intriguingly: two detectives (Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman) are trying to solve a murder in which they notice the word "gluttony" written on the wall. The day after, another kill, this time with the word "greed" makes them think about the seven deadly sins and five more assassinates to be done. That week will affect these two people in a big way. It develops the connection between them. Pitt's character is younger and more impatient, something not appreciated by the other, who is going to retire after this affair. Gwyneth Paltrow also stars in with the portrayal of Pitt's wife. She always seems miserable and worried about her husband. The menace of the freak is over all the time.
This movie fascinated me so, quite more than Fight Club (although you should aso take a look to this other one). First of all, I think the plot is perfect: a murderer obsession about bad people and punishing them by each capital sin they accomplish. I liked a lot this character, quite well performed by Kevin Spacey, because of his sordid behaviour. Besides, the two detectives will find many surprises, like for example, spectacles drawn on a portrait or the awful vision of a man trapped so long with nothing to eat, but his own tongue!. Fincher's brilliant direction gives a sorrowful view of life, because of all these terrible killings and the feeling that all the bad is always present. Despite what Freeman says at the end, when I finished watching this movie, it gave me the impression that the world is a dark and suffering place,. However, in my opinion, it's one of the best thrillers ever created, and if you like this genre, you MUST buy it. My favourite scene is the final one of the tense conversation with the freak and the painful end, it's wonderfully good! The ending credits will show first who ended up winning.
