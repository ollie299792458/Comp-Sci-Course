I owe Jet an apology.I saw Cradle 2 The Grave in March and trashed it in a review.TV Guide described C2G as a derivative thriller,and now I see why,it ripped so much from Romeo and Exit Wounds,it was a perfect cookie cutter movie.I still think C2G was a bad movie and everyone that was involved in it and this movie took a major step down,but I now do think Jet has some acting ability,as he demonstrated in Romeo.Romeo is a hip hop/martial arts version of Romeo and Juliet,and although the story was not a believeable one,but it was written well enough to keep you guessing who was up to what.Jet played the imprisoned former cop who escaped from jail in Hong Kong to find the killer of his brother and he has the chops to came off as a likeable character.Aaliyah played his love interest.She was good in the role.It's a shame she died tragically,she could have went on to become a decent actress.Anthony Anderson played a comic relief role as a body guard,and DMX played a believable part for once as a night club owner.The rest of the cast really did not impress me,interchangeable Asians and blacks to play the stereotyped gangsters,but they really played secondary roles.I would not recommend buying this,but as a rental you could do worse
