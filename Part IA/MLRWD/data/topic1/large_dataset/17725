At the beginning of the film, Joe Pendleton was the backup quarterback for the football team the Rams.  He was very skilled at that sport and it lead him to start the next game.  His luck had changed one afternoon and he never played in the next game.  Joe had been in an accident and was killed before the big game.  When he was waiting to go to his finial destination, he had found out that he was not suppose to die yet.  He could not return to his own body because it had been cremated.  He and Mr. Jordan, the person who took his body to early, started looking for a new body.  Joe settled for Leo Farnsworth's body.  Farnsworth was a very wealthy man but had a bad image.  While in his body he experienced events that were bizarre.  On many occasions his wife and her lover which was his secretary, tried to kill him.  When Joe was in Farnsworth's body he built a relationship with Betty Logan.  Betty was a teacher who had a problem with the company Farnsworth works for.  Joe's goal in this movie was to find a body that was athletic enough to play for the Rams again.

 The movie is based on fantasy and has a little bit of comedy.  The chemistry in the film between the actors gave a original feeling instead of it just seeming like a remake.  Farnsworth character was the big corporate guy who did not care about other people's feelings.  His wife was adulterous and planned to kill him along with his secretary. Betty Warren was the teacher who tried to protect her town. All of these characters played a major role in the movie and added humor to the story line.
