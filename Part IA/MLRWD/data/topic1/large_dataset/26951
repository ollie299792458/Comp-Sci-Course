i can't believe i let the good reviews suck me into this truly boring, stupid movie, the effects were horrible, the storyline and acting worse, hardly any action, i love monster movies, zombie movies, some of my favs. are tremors, return of the living dead, resident evil, day of the living dead, even liked the remake, day of the living dead, the need to feed, but this movie did not entertain me in the least, i fast forwarded through most of the movie, i even liked neon maniacs and alot of the troma movies, so i can't understand how anyone can possibly like this movie, there is just was nothing to like in it, i vote this movie to be the worst ever horror movie i've ever seen, and i have seen thousands of them in my life, i can't even think of giving it to anyone in my or my wife's family for none of them would like this, whoever is giving this movie any stars above one or two must have been in this movie or trying to sell it or must work for the studio who makes it, nothing else makes sense...........
