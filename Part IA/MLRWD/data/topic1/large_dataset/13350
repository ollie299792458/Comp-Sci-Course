While waiting for his wife to arrive at Dulles Airport in Washington D.C., Lt. John MacClaine (Bruce Willis) discovers that high-IQ right-wing terrorists are prepared to take back a deposed Central American dictator who is prisoner on a cargo flight headed for the airport. The terrorists (led by William Sadler) take over a nearby independent church and use equipment to disable the power in the controls tower. The control tower is given enough time to alert planes above not to land and to remain circling with low fuel. The terrorists demand that they let dictator (who is biding his time before he takes over the cargo plane) land in an isolated runway so that they may take a fully fueled jet to escape with him. Otherwise, they threaten to cause the planes to crash by masquerading as the control tower and making the planes equipment indicate that they are higher than they really are. In effort to rescue his wife on one of the planes, he battles the terrorists however he can, while dealing with the useless, foul-mouthed chief police officer (Dennis Kranz).
Die Hard 2 is highly enjoyable and maintains your attention like the first film. However, be warned that some of the characterizations are slightly flatter than the ones in the first film. If this doesn't bother you, than you should enjoy the exciting action scenes and the twist-filled plot. 
If you like this film, I also recommend Executive Decision and Air Force One.
Rated R for extreme graphic violence, strong language, and nudity.
