Cameron's lovingly crafted underwater 'first-encounter' thriller has no shortage of watery mayhem, but the E.T. action is surprisingly sparse, especially given that Cameron also directed 'Aliens'.

Abyss is essentially a disaster film a la 'Apollo 13' or 'Poseidon' albeit under 3000 feet of water. The majority of the plot chronicles the struggles of Ed Harris and his crew of deep sea oil explorers to survive amidst the deteriorating condition of their rig. It doesn't help that their efforts are hampered by a half-crazed Navy Seal with a nuclear warhead. The aliens pop in every now and again, but you won't give them much thought as the suspense on board the rig reaches critical levels.

Sometimes corny, but more often touching, Abyss offers an exiting tale of survival with aliens tossed in for good measure. The ending, and its moralizing, comes from out of left field, but feels appropriate none the less.

The Special Collectors Edition (not just special edition) has even more extras and added footage, though it might not be worth the added price for casual fans.
