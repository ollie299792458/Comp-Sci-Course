I have to say that I'm very happy to find out that this movie is one of the very few Motion Pictures that support the "appropriate" aspect ratio that most people (if not all) would like to enjoy in their movies.

WHY SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS ASPECT RATIO?:
For those of us who already hate the so called "black bars" on top and bottom of the screen while watching a regular movie, the Aspect Ratio of 2.40:1 on 3D Home viewing brings back those horrible "Black Bars" and with that TAKING AWAY FROM WHAT MAKES 3D WORTH THE PURCHASE TO BEGIN WITH, minimizing the effect by a big percentage.

Usually I don't mind those "black bars" on 2D viewing, maybe because we are all used to it by now, plus it doesn't take anything away...BUT ON 3D viewing this is the complete opposite.

SO WHAT'S THE "APPROPRIATE" ASPECT RATIO THAT SHOULD BE IN 3D HOME MOVIES?
Most 3D movies right now are NOT being released with the desirable Aspect Ratio that will fill the whole screen giving you the whole 3D effect BUT movies like THE AVENGERS, and the soon to be released AVATAR 3D, are some of the very few that could display with an average Aspect Ratio of: 1.77:1 WHICH WILL take advantage of the FULL SCREEN of your New 3D TV as you expected to display from day one.

With that said, This movie fortunately does support that type of Aspect Ratio which makes it completely worth the extra few dollars on the 3D Bluray version.

Even with an enormous TV set you wouldn't want to watch a 3D movie with the black bars because...the bigger the TV, the bigger the "black bars" .

ABOUT THE MOVIE IN GENERAL:
I did like this movie when I went to see in IMAX 3D, I think it had a good use of the technology.

STORY:
Story wise I don't think is half bad as many people say...it's not perfect, but certainly enjoyable.

SPECIAL EFFECTS:
Well I personally think the movie studio did better than the prequel from 2010.

ABOUT THE 3D:
I know a lot people will disagree with me on this one, but I think this movie had the best of use of 3D elements since James Cameron's Avatar.

The movie itself as I said it's not groundbreaking but certainly enjoyable, and what really makes it stand out from the pack is how well the director and his team were able to put everything together and make it look Amazing in the 3D Bluray version.

If you have a 3D TV and a 3D BluRay player, this movie will certainly make you proud of that investment...I know it did for me.
