From "The Client" to the "The Chamber" to "Rainmaker" to "The Pelican Brief" John Grisham has amazed audiences with his political high-paced stories. This is no exception, except for one. The movie could possibly be better than the book.
  In an all-star cast Matthew McConaughey, Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey, Sandra Bullock, both Keifer and Donald Sutherland, Oliver Platt, and Ashley Judd star.
 The plot is quite simple. A 10-year old black girl is raped by two drunk crusty skeezy white men and her father (Jackson) vengefully takes the law into his own before they can be tried.
  A hot-shot white lawyer (McConaughey) takes on the case with help of his hilarious friend (Platt) age-old mentor (Sutherland, Donald) and "oh-so-hot" law clerk (Bullock). We can all imagine what will happen when a white man defends a black man for the murder of two white men in Canton, Mississippi.
 Immense drama begins when the prosecutor (Spacey) enters the film. A re-rise of the KKK (headed by Sutherland, Keifer) many violent attacks, and gut-wrenching monologues, including an Oscar worthy performance by McConaughey and Jackson make this one of the best and underrated films of the year.
