This review is for the Blu-Ray version.  While we are flooded with sci-fi movies of all types these days this movie takes from some of the best of the genre and makes it all feel original.

This movie has the feel of Alien, Solaris, 2001 Space Odyssey.  But while it may borrow many of the same feelings the movie does branch off into some very original looks. The look of the sets, the ship, the suits and the ship  and many of the other details are very interesting from a technology perspective.  While obviously you can't take flying some type of ship into the sun literally it makes for an interesting idea.  The sound engineering is great the soundtrack and effects are top notch.

After seeing the DVD and Blu-Ray side by side there is the obvious low sharpness and compression on the DVD version. The HD version is very sharp and black levels are handled very well.  It is also nice to have a DTSHD track on the BluRay.

This movie has some great low frequency effects, along with superb use of the surround channels.  This movie is best enjoyed with a well configured sound system and large screen to enjoy the full feeling. This movie was made to be seen big and I could see how it would loose some the effect on a smaller setup.

Point being this is a perfect must have HD title to own.

This is also one of the first BD 1.1 spec disks with PIP.  The PIP is just what it sounds like, you get a picture in picture box pop up on the screen during the movie. There are some other features too but nothing amazing.

The movie has its flaws with acting, character development and depth, but this movie is a visual feast and if you allow yourself to get sucked in the idea of the movie will hook you quickly. Side bonus? No overtly Hollywood ending or ridiculous love story.
