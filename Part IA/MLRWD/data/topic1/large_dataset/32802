I never watched Modern Family until this past Sunday afternoon, then I started watching it and finished every single episode that's been released so far (42+) by Wednesday. Yes, it's that good.

This show is hilarious,the characters are lovable (and even relate-able to some extent). The lines are great and it's clean for the most part (good for the family). I had a blast watching every one of the episodes. And as funny as it is, there are great principles about family, sharing, relationships, etc. in it too, though that is not necessarily what people watch it for.

It's a little like The Office in that the camera sometimes cuts away to a scene with just one or two of the characters talking to the camera, sharing their true thoughts and feelings. Modern Family also takes advantage of using awkward situations like The Office. I love both.

I'd definitely recommend this TV show if you've never watched it before, you can check out a couple of episodes on Hulu first.
