Let me be clear, the 4th of July is one of my favorite holidays. We always have a flag flying outside our home.
I never would have watched this film if I hadn't read about it on an author's website.
I am so glad she wrote about it and I hope everyone who watches this movie tells at least one other person how wonderful it is.
I wish this film would be required viewing in highschool.
It opened my eyes to the political machine. A machine I knew existed, but blindly walked alongside.
What I took away from this film, was that so many of us believe what we're told when it fits out agenda.
What I loved about Pat Tillman is that he was a man who listened to everyone but followed his own code. I've really never watched a better movie about loyalty and family and friendship.
This movie made me want to become a better person. To educate myself. To reacquaint myself with history.
Though it is sad, it is also uplifting and inspiring.
I don't care if you buy it, rent it, or borrow it: Watch It.
