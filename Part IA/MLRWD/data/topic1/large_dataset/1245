I wish that we could give half stars when rating films because it would make life so much easier. Some films just fall into that netherland in between a 3 and a 4 and SEVERANCE is one of them. It isn't the laff riot that I expected but it does offer moments of dark humor though not as much as I had been led to believe. In fact it has one very clever sequence based on the silent version of NOSFERATU that was one of the best things I've seen in years--unfortunately the film makers couldn't sustain that level of creativity for the entire 90 minute running time. There were other things I admired, to be sure. Such as some of the surprises they pulled out of their bag in relation to the identity of the killer. I liked the fact that there was no solid background for him, that all we know is what the characters gave us themselves as they sat around the table telling different stories they had heard in the past.

SEVERANCE isn't exactly a carnage fest either. There is gore aplenty but if you're looking for eviscerations you aren't going to find them here. And those of you looking for nudity are going to have to wait until the last few minutes to see four breasts. The plot concerns a group of Brits employed by a weapons manufacturer. They are on corporate retreat in Rumania or some such place when their bus breaks down, their driver deserts them,and they decide to hike to what they presume to be their lodge. Wrong. It is in fact the lair of the usual demented serial killer. Violence ensues. Fortunately I could care less about that but it would take too much effort. SEVERANCE is an okay rental. You might even get a kick out of it.
