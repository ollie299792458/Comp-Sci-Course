Taken as it is, Return of the Joker is a really fun movie to watch. Even if you're a fan of the Batman Animated Series fan that never watched Batman Beyond because it's just not the same (like me), this still has some things in here (long flashbacks, a fight between Joker and Wayne inside the batcave) that you will enjoy. You learn a lot about what ever happened to many of the old characters (Batman, Robin, Batgirl). The action is fun to watch and the sound track is good. The 'Crash' music video by Mephisto Odyssey is also a nice bonus to watch.
There are several reasons why I only gave this 4 stars. Just knowing that this is the cut version automatically took some of the enjoyment out of it. Most of the cuts could be even seen as trivial, especially when you take a look back on Mask of the Phantasm (just as violent as some of the Tim Burton movies really).  I won't list the differances here since they're already posted all over the internet and easily found. But knowing that does take away from the movie. Another warning, the package notes 'Deleted Scenes' as one of it's Special Features.  What you actually get is animated story boards of ONE deleted scene with voices (no sound effects or music, just the voices). 
If you can get past the simple fact of all the censorship, it's still a very fun movie to watch. If you liked any of the other animated features (Mask of the Phantasm, SubZero or Batman Beyond:The Movie), you'll like this.
