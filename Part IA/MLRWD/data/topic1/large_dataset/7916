After my son learned his letter sounds from Letter Factory DVD at 15mos., a friend also recommended this to me. After a few months of enjoying these short cartoon clips he was able to memorize the 48 or so sight words with no pressure. He can now pick them out as we read books. These are words that you would come across most often while reading his books (she, look, of, as, like, and, it, are, this, all, my, there...). Knowing these words opened a whole new world of reading and we are really having fun. I notice now that he looks at the words I read more than the pictures. One of the clips associates a sushi bar with the word all. It might sound confusing but to him its not. He knows that sushi has nothing todo with the word it was just a characte and the sound it made. Um hard to explain but they'll get it. He now likes to add letters to the beginning of "all" and play around with the sounds like ball fall tall. It's fun to watch him learn and play with words. Oh and I also saw this for 20- at Costco but haven't seen it there since. I wanted to get it for a friend. The price has gone up since last year (24-)
