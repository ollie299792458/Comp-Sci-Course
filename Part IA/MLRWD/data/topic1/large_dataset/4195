Two lines from the movie:

Just after lights out in the dorm.

"Stephens! ... Whatever you are doing right now ... Stop."

and

After imagining he has made love to particularly beautiful model he sees in a magazine.
"The only thing left to do would be to walk down into the sea, naked, and die."

I saw this move when it came out. During the hot summer of 1969. I was so completely overwhelmed by the movie that I got 6 of my friends to come with me to see the movie.

I saw the movie 7 times in 2 months.

I never got bored. Each time I saw it it seemed as fresh and amazing as the first time.

I hope it gets re-issued in DVD. I want to see how it holds up against my memory.

Oh. Also, the movie is worth seeing if only to hear the incredible music. Anderson used part of the Missa Luba (the original one recorded in the Congo) as part of a recurring theme which, by itself, is worth the price of the movie.

Enjoy!
