I dont know why exactly but this film just makes me cringe inside. Its almost like despite the best efforts spending zillons of bucks on an all A-List cast and on marketing there is something very very very wrong about this. I feel as though by watching this, I will be dragged off to some far away land to face some existential nightmare not of my own creation.

I feel so sorry for the penguins they seem to be a victim of their own blissful ignorance. They seem oblivious to the onslaught of polar warming, bears , Orcas the list goes on (life must really suck to be a penguin right now) Maybe thats the whole point , this film is to make kids ignorance of the world around them like the little penguins! Maybe they'll learn to accept what the world around them is doing and ignore certain MPAA attempts to control the internet and the world for their own benefit!!! Seriously this SUCKS!! Send your kinds to see Pokemon, Cool Japanese Manga something that is different; independent. You never know they may thank you for it one day
