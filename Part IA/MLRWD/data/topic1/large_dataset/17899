While it's great to see ROOM 222 back in circulation, buyers beware that, perhaps owing to the fact that the show was never in syndication, the video negatives have deteriorated significantly with time.  The audio and video will actually remind you of what it was like to watch TV before the cable era.  The mono soundtrack is badly warped (especially noticeable in the underscoring, which wobbles) and the colors on the video are so washed out that, in some cases, it's hard to discern characters' ethnicity (and ROOM 222, you'll remember, is all about ethnicity).

That being said, it is still a pleasure to reconnect with a show that is so much a product of its idealistic time.  Viewed in present day, there is a poignancy in the unabashed earnestness of the writing and performing, and it's impossible to watch Karen Valentine being slammed in the face by those bus doors and not be transported back to a time when cute really meant CUTE on television.  Given that Shout Factory's other releases are all in pristine shape, we can only assume that the original master tapes of ROOM 222 were beyond restoration.  Such a pity, as the show deserves a better presentation.
