I have never been a fan of Jessica Biel but I dont deny the girl can act. London is all about Jessica Biel, Jason Statham's ex-girlfriend. On the duration of the film you will catch a glimpse of their ups and downs, but the downs are really bad, and it seems like the only thing they got in common is good sex.

Jason Statham's character Syd is a horribly possesive boyfriend and Jessica Biel's character as London is too carefree and uninhibited for such a guy. Syd talks too much and he kinda reminds me of an ex-bf..lol, this movie makes us see that its better to be single than to be with the wrong man.

Syd never fails to endear us though, he is sweet and seems very devoted to her. London also seems a little bit too insensitive for him, thus the constant fights with fills the movie 80%.

This might bore the guys, or they might find it totally ironic.

They seem to be always fighing because Syd just talks too much-more than she does,they have way too many make-up sex and too less understanding of each other.

I think I have said enough. It wasnt at all boring for me and made me see the 2 sides to every story we more or less experience in life at one point in time.
