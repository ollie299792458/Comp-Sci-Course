It's one of the two funniest movies this old grandmother of 17 has ever seen.  ("O Brother, Where Art Thou?" being the other.)  I even bought the thing, and I find a movie worth buying about once a decade.

After DeNiro's first 150 utterances of the F-word  (all in the first three minutes), its sheer reflexivity neutralizes the shock value. (Though the bleeped-out TV version I've seen once or twice is just as funny.)

BRILLIANT writing: not a false note in the dialogue, nothing that strains credulity or bogs down the story. Too many unforgettable lines to list. My favorite might be the exchange, toward the end, between DeNiro's Walsh and the FBI agent Mosely who's dogged him most of the movie.  DeNiro's bloodied-but-unbowed cockiness and the total unexpectedness of Mosely's (grudging and quickly revoked) hint of a smile is one of the better moments in film history.

Alonzo Mosely: "What should be of paramount importance to you right now....is the fact that you're gonna spend 10 years in the penitentiary for impersonating a federal officer.

Jack Walsh: 10 years for impersonating a fed, uh?

Alonzo Mosely: 10 years.

Jack Walsh: How comes no one's after you? "

A surprisingly tender and uplifting movie, F-word or not.
