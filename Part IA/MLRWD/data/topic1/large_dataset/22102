"The stuff that dreams are made of," or, for some, the greatest private eye movie there ever was gets the royal treatment in this "Three-Disc Special Edition."  "The Maltese Falcon" has ensnared so many fans in its 65 years- so many that its been lampooned and "Looney-tuned" the world over. It's hard to know where to begin.  Let's just say it's here where the whole Humphrey Bogart mystique truely takes hold in his incomparable role as Sam Spade.

  Both crafty and shafty, a "hero" only in the sense that he wins the game of "the smarter crook," Bogart is riveting to watch.  He's also superbly supported by a steller cast including a heart- aching turn by Mary Astor as Spade's "love interest" and a classic rouge's gallery of criminals including Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre (Bogart's two "Casablanca co-stars).  My fave, though is Elisha Cook Jr. as creepy man/child bodyguard, Wilmer who Bogart laughable taunts throughout.

  First time director John Huston wisely did not stray from the book as Hammett's prose is fabulously tart ("Shoo her in, darling.  Shoo her in.") and orchestrates the dialog and situations in such a frantic pace that you're consistantly jucied even though most of the action consist of few characters on small, dimly lit sets (add a thunderous musical score and you have the perfect example of the Warner Brothers house style).

This dvd edition is indeed historic as it finally, FINALLY, puts all in one package the original, little seen, "good-on-its-own-terms," 1931 version of "The Maltese Falcon" as well as its inferior, thinly veiled 1936 remake "Satan Met a  Lady" (co-starring Bette Davis) one .  Starring Ricardo Cortez as a slicker, prettier Spade, the original like its 1941 remake follows  Hammett's book closely and is fascinating to watch just how much of Huston's version was actually derivative.  It's just that Huston built the better mouse trap.
