Having read the book many times I've come to know its complexities well enough.  Albert Finney embodied Poirot from top to bottem so much so that all other portrails pale by comparison.  Even the remarkable work of David Suchet cannot touch Finney. Poirot is an eccentric ego-ist who is also one of the most intelligent characters ever created and Finney captures his qualities perfectly. The rest of the cast is equally superb! With an interational cast of Vanessa Redgrave, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Wendy Hiller, Sean Connery, Richard Widmark, Jean-Pierre Cassel etc. one wonders why all of them were not nominated for Oscars. The entire film is a work of art from the production design to the costumes, make-up and music.  All these elements under the direction of Sidney Lumet are kept flowing swifty so that you have to rewind over and over till you catch all the nuances.  The book can be a bit confusing and plodding despite the wonderful prose but the film clears away any clutter and solidifies the story.  Yes the film changes some names and some early locations but it also clarifies some plot points particularly the Armstrong case.  Agatha Christie saw this version of her story brought to life on screen and approved of it.  This film will delight the viewer with each repeated playing to the point that after a while you're going to have to get another tape the old one will become so worn!
