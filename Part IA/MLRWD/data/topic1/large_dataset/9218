***This is a review for the 3D Disc that plays with shutter-active glasses.***

I was so happy when I got my first retail 3D movie in the mail today.

This movie played perfectly with my Samsung LN46C750 LCD TV, and Samsung BD-C6900 blu-ray player and the Samsung 3D Starter Kit SSG-P2100T which has the battery operated glasses, and the Onkyo HT-S3300 3D system.

I did not notice any "ghosting" as mentioned in other reviews in the Monster vs. Aline's movie which I have and did see a little.

I am so happy there was a new movie to watch with my TV setup, I wish the Big TV guys would stop matching the new movies with purchase of a new TV system, like Panasonic has done with Coraline & Ice Age 3.

I did not see this movie in theaters when it was out the for whoever disagrees about the new 3D technology must not own one. I was lucky to be able to upgrade because of a home robbery. This is a great new technology that I can now enjoy at home, as close as possible the the 3D movies in theaters today! I will be buying every new 3D movie that comes out or is on pre-order as soon as I can find out about it.

The only "down side" I can think of about this movie, is that the menu of the Blu-ray did not have the special 3D viewing or just normal 2D view with nothing special.

SPECIAL FEATURES included on this disc are:
* BD Live
* Open Season 3D Sneak Peek
* Monster House 3D Sneak Peek
* A Recipe for Success: Making of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
* Key Ingredients: The Voices of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs
* 2 Extended Scenes
* 2 Early Development Scenes
* 5 Progression Reels with Introductions by Visual Effects Supervisor Rob Bredow
* "Raining Sunshine" Music Video
* Behind the Scenes of Miranda Cosgrove's "Raining Sunshine" Music Video

It looks like it does not have the Sing-A-Long nor the Flint's Food Fight Game nor the Interactive "Splat" Button (Throw Food at the Screen While You Watch the Movie!) as are on the 2D Blu-ray Disc.
