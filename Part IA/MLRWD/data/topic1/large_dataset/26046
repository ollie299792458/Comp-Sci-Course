Cruel Intentions is certainly not the usual bubblegum teenybopper movie--a fair warning: unless they are extremely open-minded and relaxed about sex, language, etc., don't rent this with your parents; whether they enjoy it or  not, it will not be a comfortable experience for you.  But aside from that,  this is a very entertaining movie.  Sarah Michelle Gellar expands her range  playing a bitchy sort of anti-Buffy.  Ryan Phillipe's acting style,  sometimes called soulless and cold, fits his (originally) heartless  character perfectly, and he has good chemistry with Reese Witherspoon  (small wonder, since they are now married), who does very well in the role  of the proud virgin.  Selma Blair is hilariously naive and ridiculous, and  Joshua Jackson, in a rather brief role, steals the few scenes he's in.  If  you're looking for something in the teen genre but not so fluffy as the  usual crop, and if you're not easily offended, check this movie out.  The  only reason I gave it less than 5 stars (I'd give it a 4.5 rather than a 4)  is Sebastian's (Phillipe's) transformation from lascivious jerk to tender  loverboy is a bit too sudden--the metamorphosis would have been more  believable if it had been more gradual, but this is a minor point and  doesn't really hurt the film in any way.
