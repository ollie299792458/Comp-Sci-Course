Black comedy and scares dominate this effective horror film of a family car-trapped on a dead end road during Christmas season.  Ray Wise (Twin Peaks) plays Frank Harrington, the patriarch of this dysfunctional clan, who, against his better judgement, changes his itinerary course and lives to regret it.  Indeed, before you can say what's that thing in the dark, the Harringtons are thrust forward into Twilight Zone territory where the consequences are deadly.  Writers/directors Jean Baptiste Andrea and Fabrice Canepa Andrea can smile proudly, for DEAD END is a fun and scary treat worthy of any bigger budget.  From its skilled cinematography (the high angle shot of the lone car illuminating the inky road is one fine example) to its wacky performances by all (especially Lin Shaye as the mother) to its bull's-eye timing of funny dialogue delivery, this 84 minute romp is as energetic and as fast-paced as any speeding vehicle.  Distributor Lion's Gate should really think of repackaging the DVD with some added features.-----Martin Boucher
