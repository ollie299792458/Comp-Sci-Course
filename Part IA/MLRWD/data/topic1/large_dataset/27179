Get Smart the movie uses current gags for humor while the tv series used dialog.  This difference makes the movie very different from the tv series that disappoints many core fans.  The movie is entertaining in its own way, spoofing Entrapment, Alias, and other spy movies along the way.  One must always have a dance scene in a spy movie.

 What was disappointing was Siegfried and Starkel, who both lacked the goofy incompetence and humor found in the original series.  Sure, Max was a goof, but Kaos was even more inept than Control.

 The 2nd disc is not worth the extra money in a special edition.  The gag reel is rather short and could have been included in the 1st disc.  The 1st disc presents the alternative jokes in a very aggravating manner.  It forces you to watch the entire movie and it is constantly interrupted with the phone booth elevator.  Only by pressing the enter button when the phone booth is shown, will the alternative gag line be shown.  Very tedious to be constantly interrupted and having to press the button to watch the gags.  It would have been much easier and entertaining to watch the gags the standard way with their own menu.

 Overall the movie was entertaining, but the poor special features in the 2-Disc Special Edition results in a 1-star deduction due to the higher purchase cost.  The single disc edition is good enough and a better value for your money.  Wished that other reviewers could have explained the 2nd disc in more detail, would have saved some money and only purchased the single disc version.  If you already have the single disc version, no need to buy this 2-disc version.
