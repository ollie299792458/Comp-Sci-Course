It is difficult for me to reconcile whose fault it was that this movie was so bad. I guess what's fair is to spread some blame around. A little (but not too much must go to Connery). In the entertainment biz, you just don't participate in projects to line your pockets. He was and still is one of the great screen actors but the role of James Bond had long since passed him after "Diamonds Are Forever". I liken his playing J.B. one more time to baseball player Cal Ripken continuing to play. We go and see both of them do what they do, but we realize (as in the case of N.S.N.A.) that they don't do it at the same level anymore. Sprinkle a little blame on Kevin McClory for even bringing the film into existence over his bitter feud with Ian Fleming, et al. And finally, the director (whose name escapes me)...after years of Cubbi Broccoli's highly polished productions, (except for Dr. No which is one of the greats but did not have a big budget so it's a little rough) N.S.N.A. looks like some 1970's B grade film shown before the main feature at the weekend drive-in. 
On a personal level, the movie is hard to watch for me because it is a re-do of my fav J.B. film and novel, "Thunderball". As good as "Thunderball" is, is how bad "N.S.N.A." is. The controversy surrounding the script has been well documented so, I won't rehash it here.
In closing, although I gave it one star, I do encourage everyone to see the film at least once but, preferably AFTER you have seen all of the other films. To purchase it though, I would strongly suggest spending your hard earned money elsewhere. I speak from experience. I own the film myself, but because I enjoy the other films more, I have only watched it once or twice in the five years I've had it, compared with the 53 or so times I have watched "Thunderball"....of course that's just my opinion....I could be wrong.
