But ... is it a "snuff" film?

To wit:

- Harry Knowles (of "Ain't It Cool News" pseudo-"fame") once said in "index" magazine that there's a website which offers people the chance to kill someone for $10K, the proceeds of which (purportedly) goes to the murdered one's family;
- the film's budget is listed as around $1 million, but, arguably, it could have been shot for $250,000, given that it ONLY USES ONE LOCATION FOR THE WHOLE THING;
- a lot of the credited roles are by # ["A-K GUARD #1," "A-K GUARD #2," ... "A-K GUARD #10," etc., others listed as #1 - #10];
- there's a "body double" listed last, which I've never seen before ("STUNT DOUBLE"? maybe. "STAND-IN"? perhaps. But: "BODY DOUBLE" -- a term most often used for someone who does nudity in lieu of someone else -- NEVER!);
- a lot of the shots (in BOTH senses of the word!) seem to capture "involuntary" -- and, therefore, un-"act"-able, or un-"fake"-able convulsions [barring the use of off-screen electrical current application, of course!];
- weirdly, the "families of the [whole production]" are thanked in the end credits;
- also, one of the last credits goes ahead and asserts -- for some reason -- that the film conforms w/the "laws of Indonesia"!

Am I crazy? Paranoid? Jumping at shadows, here?

Well ...YOU BE THE JUDGE!!!
