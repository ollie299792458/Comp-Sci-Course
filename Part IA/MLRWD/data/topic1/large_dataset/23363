I rarely buy any movies any more because very few are worth the >$21 blu-ray price.  I rented "From Paris With Love" and my family and really wasn't expecting a lot.  This movie ended up far exceeding my family and my expectations and I quickly purchased my own copy (from Amazon).

"From Paris With Love" is one of the best fast-paced action movies that I've seen in the last twelve months. It has a very good plot and the actors were well chosen for their roles.  John Travolta stars as an on-the-edge, gung-ho government agent "Charlie Wax" whose job is to hunt down terrorists and stop their attacks.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays "James Reece" who is an aid to the U.S. Ambassador stationed in Paris.  James Reece reluctantly teams up with Charlie Wax to stop a major terrorist plot.

The blu ray picture and sound was outstanding.  We have a 118 inch projector/screen and didn't notice any picture defects.  The soundtrack was well balanced in that I didn't have to change volume settings between dialogue and action sequences.  We haven't taken a look at the disc special features, so I can't comment on this area.

Bottom line, "From Paris With Love" is a film that action fans shouldn't miss out on!
