Maybe I didn't really get this film for what it's supposed to be, but if you watch this movie expecting to see a horror film you'll come off somewhat disappointed. I'm sure it's another one of those movies that's much better as a book because as a movie it's just plain weird. It doesn't really make any sense, it just starts off with a bullied nerdy girl who then gets asked to the prom out of pity. You get about 3/4s of the way thru the movie wondering when the horror theme actually starts, almost as if it's a regular teen movie that they couldn't figure out how to end. Anyway a horrible prank is played on her at the prom with a bucket of pigs blood, she gets angry and burns the whole place down with everyone in it using her mind powers. She then goes home to her nutcase mother who tries to kill her because shes thinks Carrie is the spawn of satan or something. Using her powers she then makes knives and other kitchen utensils go flying into her mother. As Carrie is dying from being stabbed the house falls down, and the movie is over lol It's probably one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen! It just doesn't make any logical sense, but maybe that's the idea?! But to have Travolta listed on the cover is just stuntcasting, he's in it for all of 20 minutes. Overall this movie is fairly lame, I dont really understand why it gets so many stars by other reviewers. I guess because it's old and Steven Kings first book to movie people rate it for that alone, but it really is a whacked out film that doesn't make a whole lot of sense and never really moves anywhere until the last 15 minutes of the picture.
