This movie is a one of a kind work of art, shot in a one of a kind location, New Mexico.  A family who lives in an honest and simple  way can be dsyfunctional too.  Depression hits the dad, Sam Elliot -a long time favorite of mine, and he has no clue why or how to end it.  Mom, Joan Allen-also an excellent actress who shows us a character who is strong and unique, does whatever she can to bring his spirits back up, but really to no avail.  The daughter is captivating and will win your heart almost immediately.  Of couse this is really her story, as told by her, but she discovers the cure for her dad and it is priceless!  Then there is the Stray IRS agent who comes to collect back taxes but, just doesn't leave staying on, welcomed by this odd but endearing family living off the grid, and is in awe of the beauty of the New Mexian landscape .  He then discovers his real passion in life, explores and develops it and the result is a classic in my movie library.  On a side note, if you have never experienced the raw beauty of the New Mexico landscape and been captivated by the colors changing in the evening sky, this movie is a must.  Yes, I am partial to the state as a resident, but this movie captures the essence of why it is the Land of Enchantment!
