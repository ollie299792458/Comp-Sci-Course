This was a feel-good story lite on sap.  I hadn't wanted to see the movie because of the trailer.  After I watched it, however, I realized what an injustice the preview had done to the movie itself.

I loved the country setting and cinematography as well as the fact that most of the story unfolds in the 50s (maybe 60s?). Well-known stars and good acting help make this touching story a screen hit.

Without giving away vital details, a couple of old rogue-ish great uncles wind up caring for their great nephew that they've only recently come to know.  Not only are the men bachelors, they're mildly grumpy, and stuck in their ways.  Needless to say, taking care of a young boy isn't in their repetoire of experience or necessarily something they have much interest in doing.  Recounting their past grand adventures keeps the boy entertained and intrigued.  Listening to these stories, which are portrayed retrospectively throughout the movie, draws him closer to his uncles and they form a remarkable bond.  I found myself chuckling many times throughout the movie because of some of the uncles' antics.  Likewise, I felt heavy-hearted in some scenes because of the emotional burden the boy has to carry.

The movie won't appeal to everyone (my husband fell asleep while watching it), but I still highly recommend it.  Why four stars and not five?  This wouldn't make my top 10 list.  However, good story, good acting, well-directed and produced, a bit of humor, a bit of sadness, a happy ending...what's not to love?  Oh yeah, the trailer!
