Having just seen The Princess Diaries for the first time, I have several different thoughts on the movie, but first and foremost I am glad I read the books before seeing it.
The movie is entertaining.  It is also quite sweet and charming, but that tends in my opinion to be its downfall rather than a strength.  The books are engaging and laugh-out-loud funny, whereas the story here is drastically altered and toned down, so most of the laughs are no longer there.  Anne Hathaway is very pretty and appealing as leading lady Mia Thermopolis, but her performance is sort of bland.  Julie Andrews is far sweeter as her grandmother, Queen Clarisse Renaldi, than the deliciously evil character of "Grandm&eacute;re" depicted in the Princess Diaries books.  These weaknesses are somewhat compensated for by the addition of two great original characters: Joe (Hector Elizondo), who drives Princess Mia's royal limousine, and Mia's eccentric neighbor Mr. Robitussin.  Also fun to watch is Paolo, Mia's royal hairdresser, who always refers to himself in the third person.  I regret that I was unable to catch the names of these last two actors.
All in all, The Princess Diaries is an enjoyable film that you will probably like seeing, but the books are better.
