After reading the other reviews and after loving this documentary, because like most people from the United States, I didn't have much culture in film when I first saw this on TV, I must share that this documentary lists so many great films that most people have never seen. It also identifies a great period in U.S. cinema when many Hollywood studios made real and gritty movies like in independent film today. So if you want to educate yourself on Hollywood and U.S. film between the major changes of the old school glam and the new school blockbusters, this is a great place to start or continue your education. Keep a pen and paper handy to write down many great movies to watch!

I have not seen "Easy Riders Raging Bulls" nor "The Kid Stays in the Picture", but if you like documentaries about films, check them out too but "A Decade Under the Influence" is a great place to start. I also recommend "The Z Channel" for some of the best foreign films and many other obscure films to put on your list of movies to see. It also includes a dark and tragic story of a film lover who wanted everyone to see them.

If you've seen many of the movies from these times, you many not enjoy watching these documentaries. If you expect it to be a philosophical discussion of cinema and the change at the time, it probably will come up short. But if you're like me and you want to watch and learn about even a couple new movies you've never heard of, they're worth their weight in gold!!
