i would really like to give the film 4.5 stars, but i guess i'll settle for 4. i'll admit right up front i only watched this movie because i adore rdj. i knew nothing about diane arbus or the plot. and i was very pleasantly surprised. i know this is not an actual biography and that's fine. the movie is filmed beautifully. in some ways it reminded me of tarsem singh's magnificent "the fall." the entire movie, which is basically a love story between diane arbus and lionel sweeney and the world he inhabits, is beautiful. diane finds beauty where so many people see something "less than." we fall in love with that world as well. at least i did. robert downey jr was fantastic, as always. that man can say more with his eye through a keyhole than many actors with ten pages of dialogue.

if you're a fan of the absurd, the beautiful, the lyrical, (the fall, big fish, tv show pushing daisies,) i think you will enjoy this film. i can't recommend it highly enough, i was uncertain after reading all the negative reviews here, but i'm so glad i gave it a try. i got it from my library and now i will certainly buy it so i can watch it again and again. even the film score is lovely.
