I skimmed some of the bad reviews of this movie before watching it, and having seen it, I feel like these guys must have watched a different movie by mistake. Supernova isn't top-shelf sci-fi by any stretch of the imagination, but decent acting, plot, special effects, and settings make it a fun and enjoyable ride just the same. Speaking of rides, this movie might have one of the most stylish modes of FTL transport I've ever seen. Words don't really do it justice, but let me try: a beam of light shoots out of both ends of the ship, it gets enveloped in lightning, and then it rides the beam of light into a sureal acid trip. At the other end, another beam of light, like a spear from God, shoots out of nowhere and the ship arrives riding that beam like a monorail on steroids. Oh, and did I mention that if you're not in a special protective chamber when the ship jumps, you end up inside out?

Two things bugged me about this movie, but only a little:
1) The movie casts Robert Forster as the captain, goes to all the trouble to establish some personality quirks and flesh out the character a bit, and then kills him. It seems odd and wasteful.
2) While the actors are convincing, sometimes the lines and emotions they're acting out don't make sense in context, like when they make wisecracks just minutes after losing their captain, or confess dangerous secrets to total strangers.

There are a few minor plot holes and things that feel tacked-on, but it's no big deal. This is just one of those movies you have to enjoy without thinking about it too deeply.
