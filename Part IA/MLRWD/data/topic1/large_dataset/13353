The acting: Toni Collette & Marcia Gay Harden either/or are enough to make me watch a film.  The latter did not disappoint.  Maybe I'm too amateur to understand Collette's character but to me it seemed unbelievable & since the storyline seemed to provide the goods, I generally deem that bad acting.  Somebody note me & tell me why I'm wrong because Toni Collette & bad acting don't belong in the same sentence.  Brittney Murphy (who knew, I thought she was a Paris Hilton-type) was amazing.  I take back my former thoughts of her & will see what else she has been in.  Lots of other great smaller parts, too, even the butch lady working at the No-Tell Motel & 'the sister.'  The film: really enjoyed it although vignette films never give me enough, I always wish they were 10 hours long so each vignette was movie length.  (That's not the movie's fault, just my rambling opinion.) I felt the film answered all my questions, segued nicely & didn't unnecessarily sanitize or state the obvious.  What more could I ask for?
