Aladdin is a triumph for disney.  Along with Lion King, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I loved the Genie, voiced by Robin Williams, and his humorous antics and impersonations.  I couldn't stop humming along with the songs as they played.  The animations is spectacular for a disney movie.  I couldn't stop laughing at the scene where the Genie says, "...Jafar, Jafar, he's our man, if he can't do it..GREAT!"
And I loved how Iago was the perfect foil to Jafar, a serious villain.  I also enjoyed the love story that unravels around Aladdin and Jasmine.  Jasmine is the girl that every guy wants, and Aladdin is the sweet, handsome young man that every girl dreams of.  I also enjoyed the personifications of the carpet, and his expressions.  Gilbert Godfried was the perfect voice for Iago.
I love everything about this movie, and can't wait 'till it comes out on DVD.  I've heard that it comes out in 2004.  I guarantee I'll be one of the first people to place an advanced order on Amazon.com for this DVD.
I loved it!
