I have loved Eva for almost 15 years - it was one of the anime that truly defined me as an otaku. While I was initially suspicious of the new Rebuilds, I have been pleasantly surprised. I was given the opportunity to see Eva 2.0 on the big screen last night, and I was beyond impressed. However, the quality of that screening was quite poor (it was almost like a fansub), and I'm eager for this blu-ray version.

I have one small quibble with this chapter of the Rebuild, and for people completely unfamiliar with the series, this will be a  VERY SMALL SPOILER, so you've been warned.

My beef is with the new pilot exclusive to the Rebuild: Mari Illustrious Makinami. While very cool, she feels completely tacked on, and not integrated well into the plot at all. She comes in, says some funny things, fights, and then...nothing. She's just a distraction. A mildly entertaining distraction, but an awkward one as well. If she was excised from the movie, it would not affect the story in any way, shape or form. I'm sure she'll become more important in 3.0, but for now...thumbs down.

Otherwise, this was an incredible movie. Miss it at your own peril.
