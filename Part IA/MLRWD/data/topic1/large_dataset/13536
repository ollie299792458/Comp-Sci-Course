The Zeferelli auto of his young life in Florence world war2 is a lovely picturesque tribute to the era. The English actresses and the american actresses here do no wrong.They look after the boy with great humor and  sensitivity. The sensitive and natural Joan Plowright combines with the  very charismatic Cher for some memorable acting.Cher is a stunning and  overlooked screen presence these days! The movie is really a great vehicle  for Cher to show her fashionable side and her work as Elsa the jewish  bohemian is akin to Auntie Mame as she shows the young director how to  live. This movie was a great crowd pleaser, though overlooked by the  academy this year. The scorpioni were perhaps too cute, and facism was  maybe too much a cartoon to tell the story with complete authority. We must  remember that it is from the point of view of a very young person, so  perhaps the overview would be less political. Franco has made a great movie  here even if it is perhaps too mild. It is said some of Cher's best work  was left out. Even so, there is some great acting here. Hooray for the  ladies!
