The 10th anniversary edition has enough to make any person without a DVD player happy (ezcept for the absense of an alternate widescreen edition).  It's a director's cut with about 5 minutes additional footage which  includes more to the sequence when Edward picks up Vivian in the Lotus, a  completely new sequence taking place the night of Richard's day off when  Vivian's unable to find Kit at the Blue Banana before being confronted by  Carlos and his thugs, plus many other small worthy additions.  One of the  new scenes removes a continuity error at one point in which Vivian takes  Edward's shoes off under the tree, before they miraculously appear back on,  by omitting the mistake and replacing it with footage of Richard and Vivian  riding horses.  After the movie they show the full-length theatrical  trailer, followed by a not-so-noteworthy behind the scenes featurette,  followed by the forgotten "Wild Women Do" music video by Natalie  Cole.  The tape is definately worth they money, I reccomend it to any fan  of the movie.
