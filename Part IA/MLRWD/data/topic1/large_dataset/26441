I just reviewed the Dirty Harry set and wanted to emphasize how nice these collections are. Though the movies are on flipper discs, the transfers are solid and there are a few extras included as well.

Lethal Weapon: A weary older cop is paired with a "crazy" young cop just as a Vietnam vet sets up a major heroin shipment
Lethal Weapon 2: Riggs and Murtaugh (and Leo Getz/Joe Pesci) are on the case of South African smugglers
Lethal Weapon 3: The trio (and Det. Lorna Cole/Rene Russo) go after a former officer who sells cop-killer guns to the streets
Lethal Weapon 4: The foursome (and Det. Lee Butters/Chris Rock) try to stop Chinese slave traders/counterfeiters

Just from my descriptions, you can tell there's a sense of progression in the films, and that's one of my favorite things about them. There's an amazing amount of consistency in the series - every movie has the same stars (and guest stars, like Murtaugh's family, who we get to see grow up), the same director, even the same score composer. It's fun seeing familiar sights as you watch the movies, and while the scripts aren't always perfect (3 drags and has some annoyances and 4 doesn't take itself too seriously), they're still a lot of fun!
