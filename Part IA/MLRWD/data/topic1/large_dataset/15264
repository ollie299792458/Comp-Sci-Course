I love to exercise and I'm really looking for a video whose content is not only solid but also a pleasure to view. I'm petty sure you can relate since when you buy these exercise videos your going to be watching them more than once, LETS HOPE. Well this DVD is pain and simple and by plain and simple I mean, oatmeal and water. Not fun, not interesting or exciting to do. It's just Jillian and three former contestants from TBL who to me are not inspiring to watch while doing exercise. Jillian in just a plain white set coaching each individual segment with one of the three contestants. Now I'm not saying that this DVD does not contain good material, it is basic get down and "do it" stuff. Like I said, oatmeal and water, both are good for you but do you really wanna have to do it everyday.
I only did one of the two DVDs once but I'm pretty sure the other one is the same. I'm still gonna give these DVDs a chance since I paid for them so I'll update in the future.
P.S.
I would give it 4 stars if the set and the people weren't so boring to look at.
