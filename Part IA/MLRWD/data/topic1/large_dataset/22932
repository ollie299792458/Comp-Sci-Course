"Shoot `Em Up" is an over-the-top action movie that starts off with a bang and doesn't slow down until the final credits roll seventy nine minutes later.  This is actually a live action version of a Bugs Bunny cartoon with Clive Owen in the role of the wascally wabbit and Paul Giamatti as Elmer Fudd.

The plot is..well, that's incidental.  What matters in this movie is that bullets are constantly flying and the body count is constantly rising.  If the movie seems silly and overblown it's supposed to be.  This is pretty much a parody of one of those silly action movies you might have seen Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger back in the eighties and nineties.  I realize this movie probably won't be for everyone (including those who don't like characters with necrophilia tendencies) but for those who just want to put there brain on hold for a little while you will probably have fun.

By the way, this movie has a pretty good soundtrack featuring songs from Nirvana, Wolfmother, AC/DC, Motley Crue, and others.
