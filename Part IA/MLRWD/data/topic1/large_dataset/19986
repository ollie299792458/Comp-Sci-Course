Before the Godzilla series spiraled into silliness in the late 60s and early 70s, Toho churned out a few decent films such as this one.  With great special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya, a brilliant musical score by Akira Ifukube, and non-stop action, Mothra vs. Godzilla is easily one of the best in the series.

Unlike the Showa films that followed this, Godzilla is portrayed here as an unstoppable, destructive force of nature.  In a series of impressive battle sequences that take up most of the second half of the film, Godzilla rampages across Japan and continuously defeats all of the military's plans to stop him.  Godzilla's battle with Mothra is brief but engaging, and while it's not quite the visual spectacle that the Yokohama battle in the 1992 semi-remake Godzilla vs. Mothra is, it still holds up well today.

Overall, this film is a must for any fan of the genre, and it is noteworthy for being the last Showa era film to portray Godzilla as a villain.  I can't help but think that if Toho had continued to make movies this good throughout the 60s and 70s, the Godzilla series would have been an even greater success.
