I first saw this movie not long after it was released at around the age of 12.  All I can say is that over the next couple of years, it haunted me in my sleep...literally!  I had nightmares about it for a LONG time.
Later in my teens, I saw it again, finally.  Didn't scare me as it did when i was younger, but I still appreciated it's raw gore and attempt to simply catch you off-guard for a good jump-from-your-seat scare effect.
Now, at 30, I had to order this on DVD.  You can bet I'm going to show it to my kids when they hit the age I was when I first saw it.  Will it have the same effect?  I HOPE SO!  If not, at least they'll see what scared the hell out of dad at their age and that's good enough for me.
I'll agree it has plenty of bad acting, a silly story-line and plenty of "fake" fake blood, but man, it is what it is...a horror film.  To me, this is just one of those pure horror movies that doesn't need anything other than what you see to freak you out.  Raimi did alot with a little in this one.  Late at night with the lights off and the sound up...only way to see this one!
