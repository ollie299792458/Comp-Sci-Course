This DVD won't be everyones cup of tea. Be prepared for a lot of new Alice on this. Personally I really like the newer stuff and Brutal Planet is a kick ass CD in it's own right.

The performance and stage show are great. You can check out the track listening to get an idea of the songs. Basically the first half is an interwoven new song/old song. The second half is pretty much older standard songs which you'd expect.

Some things to look out for are Vincents daughter who plays the nurse - a guide to parenting by Alice Cooper. It also has a few non standard songs on there like It's Hot Tonight.

The only thing that lets this DVD down is the mix of vocals which is atrocious. You can barely hear Alice over the band - maybe having a bad night? Doesn't sound like it, but who knows.

I'd buy this just for the fact it's a great show - however Theatre of Death is much better sound wise and I enjoyed it more than this one mainly because of the song selection.
