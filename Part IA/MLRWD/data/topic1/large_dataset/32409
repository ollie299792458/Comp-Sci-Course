I am a huge fan of the original mini-series!  This new series is one of the best re-imaginations of an old series that has been created!  The writers have done a great job setting up the story that we all remember while adding the newness that is required for television viewers of today.  The characters that have been created not only pay homage to some of the original characters, but are played very convincingly!  Anna, the Visitor leader, gives the fans an even more abominable villian than the outstanding Diana from the original series.  The mercenary, Kyle Hobbes, is a reflection of the original Ham Tyler, and main characters from the original, like Donovan and Julie, are seen through portions of the personalities of Erica Evans, Father Jack Landry, and Chad Dekker.  There is even an alien sympathizer involved in the resistance, even though the character of Ryan Nichols is much tougher than the mild-mannered Willie from the original series.  But keep in mind, you don't have to have any prior knowledge of the original series to enjoy this new one.

They have taken ideas from the original series like the peace ambassador program (visitor youth corp) and an alien baby being born (Elizabeth) and merged them with new ideas that have come together to hold the attention of those that are watching.  The episodes move very well with edge-of-your-seat excitement!  I really hope that ABC will renew the series for a second season!  This will be a great DVD to own to see how the series began or just to rewatch episodes to see things you might have missed the first time!
