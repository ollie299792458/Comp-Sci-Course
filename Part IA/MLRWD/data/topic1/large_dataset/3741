I KNOW it sounds dumb, but the un-edited cut of this movie is sooo much better that the one up for sale here!
If you're one of those people who CAN'T wait, or someone who would LIKE to see the un-edited cut, go to [...]!
They have the Turtles Forever Movie (Director's Cut!!!) and you can watch the entire movie! (No Charge)
For anyone who missed it when it played on tv, here's the basics.
The 80's turtles fall through an inter-demensional rip and land in the world of the Y2K turtles.  Not time travel, but another parellel universe.  After getting caught by the purple dragons (80's), the Y2K turtles bust them out and try to find a way to get them home.  Easier said than done, because Shredder and Krang (along with the tecno-drome) have fallen into the Y2K world as well.  After realizing there are 2 sets of turtles now, Shredder trys to find the villian that shares his name in this demension.  Using his transporter, Shredder bring back to earth.....
Yes, you gussed it, the u-trom Shredder that we saw exiled at the end of Y2K season 3. (And he has NO use for the Shredder that brought him back.)
Meanwhile, the Turtles (both groups) build a inter-demensional potal stick (I Know...Portal stick???) to get to the 80's demension to retrive their "Tecno-drome equitment", but before they can leave Hun and the foot break in to their home, grab master Splinter, and collapes the entire dojo.  The Turtles escape using the portal stick and land in 80'S Turtle land!  After a quick stop to save April, they pick up their Anti-Tecno-drome gear, and head back to the Y2K world.
I'm not saying anything more (that would be telling), but anyone who grew up with the 80's guys will appreciate this movie.  Caution: Many bad puns and mutagen ahead!!!

(Our Shredder's not like yours! He's viscious!  Tough! Competent!!!)
