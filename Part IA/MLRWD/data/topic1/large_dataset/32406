"The Edge" is without doubt one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. The flick is outstanding on virtually every level: cinematography, acting, suspense, score, locations, subtext, etc. The story concerns three men who get stranded in the remote Northwest wilderness. The plane crash that causes their predicament has got to be the best such scene ever filmed, looking very real. Although nature itself presents some harrowing dangers for these men (especially in the form of a kodiak bear), one of them finds out that the biggest danger is HUMAN nature -- in the form of covetousness, adultery, greed and murder.

Anthony Hopkins stars as an intellectual billionaire who is insecure about his accumulated wealth of (seemingly useless) knowledge, his money and his beautiful model wife played by Elle MacPherson. He's not sure who he can trust, or who is really his friend just for the sake of such. He's a bit paranoid that people will naturally assume his wife married him just for his money. Then he suspects that she's having a fling with her photographer, played by Alec Baldwin.

All this is the character backdrop to what is essentially a grand survival adventure. The entire mid-section of the film involves their encounter with the bear that stalks them. This chapter of the story could be called "Claws" ("Jaws" with a bear). The men work themselves up into a savage frenzy in their determination to kill the bear.

Hopkins and Baldwin must ultimately face their greatest natural threat: eachother.

The movie also has depth in the form of a potent message on the human condition and the power of repentance and forgiveness.
