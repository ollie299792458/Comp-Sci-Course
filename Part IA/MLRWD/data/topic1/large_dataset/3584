A Clockwork Orange was written and Directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1972. It stars Malcolm Mcdowell. It was originally rated x. Today, you'll find it under an R rating, though its still kinda strong for an R. It was based on a book by Anthony Burgess. Anyways, being a fan of some of Kubrick's other work (2001 is one of my all time favorite films, Dr. Stangelove I love) here's what I have to say about this film; first of all, it's overrated. This is not Stanley Kubricks masterpiece. I've never liked Voice- overs and this film has too much of that. I've also never liked overly pretensious or arty films, and this one at least qualifies in the overly pretensious category. There are some very good scenes, like the scene when alex knocks all his buddies into the water without warning. The gang fight scene is well done. There's no denying that this is a cinematic masterpiece and it certainly is disturbing at times, though i think that for all of its' intoxicating effects, the film was sort of an evolutionary step towards really [crummy] movies like Fight Club. In case you want to know, the film contains stong Violence and Sexuality, nudity and brief profanity.
