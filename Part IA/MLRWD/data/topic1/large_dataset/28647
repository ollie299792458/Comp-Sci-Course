There's nothing like a film that doesn't go in the direction you expect it to. So often in movies today, the ending can be seen coming from 5 miles away. which is why a movie like "Identity" is so refreshing. During the course of this film, you will think you have it all figured out about 4-5 times...only to have another twist thrown at you. The plot: a seemingly random group of people, who through seemingly random circumstances, become stranded at a small roadside motel during a rainstorm. One by one, they start dying under bizarre cicumstances, and the survivors attempt to figure out what is going on, and why. There are many subtle side-stories that mesh together nicely, and thanks to an excellent cast, headed up by the always wonderful (and here, slightly understated) John Cusack, you are drawn into this story, and want to find the answers as badly as the characters do. It is a credit to the screenwriter that the major plot twist comes across as being believable, rather then outragiously over-the-top. While some people may find it a bit confusing and hard to follow at the beginning, "Identity" is a wonderful, thinking-person's thriller that is more then worth checking out.
