I once owned this film on VHS and when I saw this film on DVD I was blown away by the quality of the picture.  Sure, the picture on my VHS copy was good, but the DVD blew me away! Colours were very solid and there was absolutely no "Chroma Noise" in the picture. Sean Connery was very good in his first time out as James Bond, although a little rough around the edges, but then you couldn't expect him to get it down right the first time!  The extras on the disc are fascinating as well. I found the trailers very interesting, but found the TV spots of the trailer rather grainy.  Also, a short documentary introducing James Bond to the world was very grainy as well. It's these two things that kept me from giving it 5 stars. However, I did find the radio ads for the film fascinating, who'd ever thought you'd be able to listen to the original radio ads for the film?  I didn't think they would exist in this day and age.  Finally, I enjoyed, for the first time, seeing the film in its original widescreen format I highly recommend this to anyone wanting Dr. No on DVD!
