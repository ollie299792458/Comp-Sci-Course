While, in ways, NBK is one of my favorite films of all time, it's terribly pretentious which is why I remain on middle ground about it's rating.  Like others have said, Oliver Stone was the films flaw.  Had it been Tarantino-esque in it's directing, I think it would have had more appeal, and less of the headache flavor.  Whatever the subliminalism in the sometimes stupid camera work is distractiong and really detracts from the replayability(sp?) of the film.  Intense films are wonderful, but it can't be so intense that it's impossible to watch it a few more times and take in the full picture.  Sometimes I believe that the real message is too overt, and sometimes I think it's hidden in the fact that there really isn't such a thing as good and bad.  Like a Yin Yang or something.  Our sympathy for Mickey and Mallory reflect the fact that they're not totally monsters, nor are many of us as normal as we would believe.  However, I believe Stone overshadowed some very important events in the story (Mickey's past) with exaggerations of relatively mundane events (the shrooms, the Indian killing) and tried to shove the spoils of infamy down the viewers' throats.  Mickey's version of Charles Manson was sort of cool, but also it evoked a feeling of "what is this guy on" as he tried to disset the philosophy of murder.  It was also unbecoming with actual murder scenes.  Mickey ranted about the purity of murder, but it was very apparent that Mickey and Mallory first killed for the thrill of people dying, and also as a manifestation of their neglect through media coverage, and in the latter part of the movie simply killed for necessity.  A good foundation, but the walls are a little crooked and the building material shaky.  I believe Tarantino should've undertaken his script and shown us the story, rather than Stone showing us a story and breaking the flow every few minutes to point out the cause and effect mechanism of the characters' depravity.
