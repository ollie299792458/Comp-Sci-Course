There are bad films, good films and a few masterpieces. This is one of the few.
We see: Liberty, economy, democracy... good words, great ideals, but from time to time, until now, these principles must be defended with a gun, a Colt 45: an human limitation, but resigning is poor. Not in vain stock market has the terms "Bull or Bear market". For me this signifies behind richness and wealth, there are an animal, irrational but unavoidable shadow at less until now: in this superb film that animal are Liberty Valance, and he menaces democracy, but there was an ignored man who killed him.
Ramson Stoddart is a good, able lawyer, he wants people in the Far West can be able to read, schools, laws.
But there's no law excepting these of the revolver. Tom Doniphon doesn't know much about paper laws, but he's strong and speedy with his gun. He knows the beautiful Hallie doesn't love him, and feeling all that, he kills the psychopatic murderer who is Liberty Valance, the gunman at service of the big,  oppressive cattlemen, and with that fact, he brings liberty, democracy while he retires voluntarily to a lone, sad existence: no doubt, democracy has a price. Doniphon is a  tragic figure, perhaps he don't understand ver well what he has done and why, but he's essentially a good man who believes in justice.
