I get the people complaining about Judd Apatow. I don't get how they could hate this film simply because he produced it.

First of all, I'm not a fan of Apatow. I hated Superbad super badly (everything about that movie made me cringe; especially the not-at-all-impressive acting by nerd-typecast Michael Cera). Knocked Up was a ridiculous piece of crap--- a completely forced comedy. Step Brothers and Anchorman were awful despite the fact that I love Will Ferell. 40-Year-Old Virgin and Fun With Dick and Jane are his obviously failed attempt to attract comedy-genre lovers using big names like Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey.

With that said, I love Forgetting Sarah Marshall. It is a well-written, catchy comedy that will have you laughing the entire time. The antics of each character are well honed and I think the over-all chemistry among the male characters are the funnest to watch. Sure, some of the jokes are overly sexual but to be honest, I was more focused on how disciplined were the deliveries of punchlines. From the simple "you sound like you're from London" to the exacerbated Dracula Song--- all of it made me laugh.
