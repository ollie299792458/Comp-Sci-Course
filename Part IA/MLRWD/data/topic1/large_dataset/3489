"Torch Song" is fun to watch, but not as much so as I'd expected. Parts of it are downright dull, and one really has to pay attention to have any clue what's going on.
 I still don't know why everyone seems to practically worship Jenny Stewart( Joan Crawford), especially when she's such a pill. The only reason that Jenny falls for Tye( Michael Wilding) is that he WON"T take her abuse. She respects him, I guess. But she seems very confident that he'll melt like everybody else when she decides to beckon. Yeah, sure.
 My favorite part is when, in a typical hissy after the "Two-Faced Woman" number( calls to mind Meredith Brooks' "I'm a B****")Jenny rips off her black wig, revealing orange hair that is rather jarring combined with her fake-mulatto makeup. Yuck.
And she's even grouchy with Michael Wilding's guide dog.Carol Burnett's parody, "Torchy Song", is lots better than the original.Devout Joan Crawford fans( and there are bound to be some) should opt for "Mildred Pierce" instead.
