I was not aware that a movie had been made based on the book as I happened by it on a shelf in the video store. I'm typically drawn to movies based on classic literature. Though I've yet to read the book (so I don't know if the movie strays), I hoped the movie would be worth watching.
Nicholas Nickleby is a beautiful film. The acting is wonderfully done. Especially by Charlie Hunnam (?), Christopher Plummer, and Jamie Bell. Alan Cumming and Nathan Lane are delightful. I loved every minute they were on the screen. The young lady who plays Nicholas' sister is lovely to look at, gentle of spirit, and her face radiates innocence. Anne Hathaway (sp?) does a fine job portraying the sweet Madeline.
The story (which has already been summarized quite well) is very touching. If I'm moved to outward response, it has to be good. I found myself cheering on a couple occasions. Especially the scene in Dotheboys when Nicholas comes to Smike's aid.
The country scenery is lovely and beautifully filmed. I would've loved to have seen more of it.
You will find yourself embracing those who are good and waiting anxiously for the demise of those who are evil. Nicholas Nickleby will move you, inspire you and warm your heart.
