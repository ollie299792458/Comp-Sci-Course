There isn't a shred of intelligence or emotional truth in this mess.  Nobody's likable or identifiable, none of the jokes are funny, none of the semi-serious moments are insightful, and any and all allegedly factual moments are either invented outright, exaggerated beyond all recognition, or fictionalized to the point where the supposed reality of Tucker Max's juvenile exploits ceases to be a draw.  Why, exactly, is anybody supposed to watch this?  What purpose could there be for the waste of time that this represents?  The flaws are so self-evident that MST3King it would serve no purpose, and besides, the film exudes so much lameness that any attempt to riff on it would be killed outright.

Compared to The Hangover, which succeeded marvelously in every respect, I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell is like the first timer at open mic night: it not only embarrasses itself, but it induces cringing in anybody who happens to be watching.  If you get it as a gift, return it.  If you don't have a gift receipt, use it as a frisbee or a coaster.  Just hope that so much money was flushed during this project that nobody who backed it will be involved in any future films.
