You've probably never heard of this movie, and gotten here by mistake. But do yourself a favour, and read on. Please.
This movie is my third favourite movie of all time (1. the crow, 2. Fearless.)
The movie is a classic about a more hidden mafia organisation gone in hiding, and Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia (Andy Garcia) trying to live a normal life again. His new found job doesn't really pay as much, and his temptation for one last job with the boss himself "Man with the Plan" (Christopher Walken.)gets the better of him. 
What happens next is up to you to find out, but I promise you: Loads of action, drama, humour, and GREAT acting is what you'll experience in this great flick! Christopher Walken gets a role he really shines in, Andy Garcia is nothing else but spectacular, there is even a little extra sparcle when Steve Buscemi enters the scene as assassin Mr. Shhh, and actually EVERYBODY in this movie does a marvelous job in their specific roles giving this movie the "real feel".
The extras are just clips from interviews with the actors. Some of the interviews seem to jump in the middle of a conversation, and it is hard to get to grips with what is actually being said. A more throughout interview with Walken himself, and more of Garcia, would have been preferred. But nonetheless, this is a DVD you can not afford to miss if you call yourself a fan of movies.
