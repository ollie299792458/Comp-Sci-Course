This is one of the best movies of the past year and if it wasn't released so early in the year would be generating Oscar type buzz.  I finished watching this for the second time tonight and was just as blown away by this film as when I saw it in the theater.

Who would have thought Joseph Gordon-Levitt from Third Rock from the Sun could give such a brilliant film performance.  He plays Chris Pratt, a former star high school hockey player, suffering from short-term memory loss as a result of a tragic car accident.  Not only did the accident kill his best friend and his best friend's girlfriend, but ended his promising career.

Jeff Daniel's is not a favorite of mine, but he gives an equally brilliant performance as Chris's blind housemate.  All of the supporting roles are cast perfectly with Isla Fischer delivering a surpisingly strong performance.

This movie resonated with me in a similar way that Memento did (for obvious reasons).  I saw them both right when they were released and came away thinking about them for weeks after I saw them.  The last 30 minutes of this film are absolutely riveting with Gordon-Levitt turning in a performance that is definitely Oscar worthy (even though I am certain the Academy will overlook him).  A pure and simple gem of a film.
