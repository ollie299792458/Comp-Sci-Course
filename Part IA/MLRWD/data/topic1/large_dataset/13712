This movie was just terrible.  Even if we'd been able to stream it for free I would still be here writing a negative review...alas, I paid $4 for this stinker.  The previews did a fair job of "selling" the movie, but, honestly, the two scenes in the previews that made us chuckle are not even funny when seen in the context of the movie.  Johnny Depp is brilliant as Jack Sparrow (and in so many other roles), so we hoped that that same subtly smarmy charisma would be evident in this movie.  Sadly, there's nothing subtle about his character, Barney, in this film...he's just plain smarmy.

The violence (Barney is a vampire, after all, and he does feed on people) is unnecessary and decidedly NOT funny.  Yes, I get it...it's a dark comedy.  And it is dark...it's just not very funny.  If Barney's disregard for human life was intended to add depth to his character in some way, then it failed.  Instead, it made me just not like him much at all.

I was also suprised by the sexual content...nothing graphic, mind you, just inappropriate for younger kids.  I came within seconds of turning it off and not allowing my 14 yo to watch the rest of the movie.  Under current "standards," the movie isn't exactly rated R, but it's just too offensive to be comfortably in the PG-13 camp.  It saddens me that the "powers that be" in the MPAA consider material like this suitable for kids as young as 13!  And I'm sorry I can't provide any solid examples from the movie...I've just spent the past two days purging it from my head. =D

So unless you are a HUGE fan of the Johnny Depp/Tim Burton/Helena Bonham Carter team, I suggest you skip this one.  And certainly don't let your kids (mid-teen or younger) watch it!
