...is so they can watch ghodawful "but it's got *CARTOONS* in it, Poppi!" beasts like this one in a soundproofed room somewhere far away from anyone over the age of eight-and-a-half. 
Look, I took my kids to see this turkey in its initial theatrical release, cringing throughout every one of Helen Reddy's noxious songs, because my wife insisted that the children would like it.  When it came out on videotape, I gloved up and bought the damned thing because my wife insisted that the grandchildren would like it.  She is now on notice that if she insists on getting this Disney disaster on DVD, I will consider it grounds for divorce.  
PETE'S DRAGON is an insult to the intelligence of everything with a central nervous system above the evolutionary stage of the common garden slug, and even garden slugs tend to writhe in agony when they hear Helen Reddy sing.  I shudder to think of the ecological impact of getting her work from this flick onto a home theater with adequate amplification and DVD fidelity. 
There are definitely Disney productions worth translating skillfully into digital videodisc format (FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR being one example), but this boojum belongs on your "lend-and-forget" list if you should ever be so unfortunate as to come into possession of a copy.
