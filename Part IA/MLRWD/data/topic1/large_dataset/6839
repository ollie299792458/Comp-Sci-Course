This is a sweeping statement, but true nonetheless:  I believe that Kenneth Branagh's HENRY V is the greatest screen adaption ever done of Shakespeare.  Period.  Better than Olivier (although he was great in a very  diferent way).  Better than any version of Hamlet (even Branagh's, which is  the best of the Hamlets).  Better than anything else.
Why do I say this?  Simply because no other film adaptation of Shakespeare has captured the  essence of what the Bard was trying to say while adding a modern  perspective in the process, all in a manner that is readily accessible to a  mass audience.  Yet that is precisely what this film does.  
By sheer  genius, Branagh was able to present HENRY V in all of its nationalistic  glory, just as Shakespeare wrote it, while at the same time adding an  anti-war footnote that serves both as counterpoint and commentary on the  Bard's message.  The contrast betwen the St. Crispin's Day speech as  presented here (in which we are made to feel the real power behind  Shakespeare's words) and the gritty, realistic presentation of the battle  itself which follows is proof of my assertion.  
It's all here:  Lessons  on history, loyalty, and the qualities of leadership, all wrapped in a  fiercely entertaining package.  Branagh's great accomplishment is to bring  the piece to life without the slightest bit of stuffiness or anachronism,  and even to add his own touch to an unapproachable masterpiece.  This, his  first film, remains his crowning achievement.  I think the Bard would  approve.
