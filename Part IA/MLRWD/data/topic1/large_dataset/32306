It's all been said by most everyone else regarding this season and the last.  What a letdown to wait so many years for these releases only to get episodes where the most important character, the music, has been deleted.  I add my voice to the complaints just in case the powers that be read these reviews.  I wrote the following as my review of the first season's release.  The same holds true for this one.

"I agree with the other reviewers who thought: At last! My favorite show, characters I will never forget and now don't have to. The episodes are there, so I am happy. But, except for the neat zip-up parka packaging, the producers of this set should be ashamed of themselves.

Surely they could have included more outtakes, commentaries, etc., like all the other DVD's out there. The very least, they should have included a package insert listing the episodes with their synopses. For the price, this is the cheapestly produced DVD set I've yet to see.

If not for that, I'd have given it five stars."

And truth be told, after watching the dvd's, I took out my old 'off-the-tv' reruns and watched them.
