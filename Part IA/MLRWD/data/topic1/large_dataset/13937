Surely I'm biased - as a youg kid, I dreamed of becoming a Disney animator (sadly unfulfilled) - but I believe 'Sleeping Beauty' has the most incredible art and music of all of Disney's efforts to date.  I rent other Disney DVDs from local library for my kids, but this one I bought.  Unlike the 'Lion King' special edition - which I found not-so-special - this one is truly well-done and worth a purchase.

Positives:

- High-quality digital restoration resulted in eye-popping color and details presented in 70mm widescreen format.

- Tchaikovsky's music is timeless in its power to mesmerize, and matched up perfectly with synchronized masterful animation.

- The supplemental second disc is unusually excellent both in breadth of content and the quality of presentation.

- There's a restrained, formal quality to 'Sleeping Beauty', akin to classical ballet, which provides a such pleasant contrast to the increasingly shrill Disney offerings of the late Eisner era.

- The painstakingly hand-drawn background and characters are simply awe-inspiring in their unique artistry.

- The sheer grace and elegance of the characters, as well as the consummate artistic skills of their rendering have NOT been matched by any other Disney films, generally as good as they are.  (I was disappointed by the comparatively amateurish art of 'Little Mermaid' and 'Beauty and the Beast'.  It was not until 'Finding Nemo' that artistic animation again made my jaw drop and stay there throughout the film.)

Negatives:

- This work was done almost half century ago, and the age does show in this time of computerized animation.  The most noticeable flaw is when Malicifent first appears literally with a bang, yet the characters in the background remain absolutely still.  This detracts from the power of this moment; rationality dictates that such an apparition would have caused shock and panic among the crowd.  Contrast this with the animated crowd scenes in 'Hunchback of Notre Dame', or the constantly dynamic background of 'Bug's Life', in which every blade of grass sways with the wind.

- The classical elegance of the story and characters means certain dignity and restraint (contrast this with the gross-out jokes of 'Lion King' and endless wisecracking of 'Aladdin').  In my opinion, this is a major plus, since this would make  'Sleeping Beauty' a true classic (like the best works of DaVinci and Michaelangelo) that will survive the test of time for decades to come.  However, in today's world where attention-deficit rules, its lack of cloying cuteness and 'Fear Factor' gross-outs may not win this film a general popularity contest.
