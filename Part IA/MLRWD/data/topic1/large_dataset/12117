First of all, you have to remember that this is a sci-fi comedy based on a comic book!  It was never meant to stand up against George Lucas' other sci-fi giant "Star Wars".  
Sure, the story line is preposterous. A science experiment gone awry, transports to Earth a lone "person" from a semi parallel universe where the predominant species are ducks. Is that harder to believe than a high-school kid who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and starts to grow silk glands, spin webs and climb straight up vertical walls? No, and yet "Spiderman" was one of the biggest hits of the year, and was slated for a sequel before it even hit the theaters.
Yes, "Howard" is filled with "predictable, cheap one-liners." ("Howard, duck!" "And proud of it!") Look at any Mel Brooks or old Bob Hope film. What are they full of? Predictable, cheap one-liners, yet they are some of the funniest movies ever made.
And what about the acting? Well, I feel that the then pretty much unknown Tim Robbins' portrayal of the nerdy lab assistant was suburb. He actually made the geek that much more believable. Jeffery Jones as the scientist whose body is taken over by the monster alien is absolutely perfect in the restaurant scene. ("She took my eggs!")  And what can I say about the lovely Lea Thompson, except she is wonderfully fresh, and even does a fantastic job with her own singing.
All in all, you have to ignore the turkey critics on this one and see for yourself. If you give it the chance it deserves, Howard the Duck will make you laugh and cry at the same time, and that is a sign of true comedy genius!
