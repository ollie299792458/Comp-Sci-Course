This movie serves as a warning of what could happen to our people and our planet.  A corrupt, ruined, stripped planet, with all the hot weather effects warned about by our current scientists.  As it has been said, "Power corrupts, and absolute power courrupts absolutely".  This has been one of my favorite sci fi movies.  It was made before all the fancy special effects movie makers have at their disposal now.  More good acting, less made up graphics.  The cast was superb, the story flowed well, and it was quite beliveable.  The corruption that surfaced throughout the film was both horrifying and likely in those conditions.  This movie shows an extreme division between the "haves", and the "have nots".  There are only a select few enforcers, not unlike the SS, who are themselves "have nots" and the corruption of their group springs from that lower position.  All in all, a horrifying and convincing "possible future" for our world, given the direction it's going these days. Hopefully, in the year this movie was to dipict, things won't be that bad.  But time will tell. News at eleven.
