Having seen various other versions of Shackletons' expeditions I was surprised that this one portrayed Shackleton as a selfish, shallow womanizer. Perhaps I'm not British enough to find his dalliances amusing or interesting. The "manly, man's man" comes across as one incapable of holding any moral high ground and becomes quite oddly subdued when confronted with his very unintimidating wife concerning his unfaithfulness. He seems devoted above all else to self interest. The mighty Shackleton it seems didn't have any real skills for employment.
 His selfishness and pride made him deaf to good counsel, and so he put his trusting crew in mortal danger. He's not a hero, simply a proud man running away from himself while chasing after self gratification, and glory. The stories of Shackelton's explorations are much more interesting than the man this movie makes him out to be. In this version he is not so much a heroic explorer as he is a bumbling survior obssessed with the idea that playing explorer will make him more of real man and give his life meaning.
