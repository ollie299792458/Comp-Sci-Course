I guess I am the only person who did not enjoy this dvd.
It felt more like a modern dance class than yoga.
Shiva did not do any prep to open up the hips and thighs before moving into some fairly advanced poses. She also didn't hold any pose long enough to really be able to breath into them and her instruction was basically non existent.

There was no "flow", the transitions from one pose to another were cumbersome and unnatural. At least in the practice I did, which is the 51 minute water-heart-air-forwards bends, there were no true vinyasas - I would not have called it "vinyasa flow".

I am a Yoga Instructor myself and, after hearing so much about Shiva Rea, I was really looking forward to getting this DVD. I truly wish I could have given it a more positive review. I let a couple of my students try it also and they too did not enjoy it.
Perhaps it is because I am used to a more Ashtanga based practice, but this really didn't feel anything like yoga to me.
