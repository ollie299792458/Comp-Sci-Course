Is it a decent movie?  Well, in my opinion it's fair.  If you like action flicks, it's probably worth a view.  However the maniacal producers behind this movie have decided to declare war against fans, filing thousands of lawsuits against those who dare to download this movie via BitTorrent or P2P networks.

These shotgun lawsuits inevitably catch the innocent (Google it, you'll see), but this is something the morons behind Hurt Locker consider acceptable collateral damage, I suppose.  The mass lawsuit campaign sure worked out well for the RIAA, didn't it?  Metallica sure has done well since they helped bury Napster, haven't they?  Apparently, those who fail to learn from history are indeed doomed to repeat it.

Nothing these idiots are involved in will ever earn any money from me, my family, or my friends, ever.  Their crusade will do more harm to their brand than any revenue they might actually scrape up.  Nicolas Chatrier got barred from the Oscars because of his insane hatred and has arguably (and in a very short time) attached more infamy to his name than Manson could ever dream of.

I'm not here to justify file sharing, or uploading/downloading copyrighted content.  I am here to say one simple thing to the producers of Hurt Locker...

You're doing it wrong.
