Now we're talkin'! This ECW video is the BEST ECW video ever!  The first match is a fatal four-way elimination match up featuring Pit Bull # 2  vs.  Shane Douglas  vs. 2 Cold Scorpio vs. Chris Jericho. This match is rather long but still pretty fun though. Francine gets powerbombed through a table near the ending of the match.
The second match is much better, pitting "Mr. PPV" Rob Van Dam against Bam Bam Bigelow. Rob Van Dam throws Bigalow to the front row of the audience and then jumps onto him from the top turnbuckle in the ring! And then, RVD does it AGAIN! You've gotta see it to believe it! The 3rd match up is definetly not for the faint of heart and DEFINETLY NOT SUITABLE FOR KIDS! The Sandman takes on Sabu in the very first "Stairway to Hell" match up, a match in which barbed wire is hung from the ceiling to become the ultimate weapon. This was the most violent war I have EVER seen! Sabu stabs The Sandman with a pair of ... scissors and wraps his head up in the barbed wire! Sabu breaks his jaw over the metal guard rail and begins bleeding from his mouth! You watch this match and tell me it's "fake". The Sandman's face gets covered in blood and so does his shirt! And the fourth match up is just as graphic. Ian Rotten takes on Axel Rotten in a Taipei Death match: Taped fists covered in BROKEN GLASS! And the last match is a Three-way Dance, pitting Jerry Lynn against Tajiri and Super Crazy in a match up of amazing display you'll have to see to believe! THIS VIDEO IS THE BOMB!  GET IT!
