Ok, let me start off by saying that i enjoyed this movie. It was better than King and Arthur and that horrible Alexander. But it isnt even in the same ballpark as Gladiator, which Scott also directed.

Kingdom of Heaven had tremendous battle scenes and swordplay and was one of the most beautiful shot movies ive ever seen. The snow scenes and desert scenes were breath taking. The colors and environments stood out and looked wonderful.

On, the other hand, i wasnt too pleased with the characters personalities, or lack there of, in this film.

None of the characters truly stood out as someone you can 'root for.' Bloom lacked the power of Crowe, Gibson, or even Clive Owen. And like one other reviewer mentioned, Blooms speeches in this movie were laughable and didnt inspire as much as William Wallaces or Theodens from Lord of the Rings.

And the pace of this movie, while fast and exciting, didnt give its characters any justice. Bloom leaves his town so fast. Joins his father in 5 minutes. Forgets his dead family quick. Falls in love 5 minutes later. Saladins sister is introduced and killed in 30 seconds total. Everything happens way too quick. Nothing is built up.

All in all this was a pretty good movie but it falls right smack in the middle. Not nearly as bad as an Alexander but nowhere near a Gladiator either.
