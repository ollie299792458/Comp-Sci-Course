BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is one of the most inventive movies I've ever seen.  The central conceit is clever and original, but the genius of the movie is that dizzying variations on the idea are worked smoothly into the plot and  used to reveal the devices and desires of the characters.
The choice of  John Malkovich as the MacGuffin is, in retrospect, obvious.  It is hard to  imagine another actor with a public image that would work so well (consider  BEING BURT REYNOLDS).  The entire cast does a suberb job, and even Charlie  Sheen appears in a rare non-gratuitous cameo.
Despite many comic moments,  this is a fundamentally tragic movie, reminiscent at points of the work of  Robert Aickman.  Desire, here, is a vacuum and personality is a deadly  trap.  "Consider the metaphysical implications!" says one;  "We could charge $200 a head," answers another.  Simple greed  appears healthy when compared to the grasping for control and immortality  that wins the day.  The redemption offered to a few characters by love is  anything but the typical tidy Hollywood escape (no one even gets to  "die for love.")
BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is delightful and  disturbing, a rare and magical combination.
