This has got to be the best movie nobody has heard about. Dex and his friends have perfected what they call the "Tao of Steve" as a way of winning over one-night stands. They define every male basically as belonging to one of two categories:
1. Steve. These are the guys you emulate by showing up, being excellent in a girl's presence, and getting the heck out. The way Dex describes it to one of his friends, men can only wait five minutes before hitting on a woman. Women, on the other hand, can wait ten minutes. So Steves wait it out so they become the chased, rather than chasing women and looking like fools.
2. Stu. These are the fools. They come on way too strong to women. The only way they see action is through pressing a woman into it. No glory here. Dex names people like Gomer Pile as a-list Stus.
The movie then shows how although Dex's rules are awesome for the single guy on the prowl, the [...] games don't work when you want to be honest and true to a girl you really care about. Dex pleasently breaks all of his own rules and looks noble doing it!
The icing on this movie is that it is so incredibly true. If I were five years younger when I saw this movie, it probably would've changed my life. It also explains (somewhat) to my satisfaction why guys who have a girlfriend/fiancee/wife always seem to get hit on when they go out with their friends. It's because they don't give a rip about women, and that perplexes the fairer sex. Watch this movie, then admire your friends who are Steves and laugh at the Stus.
