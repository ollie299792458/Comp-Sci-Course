I can't even put into words how brilliant Mr. Carey and Mr. Daniels  were in this dead HILARIOUS film! From the first scene (LETS PUT ANOTHER SHRIMP ON THE BARBE) to the closeing minutes (MY FRIEND HARRY HERE IS A LITTLE SLOW...THE TOWN IS THAT WAY) the movie is just packed with classic slapstick comedy. I'd have to agree with the millions of other people who think that this is the most fabulous comedy ever released. I even went through a period of about a couple months in which i watched the movie numerous times a week! ITS JUST THAT GOOD! Everytime I watch the movie to this day im always finding little spoofs that i never noticed before, even though ive seen the movie........oh i'd say about a good 80 times! I personally dont understand how anyone could give this movie 1 star and said that they FELL ASLEEP during it. that just REALLY PISSES ME OFF TO HEAR THAT. Anyone who doesnt find humor in this masterpiece obviously has no pesronality and sense of humor whatsoever. YOU GOTTA BE A LOWLIFE TO NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE. it blows every other comedy made out of the water in my mind. ITS THAT GOOD. havent seen it? SEE IT. dont own it? BUY IT. dont like it? DIE.
