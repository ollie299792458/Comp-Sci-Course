I recently saw this title on VHS, and was impressed with the animation. However, I quickly saw after watching it about 20 minutes why it didn't do so well in its theatrical run. 
While the voice talents of Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, John Leguizamo, et al should be praised, the overall story was somewhat implausible and, I felt geared toward a young-teen audience, probably folks around 12-15 years of age. The musical soundtrack backed up my theory on this. 
The overall story revolves around a ship known as the Titan, a ship built by humans in the early 31st century, which has the ability to actually create a planet out of nothing. An evil alien race known as the "Drej" swoop down on earth before the Titan can be fully activated, and completely destroy Earth. The human race, now a homeless, nomadic people, are relegated to the bottom of the galactic social order, and survive in "drifter colonies" made up of spaceships which survived the destruction of Earth. 
As the story unfolds, the young Kale, (Matt Damon) who was the son of the Titan project's leader, is found to be the key to finding the Titan, which was hidden from the Drej to protect it. Along the way, he meets a group of humans and aliens willing to help him - but do they have other agendas in mind???
Overall, this movie was entertaining, but I felt that it didn't take itself seriously enough to qualify as an animated space epic. The movie was also too short, and there are many plot holes which should have been better explained (Why would the entire project be entrusted to one small boy, and not a group of people?) Worth a look, and there's certainly room for sequels, but based on its poor performance at the box office, I wouldn't hold my breath too long.
