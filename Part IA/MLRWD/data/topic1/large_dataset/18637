Vin Diesel heats up the screen in yet another tough boy movie that shows us even muscle men can act when given a chance.

Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) Is a stunt fanatic who tries every death defying trick in the book, while filming it and selling them. Its a decent business I guess, and Xander thought so too, until he decided to steal Senator Dick Hodgekiss' car and drive it off the bridge.

Enter the FBI, led by I'm-going-to-haul-your-tail end-to-jail-where-you-wish-wheren't-born Mr. Gibbons (Samual L. Jackson) a man with a plan to get the dirties, meanest guy off the streets to work undercover and take down his unfortunate prey. A certain Russian that is under American survelliance because of his power and prestige in Prog.

Enter Xander Cage as Gibbon's lackey who despised all things in the American spirit and believes he lives soley for and to himself. That is, until he is sent to Prog, to discover that he is hard pressed to escape the long arm of Gibbon's.

There Xander discovers all is not well in Russia, a feeling that will soon overflow its banks and pour over into America, and the rest of the known world if the man is not stopped. So begins Xander's exhilerating journey through self-redemtion and the purpose to live as he falls in love and begins to live for one not himself. The ending is beautiful, and ending that is destroyed however by the directors cut and Rob Cohan's "Short movie on Xander's death." Word of advice, if you like triple x alot, don't get the directors cut to see this short flick. It will leave you tears of frustration.

A good spy movie in an unconventional sense, as our hero is bad and buff, and not in the least interested in saving our rear ends.
