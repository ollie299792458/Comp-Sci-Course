I'm very surprised at all the subpar reviews of this movie. Comedies these days aren't generally very fulfilling in terms of plot(just look at most of Sandler's earlier films). If you go into a movie like this thinking your going to be watching the next schinlder's list then you are going to be wildy disappointed. I mean look at the Austen Powers series, those movies were huge and there is absolutelly NO real plot in any of the three. Crap happens in them sure and it seems to flow in some general direction, but its just a vehicle for the bits stuck in between.

That said, this movie has some truelly hilarious moments in it and I think is one of Carrey's best. I'm all for movie's like 50 first dates or stuck on you which were very funny films but were still sweet and meaningful thematically, but this film is just hilarious and twisted, thats all there is to it. In no other movie can you find a scene of someone getting beat down by a sex-toy, no big budget movie anyhow.

If you love Jim Carrey then you probably love this movie, just don't go into thinking you going to get anything more out of it than the need to stitch your spleen.
