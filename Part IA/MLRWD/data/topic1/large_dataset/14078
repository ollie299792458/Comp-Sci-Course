I have to be honest and upfront about everything I write. I am forever linked to the Memphis Belle as my great uncle, Robert Hanson, was the radioman on the actual Memphis Belle on all 25 of her missions. I remember family reunions when Uncle Bob would borrow the actual film from Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane and show it to dozens of us. He'd mist up at every showing. It was this film that eventually was released as the documentary. I bought the VHS tape in the 80's.

When the Memphis Belle movie was released, the entire family went to the theater to see it. We knew that it wasn't going to be a true representation of the 25th mission of the Belle, but a compilation of what happened to the B-17 crews stationed in England. It was filmed in England and the surviving members of the Memphis Belle crew were "hired" as consultants, flown to England with their spouses, and had a wonderful time according to Uncle Bob. I have a picture that was taken of the movie's Memphis Belle crew and the actual Belle crew members. Many of the actors in the movie have gone on to have great careers. The filming inside the belly of the B-17 was amazing as it was to see the restored aircraft used in the movie. At a local air show, a B-17 was one of the many aircraft. I climbed that straight ladder into the center of the plane. I couldn't believe how narrow and tight the spaces were. What the men of the B-17 crews endured and what they did during WWII under such extreme circumstances is amazing. It is unfortunate that all Belle crew members are now deceased.

If you see this movie for nothing more than the historical value it offers, it is well worth it. It's imperative that we not forget the sacrifices made for us by previous generations.
