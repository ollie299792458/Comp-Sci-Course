When ever one looks in the bargain section of the local Borders or Best Buy, they can always find a copy of this film lurking around. But, the kicker is, the version that they are getting is most likely not the ultimate edition.

You miss out so much when you don't get the chance to see the original cut of a movie. Most of the time an editor or a director can achieve an entire change in plot by simply leaving certain snips of the finished cut out of the released cut. This is what makes the Mileston edition of the Phantom of the Opera so precious.

Not only does the DVD come with the 1929 edition of the film that most people can buy on the bargain shelves, but it also includes the very rare original cut of the film (I believe it was made in 1925). This original cut is several minutes longer than the later cut that has become so much more famous, and includes plot developements excluded from the later cut (such as more scenes concerning Roul and his brother, Phillipe, which make their relationship stronger; the original ending to the film; and several scenes that add both mystery and emotion to the character of the phantom himself).

Take the word of some one who grew up believing that the 1929 version was the best version ever produced of this film, there is so much more to offer with this Mileston edition! It is well worth it, and you'll thank yourself for buying this version.
