like the film itself, the vista series of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is designed for the enjoyment of both children and adults alike. i was 11 years old when this movie was first released, and i remember being completely blown away by it. this movie only could have come from the 1980s! the special effects would not have been possible previously, and there's no way disney would allow all the cursing and violence if it were being made today. when i watched this dvd, i had not seen ROGER RABBIT since i was a kid. as an adult and avid movie fan, i was still completely blown away! this movie is not only a technical achievement (no computers were used, all animation was hand drawn) but it succeeds on levels of creativity and entertainment as well. it really is a great flick.
disc 1 is for the kiddies, it contains the full-frame version of the movie and a couple extras that briefly go over how the movie was made and so forth.
disc 2 is for longtime fans and film buffs (the people dvds were made for in the first place). it contains the widescreen version of the film, plus tons and tons of supplemental material on the making of the movie. through interviews, rough cuts, on-set footage and more, you get to see every stage of production and all the info you could ever want on what went into making such a visionary film. this disc is loaded and will not disappoint.
WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is a classic because they just don't make movies like this anymore. this isn't a children's movie, it's a movie period. it doesn't insult the intelligence of its viewers and wasn't made to cash in. it has withstood the test of time, because i loved it as a kid and now with this special edition, i can enjoy it on a whole new level as an adult. my kids can watch the first disc and be completely entertained as i was, then as they get older they can dip into disc 2 and who knows? maybe they'll be inspired to get out there and bring their imagination to life the way these filmmakers did.
