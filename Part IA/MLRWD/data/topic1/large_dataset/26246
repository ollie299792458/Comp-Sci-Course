Being a fan of the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone and especially a fan of Leone's finest "Once Upon A Time In The West" starring Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards, and Claudia Cardinale (rent it sometime!), I was really very amused at Sam Raimi's choices of camera shots...they were, of course, taken directly from late 60's film! But, hey, that's okay. The film felt like a tribute and therefore, made it enjoyable to me.
My only real problem with the film is Sharon Stone. Don't get me wrong, I actually have a lot of respect for her and have enjoyed performances by her at other times, but she just didn't seem to have the right tone in this movie for me. I would have much preferred for Sam Raimi to make his tribute to the spaghetti western using the other two main characters -- Cort (the unbelievably talented, charismactic, brilliant Russell Crowe) and John Herrod (the also brilliant Gene Hackman). Cort was the most interesting character in the film and Russell really does make the perfect cowboy; Gene Hackman likes to chew up the scenery and a duel between these two is the film I'd like to see!
This movie is not a waste of time; but I found myself wishing for what could have been...Do you think Cort would have beaten Herrod, even with his left hand?
