I very recently bought the 40 GB PS3 and havent watched a decent amount of Blu ray titles to be able compare this release to. I will say that so far, from what I have seen, this Blu ray release is definitely top notch as far as PQ and SQ go. Colors were very clear and in many cases bold. I dont have an HDMI receiver so I was only able to hear the 1.5 mps DTS CORE track. Still, even that more then met my expectations. I can only imagine how good the uncompressed PCM track would sound. The only gripe I have is the fact that the "extended cut" edition of this movie wasent included. Space was obviously not a problem so FOX has no excuse. im willing to lay odds that sometime in the near future there will be yet another Blu-ray release of this movie with both cuts. I for sure wont double dip again. if you have an HDMI receiver you owe it to yourself to buy or at least rent this movie. You wont be sorry. As for the folks like me who only have a receiver with an optical connection. Were still getting one heck of a treat!
