This is the only American-made World War II movie I have seen that does not present US soldiers as heroes on the battlefield. Instead, it shows us the internal dynamics of US prisoners kept in rather good conditions in a German POW camp. The contrast between the treatment Germans accord to the Americans and that they mete out to Soviet prisoners is disturbing, as is the behaviour of certain white American prisoners towards their black comrades. Thus, the violence in this movie does not consist of hours of blood-soaked footage, but rather of the more subtle violation of human dignity.
The story revolves around a young lieutenant from a privileged background who cracks all too easily under German interrogation and spends the rest of the movie trying to earn the respect of his fellow inmates. His quest to redeem himself drives him into constant confrontation with the ranking US officer in the German camp, from which they both emerge wiser men.
This is a rather refreshing war movie, for it avoids overblown heroism and shows us, instead, the triumphs and failures of ordinary men caught in an extraordinary situation.
