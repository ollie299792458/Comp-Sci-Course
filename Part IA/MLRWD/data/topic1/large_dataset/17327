I spent over $800 on the VHS videos from Columbia House two decades ago. I spent less than $140 for the complete DVD set and discovered more treasures, rare filmed interviews, bonus extras and high-quality transfers that are far superior to what I have been watching the past 20 years.

The Serling blooper was the same featured in Season 1 box set. The color footage of "Miniature" was clearly from a VHS. But don't let that keep you from buying this must-have. The rarely seen hour-long episodes are available uncut and commercial free. Anne Francis gives a superb video commentary. The commercial billboards are great and perhaps the best of the season.

The retail price keep lowering over the months but by now it's beyond affordable. I recommend you grab this season box set today.

I also suggest you buy "The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD box set. Before or after you watch an episode, you can use the book to uncover the in-jokes, bloopers and trivia that make viewing these episodes fun. Watching the shows is one thing, knowing the behind-the-scenes stuff is even more fun. Both are available on Amazon.
