The notable quality of this 1955 Shakespearean rendition is that it is definitely not a filmed stage production but rather a movie conceived as such.  It includes for instance a wide variety of locations and camera angles, indeed perhaps too many.

As could be expected in a film starring and directed by Laurence Olivier, the acting is generally outstanding, except maybe for the death scene which is rather outr&eacute; for today's tastes.

By current standards, this production clearly benefited from a relatively low budget, with much money certainly going to the battle scenes that involve considerable cavalry.  Thus, the sets and the minimal special effects look tacky and require a major `suspension of disbelief'.  Though the costumes were undoubtedly designed with much care, they are garishly colourful and often plain ridiculous, including the crowns adorning kings and queens in their daily activities and ... the tights worn by many male actors.  The loud and syrupy music, typical of the 1950's, overemphasizes dramatic moments.

The DVD includes absolutely no bonuses, not even English subtitles that are so useful with a Shakespearean text.

Thus, this work will be of great interest only to Laurence Olivier diehards.
