This movie is Monroe's biggest hit,even though she's not in the film for the first half hour,but its worth the wait. When you see her walking on the train,pass Jack and Tony dressed in drag,the fun starts. Marilyn was three  months pregnet while making this movie. She really wanted this baby,but  lost it while making the film.Her performance was one of her best. Jack  Lemmon is fantastic in the film.He was up for an Oscar,and should have  won.He really gets into the drag part.Even when he gets engaged,he's making  wedding plans. I did't care for Tony Curtis's remark about kissing  Marilyn.He said he would rather kiss Hitler. She would take along time  making sure her scene was perfect,so the other actor had to make sure  everyone of his perfomances was the best because they would keep her  take.Billy Wilder's,Some like it Hot is one of his biggest films,and  Monroe's also. If I was only to have five movies,this would be one of them.  The best part of the film is the end,when Joe E Brown doesn't take no for a  anser from Jack,even when he takes his wig off,and says,"I'm a  Man."I still bust a gut at Jack Lemmon's eyes when  Brown  says,"That's OK,noboddy's perfect.
