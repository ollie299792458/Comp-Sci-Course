I relish a good mystery story, however this film's PR promised...BUT didn't deliver anything but unrelated past'n'present snapshots of a wounded RAF Airman's WWII recouperation--now confined to a wheelchair due to a spinal injury during combat--that never develops any cohesiveness, and then climaxes with a totally bizarre ending that is neither cathartic nor ties up any loose ends, of which many remain unresolved.  That the main character is betrayed on all sides is graphically portrayed, that he does have war time flashbacks and physical disability issues is all too true, but how the film treats them is fractured "film noire" at best. I have not yet read the book "The Haunting of Toby Jugg" from which the movie was adapted, I may have to if only to see what the author really had in mind.  Rated overall at 3-Stars, the reviews are worth reading as they zero in on more of the shortfalls of this film in which Robert Pattinson admirably portrays Jugg in his fall to madness--due to a thinly veiled conspiracy to make him so.  I'd recommend you to pass on this film as not worth the viewing but for Pattinson's performance.
