I'd heard about this movie so much and it was all raving. I read the write up and it sounded good. So I watched it. I don't care if this was good in it's time, that's nice but someone trying to pick out a movie now who does not prefer cheap terrible low budget 70's horror B-movies would not enjoy this. It was shocking all right! I sat agape in disbelief at how awful the acting was, that these ugly, silly bad guys were so inconsistent in personality. One scene shows a brutal violence by these unfeeling fiends followed by these odd pensive looks of.."Hmmm... maybe we made a mistake, gee I think I feel bad." and it was not at all genuine or believable. The parents, whoever they were played by are some of the worst actors I have ever seen. Sometimes it appeared people were having a hard time remembering their lines because the timing, the flow was all choppy. Ever heard of reshooting a scene and editing??  The music was to say the least inappropriate. The only light in this drastic darkness were the girls, the main character, Mari Collingwood was played by the only genuinely talented actor in the whole movie. If this movie broke new ground and by that led the way for other MUCH better films later to come then for that I am grateful as I am a very big horror genre fan. But that doesn't mean that it wasn't absolutely dreadful. I suggest that if you want something along the same lines but that is SO much better yet still is kind of dated, then watch "I Spit On Your Grave".
