I think Robert DeNiro should have gotten an Oscar for his performance in this movie.
I showed this movie to my students in a high school health course (with permission from parents since it is "R" rated).
Groups of usually ebullient students sat quietly transfixed throughout the movie. Comments were universally good. More importantly, follow-up discussion often displayed thoughts and insights previously uncharacteristic of the age group. The developmental importance of this at this age cannot be overstated. (See "Forms of Ethical and Intellectual Development in the College Years" by William Perry of Harvard. What he describes occurs also in high schools.)
Even if you as an adult watch this movie alone, I doubt you will be able to press the pause button. I also suspect you will be recommending it to friends.
Sadly, Netflix, Redbox, and Blockbuster Express either don't have it or won't get it to you anytime soon.
It is not expensive and well worth purchasing while there are still copies out there.
