Stevie Wonder has been around so long that I was hardly surprised once to find his CDs sitting in an "Oldies" section of Tower Records.  Yet he's in the prime of his career.  That much is obvious from _Live at Last_, his live DVD from a 2008 concert in the U.K.  This is a superb showcase, demonstrating the length as well as the depth of Wonder's repertory, and also showing how beautifully he has reconstructed tunes originally written in the recording studio with synthesizers for a large band.  Indeed, these superb musicians--two drummers, two guitarists, keyboardists, horn section--are given a large chunk of space to solo on the Chick Corea tune "Spain"--which, along with Miles Davis's "All Blues," constitutes two jazz tunes on this DVD.

But it is Stevie Wonder's songs that are so striking in this video.  From "My Cherie Amour" and "Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)," which date from the late 1960s, to tunes from his latest CD "A Time 2 Love," this is an astonishing repertory--and one the audience knew well, as they responded to Stevie's frequent requests to sing along.  (The predominantly white audience--well, this *was* England--was gently needled by Stevie when they sang about being "nappy headed boys" on "I Wish.")  Two hours hardly seemed enough time to sample it.  The tunes are presented not in "greatest hits" medleys, but given full-length performances, often with new arrangements to accommodate the band.  I can't recommend a better overview of the work of an astonishing American composer.
