I struggled a bit with how many stars to give this.  The quality, both technical and plot, were surprisingly good.  The sound and music were super.

That said, and this will seem a bit coarse, I like my trash to be trashier than this.  When I think "lesbian vampire," I don't think about it being implied.  I think about it being a bit more in my face than in my head.

I did like that a bit of the dialogue is in a Rob Zombie song.  I had wondered where that sound byte came from.  EDIT:  The song is Living Dead Girl.  "What are you thinking about?"  vhttbbb dddbbb "Same thing you are."

A fine film that I will watch again, I was just surprised at how tame it was.

EDIT:  I finally got around to watching The Blood Spattered Bride that came as a bonus disc in the same packaging.  I am amazed, but I liked it far better than Daughters.  BSB is down right creepy.  At no point was Daughters frightening, but BSB?  I'll watch it again (and I think my wife may like it) before I watch Daughters.
