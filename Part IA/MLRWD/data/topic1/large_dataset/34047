Guy Ritchie manages to stay true to Doyle's characterization of Sherlock Holmes, but more so than past films, this action packed movie highlights the martial arts skill in 'baritsu' that Doyle mentioned. When I saw this for the first time, my immediate impression was that there was much more overt violence here than in any other Holmes film I can recall, but the scenes are extremely well done and the actors are superb. Also, the cinematography was impressive, as were the costumes and sets.

The chenistry between Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Watson (Jude Law) is perfect, and it is fun to watch them play off each other with their intelligence, skill and humor. I'm grateful that Watson was accurately portrayed as an intelligent friend and partner to Holmes, true to Doyle's description of his character. I think that Conan Doyle would have been quite pleased with this film in all respects, including his love of the occult and supernatural.

I also note that there is a deeper, more purposeful aspect to this story referring to religion and politics and showing how those in power or aspiring to power often attempt to control the population through fear and terror. This happened in ancient times because people could not understand or control the forces of nature, and alas, it is happening now in many parts of the world.

Web news services recently announced that Guy Ritchie is doing a second Sherlock Holmes film, due December, 2011. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law will again play Holmes and Watson, and Stephen Fry will play Mycroft Holmes. It would be great to see the major players reunited for more superb films, and hopefully this will be the first in a series with many more Sherlock Holmes movies to follow! Bravo!
