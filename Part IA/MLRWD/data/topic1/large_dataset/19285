Kent State, Stanley Milgram's Obedience To Authority, Symbiopsychotaxiplasm, Billy Jack, The Most Dangerous Game, Soul On Ice -- it's all here and unique.  Peter Watkins makes Goddard look like a sellout.  This man is a true believer and has paid for it.  He's the kind of person so honest it hurts.  We need more of this kind of pain.  [Battle Royale is the work of someone whose life experience is comicbooks.]  What used to be called the anti-establishment and the flipside establishment are both playing out a fantasy here.  They all expose themselves.  He's a filmaker as stident and uncompromising as Ralph Nader.  Ralph annoyed everybody but today we all wear seatbelts and that saved hundreds of thousands of lives.  You wouldn't want to hang out with him but you respect his efforts.  He's from the Left but so what.

The players in the movie are real people the situation is fictional mockumentary is not the right word -- call it documenary fiction like Battle Of Algiers; but 40 years later it's like a LoFi Logan's Run, or The Running Man.  Arnold Strong was in that wasn't he?  Now California has the Governator and we have a black President -- all of it less plausible and less well acted than this movie.

[Another movie Peter Watkins made Edvard Munch is as good as any movie ever about an artist. I rank that movie with Love Is The Devil about Francis Bacon.]
