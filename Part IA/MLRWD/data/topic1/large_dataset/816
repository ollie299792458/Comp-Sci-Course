Joe D'Amato a name synonymous with sleaze. After 150+ films which included everything from horror, sword and sandal movies, nunsploitation, XXX horror to big budget hardcore porn during the 1990s, Joe D'Amato is usually forgotten amongst the usual cast of characters that we know and love of Italian cinema. Buio Omega is arguably D'Amato's most accessible film reason being that U.S. censors either edit his work for domestic release (ala Anthropophagus; releases in the U.S. under the title The Grim Reaper) or refusal to release the titles at all ( Death Smiles On A Murderer, Porno Holocaust and Erotic Nights of the Living Dead are three great examples).
Buio Omega is a tale of necrophilia; one man's love for his dead girlfriend who dies under a voodoo curse. Since love in an undying thing, this young man digs up his lady fair, takes her back to his villa and preserves her in a rather graphic disembowelment scene. Other women keep getting in the way and hence, trouble ensues.
REVIEW: Buio Omega is arguably the best necrophilia film in existence. As perverse as it all may seem (it was 1979 and sexing the dead wasn't a popular theme) it still retains elements of a bizarre love story thanks to Goblin's odd film score. The pacing of the story is fairly fast and the ending of Buio Omega solidifies one man's love for the dead.
