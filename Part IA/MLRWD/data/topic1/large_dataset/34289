I had really high hopes for this movie when I heard that it was coming out. The teasers gave it just the right edge, but the reality was different. Making this movies was one of those ideas that seems better than it actually turns out to be. I could have said the same about "Underworld: Rise of the Lycans", but that's for another time.

We start with Selene recaping the Lycan/Vampire war leading up to her meeting Michael. Then it's like "Houston, we have a problem--The Humans are trying to exterminate the Lycans, the Vampires, and us along with them." Selene & Michael are captured, and spend the next decade or so on ice until they are able to escape, helped by the mysterious "subject 2"  Ok---no more spoilers.

As far as the film itself, Kate Beckinsale starts strong, but gets bogged down trying to figure out where/when she is, and trying to find Michael. Michael appears in a couple of "blink & you'll miss him shots". It turns out that "Michael" is actually Scott Speedman's face digitally superimposed on a stand in. The production values seemed dark--Not grim & serious, but "who turned out the lights?"  Were they trying to save money? This is not to mention that some of the most important dialogue seemed forced and awkward.

A lot of important details were either glossed over or omitted entirely. But then, what do you expect from a movie that's only 78 minutes long??? I'm hoping that an extended cut of this film will be released at some point. Maybe that will fill in the gaps until the next sequel.
