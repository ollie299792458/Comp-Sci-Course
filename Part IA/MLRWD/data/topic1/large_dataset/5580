Excellent dialogue, international locale, wonderful performances, perfectly flawed characters, Cinematically gorgeous, a plot without a single hole.

There are very few perfect movies, but if you want to enjoy one, The Third Man is it.  With Orson Wells on the cover, it spoils a large surprise of the plot, but this cannot be blamed on the film-makers.

Joseph Cotton gives a perfect performance as a good guy who writes bad novels and falls too hard for women he shouldn't.  When he comes to Europe to meet with his friend and finds him dead, he attempts to find out what really happened, only to fall for his friend's lover and find out more than he wanted to know.

With one of the greatest scenes in movie history between Cotton and Wells in a deserted ferris wheel, this is a great, great movie.  For fans of noir, this is a great Euro-Noir (check out the shot of the police hiding invisibly in the shadows, only their faces appearing at random in the light).  Highly recommended.
