I wonder if it's OK to have a temporary crush on a cat. Not a real cat, an animated cat that dresses in a grey suit, drinks tea, and is voiced by Cary Elwes. I'm talking about none other then The Baron in The Cat Returns. The Baron is this really neato cat that helps save the heroine from having to get married to the Cat Prince. When Haru saves the Cat Prince from getting run over by a car the Cat Kingdom is eternally grateful. They send her presents like mice in her locker. The cat ambassador of sorts thinks that she agrees to marry the Cat Prince and stay in the Cat Kingdom. The cats are going to take her away that night when she hears a voice telling her to find a white cat and ask him to take her to the Cat Bureau. There she meets the dashing Baron, the crow voiced by Elliott Gould, and gets to know more about the white cat, voiced by Peter Boyle. As she is whisked away to the Cat Kingdom and faced to marry the prince, the Baron, Toto the crow, and Muta, the white cat have to save her. During her time in the Cat Kingdom she begins to turn into a cat making it all the more important that she leave the Cat Kingdom before the change is permanent!

Also of note: Tim Curry does the voice of the evil Cat King! Anne  Hathaway does the voice of Haru. It took me a while to get used to Anne Hathaway's voice because I recognize it from some of the other films she has been involved in.

It was SUCH a cool movie! Of course I would think so because it involves cats but still! The director, Hiroyuki Morita, is sort of a protegee of Hayao Miyazaki and  Nozomu Takahashi (the two directors that alternate directing Studio Ghibli films as I learned in the Special Feature section :) ). I really liked this movie and hope that Hiroyuki Morita continues to produce more great movies.
