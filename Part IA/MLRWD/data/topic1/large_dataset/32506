I liked this film and the bad reviews came as a surprise after having already watched it. What I like most about this story is the fact that the narrator, a nobleman who comes from a highly sofisticated society, is not a macho-man dare-anything hero, but a poet who has never in his life seen a battle. His cultural shock when he finds these barbarians --the Vikings-- is enormous and we just see everything through his eyes and from his point of view. The fact that he doesn't know the Viking language and needs first a translator (from Latin, which he doesn't speak either) and then to learn the Viking language is one of the difficulties that he finds and link us to him: we (us and him) don't understand anything. Another big problem that makes us sympathize with him is that he goes unwillingly on this adventure. When he is thrown in the middle of chaos and bloody fight, we see what he sees, that is, we don't realise that the enemies are men and not beasts until we see it through his eyes.
The clash of cultures is the main theme of this adventure movie: there is the clash between the Vikings and the Arab traveller; but, most importantly, they really begin to respect each other and to find out what they have in common when they must fight against the terrible Wendol, who are different and illogical to the point of being incompatible as neighbours, and must be destroyed.
