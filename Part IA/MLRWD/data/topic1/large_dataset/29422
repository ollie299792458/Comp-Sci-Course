Alright, there are plenty reviews to be found on this film, so there's no real need for me to address the plot, characters, etc.  We all know what a fantastic movie this is.  It got a few Academy Award nominations, so that speaks for itself.  What you really want to know is why should you purchase this in it's newer DVD format, right?  Let's get to it.
First off, it comes in the neat, sturdy plastic case, not the horrible plastic frame with the cardboard cover deal.  Those are the worst.  The booklet inside is nice with some great details about the movie and the features of the DVD.
The picture and sound quality are great.  Now that doesn't mean perfect because putting it on DVD and cleaning it up a bit doesn't mean that it's going to look like it came out in the 21st century.  It didn't.  Still, it looks great in the widescreen format and the score is still terrific.
The extras, in this case, are fairly nice.  The best part is the feature-length commentary provided by the director and writers.  This means that you can watch the entire movie without sound, but with the director and writers giving comments on the film.  This gives you terrific insight into the movie that could not be had before.  It's a bit long, the full 2 hours of the movie, but still very informative.  
If you truly love this movie, then you'll definitely find this DVD a very worthwhile purchase.  It's even cheap for a DVD.  Get it while it's in print because there won't be another printing.  The commentary alone warrants the purchase.
