I just thought of this and bought it instantly.  If you want to draw comparisons, do so with Backstreet and Madam X but NOT the Keanu Reeves version.  Much as I adore Keanu, his cannot compare to the Anthony Newley/Sandy Dennis combination that was the first Sweet November.  I saw this movie when it opened in NYC (in those days to see first run movies you had to go uptown to the big theatres - local theatres would get them about a month or two later).  I was 17 and remembered the last time I felt my heart break for a movie was West Side Story.  I must thank Barry Eysman who wrote his review in 2002.  It said beautifully everything I would like to say.  My eyes filled up when I read it.  I think the thing that made the original characters so appealing was they were not drop-dead gorgeous with leading man/lady good looks.  They were believable.  I felt as if I knew these people or at least could know them and relate to them.  Since I saw this movie, every time I smell a new perfume on someone that appeals to me, I say "you smell like the main floor of Bloomingdale's".
