The movie is a documentary about crossword puzzles, crossword puzzle makers and crossword puzzle solvers.  It focuses on Will Shortz, the puzzle editor for The New York Times and the annual competition he started back in the 1970s.  On the way to the competition you meet the folks who construct the puzzles and those who take great joy in solving them.  And the solvers range from former US Presidents to major league baseball players to pop music stars to Jon Stewart.  Believe me, watching Stewart plowing into a puzzle is worth the price of admission in itself.

The less famous players are folks who can do annagrams on the fly, have sets of unabridged dictionaries, and can do the Times Sunday puzzle in four minutes or so.  These are folks who have marvelous talents but are short of people skills.  They're the ones who were bullied in the playground, but they have found something they can take pride in.  And the film's makers treat them with respect and kindness.

There is bonus material in which some famous puzzle makers show how they go about constructing these challenges.

The film has much wit and real respect for the talents of its subjects.
