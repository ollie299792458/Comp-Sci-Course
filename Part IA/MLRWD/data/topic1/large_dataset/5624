I'll cut to the chase.  Even though I'm a fan of Hepburn and of director David Lean, I found this movie to have great scenery but a pedantic and somewhat intellectually shallow plot.  A B-/C+ "spinster coming of age" flick that probably was only exciting in the 1950s because it was before the sexual revolution and therefore considered "Kinseyan" and "edgy."

Which brings me to my final thumbs down for the movie.  Now that we're no longer pre-sex revolution and are living in its wreckage, this movie strikes me as immoral.  Of course, I wouldn't censor it, but if you can stand the ham-handed screenplay I would urge people to watch it as an example of how Kinsey America naively talked itself into sexual disaster.  "Just an innocent summertime fling to liberate the repressed."  Um, yeah.  Right.  Keep telling yourself that.

Today, the "edgy" movie would be a remake where the Hepburn character sticks to her guns, eschews temptation, and "finds herself" by plumbing the depths of her values; a summer where her frumpy morality transforms, under testing, into something better: genuine heartfelt chastity that flows not from "rules" but from deeper values and human identity.  Now that would be a movie worth watching.  This one?  Not so much.

Ironic that Lean did make a movie with character development along those better lines just 2 years later in The Bridge on the River Kwai.
