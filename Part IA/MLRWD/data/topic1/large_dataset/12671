I thought the story was awesome, though you may have to watch it again to get the full impact of it.  Its a mystery so its pretty weird to follow, especially if you miss anything.
  People have been giving it bad reviews but it seems that that is mostly because 1) they're familiar with the series and wanted more of that, 2) they've seen one or both of the first movies and loved them and don't like that is strays from that a bit, or 3) they fall into both categories 1 and 2.  The rest of rest us fit it such categories as 1) seen the series/movies 1 and 2 but didn't care for it/them, 2) seen the series/movies 1 and 2 and liked them but don't mind that this movie is almost independent of them, or 3) this was their first patlabor movie.
  I fit in category 3 of the second grouping.  This movie was my first Patlabor anything; series or movie.  I will admit that sometimes the voice acting seemed like they weren't trying, but such shadows pale in the light of the creative storyline and the pull of the movies air of mystery.  The movie is an excellent must see for any fan of mystery, of a good and thoughtful storyline, or for someone looking for something different for their anime collection.
