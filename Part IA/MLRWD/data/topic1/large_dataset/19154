I gave it one star because I had to to post. Really though it means NO STARS.

Absolutely one of the worst Xmas and regular movies ever made. It is just flat out WEIRD and CREEPY! And I don't mean weird in a good way. It is very mean spirited as well. What is creepy about this movie is that there are actually people like this for real in America. Nosy busy bodies that stick it in everyone's affairs. Passive Agressive nimrods that hide behind a veneer of being such caring individuals. When actually they are seething with rage and jealousy beneath. This movie depicted Middle America very well. A wasteland of shopping malls, walmarts and empty lives, combined with shallow views upon life and other's belief systems. IF YA AINT ONE OF US, WE'RE GONNA STICK IT TO YA! This is basically the theme of this movie. CONFORMITY, Not Christmas. The movie should have been titled. Conforming with the Kranks. It's along the lines of Funny Farm and Groundhog Day. Two other atrocious films. Also, I want to point out that the codependent attitude that Jamie Lee Curtis finally succumbs to is PATHETIC. I can not believe she did this movie. She must have been hard up for the cash. It is just AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL! I ABSOLUTELY DETEST THIS MOVIE, and never want to see it again! As a matter of fact, this movie is not allowed in my house. It is that bad. If you want to see a good Christmas film watch A Christmas Story. Not this piece of garbage.
