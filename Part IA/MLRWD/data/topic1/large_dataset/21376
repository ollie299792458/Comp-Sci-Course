The opening Â½ hour title sequence is one of the best ever filmed. It sets the eerie mood for the entire film. The skill in which suspense is built using the the camera and ambient sound is astounding. It's almost too much at some points. The photography, including crane shots, combined with Ennio Morricone's excellent score also add greatly to this film, as with the earlier Clint Eastwood "Dollars" Trilogy. Leone's style just kept developing. There are significant differences between this film and the Dollars Trilogy. The Eastwood films are action based and have more humorous elements. Once Upon a Time In The West is deadly serious--there is no humor. But this film also has elements in common, such as the importance of the score and the way the story is conveyed with very little dialogue. The grand scope is reminiscent of "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly." Much has been made of Eastwood being Leone's first choice for the Harmonica character. In retrospect, however, Bronson was the perfect choice. Its hard to imagine anybody playing this role better. For example, when he responds to being one horse short with "You brought two too many" he makes this character his own. Bronson's character is more brooding than Eastwood's more enigmatic character and has a deep grudge that motivates him throughout. This film needs a re-mastered DVD release.
