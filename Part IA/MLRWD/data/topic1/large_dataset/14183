This is by far my favorite Bond film of the series. Roger Moore is at his best in this film, and it is definately his best performance as Bond. Roger Moore brings a lot of humor to the movie as he usually does, and he shows his serious bond side in several parts of the movie. This movie has a excellent plot, two spectacular chase scenes, some of the most beautiful locations, and above all it keeps you guessing who the real main villian throughout the movie.

  The cast in my opinion is one of the best in the series. First you have Carole Bouquet as Melina Havelock who is one of the most beautiful bond girls in the entire series. Julian Glover who plays Aristotle Kristatos was equally as evil as Christopher Lee in "The Man with the Golden Gun". I also liked the assortment of villians in the movie such as Locque, and Eric Kriegler. Then you have Topal who plays Columbo the columbian smuggler who turns out to be Bonds ally.

The plot of the movie is based on the A.T.A.C device which can launch submarine missiles on any desired target including your own cities! It also includes Melina seeking revenge for the death of her parents, who soon joins Bond on his mission. I also thought the young skater Bibi who was very cute brought a lot drama to the movie as well.

  The only flaw I found in this movie was the lack of gadgets. I can see why they didn't have many in this film. They wanted to return to a more serious Bond who really and truely looked like a spy. I have always been a fan of Q's high tech gadgets that get Bond out of tight situations.

I would recommend this film to anyone, even if you are not a Bond fan like myself.
