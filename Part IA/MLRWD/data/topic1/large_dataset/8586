Good News...what can I say about this movie? It's one of my favorites!
The story is about Connie Lane (June Allyson) and Tommy Marlowe (Peter Lawford). Tommy is the big man on campus, why he's captain of the football team! Then he meets Pat McLellan (Patricia Marshall) and she couldn't care less. She only wants a man for his wealth *ahem* of culture! So While Tommy is trying to figure out how to win Pat he meets Connie. And, well that's really where it starts get interesting.
The B plot is about Bobby Turner ( Ray McDonald) and Babe Doolittle (Joan McCracken). Babe is dating football player Beef (Sadly I can't remember that actor's name!) but she's crazy about little ol' Bobby, who's scared to death of Beef!
Oddly enough, the very first time I watched it I hated it. I thought it was one of the worst movies ever made! But, it got under my skin. It grew on me. The story really is pretty cute, and the acting is great and well, you have to give Mr.Lawford credit for singing because it was most definately not his strong point! The dancing is also very good, I only wish there was more! And it really is pretty funny to see everyone run around in the 1940's version of the 20's (it was still terribly, terribly, terribly, 40's. No matter how many times they called the girls flappers, it didn't change the fact.)  Something else fun, on the DVD they included two numbers from the movie version that came out in the 20's. I don't know exactly how to describe them, so I won't.
If you want to watch a light (and I do mean light!) musical, This one is great! And really, I personally don't think you can go wrong if Peter Lawford is in it...his er, unique singing voice I think only makes him more charming!

P.S. For all of you Mel Torme fans, he has a small role in the film as Danny. He sings a couple of songs and even has a few lines! A couple of them are pretty funny too!
