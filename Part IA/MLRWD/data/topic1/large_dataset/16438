First I will say this is an amazing documentary.  I watched it when it came out on PBS, but I was only 14 at the time and my perspective has changed a bit.  I love the poetic justice the commentators give, especially Costas.  Fellow Minnesotan Garrison Keillor is also amazing reading quotes from ballplayers.  My only complaint is that they didn't use Keillor more.

My only real complaint, and it is a big one, is the omission of the 1961 SF Giants.  Last night I watched the 1960's "8th Inning" and  the Latin Giants were mentioned exactly zero times.  Hell they didn't even mention Marichal either!  I know it can't be all things to all people, but two hours and not even a passing mention of them?  Oh sure they gushed over Mantle at length, but nothing about the Dominicans who transformed the game.  The segregation they faced could have been beautifully woven the civil rights piece. Not only did they face racial issues, they faced ethnic ones as well.  The Giants manager refused to let them speak spanish to each other in the dugout.  You also have the Alou brothers, who covered the entire outfield. Their improbable run to the World Series, only to lose in Game 7 against the Yankees is another great story.  So many great chances missed by Burns.
