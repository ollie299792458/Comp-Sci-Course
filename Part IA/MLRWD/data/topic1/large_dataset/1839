I've been on Amazon for some years and this is my first comment. This film, though flawed and a bit fragmented, holds firm as a cohesive statement about the character of Sherlock Holmes.  Watson's character attempts to be somewhat of a foil, which keeps this piece in the realm of mystery/adventure, for without him we'd have a romantic thriller.

I had seen this film much earlier and forgotten most of it. Now, I very much appreciate seeing Holmes' emotional foibles and vulnerability.  Even throughout his previous adventures when he forgives a person's crime, Doyle did not allow Sherlock to shed a tear and bat an eye or elude a glance.  This film was immersive on a level rare for Sherlock and I enjoyed it very much. The casting was terrific and spot-on. (I would love to know what Jeremy Brett thought of this production.)

If today's writers are to expand on what Conan Doyle has given us, it is in this private, emotional arena. At the end of this year (2009), a new action film called "Sherlock Holmes" will be released, portraying Sherlock as an unshaven cross between James Bond and Batman.  Though great for this era's viewer to see such entertaining thrills, I feel it goes astray from the creator's vision and the purist audience's desires.

Now, after viewing this film, when I read the stories again I can flesh-out Sherlock into much more of a feeling man, who only chooses the coolly analytic so as not to detract from the truth. Now, I can truly imagine what is in his secret heart of hearts.  Bravo.
