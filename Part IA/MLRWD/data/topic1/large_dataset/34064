... the man from his characters.

By the end of the performance, I was not saying, "Jeff Dunham's funny" - I was saying, "THEY were great," even though I knew "they" were inanimate objects being manipulated by Jeff Dunham.

About the only thing I object to in this concert was Dunham's decision to deliver intolerant jokes through a heretofore untried dummy (Achmed the Dead Terrorist).  The jokes were fairly offensive but might have been received better through "veteran" dummy Walter.

Old favorites Peanut and Jose Jalapeno (on a stick) are back as well, and Dunham milks the audience's affection for these two delightful characters, but keeps the material fresh and topical without losing any of the charm they've maintained for so long.

Dunham is, unquestionably an artist both of ventriloquism and of sculpting, as is shown in the bonus footage of his creation of new character Melvin.  I hope this DVD will generate as much interest in his work as did his previous release, "Arguing with Myself."
