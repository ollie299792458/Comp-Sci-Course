Having been a major fan of the American QAF, it was great recently to see the British.
Like a lot of folks have said, the initial story line is almost identical, just treated in a different way.  British is faster paced and funnier, especially after you get used to the Manchester working class slang.  But the faster pace keep the characters from having quite as much depth, although I like how the relationship between Stuart and Vince turns out more than Brian and Mike.  But I'm more of a romantic about stuff like that.
And the British is far more authentic in its approach to the working class culture.  The American boys claim Pittsburg working class roots, but they behave like middle class suburbans.
Overall though, I like the larger cast, more complex story and character development of the American version.  And there's nothing in the British that comes even close to the impact of the last show of season 1 American, especially for someone who's been through a similar situation as what happened to Justin.  That one episode did more to heal my old emotional pains than years of counselling could ever hope to!!  I also think the way the American told the story of Mike's 30th birthday was much better set up and followed through to a logical conclusion than Vince's 30th on the British.  If I hadn't seen the American, I probably would have missed the point on the British.
But all in all, the British is definitely worth having if you're into QAF.
