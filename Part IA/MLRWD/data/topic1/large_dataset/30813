Louise Hay has been there and done that and this is evidenced by the content of her book.  When I first bought a copy of You Can Heal Her Life, I read the first 2 chapters, and put the book down.  I was angry because Ms  Hay was telling me like it was, and I didn't want to hear the truth.  I  didn't want to look at myself and take responsibility for my life and my  happiness and my health.  I wanted to be told that My situation was beyond  my control. A couple of years later, I picked up that copy of You Can Heal  Your Life, ready to read it and hear the truth that saved Ms Hay's life,  years before.  As I worked through the exercises and started practicing the  affirmations in the way Ms Hay instructed, I literally began to heal my  life of suicidal depression, kidney disfunction, arthritis, and the hurt of  child sexual abuse, as well as a slew of other problems.  A miracle  happened.  I started to become happy. Since this time, I have continued to  use the mirror exercises and affirmations that she describes, and continued  to work to change my thought patterns.  As a result of this, my attitudes  have changed, and I have become a much more positive, optimistic person.  Everything that I need in life seems to come to me as I need it.  I used to  get sick with great regularity, catching everything whether it was a common  disease/disorder or not, and I rarely get sick or become injured now.  I am  happy almost every day and am seeing my dreams come true.  The last 10  years, since I read You Can Heal Your Life for the first time, have been a  wonderous journey, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.  While I did the  work, I owe a debt of gratitude to Louise Hay for writing and marketing  this book so that her message could reach me and countless others.  I have  seen the same kind of results in almost a dozen other people who have read  You Can Heal Your Life.  There is a better way, and this is it.  Give it a  try, you're worth it!  Love and Peace!
