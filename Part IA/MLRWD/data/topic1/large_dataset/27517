I'm still rather confused as to why this movie has been listed as a comedy in many places. Sure, there is comic relief - but there is in Scarface too. It has been about a month since I last saw the spectacular Eternal Sunshine, but when I saw it, I don't think I really laughed, other than the scene when Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are really young, and they try to bathe him in the sink. But anyways...

This movie is so well done. Another reviewer put it best, saying "Just when you thought romantic comedies were unoriginal". That's so true. When I went into my school's movie theater, about to watch this movie, I had NO idea what to expect. I had heard nothing about it, other than the buzz about Carrey and Winslet's Oscar-worthy acting. As I participated in the adventure that this movie took me on, I found myself totally engrossed in the movie, unlike 95% of the other films I have seen. I never looked at my watch. I never talked or whispered to anybody around me. I was so involved, trying to figure the movie out.

That is why I gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars. At some points the plot was confusing, and I really had to sit back for a minute and try and figure out what was really going on. Thankfully, however, I was able to figure it out quickly enough.

The acting in this movie is superb, the directing excellent and the storyline provoking. What would you do? If someone so special betrayed you by erasing her memories of you, would you erase your memories of them? It's confusing and a hard question to answer. "Eternal Sunshine" may not answer that question for you, but it is truly amazing to see what the characters do in the movie.
