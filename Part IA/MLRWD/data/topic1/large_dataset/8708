This is a very stylish film that deserves more attention from film viewers. I've read some reviews about this film and I was upset to find some people that did not like the film because of some camera techniques or the non sense of the story. First of all, although in many scenes the camera shakes a lot, tilts, and uses unusual angles, the effect of this only adds to the insanity that is going on in the movie. The story is meant to be paranoid, painful, disorientating, stressful for the main character Max Cohen, and the effective use of camera angles brings the audience into the movie. If you felt nausiated by it, it was meant to make you feel that way. Second, the story if of course non sense because cleary the stock market, Pi, and the Kabalah has no significant similarities. Instead of focusing in on the technicality of this, why not focus on the character who is obssessed about finding those similarities? Thirdly, some one pointed out that this movie was cheaply made, and it is true that this movie had one of the movie industry's lowest budget. However, the director geniously turned that disadvantage into an advantage to create something that is totally unique. I really cannot say anything negative about this movie except for near the ending where I thought needed more explanation, however, that discovery was only for Max Cohen, so we don't really need to know what happened but the fact that he did come up with some kind of a revelation. Anyways, great film, and I would definately recommend this film to anyone.
