As it's chilly performances and aloof style put the audience at a distance, it's hard to see the first time through what a brilliant film this picture is; but repeated veiwings have only cemented my  opinion--Miller's Crossing is the finest American film since Raging Bull.  
I think the key to my love for Miller's, though, is realizing what what  I believe the dream-hat meant (I'm sure this will be obvious to some,  especially those that have watched a number of times, but I just want to  throw this out there for folks that have seen it, but don't know what all  the hubbub is about--because certainly, that's how I felt when I first saw  it).  
Whether people wear hats or not in the film seems to represent  whether they are acting out of passion-from the heart, that is, or out of  mind--thinking logically, or unemotionally.
Tom's conflict in the film is  entirely between his head and his heart(Verna).  He loses his hat to Verna  in a poker game, and he goes back to her apartment to get it--and it is  left on the sill while they fool around.  And Tom says about his dream:  "There's nothing more foolish than a man chasing his hat."  Ultimately, Tom chooses mind over heart in the end--or does he?  The final  shot shows him methodically putting his hat on so low that we can't even  see his eyes, so he seems to make the cold choice of pure logic--but then,  as he looks after Leo leaving (Leo, who has been hatless throughout, pure  emotion, has now learned something--and he is wearing a yarmulke), the  camera sneaks in under the brim of Tom's hat to see his eyes.  It is rare  for a movie to understand its character's so well.  Wonderful filmmaking
