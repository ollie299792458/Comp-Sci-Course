Having seen the preview ads, which focused mainly on Toula's boisterously loving but meddlesome family, I wasn't expecting a lot here. But Nia Vardalos is a talented actress and writer, who
gave Toula a depth and reality that was vulnerable and heroic. I think what worked here is that we have all either been or known a
Toula. We have all wished for an Ian to inspire us out of our everyday lives. Their relationship seemed genuinely caring, and I
liked that the focus was mainly about respecting and valuing each
other, not just sex. John Corbett and Nia Vandalos had real chem-
istry, not Hollywood chemistry!!!
Mr Constantine, Ms Kazan and the rest of the supporting cast did very good, but not excellent work here. The sole false note in the film was the over the top behavior of Toula's family, which was wildly exaggerated for satire's sake. I have known several Greek families, and while they have their loud moments, they also
have a lot more respect and trust in each other than the film implied. Most are extremely kind to outsiders and not as clique-
ish as the Portokolis' seemed to be. Also, the papous(grandfa-
thers)and yayas(grandmothers) are much more highly valued than the treatment of Gus'mother would let you believe.
This film was very well written and acted, very funny without being raunchy. I would see it again; have asked Amazon for DVD
release info, and would urge bored with Hollywood standard fare
moviegoers to seek out this small, independent gem. Appreciate
Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson's help in finding this and getting it
produced. Overall rating: 4 and 1/2 stars.
