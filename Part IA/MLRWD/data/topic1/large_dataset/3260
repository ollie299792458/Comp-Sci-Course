Claiming that Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" is the greatest movie ever would seem to be a bold statement to anyone not  acquanted with the movie. But believe me, once you watch this movie, your  life will never be the same. Sure, a movie probably won't change your life  as much as say, reading "Les Miserables", or "For Whom the  Bell Tolls", but it will definitely make an impression on you at the  very least.
I would definitely enjoy giving a description of the movie's  plot, and principal protagonist, and antagonist, but that would spoil what  would be a magnificent movie. I think the cast, director, and soundtrack  should indicate "why" this movie is great. The movie stars Martin  Sheen, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper, Robert Duvall and  the legendary Marlon Brando(of course you didn't forget Vito Corleone[AKA  the Godfather], did you?). In addition, it is directed by Francis Ford  Coppola, the director of the Godfather Trilogy, and many other excellent  movies. And the soundtrack is composed by Carmine Coppola, and features Jim  Morrison's "The End"(a rendition of "The End" that will  almost certainly leave a "lasting impression"!). Simultaneously,  the fact that it was nominated for eight Academy Awards, should almost  certainly speak for itself. To conclude, if you only have the opportunity  to purchase one DVD or VHS, I would highly recommend that you purchase  "Apocalypse Now", it is easily the most remarkable movie that I  have ever seen, and believe me, I have seen an abundance of movies.
