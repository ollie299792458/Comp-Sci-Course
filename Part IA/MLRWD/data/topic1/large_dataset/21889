It took all my life for me to see THE GRADUATE, but I'm glad I finally did!  Everybody is a Benjamin Braddock at some point in life.  Here we have an intelligent, introspective young man, fresh out of college, who wants nothing more than to lounge in his parents' pool and reflect upon his future, a slacker three decades before that term was coined.  But those in his life try to pull him into different directions and attempt to make decisions for him.  His parents are hell bent on his going to grad school; a colleague of his father's insists he seek out a career in the plastics industry; and, most forcibly of all, Mrs. Robinson coerces him to initiate an affair with her.THE GRADUATE is more a story of one person versus a domineering society than anything else.  At every turn, Ben attempts to right all the wrongs and potential wrongs, only to have his efforts backfire badly on him.  What he wants most is what eludes him, forcing him to wrest it from that domineering society.The film is very effective in underscoring mundane actions -- climbing slowly out of a swimming pool, driving across a bridge, peering at monkeys in a zoo -- with Simon and Garfunkel's excellent music.
