Alien is one of the most disturbing and horrific movie experiences you will ever have, and I mean that in a good way. I think it comes close to being a masterpiece. This is my second purchase of this movie. My first was the 1979 theatrical release version of Alien. It was in the extra material that came with that DVD that I discovered the deleted scenes and out-takes, most of which I hoped would be included in the 2003 Director's cut. One scene I really wanted restored actually WAS included, however, incredibly, inexplicably, the best line in the scene WASN'T!
I refer to the scene where Ripley stumbles upon the remains of Brett and the still living Dallas. The line missing is where Ripley says, "Dallas, what did it do to you?" I love this line! I love it because like the rest of the dialogue in this brilliant movie, it is perfectly natural. It is exactly the question someone would think to ask in that kind of situation, plus it is incredibly ominous and loaded with horror! So I repeat my question...Why Ridley? Why was this line omitted?
Also, the out-take I really wanted included was where Parker and Lambert  are collecting supplies for their escape in the shuttle and the alien is right there in the room, crouching on the floor, almost unnoticed until  it starts to rise up. It's horrifying to watch. I love the way the alien's strange form makes it almost invisible in plain sight. Although this out-take scene didn't have any sound, I'm sure sound could easily be added. Oh well, maybe for the next edition. How about it Ridley???
Ridley's brilliant direction aside, don't for one minute discount the impact of Jerry Goldsmith's truly remarkable movie score!!! The actors are pretty good too ;-)
