Roar is set in a sword and sorcery world that is very light on the sorcery. The violence is generally low key and de-emphasized.

Fantasy needs to be tied to something concrete and/or familiar that the viewer can identify with. If it fails then it won't hold your interest. It has no literary weight and feels pointless, like Roar.

This is supposed to be about indigenous people struggling to unify against an ongoing Roman invasion. You very seldom see the Romans invading anything.

The plot of the overall show does not move forward. It might be said that there is no overall plot. Everything they were planning to do in the second episode they are still planning to do in the sixth episode, heroes and villains.

The characters do not change. No one gets better at anything than they were in the first episode. None of the main characters so much as changes their minds about anything. Even what is set up as a big deal is almost never mentioned again and never affects the events or quality of the show again.

In every episode models and underwear models travel through the woods alternately sneaking and dashing. Every episode sees someone go on an emotional journey with emphasis on sadness and hope. That makes this a drama about pretty people more than anything else.

Roar has too little sword, sorcery, plot, characterization and weight.
