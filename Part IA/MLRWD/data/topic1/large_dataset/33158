I am a christian, and I have been to hellhouse several times. I even know alot of the people who participate in the acting. When a person makes a documentary they do it to form their own opinions. They are only going to show you what they want. It's called editing. Most of the scenes in the film are controversial because George Ratliff does not show you what he really taped while filming these scenes at Trinity in Cedar Hill. (Star of David mistake,The angry kids which by the way that was the only group he could find in all the days he was at the church taping, and on the very last day! etc.,etc.).He doesn't show you the kids who come out truly touched because they could be in a similar situation. It frustrates me how people get so angry when they see the hellhouse movie, but they can watch horror movies. I mean really grotesque images!! Without even a second thought. Then, I have to realize that when you become so hateful over what we believe in, that it is conviction and that's why you respond in that way. They do not force you at the end to join the church, they simply let you know that if you want someone to pray with or talk to, counselors are available in the next room. Try going and seeing it for yourself before you judge a very poorly done documentary. They care about people, our youth is blinded today, and they want to reach out to the ones who are hurting and could be in these situations. You love the person, not the sins. That is what hellhouse is really about.
