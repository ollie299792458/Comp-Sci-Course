Despite the fact that this film raises issues that are not very potent today, it remains to be  a timeless classic because of its sheer artistic value. This great artistic value is largely due to the brilliant idea (the  idea of creating a play about Kathrene Hepburn [not literally, of course],  for Kathrene Hepburn), the plot itself, and film's charming and witty  script. Hepburn is the only and true star in this story, although I can  appreciate Stewart and Grant in their roles. But truly, it would not have  mattered much artistically, if different supporting cast was chosen.  Apparently, it did matter to RKO commercially a great deal.  Thank God for  that, because Stewart, Grant, Hussey, and Howard all added something to the  film.  The result is a story with a "love...well, let's just say, more  than a usual triangle", that revolves around one Philadelphia society  girl and a few of her eccentric family members. The DVD has an outstanding  sound and picture quality. Cute little menu and original theatrical trailer  are also included. It is nice to know that this great film will stay with  us for generations to come and enjoy it.
