It was surprising to see the difference between the technologies of the 80's versus current day.  What was considered to be great graphics back then would be laughed off the screen today.  This is even more apparent in the Blu-ray version where the graphics look very much pasted onto the screen with no real interaction between what was in the background and the graphics itself.  Things that "exploded" like the alien base, merely disappeared when the scene returns to it later in the movie.
  Saying that, it was nice to revisit and get a taste of the 80's again, however I wouldn't recommend getting this in Blu-ray as the graphics contrast is too great.  The DVD would be sufficient to enjoy the movie for what it was, a good family movie with a little humor (especially the fashions and hairstyles of the 80's) as well as an old fashioned story plot where a teenager, coming of age realizes that he doesn't have to be stuck in his current situation, he can always break free and save the world(s).
