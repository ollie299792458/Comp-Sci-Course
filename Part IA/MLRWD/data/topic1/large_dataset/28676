Great acting by the five men with good music and s moving story.  There were tears flowing when his little girl was killed.  There were tears flowing again when he reached out to his friends and to his son.  The story is every family's story.  Our children depend on us to make decisions that will guide them into their adulthood with the training and love they need for happy and fulfilled lives.  We depend on God to help us overcome the evil temptations of life and give our children an example to live by.

By dedicating their lives to God, these men soon learned that all is not easy when making a resolution to do good.  It was with a very heavy heart that they had to turn away from one of their own brothers in the Sheriff's department.  But the resolve to do the right thing was the catalyst that brought them closer to each other and to their own families.

I am so proud that I saw this movie.  It was a huge surprise to me.  I never saw it advertised nor did I even know it existed.  I just happened onto it while searching for something to watch on a Sunday afternoon.  It should be shown to all parents and their children.  It is life changing.
