... and mostly a riot! Tropic Thunder fails, only insofar as it falls short of all its ambitions, and in failing it is still one of the most original and audacious comedies of the past few years. There is so much to love about this movie: the writing, acting and execution of Robert Downey's character is fantastic. Tom Cruise is not only everything he needs to be for the satire to work so savagely, but his playing against type in the makeup he has to wear for the part...well, love the man or hate him, he is one hell of a movie actor!

 There are no war movie cliches left standing and the pretensions of "method actors" are hilariously skewered in the courageous presentation of Downey's "white-guy-trying-to be-Black" Sargeant and Stiller's "I am Sam" satire.

I was on the fence about Ben Stiller, but this movie has made me a fan. The bravely non-PC in your face outrageousness of this film is refreshing, even when it doesn't quite work as humour. The only negatives I found were the mis- (under?-) use of Jack Black in a poorly written role and the anti-climacitc and formulaic ending. Stiller is trying to keep one too many satirical balls in the air, so the result does sometimes seem unfocused and the ending a bit tacked on and forced.

Jay Baruchel, Nick Nolte, Matthew McConaughey and Steve Coogan deserve special mention, particulalry Baruchel for being the "straight man" who highlights the over-the-top antics of the prima donna actors.

It's refreshing to see a comedy that has the guts to go after sacred cows. I hope Stiller keeps it up!
