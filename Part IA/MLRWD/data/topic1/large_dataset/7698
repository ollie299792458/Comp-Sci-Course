The film is most enjoyable and a MUST teaching tool for film schools. This is precisely what we want to tell students how they can make great films with bare minimum resources and lots of creativity. The entire film was shot in a funeral home warehouse (cheap rent) which was used for shooting most scenes and for turning an upstairs room into Mr Orange's flat. There was no big budget for grand sets, costumes, pretty girls and handsome faces but the right mix of creativity, talents, a fine script, the strong performance of the right cast and crew delivers miracles!!

The Tarantino phenomenon begins with "Reservoir Dogs", the film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino which won him worldwide acclaim and gave him his first break.

This 1991 film is about six perfect strangers with colour-coded aliases (Mr Orange, Mr White, Mr Blonde, Mr Pink, Mr Brown and Mr Blue) pulling off a simple heist. But one of them is an undercover cop.  The story ends with the most moving and unexpected twist despite all the typical Tarantino blood, gore and violence.

Eight to eighty years old are fascinated by the riveting story and moved by the unlikely friendship developed between Mr Orange/Tim Roth and Mr White/Harvey Keitel.  It is not just the plot that captivates our imagination, it is Tarantino's ability to make us captive audience witnessing scenes of violence and suspense while he eases our tensions with the light-hearted K-Billy's Supersounds of the Seventies(think the ear-hacking torture scene of Marvin Nash, the cop tied to a chair by Mr Blonde).  Well, who can ever forget the violent ear-hacking scene accompanied by Stealers Wheel's delightful "Stuck In the Middle With You". Ingenious!  Brilliant!!!
