I like Stephen King alright, but I've never been a fanatic. I've never read the book, I didn't expect the movie adaptation Of "Pet  Sematary" to be anything special. It turns out I was wrong.
I think  Brad Greenquist as Victor Pascow really makes this movie. He is easily  among the creepiest AND coolest characters that I've ever seen in a horror  movie. Greenquist plays Pascow with the perfect mix of smugness and  solemnity, with a nice touch of "grave" (pardon the pun) humor.  And there's something about a ghost walking around in geeky jogging gear  with the side of his head bashed in and his brain exposed that is really  eerily gross.
The toddler who plays Gage is quite the young actor, too.  And who couldn't like good ol' Fred Gwynne (although it's kinda hard to  disassociate him from the image of Herman Munster, even sans make-up and  with an exaggerated New England accent).
I could take or leave the plot,  which is kinda hokey. But the spooky atmosphere more than redeems the whole  thing.
