I didn't really care for that episode but I watched it anyway, because I own it and I can!
But I might have to agree with steven Carter down further in the reviews. I'm not so sure that these season 2 episodes are not uncut also, but I'm not certain. I can't help but feel like there might be something fishy going on. Or It Could be that I'm just paranoid about it.
Season one I still cannot buy because I know for a fact it been edited. It makes me crazy seeing season 1 sitting on the shelf at the store and I can't have it on the grounds of my own boycott. (thanks anchor bay, not) But if I'm being kept in the dark or am being tricked into believing that I'm watching uncut episodes in season 2 then so be it. I mean jeez, I can't go on forever without buying Roseanne on DVD! I've waited to long for it to be released, we all have. And I love being able to crack up at the Conner's anytime I want to! Anyway, this boxed set is very well put together with a few good extras. So I highly recommend!

Rest in peace Shelley Winters
