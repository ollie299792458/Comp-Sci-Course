The 2000 Rumble is easily the greatest Royal Rumble ever. Even without 'big names' like Stone Cold Steve Austin or The Undertaker, this PPV was nothing short of awesome!
The match between Triple H and Cactus Jack was  a classic. It is about as hardcore as any WWF match has gotten. A  barbed-wire wrapped 2x4 and a pile of thumbtacks were just some of the  weapons used in this great match for the WWF Championship.
The other  spectacular match was between the Hardy Boyz and the Dudleys. It was a  special 'table match' in which the only way to win is to put both wresters  on the opposing team through tables!
Other matches including New Age  Outlaws vs. Acolytes for the Tag Team titles, the debuting Tazz vs. Kurt  Angle, the Miss Rumble 2000 bikini contest,and Chris Jericho vs. Chyna vs.  Hardcore Holly for the Intercontinental Championship.
An all-time great  PPV. It ranks right up there with Wrestlemania XIV, 1998 King of the Ring,  and 1999 No Mercy. A must have for fans of  D-Generation X!
