A co-working of mine was talking about this movie a year ago and telling me that he couldn't wait for it to be released on DVD.  So, when I saw it at a local chain I plunked down the cash and hoped it would compliment my "minature" horror/comedy section of my library...Child's Play (all of 'em), good old Leprechaun (all of 'em) and even Rumplestiltskin.  Boy, the old adage, you can't judge a book (DVD) by the cover, how true!  As pointed out by a previous reviewer, the concept sounded like a blast but the execution was a disaster!  Where do I start?  The cast?  The Ho's for lack of any better description in this movie must have been recruited from some methodone clinic.  The acting was beyond bad it was painful.  I know movies in this genre are supposed to have bad acting but you have to see this to believe it.  The only requirements for auditioning in this film are:  Do you have big breasts?  Will you get naked? Oh, and did we mention you need to be willing to hump a wooden dummie?  The movie was more like "Chucky meets Jenna Jameson"  If you like the sight of crack ho's boffing a wooden doll, then this movie is for you, because that's basically it along with the stereotyped one liners.

Now on to the "special effects"...what effects???  This was so collegiate.  Worse than low budget, worse than no budget.  The dummie, the "Star" of the film was so pathetic, it was insulting.  Look at the scenes of him "ambulating" because it sure isn't walking and you'll know what I'm talking about.  The other hi-tech effect was Jergen's lotion!  If you're dumb enough to watch this movie like I did you'll get the picture.

Why 2 stars?  Because as I've said before, the concept sounded fun, an African American Chucky (by the way, the "N" word is really over used in this little flick).  4 stars for the balls to come up with something like this and 0 stars for the overall result.  Granted I must admit I chuckled a few times, but replaying this mess is outta the question!
