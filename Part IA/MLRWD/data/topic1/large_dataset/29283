Yes, this is a fine version, but there are obviously serious translation problems with this DVD, some even affecting the narrative Murnau intended.  For example, in the 34th minute, commentator Lokke Heiss tells us that Murnau is playing the text against the visuals by having written "Hutter had heard her [Ellen's] call of warning" as the text. The intertitles however on this DVD though don't say this at this point; instead we read "her soul had heard the call of the deathbird."  So ... which is it?  Heiss was certainly watching a different version from this one when he did his commentary track.

Another drawback to this version is that the English text seems almost childish at times - with a language as rich in terror adjectives as English is, couldn't the translator do better than resorting several times to "creepy?"

Nonetheless, Heiss's comments really are expert (but could anyone explain how, if vampires cannot cross moving water, the Count appears as a hyaena to check on Hutter at the inn across the river?).  Perhaps the best component of all in this DVD version is Heiss's tour of the original exteriors used in the film; his showing us what the original "Nosferatu" sites look like now is a superbly original, considerate feature that any hardcore fan will appreciate.
