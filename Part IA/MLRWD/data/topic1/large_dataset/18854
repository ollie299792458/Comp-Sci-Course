What can i say about this film, well its based on the arcade game house of the dead, i use this term loosely, because the name is where the similarity ends. Such a disapointment they could of made this into such a phat film, they had the perfect catalyst and they decided to burn it, literally.

It seems as if Uwe Boll has never actually played the game and watched what was happening on the screen, there are plenty of references to it in the film, but in the wrong way, flashing up screen shots of the game throughout is an eye saw and lazy.

The sound in this film goes in and out so much youd think a child had been there playing with the mute button on a remote, the bullit-time shots were used inappropriately, it gets tediously boring and the acting, dont get me started.

The film is supposed to be set on an island and yet it is claustrophobic, the story is hazy at best and extremely poor.

"THE GAME HAS JUST BEGUN" yer and your career has probably ended.
