The Criterion Collection unearths yet another gem in the large spectrum that is foreign film.  This movie would never have even been released in America given the nature of the plotline and in-your-face brutality contained within. The movie is a mockumentary of sorts, as a camera crew follows and documents the everyday life of the ever likable Benoit.  Too bad he's a serial killer.
There will be many times that you will laugh...and feel incredibly bad for doing so as all the humor centers around Ben's choice of work.  I do feel that I should warn people that some of the material may be considered offensive or just plain to brutal for a weak stomach.  I read one review mention a brutal rape scene, and indeed one is included in the film, but I must say that the reviewer exaggerates a bit and most likely has never seen Irreversible which contains the most brutal rape scene I have ever seen.
It isn't the humor or shock value that makes this movie stand out though.  It is the implied message that hits home.  And that is the lack of morality within the media (example: The use of ultra violence and sex to sell).  Also I feel I should mention that the film makers themselves do an excellent job on the super low budget that they had to work with, even using themselves in the role of all the main characters.  I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in social commentaries (Natural Born Killers is a good example) or to anyone who is interested in expanding their minds and movie palette.
