Black and white, 1937, French with English subtitles, and some people will stop reading right now. For the rest of you, let's look at the cover blurb.

"One of the very first prison escape movies, GRAND ILLUSION is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. Jean Renoir's masterpiece stars Jean Gobin and Pierre Fresnay as French soldiers held in a World War I German prison camp, and Erich von Stroheim as the unforgettable Captain von Rauffenstein."

Oh, he wasn't the only unforgettable character. Most of them were. It's a genuine pleasure to see an "ensemble cast" where everybody shines, everybody's outstanding, and everything just works. Excellent writing, directing, acting. I'm sure the HOGAN'S HEROES bunch watched this, because it's funnier than they were. But it's also deadly serious. It alternates, as life in a prison camp quite probably would, and every bit of it is a joy to watch. Also, since it was filmed before World War II, watching such an accurate portrayal of pre-Nazi German soldiers was a bit spooky. Prescient. In short, just a wonderful film.
