I've had the VHS version in my collection for years and just went online and found a reasonably priced copy of the uncut 196 minute version.  The different, to put it mildly, is night and day.  It's almost another movie (and I'll never understand how the reconcilation of selves scene at the end was cut from the VHS version - isn't that the whole point?)  I've always found this movie inspiring and terrifying, but the original version communicates the horror that Sybil experiences in her head in an eloquent, fascinating way.  Now finally, scenes in the cut version make sense because the scenes that were removed before or after them are included (Dr. Wilbur's concern that she's pushed Sybil too far, Sybil's affection for her neighbor/boyfriend who reminds her of a childhood friend, the conversation between Dr. Wilbur and Sybil's father, and on and on.) It is a crime that this hasn't been given a real DVD release when I think of the junk that is taking up space at the store.  This is a tour de force from Sally Field, but I have to say I really love Joanne Woodward's work here.  Her Dr. Wilbur is absolutely convincing and you understand why this woman could help Sybil heal.
