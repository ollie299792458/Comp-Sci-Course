This movie is definitely worth seeing! It was really amazing. The story begins with Gandhi being assassinated and then flashes back to a run in he had on a train while he was seated in first class. From there, Gandhi begins his journey of showing the world that we are all children of God, not only certain people. You see his transformation from a young brilliant lawyer to a man of few possessions and many followers. It was truly amazing to see and hear what Gandhi had to say to people in high government positions and those who were in severe poverty. His outlook on life is one that I wish we could duplicate and give out like a drug. His passion for all men, women and children and for non violence is something that I will remember for a lifetime.
This movie is one that should be shown to every person in the world. It relates to world religions in many ways. First, it is a teaching that we should all, no matter what religion we are, should follow. One of his quotes, "I am a Muslim and a Hindu and a Christian and a Jew and so are all of you" ([...])is a powerful statement and shows how passionate he was about all people. If everyone thought like Gandhi and truly believed in the above quote, this world would be a much more peaceful place for all of us to live. Another way it relates to world religions is that it teaches acceptance and understanding of all religions. Gandhi is a Hindu, but has a love and understanding of all religions. He believed that we are all children of God and that we should all be treated fairly and that no religions is lower to any religion.
I truly believe that this movie should be shown to each person living on this planet at least once, if not once a year. It is an astounding look at the human being we all have inside of us and the fact that one person can, and does, make a difference.
