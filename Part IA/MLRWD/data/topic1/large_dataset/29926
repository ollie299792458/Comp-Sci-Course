Yes I do deserve to be stabbed in the eye for that title.

Anyway, since I first started reading the Fantastic Four comic books I became an instant fan. Needless to say I was thrilled when I heard that Marvel decided to make a film of it. Was the movie the best comic adaptation? No. The film was a little too flippant at times, using so much comic relief that it was sort of distracting. And I didn't like Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom. He was pretty good before he went evil, but once he was in full Dr. Doom mode, his acting was annoying (the scene when Doom is looking for the Invisible Woman saying "Marco Polo" is obnoxious-maybe that kind of acting worked on "Charmed" but it shouldn't be happening here Nip/Tuck boy). And why do they have Jessica Alba in those obviously fake blue contact lenses? Perhaps I'm just being picky, but these things were a distraction to me.

However, does this mean that this is a bad comic book movie? Not at all. I found it was fun to watch. The story was all right and the action was great. If they make sequels to it, the set up portion is now out of the way. There is real potential now to focus on a stronger story and sharper character developments that would further enhance the franchise. I certainly hope this will be the case, as this first movie looks like a pretty good start.

Caesar says thumbs up!
