I've always wanted to go to Italy. The rich cinematography of this movie has me packing my bags.
As for the film itself, I thought it was well-acted and well-written, and it is handled with a subtlety not typical of American film, which is typically in-your-face. The homoerotic angle was unexpected, but it didn't bother me, and it added an extra layer to the plot.
I enjoyed Damon's performance, but I think that Jude Law stole the show. Other killer performances were Cate Blanchett as the inconvenient woman who keeps popping up around Ripley, and Phillip Seymour-Hoffman as Freddy, the snotty friend of Dickie. I thought that Jack Davenport did a great job as Ripley's would-be boyfriend, and as the only person in the movie that treated Ripley like a person. Davenport is sexy, and I would like to see more of his movies.
When I first saw this movie, I didn't know it was based on a book....
I think the movie really showed how the rich treat the have-nots, and how they often become victims of their own snobbishness and shallowness. All of the characters had a distorted view of reality, and this movie is a study of what can happen when all of these different character flaws come to a head.
