As an avid Hawaii Five-O fan, whom has seen all the episodes in various reruns, I would have to say that this was probably one of the best seasons of the slowly aging 'McGarrett' and his team. The other seasons I thought were great was season 2 and 4.

Among the episodes from this 1975-76 season, which were enjoyable was the two hour opener, "Murder: Eyes only", with the return of Wo-Fat, "McGarrett is Missing", "Death's Name is Sam", "The Case Against McGarrett", featuring the return of the Vashon character played by Harold Gould, "The Defector" and an underrated classic, "Wooden Model of a Rat" with guest star Ed Asner.

As well, like other series, there are some poorly dated episodes, as you would expect from a series produced in the mid-1970's. As well, what is great about the show, is the fact that the actors manage to carry over their aging selves into their roles. Let's face it, all of the characters were starting to shows their ages by this point of the series.

My hopes is that the mastering for these episodes, will be an improvement over the previous season. It was evident from Season 7, some of the episodes did not go through the full mastering process, as some of the episodes the were recently remastered for syndication. Perhaps it was laziness on Paramount/CBS not to go through the entire library to fine tune this. As well, I wished that a second audio track would have been added to create a 5.1 channel surround for the amazing musical score of this series, especially from this season, which has some of the best music scored for the series.

Well, Season 9 will be the last of the solid episodes from the series... From the 10th season on wards, it gets sketchy from there...

Enjoy!!!
