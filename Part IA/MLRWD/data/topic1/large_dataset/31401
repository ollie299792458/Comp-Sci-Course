If you are looking for a looking for a work-out that will leave you looking like a body builder, than this is not the book or type of work-out for you. If you are looking for a work-out that will leave you with sexy feminine curves, lean legs, a flat stomach, and drop-dead gorgeous arms, then get this book and Trayc's DVDs. I am a mother of 4 with 2 year old twins. I am an athlete, and I have been a competitive athlete since I was 15. I never lifted weights when I was 15, but in my youth I always had a beautiful atlheltic build. I can't stand the work-outs that tell you that the only way to be fit is to get big muscles, and I have the type of build that puts on bulk quickly. I am forever grateful to Tracy and her work-outs for helping me find my way back to that thin, toned, solid, and curvey look of my youth. I can't believe how my body is changing every day. I have defined and toned legs, abs, and arms. You would never guess that I had 4 children. Trust me, it is hard work. I do the mat work almost every day, and the cardio dance 4 times a week. I have done tons of other videos--P90X and Insanity work-outs, and sometimes I substitute these for the caridio...but NOTHING replaces the daily muscular structure work-out. I would suggest getting her mat work-out and her most recent design series and switching the DVDs every 10 days. Hang in there, and you will eat what you want AND be amazed at your body. Thank you Tracy!
