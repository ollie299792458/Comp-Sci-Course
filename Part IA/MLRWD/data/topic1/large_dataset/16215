I've been watching this a lot lately as it has been doing the rounds on my digital cable TV stations.  The critics are wrong.  The problem is that everyone is a critic and it seems that some people are rarely ever happy.  It's not LOTR, but it's still a good movie.  Cage is good, Kruger is as cute as ever, Sean Bean is... well, Sean Bean.  Love his on screen presence.  Jon Voight's character cracked me up, and who cannot enjoy Harvey Keitel in anything?

The whole conspiracy and idea of the treasure is entertaining and it's a real Indiana Jones type of a flick.  It's what Sahara should have been.  I'm a churchgoing Catholic, and as anti Catholic as the Masons are supposed to be, I don't consider this an anti Christian film.  That's silly.  The Masons are a great plot device.  It seems that many people have it in for the Masons. (including Rome)  Oh well.  Better a Mason than a Jihadist I always say!  ;-)

I'm going to buy the widescreen DVD b/c I like the film so much and would enjoy the better quality on my 57" widescreen TV.  It's great escapism.  BTW could Cage flash that Rolex Submariner any more than he did?  If Rolex didn't pay for that and the mention by name then what a free advertizing coup for them.  Bravo!
