Note: This review is on Mark Twain: A Musical Biography ASIN: 630272001X, but somehow it is also appearing on another video for an unknown reason - the two videos are not related.

It's very clear that this "musical biography" has been extremely well researched. Famous people often have multiple biographies, but very few have them turned into musicals. It takes a tremendous collection of talent to put together history, poetry (lyrics), music, costumes, staging, and acting into something like this. This video was shot during a live performance and yet there are close-ups and different camera angles which make for good TV. It's apparent that meticulous attention was paid to many details and it makes for a wonderful viewing experience. I found myself enjoying the parts of Twain's life I already knew about and also learned a few new things. The large production numbers are very entertaining and some of the individual performances are spectacular -- some of the solos are captivating. The music itself is very well done and it's surprising that this musical doesn't find its way to production companies around the country. This is a very entertaining way to get some history about this amazing person without your typical "documentary" flatness.
