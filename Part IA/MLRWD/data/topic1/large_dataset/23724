For starters, the description listed here is inaccurate. There is no commentary by Neva Patterson. The commentary track is by Dina Merril and "Film Historian John Lee." Sadly, about 75% of Ms. Merril's commentary has nothing to do with this film, but with other events in her life and career. Mr. Lee's commentary is more relevant to this particular picture, but sometimes inaccurate. The Fox Movietone News short, "Designers Inspired For New Creations By Film 'Desk Set,'" is fun. The collection of still is nice, but was letterboxed then surrounded by a filler background for some strange reason, which makes the photos very small on the screen. The theatrical trailer, with its craft editing, is very interesting because it seems VERY risque for its day, particularly where it leaves you with the impression Tracy has left his clothes in Hepburn's bedroom. There are also trailers for four other classics that are fun to watch. The transfer to DVD of the feature film is decent, but nothing spectacular.
