It is as funny as it is dirty. If you enjoy dark sarcasm, this movie will suit you well. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are a lot more creative than most people give them credit for. "South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut" does more than entertain us with blatant mockery and fart jokes. It has personality (... a crappy personality, but great none-the-less). It is entertaining time and time again not only because we can associate the situations and characters in this movie to people we know and events that happen in the world, but because one of the countless implications that are made in this movie may have new meaning each time the movie is seen. I give this movie 5 stars for creativity and personality (Aside from the fact I find it more and more hilarious the more I watch it). Some say you have to turn your brain off for this movie, and for many people I can see why that might be a good approach to this movie, however I prefer to read between the lines. In a movie that is this blunt and tactless, it is easy to be wildly entertained.
