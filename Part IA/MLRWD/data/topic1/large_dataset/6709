There has been lots of enthusiastic hoopla over the newest (2009) BBC Emma with Romola Garai.  But this earlier adaptation, with the wonderful script by Andrew Davies, is still the best. Davies has a genius for preserving period language, which, in Austen's case particuarly, is crucial to period drama. This is only one reason why I prefer this over the 2009 version, whose screenwriters have modernized and, in my opinion, dumbed down Austen's language.

This version is not only perfectly cast, but perfectly acted--all the characters are portrayed exactly as Austen wrote them. Production values, of course, are top drawer, and the musical score is appropriately suited to the period. (Another unfortunate trend these days, besides modernizing the language, is using music that is jarringly modern.)

Despite glowing customer reviews of the 2009 version, this one is still the most faithful in terms of language and character portrayal. Let's hope the current trend of trying to make Austen "fresh" for today's audience is short-lived. She is timeless just as she is.
