I will always remember "Fraggle Rock."  My dad recorded most of the episodes for me, and when the Disney Channel re-played many of them in the mid 90s I watched faithfully every day before school.  Now that they're on DVD, I couldn't be happier.  September 6 can not come soon enough.  I have the three DVD currently available, but a complete box-set will be awesome to have.

There are no other children's shows that teach morality that are as entertaining as "Fraggle Rock."  Red and Mokey have been my heroes ever since I can remember.  I remember thinking to myself, "What would Red (or Mokey) do?"

Looking back "Fraggle Rock," it is very weird, but that's what makes it so wonderful.  Jim Henson was one of the most imaginative storytellers ever, and the only creature I can think of as loveable as the Fraggles or Muppets is Yoda.  But even Yoda is from Jim Henson's Creature Shop and let's not forget that Frank Oz worked with Henson and the Muppets.

The Fraggles are a great treasure that has been returned to the world.  Horray!
