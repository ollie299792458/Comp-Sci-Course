This is a powerful film, with great performances (Especially by Sheryl Lee, who is an emotional volcano here) and some of David Lynch's most claerly defined statements about the soul, but it lacks a lot in other areas.  Although the first third of the film is weird and witty, the rest is frightening and almost abusive to the viewer.  Longtime Twin Peaks fans cited a disapointment that many of the characters from the series were left out, and focusing on the elements at hand seemed to shift the focus far away from the anti-Mayberry of the Pacific Northwest.  If that is the case, then there is no way the movie could have succeeded, as it would have been too long to sit through and would have been able to focus on nothing.  Still, the film seems to waste time through many sections (the opening scenes, for instance) and hustle through meatier matters (such as the old woman and her grandson.)  In the end, I think expectations were too high, and Lynch's attention seems to have moved on.  Still, really haunting and powerful, just not enough.  (Maybe the rumored deleted scenes will answer most of the critics.)
