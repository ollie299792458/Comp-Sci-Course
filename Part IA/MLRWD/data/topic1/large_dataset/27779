Just finished watching the video and am mindblown.  Wouldn't say it's a GREAT movie ... the Shakespearean angle didn't quite work for me. But it clearly portrays the depth of vulnerability, the at-once jaded and innocent  quality of the street kids, especially Mike (Phoenix).  I have  the feeling  River's death was probably hastened by playing this role. It's hard to  imagine how any actor, especially a young one, would not be deeply affected  by portraying the extreme abandonment and feeling of being unlovable that  this role required, especially if he wasn't emotionally stable and/or  lacked a strong support system.  But for all its grittiness, its graphic  depiction of the screwed-up-ness of the world, this movie left me with a  feeling of compassion for all of us humans ... the deep wounds we sustain  and our desperate attempts to find meaning.  This is not an easy movie to  watch; it won't make anyone happy and may actually leave you depressed, but  it may also break your heart open and make you want to tell someone that  you love them.
