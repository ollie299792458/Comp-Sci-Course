This was a great purchase. The musical numbers are so memorable and lovely to hear--younger viewers may not recognize some of them, but they stand the test of time:  "Shall We Dance" is still so romantic, "We Kiss in a Shadow" truly tells the story of people in love, and "Hello Young Lovers" tells of the generous heart that has known true love.  Beyond the romantic aspect of the story, however, is the struggle of the King to bring his country out of third world status--something that easily resonates even today. The musical is quite true to the factual account in the book, "Anna and the King of Siam".  There are a few deviations in the story (for example the slaves were actually burned at the stake for running away--but this would have put quite the damper on a musical--even so the treatment accurately depicted the harsh cruelty toward slaves).  The story of slavery is one that should not be forgotten--the historical ties to the United States and our own struggle with the slavery issue at that same time period is very well done.  The middle school teachers showed this film to our students, since there is so much of world history, customs and challenges still faced by countries and individuals today, there is quite an educational opportunity. Certainly as entertainment, The King and I is funny, thoughtful, interesting, lavishly produced, musically lyrical and memorable.  As a history study, it is also a worthwhile way to learn about a place and a period of time.  The quality of the DVD was fantastic. I highly recommend it.
