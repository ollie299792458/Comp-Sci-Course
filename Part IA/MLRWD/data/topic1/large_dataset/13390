Here's a movie with tons of energy, not particularly leading anywhere, a minimal plot, lots of cinematic eyecandy, layers of sound and shot and an over-the-top soundtrack (an assassin double barrelling in slow mo to the refrains of "I'm Cool..."), and an ending which ties it all down, with a light, maybe coy, but perfect touch.

I really can't say enough about this ending. The movie all hangs on this ending. Michele Reis smoking a cigarette bringing a chopstick dripping noodles to her red red lips and then the wave of ectasy which passes her face, when the Japanese actor breaks a bottle over the head of a neighbor in the next booth he doesn't like the looks of and subsequently gets pounded in the receding aisle of the noodle shop. Well, then, an acappella Yaz...this is forgiven, for the one moment these characters are together in the movie, she leaning into him on the back of a motorcycle under the yellow lights of the city tunnel. It won't appeal to that part of the brain which wants weight and layers from the cinema; but it feels right, it captures a bright light of human epiphany, the movie works its way through its frenetic hour and a half, and earns that moment, like the lives of two strangers whose entire lives are lived and meant for that one moment they will cross on the street, and brush sleeves.
