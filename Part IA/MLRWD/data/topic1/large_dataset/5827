"The Night Of The Iguana" . . . i can only say this: Richard Burton . . . and Ava Gardner! -- this movie made in 1964 in "black and white" is a piece of "poetic magic".

I fist saw this film back in 1964 . . . and years later when i watched it again, i was surprised that it was in "black and white" . . . my memory "filled in the color" and i remembered it in brilliant color . . . perhaps a cinematic trick of self-delusion . . but i believe it was the color brought to this film by an excellent cast of actors . . . and Richard Burton, playing the defrocked priest-turned-tour-bus driver and Ava Gardner, a most world-wise resort host (who "knew" the rev T. Lawrence Shannon better than he knew and understood himself) lead the procession of more than excellent actors who bring this Tennessee Williams play "to life".

WEhat a great film . . . do not miss it . . . watch it more than once . . . don't expect "special effects and tecno-wizardry" . .  . just sit back and be drawn into this "tour" . . . become a passenger tourist observer . . . and be mesmerized and captivated by these master actors/actresses.

i have seen Ricahrd Burton in many and various roles throughout his career . . including his great "Hamlet" . . . but to my mind, this movie, "The Night Of The Iguana" presents Burton at his very very best and most memorable . . . "black and white in living color"!
