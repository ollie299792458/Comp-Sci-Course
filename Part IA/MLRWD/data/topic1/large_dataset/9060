First of all...I really liked it. Now I must tell you that I went in to see this movie with a poor attitude, because I don't like Jack Nicholson movies (except for "A Few Good Men" and "Wolf"). Ever  since I saw Jack in the "Shining", I have thought the guy was  just too psycho. Well sure enough, I found that I now like a third Jack  Nicholson movie and yes...this should be known as a "Jack  Nicholson" movie. Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear were great in their  respective parts, but Jack carried the day. The movie was funny in a most  offensive way, serious in a very sad way, and bizarre in a Jack Nicholson  way. Jack plays a guy who is just rude and offensive to everyone he meets,  you feel sorry for him every so often, but those brief milliseconds pass  and you go back to thinking he is just a jerk....but then even jerks have  the potential for changing. Now any one of you who like to rip on others or  those of you who all know a person like that, then this film is for you,  but if any of you are on the receiving end of a person like this, then  you'll even appreciate this film, because guess what...he does begin to  change for the better...so maybe there is hope. It is not surprising that  Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Golden Globe awards for this film.  You will definitely be glad you saw it, even if you are sitting there right  now saying no way, well stop talking to yourself and go see it....you will  like it. Bottom line...if you are looking for a great movie this month,  then this is "As Good As It Gets".
