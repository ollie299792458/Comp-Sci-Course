While Fidel did replace a dictator that was running Cuba in a very disorganized way, while allowing corruption and poverty to flourish, instead of setting up a "democracy" as he always said he would, he became King of the island, his slaves the Cuban people, and the corporation buddies (the various Canadian and European investors.)

This movie doesn't even hint on the many murders and tortures that the KKKomandant has used to gain and remain in power.

If KKKastro would of used his wit and charisma, into fomenting Cuba into a democratic country, Cuba would really be the star Pearl of the Carribean. Instead, he chose (out of hatred against the USA,) to inprison Cuba into the dregs of the socialist bloc, make poor decisions despite expert warnings, and polarized the Cuban society into the very thing he fought against; the wealthy investors and mayimbes, and the common dirt poor Cuban who is not allowed to step into most beaches, hotels, or clubs that cater to the tourists.

Wow! The slogan has changed from socialismo o muerte (socialism or death,) to ultracapitalism or death.

One last comment, being that Harlem seems to think he's a real leader; please investiage the very bew blacks that make up his politburo; they are, in a country of almost 70% blacks and mulatos, a couple compared the mostly white majority. Very much an under representation.
