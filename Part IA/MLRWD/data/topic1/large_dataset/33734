Going into kick-Ass I had some doubts because I feel this movie was poorly marketed since it seemed to be advertised for teenagers and the movie is obviously meant for adults. So after watching the movie I was extremely impressed I found it to be funny and action packed. I was expecting it to be funny, but not as action packed and dark as the trailers led me to believe. The movie being a little dark mainly the Big Daddy and Hit Girl parts made me fall in love with the movie instantly. I actually went to see the movie twice in the theaters and I barely go to a movie once let alone twice.

I can honestly say this is the 1st movie in a long time Nicolas Cage didn't piss me off since his character was perfect. But obviously the star of this movie his Hit-Girl, she steals every scene in the movie I don't know if it was the shock factor of how kick-ass she was or she was just perfect for the role. Either way this movie surprised me and was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.

I say give it a chance and please this movie is not for kids despite how this movie was advertised which explains it's poor performance in the box office after it's great opening weekend. I can't believe parents took their children to see it when I was at the theater despite it's R rating. And they walked out angry and than bashed the movie on the internet. This was not meant for kids you are bad parents for ignoring the R rating. Also reason I mention this is because I have seen at too many sites parents complaining about this film.
