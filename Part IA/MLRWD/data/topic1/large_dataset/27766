Open Water 2 is not as good as the stellar Open Water, but if you liked that one, this one's worth a watch.

It WAS entertaining and unpredictable, it DID command my attention, and the premise IS compelling. I have to recommend a movie that manages to accomplish all that.

Open Water 2 features a small group of friends stranded in the ocean because everyone had jumped off the side of the boat, and no one had taken the responsibility to pull the ladder down. They have no way of getting back on. Everyone is in the water except a hungry, wailing infant, while her mother listens as she fights to stay afloat in the ocean.

The owner of the yacht is inexperienced, emotionally distraught, and drunk.  They're all in way over their heads out there (pun intended), but the movie's not dumb just because they are. It's possible to imagine yourself caught in this hopeless scenario on a private yacht involving a lot of flirting and alcohol, with people who have no business being in the deep end of a pool, much less aboard a vessel like this.  Thus I rate it scary and suspenseful enough to make for decent entertainment, especially since it claims to be based on a true story.
