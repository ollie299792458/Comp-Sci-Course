"The Pillars of the Earth" is my favorite novel of all time. Despite the length, it kept my interest the whole time and told a magnificent story. I was nervous about watching the mini-series because usually these do not live up the novel. I was write, but it still was a fun watch.
The series does deviate and cut (the book is 1000pages long so some cutting is understandable) quite a bit from the original story. No spoilers but some major events are gone or just forgotten about. Ken Follet himself is in the series as a peasant at one point so that lets you know that he did approve the changes.
Otherwise, the series is very entertaining. The introduction for every episode is absolutely beautiful. The acting is superb and the set is very well made. Costumes are top notch as well. Prior Phillip is especially well acted I feel. The special features are well made and show clear effort.
If you haven't read the book (DO IT NOW) or just don't want to, this will be a great mini-series to you.
