I didn't get to see X-men while it was in the theaters, so when my husband and I bought the DVD, I was worried about a little something I like to call "Overhype Syndrome": you know, when everybody you know sees a movie before you do, and they all tell you how great it is, and by the time you see it, you're expecting great things, and when you don't get them, you're all let down and ready to hurt someone. Well, I've read every review, and visited the website, and all my friends have seen it, and I was definately expecting great things. And I got them. I got them all. Every expectation was met. Not too much bad dialog to clog up the flow of the story, no drawn out mush scenes dragging down the pace. It was great. Cyclops was the perfect uptight geek, Jean Grey was appropriately Goody-Goody, and the best part, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos didn't mess up her part by trying to act. Sure, there were things that didn't follow the comic book (Wolverine was a little tall, and Rogue had a real name, and Storm wasn't claustrophobic), but none of it really mattered. The only really major change was Magneto's origin, but that was to make his reasoning look like more than just pure evil. Anyway, the movie was AWESOME! If you haven't seen it yet, see it. If you don't own it, buy it!
