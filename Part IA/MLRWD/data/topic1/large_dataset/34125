I have only just begun to watch the second disc in this set, and so far, I feel the laughs are at least as good as the previous episodes, if not a bit better! But having just started to watch disc two, I wonder if they screwed up the order of the episodes. In season 3, Fred was absent due to visiting family out of town. At the beginning of disc 1 of the fourth season, episode 1 is "Fred's Treasure Garden," and Fred just appears all of a sudden; no fanfare, no reintroduction, no explanation. But the first episode of disc 2, which they call episode #9, is titled "The Surprise Party," which depicts the welcome-home party for Fred, complete with extended ovation, after his long trip out of town. It seems this should be the first episode of season four. Which leaves me now to wonder, how many of the episodes are out of order? Or did they just mislabel the discs, and if so, how many of the discs are swapped? If the current disc two should actually be the first disc, who can tell me if the current disc three should actually be the second disc? It would be nice to follow the episodes in the order they were aired, especially after the awkward fashion the screw-up reintroduced Fred this season. If someone S&amp;S fanatic could please list the actual order of the season four episodes, that would be appreciated. Thanks.
