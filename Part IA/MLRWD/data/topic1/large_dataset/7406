Douglas Sirk's obviously artificial looking movies are extremely fascinating. While a bit outdated in the sense of dress and behavior, and acting style, All That Heaven Allows is by all means a classic film.

Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman play an outdoorsman and a widow of upper-middle class, respectively. Hudson is young and rugged, and Wyman is a proper woman, and their falling in love is the object of Wyman's friends' jeers and insults. A widow slumming it with an outdoorsmen - how horrid! A particularly poignant statement made by Douglas Sirk, to be sure. Sirk was obviously far ahead of his time in the making of this film, which makes it all the more enjoyable.

Everything in this film, from the technicolor to the classical acting style, to sets and costumes are over-the-top. Perhaps this is also a statement being made by Sirk? It's impossible to know for sure, but these are just one of the many different interpretations that can be made.

Wyman is particularly endearing in the film. I haven't felt so strongly and bad for a character in recent memory.

I loved this film, and while I'm not sure if you will to, give it a try! It really is a wonderful love story, despite the fact that it takes place in a very different decade.
