nothing this bad can receive 5 stars, but given the place these oddities hold in my heart, i can't do less than 4.  they provide exactly what one can expect of cheaply made 1950's science fiction: no-name actors (Zsa-Zsa was the exception to the rule), bad - sometimes painfully bad - special effects, atrocious plots.  and yet, and yet... they are what i grew up with, as i stared desperately at the snowy screen of a black and white tv, trying to make out what was happening.  perhaps no one brought up on today's special effects, video on demand, dvds, and the overall pervasiveness of video will understand just how cool the giant behemoth was (when it finally appeared), or how scary (yes, scary - to a seven-year-old) the alien from "attack of the 50 foot woman" was or how oblivious little kids were to the sexual innuendo that sometimes appeared in the oddest of places.  if you vaguely remember these fondly, buy them.  now.  you won't regret it.  and if your kids are young enough, you can watch them with them.
