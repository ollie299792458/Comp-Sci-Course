The previous movies went downhill after the first (as is usually the case), although I still enjoyed them as a fan of the genre. Now, where do I start with this one?

The only thing more annoying than the sub-sub-par acting was the shouting in pretty much every single scene of the movie. I wish I were joking, but this was one of those movies where it was just excruciating to watch through to the end. If you really must watch this movie I highly recommend taking some form of pain killer before pressing play, you'll thank me later.

A few other thoughts...
- None of the characters were likable on any level.
- The whole plot, if you can call it that, was ill-conceived at best.
- This just seems like a poor attempt to cash-in on the Sleepaway Camp name and make a few bucks from the fans with fond memories of the originals.

I really cannot understand all the 5-star ratings/reviews for this movie, the only reason I'm throwing my 2 cents in is in the hope that someone reads this and stays clear of this low-budget trash. Don't get me wrong, there are great low-budget horror flicks out there, most of the greats are low-budget, but this is certainly not one of them.
