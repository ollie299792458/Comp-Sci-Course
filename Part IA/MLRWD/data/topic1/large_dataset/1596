Everyone said the the book of The Beach was very cinematic, this is probably true but for full character development and the bringing to life of personalities within the story, the film is the better of the  two.
Danny Boyle has done a lot to make the film his own despite it being  based on Garlands book. He has given substance to the characters, Sal's  movie character being more believable and more domineering than in the  book.Her partner bugs only has a small part to play in the video but he too  is better rounded and seems to have potential for real evil than his book  counterpart.
Leonardo DiCaprio makes the video from beginning to end, his  character is neither angel nor saint a very true to life and expertly  portraid. This talented actor makes us aware of his fluctuating emotions  and feelings throughout the story with not only his commentary but also  body language and subtle facial expressions.  It is the kind of movie that  makes us wonder what we would do in similar circumstances.  It shows us  that no matter how ideallic the surroundings, human nature will out. It has  a feel of "Lord of The Flies", a group of people randomly brought  together looking for paradise, but can paradise exist when it is to be  inhabited by human beings, that is the question!
A very thought provoking  movie, entertaining with never a dull moment.  You will find yourself  discussing different aspects of it for weeks to come.
