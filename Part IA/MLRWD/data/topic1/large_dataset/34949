Does anyone else hear Spike Lee??? A large number of people would evidently find this film distasteful due to the visual perception that's viewed at first. This film is probably the most powerful film that he's directed yet. Please don't be misled by what you may have read. This movie is something that all Americans as well as the world should witness first hand. Spike Lee delivers a cold and chilling message to mainstream America (Black & White) that reflects the perceptions of African Americans in entertainment. Spike indicates that even though minstrel shows are no longer visible through mass media, The same identical traits and stereotypes exist today. Basically Lee projects to the audience that a majority of present day Black entertainment is nothing more than one conglomeration of a minstrel show. He displays that in many instances, African American television shows may have Caucasian writers, producers, and directers, who in many cases are completely oblivious to the African American experience or struggle. This is one of the most intriguing satires ever concepted, at least in my opinion. This movie should be appraised for what it conveys. If you have an open-mind and are actually able to perceive this movie for what it trully represents you would in turn understand what is facilitated. This movie includes Monumental performances from Tommy Davidson, Damon Wayans, Savion Glover, Mos Def, Mike Rappaport, Jada Pinkett-Smith, and Paul Mooney. This movie will force you to view telivision, music, and film in more of a subjective but yet conscious way.
