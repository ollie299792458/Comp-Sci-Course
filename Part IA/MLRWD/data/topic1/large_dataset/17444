Like another reviewer below, I had to go and read the one-star reviews and try to fathom the damage these folks have sustained prior to watching the film.  I count these rather faint strikes being marked against a fantastic  film:
1.  "No 5.1 sound!"  Oh boo hoo!  It also did not have  Leonardo di Caprio  If fancy sound is why you would buy this, you're  clearly not getting the point.  Go buy Titanic and The Matrix.
2.  "I knew what was coming"  yeah, right!  :)  If that's so, why do  we see you at the convenience store buying lottery tickets every danged  day?
Sadly, too many people have already commented on "the  twist", which only excites speculation amongst those who have not seen  it and will lead to premonition in a sad number of cases.  But what I love  about this film is the CHILL I get (I've seen this maybe 6 times over the  years) each time when the characters come to realize the situation for what  it is.  This scene makes my neck hairs stand on end, and it is one entirely  devoid of action.  
THAT is the sort of depth of awe this film elicits  from me, and (judging from the stars) is why to get the film.  It's just  sad that the buzz that there is a twist to this film may ruin it for some.  Give it a try.
