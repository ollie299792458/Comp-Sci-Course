Not the worst film I've ever seen, but a close second.  My roommate's quote for this film was "It made me want to claw out my own eyes and stuff them in my ears."  
This film is a mis-mash of fairy tales, combining "Swan Lake" with elements from "Cinderella," "Sleeping Beauty," and "Beauty and the Beast." From "Sleeping Beauty" we have the father despairing of her birth until late in his life. Yet we never meet Odette's mother. From "Beauty and the Beast" we have the theme of love should transcend appearance and the motif where Rothbart comes to Odette every night to ask her to marry him so he can have her kingdom legally. And from "Cinderella" we have the ball. After Odette's father is killed and she disappears, Derrick's mother attempts to convince her son to wed another since she thinks Odette is dead. In this we get the song "Princesses on Parade," where Derrick is forced to sit through a long line of women paraded for him in outlandish costumes and their finer points ticked off like a bad singles ad.
The film suffers greatly from being too derivative, too predictable and trying to be too many things to too many people. This is truly bad animation. The Swan Princess is everything that is trite and annoying in all of Disney's films all rolled into one film. The songs are horrendous but fortunately immemorable, there is no characterization to speak of and a concert film has a better (and less predictable) plot. However, apparently some people really love this movie, but in my opinion if you want "Swan Lake", go to the ballet.
