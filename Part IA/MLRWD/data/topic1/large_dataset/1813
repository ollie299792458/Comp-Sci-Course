I saw this movie when it first came out and my husband and I absolutely loved it.  It was one of those movies where you felt like your life had been changed when you walk out of the movie theater.  I've thought about it a couple times over the years, but figured I would probably never see it again.  Well it happened to be on a movie channel tonight and I watched it again.  It still had the same effect on me and my kids were really interested in it.  Unfortunatley, I turned it on 35 minutes after it had started and the kids still had homework to do and showers to take.  So I decided to check here to see if they sell it.  They do and I bought it immediately!  It is one movie I will LOVE to share with my kids.  It is such a powerful movie with a powerful message that is still relevent today.  I think it has a great message about how we treat people that are different.  My kids are in high school and I think that this is something that will change the way they view people that may not have the same things (i.e. looks, advantages, etc. ) that they do.
