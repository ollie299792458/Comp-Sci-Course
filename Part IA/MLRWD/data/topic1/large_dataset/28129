It's important to say at the outset that the video and sound quality of this DVD are superb, and this for a re-release of a film done in the nineties.  The production itself is exquisite, with sets, cars, clothes, and dialogue that perfectly evokes the Los Angeles of 1953.  James Ellroy's book was long, tedious, loaded with subplots, and an interminable read.  The script for the film picks the strongest characters and subplots, reweaving them into a largely new story which stands on its own.  The last time I recall this happening was with The Godfather in 1971, and Mario Puzo collaborated on that screenplay.  It's a good thing Ellroy is nowhere to be found on the credits for this one.  LA Confidential is notable for being the US debut of Russell Crowe in the role of Bud White, and an auspicious debut it was.  Kevin Spacey is wonderful as cop-on-the-take Jack Vincennes, and when he drove up in his green '53 Studebaker Starliner coupe I said, "YES!!!  These guys know what they're doing!!!"  And they do.
