From the novel by Whitley Strieber and directed by Ridley Scott's little brother, Tony. (Top Gun & Beverly Hills Cop II)

Miriam (Deneuve)and John (Bowie) Blaylock seem like the perfect "eternal" couple.  A couple of chic, clubbing 80's vampires, that is!  Until John inexplicably starts aging right before Miriam's eyes.

The once young, sexy John is liked to Dustin Hoffman's 120 year-old Jack Crabb at end scene of "Little Big Man".  The quickly aging John seeks help from Dr. Sarah Roberts (Sarandon) but, indeed, it is too late to regain his youth.

Miriam packs crumbly old John away in a coffin along with her other ancient lovers and moves on with just a single tear shed to more younger flesh and the sexy seduction of Dr. Sarah Roberts.

Lots and lots of exchanges and changes go on all played out with some really beautiful cinematography, breathtaking set design and setpieces, and great classical music to boot.

I got a kick out of some of the other cast members like Dan Hedaya, Beth Ehlers (The Guiding Light), Ann Magnuson, Jane Leeves and Willem Defoe.

I won't spoil the twisty and ironic ending for you as it is a doozy!  Watch and see what the Blaylock's are up to!

The Hunger a pleasantly different, 80's uptown twist on vampirism and is not to be missed!

Happy Watching and Unpleasant Dreams!
