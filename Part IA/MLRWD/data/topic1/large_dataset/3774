This magnificent set includes seven 007 titles that span over the period of 1962 to 1997.  I consider this to be the best of the "James Bond Collection" volumes... and I'll explain why.

The set includes a sample from four of the five actors to play the role of Bond; it also features the introductory James Bond film, Dr. No, which should be held in high acclaim simply because, along with being a great Bond installment, it was the movie that kicked off the 007 phenomenon.

You should also consider that this set includes Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me, and Goldeneye. These three titles are considered by many critics to be the best movie in the era of their respective Bond actor (Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Pierce Brosnan); I would have to AGREE with them!

Here are some facts about Volume 1: the set includes The Spy Who Loved Me; IMDB.com's users rate it 7 stars - the best rating a Moore-era 007 film got, and the highest rating on a 007 film since Goldfinger.  According to the same database, Goldeneye was rated the highest for Brosnan's 007 films, as was Goldfinger for Connery's.  On the Goldeneye disk, The World of 007 documentary is included as a special feature, which takes you on an interesting (and informative) journey from the beginning of Bond to the Brosnan-era, hosted by the beautiful Elizabeth Hurley, and including interviews with stuntmen and crew members.

The only weak point I can see in this set is Licence To Kill, which I feel is the lesser of Timothy Dalton's two 007 films.  However, I don't feel that is significant enough in itself to deduct a point from the rating.  Overall, this is a great set.  If you can locate one, I highly suggest that you buy it without hesitation!
