Based upon a true tragedy, this movie speaks volumes about the depravity and is a stark portrayal of exactly why optimistic humanism has never lived upon to its promises.

This film is downright sad. Sad in the absolute hatred that is exhibited and also the uncertainty and fear that goes along with this particular war.

I was emotionally moved by this film and the portrayal of the abandon of hope from the West was really eye-opening.

This film brings out some stark realities in international relations and intervention. One of them is that world powers are reluctant to intervene out of pure principle, they normally only do so when it is to their advantage. When it comes down to it, practically speaking, many people see people across the ocean as being less "human" and therefore would be reluctant to intervene on pure principle.

Don Cheadle does a fantastic job in portraying the main character.

The film screams: How much would you be willing to risk to save people from genocide?
