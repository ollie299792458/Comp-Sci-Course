Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back is by far the greatest movie that I own!  This movie is filled with hillarious antics and is jam packed with huge well-known stars of hollywood, such as will farrel, chris rock, shannon elizabeth, jason biggs, sean willian scott, a monkey, mark hammel, princess lea, the guy from dawson's creek, scooby doo and the gang, and so much more!  The movie is about 2 stoners that are on a quest to stop a miramax film titled, "bluntman and chronic" from being made.  The movie stole their likeness rights, so they want their mfing movie check, as they so sickly put it.  On the way to Hollywood they hitch a ride with a van full of hot chicks that are international jewel theifs that mislead Jay And Silent Bob into freeing animals at a research facility, while the girls rob a diamond bank. I do suggest to keep this movie out of the reach of children because of the numorous "f" words in it.  With that said this is the greatest "f"ing movie that I have ever seen in my entire life!
