Denzel Washington's chilling portrayal of Alonzo Harris, a corrupt, murderous narcotics Cop, dominates this gripping crime drama. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a rookie "auditioning" for a spot with Harris' squad. Before his"Training Day" is over, Jake will fall into a vortex of corruption, murder, and betrayal, and see his belief in the system turned upside-down.
  Washington does his usual great job; You'll spend the entire film hating him, but being drawn in by his charisma at the same time. Hawke delivers an equally solid, if less flashy, performance, and holds his own with Washington. Great casting all around; Supporting players Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Scott Glenn also add a lot to the film. Director Antoine Fuqua keeps the film moving at a breakneck pace, and the ending is phenomenal.
  The extras on the DVD include the HBO "Making Of" Documentary, deleted scenes (All of which would have added a lot to the film), 2 music videos, and an alternate ending, which answered a question I had about the film when I saw it in it's theatrical release.
  Overall, an exceptional film.
