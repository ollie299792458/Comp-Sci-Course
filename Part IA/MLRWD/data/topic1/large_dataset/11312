As you have read previously, The first ten to fifteen minutes of this film are FANTASTIC. Unadultrated Horror, Every sence of the human nervous system ponder the idea of "What would you do if you were in that scenario." You would die!. The credits would of been even better if it had not had the MTV style flash photography it had in order to keep the younger viewers interested. The whole of the movie were the opening credits. The scene in particular which was most disturbing was the secret service trying to protect the President of the USA. AWESOME, i can only wonder why the director decided to throw these scenes in a manner in which most people could not understand. Non- the less the movie is very good, entertaining and scary. The zombie delema, well I loved the running zombie, I also loved the pregnant lady scene. The producer is one sick pup. I can't wait until he directs again. The end of the movie was good as well. If you sat around to see it. It came on the screen after the end credits came up. It told you the fate of the survivors. I'm glad I was not a survivor in the film, I would of rather been taken out in the dawn then wait around all day to be taken later. You know in The Day of the Dead...Hint.
