If you want to get away from the mundane existence of everyday life and go on a great adventure, I would suggest getting this movie.  It takes the J.M. Barrie tale to wonderful new heights with stunning visuals and gorgeous landscapes.  And the children chosen to act were superb.  Jeremy Sumpter is the perfect Pan, with a mischievous grin and a wonderful sparkle in his beautiful green eyes.  And Rachel Hurd-Wood makes an amazing debut as Wendy.  She is perfect for the part, playing the role as I had always envisioned it being played in my head.  The wonderful undercurrent of a young crush between Peter and Wendy is both sweet and heart-breaking, as this can never be, because Peter will never grow up.  Also, added to this already wonderful film is the extra of the alternate ending.  I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it, except to say that it's clear they weren't planning to use it in the film as you can see the special effects props quite clearly.  And also to say that the alternate ending allows for a wonderful transition into the movie "Hook" which once I finish watching, I will review.

Two Thumbs as high up as I can go!!!!
