What a treat to find this show again!  I was such a huge fan of FAMILY. I was in high school at the time and just beginning to appreciate a well-constructed, thought-provoking script.  Certainly, the show is dated but not to the point where it's unwatchable.  It's amusing how some heavy issues are approached so gingerly.  Then we were shocked - now we smile and think "God, they were cautious back in the 70's."  But for me, experiencing the Lawrences again was like a family reunion - pardon the pun.  I loved these characters and their interactions together.  This show was very sophisticated for it's time - and in today's era of Survivor, Super Nanny and Nancy Grace, I long for television written BY clever people FOR clever people.  Okay, so I'm being overly cynical.  Yes, there are some well-written shows today mixed in with the shlock - if you watch long enough you'll find them!  But I digress... Sada Thompson's stoic Kate is a wonderful matriarch.  And don't forget inquisitive Buddy, brooding Willy, perfect father/husband/champion Doug and, of course, bumbling big sister Nancy!  FAMILY is a great nostalgia trip with relatives you forgot how much you missed.
