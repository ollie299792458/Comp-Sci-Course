This is exactly what's up!  A great new addition to the genre.  Part Thriller, Part Family Drama, Part Extreme Horror, this has an excellent mood to the film, accented by wonderfully grandoise "Kubrik'esque"  Wide shots of forboding sets to help incorporate the hopelessness this film exudes all work very effectively in my opinion.  Hats off to the director and actors!  And damn, some realistic gore FX if I've ever seen them, there is a great shot of a man cutting our protagonists palm and then it bleeding out into the sink where you really couldn't have really cut his hand to make it look any more real... very unsettling.  Don't listen to the naysayers who will give it obvious comparisons the The Wicker Man and A Serbian Film, which are both excellent pieces on their own, and yes, of course it will have its similarities, but judge it without comparisons and you will no doubt have one of the best horror films of 2012 under your belt!  This is definitely what I need more of!  Cheers and Enjoy!
