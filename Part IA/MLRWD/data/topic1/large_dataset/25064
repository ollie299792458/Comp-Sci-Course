I first saw this film when it was in limited release theatrically.  It was much more powerful watching on the big screen versus the DVD.  I was a little suprised that the DVD was not supplemented with more extras considering that it received a noteworthy Academy Award (no bios, special commentaries, widescreen format, etc).  I was riveted by the story and most of the casts performances.  No one can dispute the fact that Halle Berry' s performance was exceptional, but she had a strong supporting cast to help her.  Billy Bob, Heath, and Peter Boyle were thoroughly convincing in their respective roles.  My only criticism of the film was that Halle's complexion always seemed to look fresh and dewy despite the fact that she was destitute, alcoholic, smoker.  Still when she had to perform, anyone watching could feel the emotion she was conveying.  I would highly recommend viewing this work if nothing else but to see what was required for an African American actress to finally break the color lines.  She had to be willing to show herself in the most unflattering way and let it be known that she knew her place for the Academy to feel that she was worthy of the highest distinction.
