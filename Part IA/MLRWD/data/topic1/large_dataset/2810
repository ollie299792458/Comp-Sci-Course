How can I best describe Outlaw Star? One statment: Totally fun. This anime series isn't a thinking man anime, it anime series where you have fun watching it and it a great escape anime as well. You aren't pleage with soul searching questions like you do with EVA or unanswered question like with The Big O. This series is meant for one thing, fun. Yes do you have the unanswered question, but none of them are ones that will kept you up at night.
Like most people in the US I saw Outlaw Star when it was on CN and while CN is good to intorduce you to a series. The best way to view this series is unedited, this is because Outlaw Star was gutted like a fish by the editers on CN and this is do the fact to the age group this series was targeted to. But seeing Outlaw Star unedited fixes the lack of communitity that you get with the CN version. Outlaw Star is the type of Anime that you should watch load because all of the sound effects that are all over the place. The picture quaility is great and like with most series that are releae by Bandai the English Dub is not only good, but great.
