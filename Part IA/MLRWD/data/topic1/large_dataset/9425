Bette Davis again proves she is one of the best actresses that ever existed.  She always stated how she wasn't beautiful like other actresses and was just a plain Jane, however, when you watch this film, you realize she was really physically quite beautiful and her acting is just marvelous.  I cannot name one actress that had the ability Davis did.  This is an excellent movie.  Considering its age, it comes across as very likeable and is a real tear-jerker at the end.  She was in love with George Brent in real life at that point in her life and it shows.  I especially enjoyed Geraldine Fitzgerald who played her best friend and was tickled seeing her because she played the grandmother to Dudley Moore in the movie Arthur.  All in all, a film worth the money.  I will be getting more Bette Davis movies.  The one thing about Davis was she rarely got along with her directors because she was a very serious actress, cared about her craft instead of just earning a rich income.  Stars like her are rare and don't exist today.
