very good,  but in the first part,  it left me questioning their sources as to how accurate their stories were about the indian civiizations before the white man came.  How did they know so much to be able reconstruct their towns with computer graphics.  It made me wonder if I was being fed bologne or not.
  I was questioning myself through out the whole thing.  How did they know so much and how did they know exactly what happened and what things looked like?  How do they know so much??  I mean this was hundreds of years before the white man came. I think the documentary was very good and well worth the watch.  I just could not get over the first part,  how did they know so much about indians ancient history and how they lived and what their ancient towns looked like. It just seemed a little overly speculative is all.

  And the next big question is how could this be a complete documentary about the American Indians without talking about the destruction of the Inca Empire of Peru. And talking more about the Indian tribes in South America??
