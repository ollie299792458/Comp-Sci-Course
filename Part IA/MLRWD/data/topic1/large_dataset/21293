The above reflects what the creators of this visually stunning, in some cases very entertaining yet contrived film were saying to each other during it's development. The voice talent was excellent, the animation was the best I've seen for an American film for years, however this film borrowed HEAVILY from other flicks. First of all, there is an anime film called Lensman in which a young man becomes "the last hope for humankind". He ends up getting some special device implanted in his hand that can save humanity from a pure energy scourge that threatens the universe. Secondly, Titan A.E. also borrowed liberally from Starchaser: The Legend Of Orin. The starship chases and overall look was definitely an inspiration to the creators of this film. The big problem is that both Lensman and Starchaser were both pretty much animated versions of either OTHER ANIME or STAR WARS. As we all know, Star Wars was a space version of an amalgamation of George Lucas' favorite Akira Kurosawa films. Titan A.E. was also inspired by Heavy Metal, the cult animated film with different stories featuring a pulsing soundtrack. This is the other area in which my friends and I were saying to each other "have I seen this before?" repeatedly throughout the film. Look, Titan A.E. DID NOT SUCK, but it did not take us into any new territory, either.
