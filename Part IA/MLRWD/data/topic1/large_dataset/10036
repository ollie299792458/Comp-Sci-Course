Why everyone doesn't own this is beyond me. Anyone who likes the Universal monster movies should buy this. I discovered this movie curled up in my bed at three in the morning on a rainy night. Fantastic....
PLOT: A group of three get stranded on a rainy night at a creepy mansion. Creepiness ensues.
WHY THIS MOVIE IS SO GREAT: One word-ATMOSPHERE. This movie drips creepy, shadowy, rain hitting the windowpane atmosphere. James Whale (Frankenstein) directed this, with all the little nuances that make his movies so enjoyable. His humor is here in leaps and bounds. The acting is great (What a cast!)
WHY THIS DVD IS SO GREAT: Crystal clear picture- considering it's 70 years old. The essay in the sleeve is informative, the movie still gallery is enjoyable (for those of you who like those sort of things), the interview tells a neat story, the commentary is great, but the gem is Gloria Stuart's commentary. OK, she's old, so it's not exactly fast-paced. But her memories are priceless. Pretty soon all who worked on this movie will be gone...
If you like atmospheric, "bump in the night" B/W movies, The Old Dark House is by far the best one. 
Buy this movie, you will NOT be disappointed!
