As I went into the film I wasn't too overexcited or anything being that it was my girlfriend's pick, since we went to Kingdom Of Heaven last week. However I was pleasently surprised on how funny this movie actually was not because of Lopez or Fonda but because of Wanda Sykes. The one time stand up comedian who also starred in Down To Earth with Chris Rock had me laughing almost the entire time. While Lopez and Fonda had there moments as well whenever they would catfight. For example when Fonda would often imagine doing something terrible to Lopez, like smashing her face in a cake. Or when Fonda would smart off calling Lopez fat and than Lopez firing back saying there's always Lypo Suction. But besides that there are also a few melo dramatic parts for those people who like drama. So in the end as I walked out the theatre I have to see as an overall movie it was pretty good but as a chick flick an instant classic. **** 1/2 stars out of 5, Recommendation if you liked Meet The Parents with Ben Stiller and De'Niro your going to Monster In Law with Jennifer Lopez and Fonda.
