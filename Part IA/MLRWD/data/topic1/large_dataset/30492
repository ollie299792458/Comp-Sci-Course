I've been fascinated by The Twilight Zone series since I was about 7 years old.  I'm 41 now.  Starting last year, I bit the bullet and decided to start getting the series on DVD.  Just purchased Season 2 and while there are great episodes in each season, I have to say that a heavy concentration of my favorites are here.  "Shadow Play" and "The Obsolete Man" are among the best works ever made for TV in my view.  However, even the "lame" episodes in this season are fun to watch.

This is a must for any Twilight Zone fan.  And if you don't know the show, this season is perhaps the best one to start with.

My only complaint -- and this is just a manufacturing defect, is that there were two "Disc 4's" in my set.  Fortunately, it was just a mislabeling.  The "other" disc 4 was actually disc 5, so everything was fine.  I just had to write a 5 on the mislabeled disc and I'm good to go.

Thanks to all of the talented writers, directors, actors, composers, camera operators and all of the others responsible for making Twilight Zone a timeless and enjoyable piece of art.
