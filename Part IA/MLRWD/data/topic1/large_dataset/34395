I'm a real movie buff, but can't believe I missed this one... The story of a mid life hansome man Burt Lancaster, swimming home across the county,via his neighbors back yard swimming pools. It doesn't take too long to realize his view of his life differs greatly from the friends and neighbors, (some not so friendly,) that he encounters as he swims home.  I was left wanting to read the book, as I felt this was a story that was too complicated to cover in a 2 hour movie. Its a movie that some how gets under your skin and leaves you wanting more. He keeps talking about his daughters at home playing tennis,and how much they adore him, he tells everyone his wife is fine..and everything is wonderful in his life....at the end he arrives home to an abandoned, rundown estate..he has obviously been living in the past..but I kept wondering where he had been in the years between actually living there and swimming back home. The people he encounters along the way paint a story and hint of his financial, legal and marrital disasters, but he denies all of it the throughout the movie. I wonder how a re-make of today would handle this movie.
