Most people who follow Eddie Murphy know about the quality of this movie from the point of view of the movie itself.  This special edition is a very good version of the film.  Both picture and sound are very good and the widescreen effect does not interfere for those who aren't purists (I am and prefer widescreen editions).  
Colors are very crisp and the sound is clear and more than adequate.  
The film itself is enjoyable and, while the story is not the greatest, the cast including Murphy make it work with enough suspense to make it interesting to the end.  The suspense really comes more from the reaction to Axel Foley (Murphy's character) by the Beverly Hills force, especially the old chief than it does from the reason for his trip to Beverly Hills (Will he succeed in getting the BH force to support his actions?  will the Chief relent and let Foley finish his investigation?).
The action is pretty standard as a cop show.  However, Murphy's humor and reactions carry the movie and make it rise above the traditional cop genre.  Great supporting cast in Ronnie Cox, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton.  Foley's boss back in Detroit is great and deserves more screen time.
The DVD extras are good and add to the enjoyment.
