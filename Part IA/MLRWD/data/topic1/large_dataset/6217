I wasn't crazy about the last Cronenberg/Mortensen outing "A History of Violence" and wasn't sure what to expect here. Cronenberg has never really made a bad fim and I have a deep appreciation for his darkness, both in the characters of his films and the general lighting and design of his sets.
Viggo Mortensen is strong as driver/enforcer for a Russian crime family in London. He has suprisingly little meaningful dialogue and plays the part well by not overcompensating his badness and instead creating a tense aura with his self-confident and unrelenting facial expression. A man with no doubt, only a mission.
The plotline follows a young London nurse of Russian heritage and her investigation of the newborn child of a young and addicted prostitute who died shortly after giving birth. Her trail leads her to the Trans-Siberian restaurant, which is owned by Semyon, the head of a Russian crime family, Kirill- Semyons impulsive and violent son and Nikolai (Mortensen) a driver/enforcer who is rapidly gaining the fathers favor.

If there is any critcism to be had, it of the unidimensionality of the Kirill role, similar to the "climbing but dumb son" role seen in many other organized crime yarns. Great performances are turned in by all other principals and a good bit of the dialogue is in Russian with subtitles- a move that works in giving an honesty to the tale. Cronenberg always ends on a thought-provoking note, "Eastern Promises" is intense and hard hitting with the kind of script that we don't see often enough.
