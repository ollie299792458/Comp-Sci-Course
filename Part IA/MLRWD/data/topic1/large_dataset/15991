I like that the movie is ambitious, but there are some forgettable performances that mess this thing up.  You think you are going to see some authentic eastern power, and then "keanu reeves" happens.  Those flashbacks while bridget reads the story are just ludicrous.  I have nothing against Keanu Reeves, and I hear he's just a great guy in real life.  I do have an issue with the casting director, who made the biggest mistake he/she could have, taking a great spiritual tale, and casting a mediocre "name" actor JUST for box office sales.  Short term profit is the doom of this friggin show, and what a waste of every viewer's time.  Casting the God-man of the Buddha is a high responsibility and an honor (and I'm not even a buddhist).  You could have an empowered experience, oozing with electricity and glow, making all the audience's hearts move climb to indescrible reaches, but alas, THIS movie is what happens when you have a mediocre westerner oversee a production about the riches of the East.  I know what!  This movie should be remade, and this time, hire a relentless casting director who is hardcore into their craft.  I've said too much, I just really believe art is meant for more.
