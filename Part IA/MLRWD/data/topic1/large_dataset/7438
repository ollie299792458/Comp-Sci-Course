I'm so glad that this movie got a special edition, with commentary and featurettes.  I've always considered this to be one of the best horror films ever made.  It hits on so many levels. The casting is great. The score is the best horror film score ever, and it plays a huge part in the success of the film.  The whole ambiance of the film is perfect, and most of all, it's scary.  It still scares me to this day, and I love a horror film that can do that.  The 'films' that are made today should take notes on how it should be done. Oh, and sure, the acting is a bit schmaltzy at times, but please, how could it not be?  Look at the subject matter!  Anyway, it's a timeless story, and a genius piece of horror film making.  I can't believe they're going to remake this movie.  There is no way to make it better than this. One way to look at it is this- they don't remake crappy movies. One last thing- the original cover art/poster was so much better than this special edition generic garbage we're forced to look at....
