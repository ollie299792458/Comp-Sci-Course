I won't belabor the many fine points of this film (not least among them the casting of Paul Newman "as" Ari). I hope to offer information that isn't as well-known.

The main Palestinian Jew/Israeli's name - Ari Ben-Canaan - has interesting historical significance. (See Uris' book "Jerusalem" for a more in-depth coverage of this topic.) Canaan was the land of Israel before the Israelis settled it. It was, as Uris writes, "the land of Abraham." The name BEN is used in Hebrew names to mean "son." Therefore, this character's name literally means "Son of Israel." And, of course, "Ari" means "lion" (in Hebrew). So... "Israel's Lion"?

Exodus (the film) was based on - surprise surprise - Exodus (the book) by Leo Uris. The movie follows the historical novel with surprising intrepidness, although clipping the ending slightly (and unnoticeably). The movie has the SPIRIT of the book, the SPIRIT of indomitableness that Uris felt emanating from the Jews and their actions.

Secondly, the events described in this film are, to the best of my listening, historically accurate. Even events that the "fictional" Ari Ben-Canaan is involved in happened, and his father existed as a member of the early Jewish parliament.
