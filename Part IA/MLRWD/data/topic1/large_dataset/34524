There are times when a movie "borrows" from a LOT of previous directors.  Scorcese has even mentioned that a camera angle, or a way a scene was set up was something he'd seen or done in a different movie.

Having said that, Zemekkis uses as much of his talent and liberally uses those of the masters to find out how good he can direct a thriller.  Most of it works, some of it doesn't.  Reading some (a lot from late 2003) of the reviews made me wonder why people would spend money to see a movie, realize in their opinions that it's a bad movie, and then spend MORE time writing a review of it 2 years LATER!!  The DVD came out I think early 2001.  "Scream" was good in its self reference, but isn't it still a "stab and stalk" movie series?  How many times did Sydney get chased?

Anyone who says this movie is "boring" obviously hasn't sat through Casablanca, or Psycho (movies with quite a bit of dialogue with no real "action" for more than 5 or 6 minutes) or other movies that are big on dialogue.

Oddly enough, people still believe in watching a movie for the atmosphere more than the story (Silent Hill anyone?)
