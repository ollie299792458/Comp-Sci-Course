This is still the best motion-picture adaptation of a comic-book ever made.  True, the 70's era special-effects aren't very convincing any more.  And, yes, technically, the movie is incomplete;  the plot isn't finished until we get through Superman II (Superman and Superman II are really two-halves of the same movie).  Still, this movie continues to outshine every other comic-book movie made since (including Spiderman) and for a very simple reason.  In making the film, director Richard Donner always insisted upon what he called "verisimilitude", that is to say, a movie that was "true to life."  Unlike so many other comic-books that get turned into movies this one takes its main subject seriously.  It never gives in to the temptation to parody itself.  That's why it works. Chris Reeve looks like he stepped right out of a Curt Swan-drawn Superman illustration and John William's music is nothing less than a cultural landmark:  heroic, soaring, emotional, glorious.  William's main theme for Superman is simply the greatest musical cue ever written for a character.  Once it is heard, it is indelibly imprinted in the listener's mind.  Having heard it, it is impossible to associate the character with any other musical signature.  This is the greatest score ever written by a great composer.  If you are one of the few people who haven't seen Superman, do yourself a favor and buy it.
