Platoon is unquestionably one of the most powerful movies I've seen within the last twenty years.  Though I was too young to remember the horror that was the Vietnam War, this movie captures the emotion and tragedy of what was a dark era in our nation's history.  Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe all put in  strong performances.  (Sheen, in particular, is excellent as the young private who is baptized into the ways of war.)  In a sense, this is "Lord of the Flies" set in 1967 Vietnam.  
The visual transfer to DVD is very good, but it's the audio that brings the film down a notch.  Yes, the cover case indicates 5.1 Dolby Surround, but you can hardly tell even with the sound cranked up.  It might as well be in monaural.  The explosions are muffled and the gunfire is almost too frequently indistinguishable.  (I guess after viewing "Saving Private Ryan" on DVD I'm somewhat spoiled.)  Also, there are no deleted scenes or notable "extras" included in the DVD.  I give the DVD 5 stars for content and 3 stars for technical details.
