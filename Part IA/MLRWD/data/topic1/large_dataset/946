Like a lot of reviewers I had seen the SHR clips when my kids were little. Now that I keep one of my grandchildren fulltime I was looking for something to teach Math, History, Science, Grammar etc. in a fun manner. This DVD has a little bit of everything. Another reviewer had mentioned instead of having the kids listen to nursery rhymes let them hear SHR. Made sense to me. The fact that so many reviewers recall how remembering these catchy tunes helped them during stressful tests made me interested enough to purchase this DVD. Plus it's a great value with 2 DVDs, and ALL 46 songs! I enjoy the DVD as much as my little toddler does. I'm sure she will have even more appreciation of the wit and educational value of this video as she gets older. The Playlist feature is great! I love the options you are given in using this DVD. The only complaint I have is the over the top number of Disney promos at the beginning. I can see having one preview, but the number they place at the beginning is unnecessary, stupid and annoying.
