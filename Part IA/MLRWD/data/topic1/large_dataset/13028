If you are sick and tired of Religious fundamentalists denying the science of Evolution as first proposed by Charles Darwin in his seminal 1859 book "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" simply because they really don't understand the proven scientific hypothesis proposed by Darwin and later shown by James Watson and Francis Crick's discovery of the DNA molecule how Darwin was correct; even though Darwin did not know the actual mechanism of Evolution.  This NOVA documentary clearly explains both sides of a conflict of beliefs that's been in the news since the Scopes' "Monkey Trial" of 1925 in Tennessee.

On one side of this continuous issue stands the Nation's Religious Fundamentalists' devoutly held belief in the Creation story in the Bible's Book of Genesis, where it is stated that a supernatural Supreme Being created the heavens, the Earth, and all living creatures on the Earth.  Some of these devout Religious Fundamentalists want to call this Supreme Being an "Intelligent Designer" to side-step the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment by labeling "Intelligent Design" as a "science" to supplant the theory of evolution now taught in high school biology classes.  On the other side of the issue are the parents of those high school students who believe their children's Constitutional rights would be violated if their biology books were altered to include the Creationists' viewpoint.  The Genesis account of Creation is true to the extent that God created life, but Genesis does not detail how.  Fortunately, the humans that were created were each given a brain with which to reason how life may have come about, and the other how's and whys of the other sciences as well.  Albert Einstein once stated:  "I want to know God's mind, all the rest are just details".  This NOVA documentary explains some of those details, and why Intelligent Design is Not a science.
