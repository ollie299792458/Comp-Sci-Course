As an avid fan of the original Upstairs Downstairs series, I was interested to see how this new miniseries would continue the story.  As most of the main characters of the original series are either dead or are now too old to continue in their roles, this would have been quite a challenge.  The only member of the original cast was Jean Marsh who played Rose Buck.  Eileen Atkins, a co-creator of the original series with Marsh, has a major part in the series as the Dowager Countess.  There is no other continuation of the original story other than the musical score and some schmaltzy mementos such as Hudson's key tag that cause Rose to smile wistfully in fond remembrance.  The characters are rather one dimensional and not particularly convincing.  The script lacked finesse and subtlety.  The set design was lavish but this did not make up for the banality of the script which seemed to be based on Barbara Cartland style pot boilers.  Some of the story lines could have been very interesting such as the flirtation by the English upper classes with fascism but these were never fully developed.  It is watchable but only just.  The reference to Upstairs Downstairs is rather misleading as it bears little relation to the original series.
