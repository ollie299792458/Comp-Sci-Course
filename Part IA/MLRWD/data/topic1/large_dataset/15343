The description provided above says so much.  But, in today's world with the emphasis on business, interpersonal relationships and differences in opinion, PERCEPTION is everything. Four people tell about the same event in  different ways. Each way is convincing. One begins to say "that's what  happened" and then the circle opens.  This can be watched in a group  or at a party and great discussion will result, maybe with some Saki to  mellow the differences. 
There is an actor who walks into the scene at  the beginning, wanders around and seems to set the stage for the four  stories.  After they are told, the pouring rain, which has kept the  listeners around stops.  The actor picks up life in a way that offers  redemption for all.  One can focus on the opening or closing and build a  story.
This is great for movie buffs, those starting with their first  subtitled movie and also anyone concerned with interpersonal relationships.  Marketers would especially gain from this.
The challenge is to get a  vision that all can agree on. Rashomon does not achieve this goal yet all  can agree something happened. What? The question is part of the  universality and greatness of Rashomon.  Buy it and guard it. agree  take  all.
