This movie validates the universality of woman's quest for meaning in Life. I dare say many women have dreamt along with the tale, of ending their ( perceived or real) isolation and finding hope in the midst of their grey mundane lives.I loved the poster she kept hidden in the cupboard of her "vacation fantasy spot". The lack of attention her spouse remembered to bestow upon her is all too common. I recommend this, and it's surprisingly upbeat and hopeful end, to all who feel they have lost sight of their vivid purposeful life. It is the quintessential story of unconditional love and acceptance, healing the hearts of self and others.

For women 35 and up. It requires a level of empathy that only living lonely, as an adult woman may impart. Especially for peri -menopausal women who are struggling with the next immanent passage in their life.It offers hope, a lovely travelogue and resolution of life's Path across a colorless daily drudgery . Creative* plot and quixotic mix of characters and sub plots.It presents us with a compassionate view of several "personality types" and how a positive intent can manifest in finding True Self in the midst of private inner sorrow.
