How can I explain this film.  Think Hepburn, Finney, Donen and music by Mancini.  Then set the scene, French countryside and most wonderful supporting cast..Eleanor Brohn and William Daniels..let's not leave out Ruthie.  Bittersweet, love that seems so wrong but is so right.  Haunting words, blended with music that stays with you always.  Dialogue that pops into your mind, at different times.."what kind of people don't talk to each other in restaurants?"..."Married people" and you will find yourself thinking of this when you look around a restaurant at your fellow diners. 
 Hepburn is at her most beautiful, charming, sophiscated, sexy, mature, and gentle.  Finney is a bastard! so full of himself, but loves her always, as long as he gets his way (and aren't most men like that?)The most amazing cinematic moment comes when Finney confronts Hepburn and her lover...and the ensuing scene will break your heart and then take you to laugther.  Way to go Mr. Donen!
Kudos to all who were involved and have left us this most beautiful film.  It is timeless!
After watching over and over through the years, I still see something new, something that makes me smile, laugh and shed a tear. This movie defines why you have to work at marriage when the other partner doesnt work as hard.  We have all been there!
Take the time, spend a few hours, and then sigh at something most wonderful.
