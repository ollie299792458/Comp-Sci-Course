As I am not a raving Ashton Kutcher fan, I have to admit that I was surprised by his likeable performance in this film and felt that the chemistry between he and Amanda Peet was excellent in this entertaining but yet predictable romantic comedy.

The film starts with a chance meeting in an airport between Emily (Peet)and Oliver (Kutcher).  The premise is that a stand-offish Peet bets Kutcher $50 that his dream of owning his own internet business and moving out of his parents home will not be fulfilled within six years.  The movie follows the two over the next several years and follows their ups and downs with relationships with others.

Over their several 'chance' meetings over the years you find yourself rooting for them to make a go of it...yet something always seems to be in the way.  Although Emily informs Oliver that he has three strikes against him, he eagerly works to correct the missteps.  The relationship is similar to "When Harry Met Sally".

The movie concludes with a predictable but palatable situation.  You will find yourself entertained, although the movie seems that it could have conveyed the same entertainment value in about 15 less minutes.  The middle of the film drags a bit.  Overall, however, I found it to be much better than what the trailer would suggest.  Not a blockbuster, but better than most in this genre.
