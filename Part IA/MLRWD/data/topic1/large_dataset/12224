Update:  Wouldn't it be nice to find a widescreen version of this movie.  Amazon listed this as wide screen, but what I recieved was PAN & SCAN.  The Movie was great.  It would have been MUCH better in widescreen format....better yet..give me blu ray with digital sound effects!

Those who gave this movie low marks are neither as bright nor knowledgeable as they would have you believe.  True - the movie was not historically accurate because it is a MOVIE.  The public does not go to the theater to watch documentaries.

Who really knows the whole truth?  If you desire more information about Geronimo, (Goy-Ak-la was his real name), I strongly suggest that you read the books; Geronimo, In His Own Words and The Truth About Geronimo, written by Bitton Davis.  Davis was an Indian scout leader and knew most of the people highlighted in the MOVIE.  He was not fond of Geronimo, but wrote a very interesting account of his attempts to capture the so-called renegade.  The victors in any clash of cultures, all to often, write the history.  My studies of Native Americans have convinced me that the original inhabitants of this country usually provide the most reliable accounts of these clashes.

About the movie:  I agree with those who felt that the action scenes were well done and the scenery was breathtaking.  The directing and acting was very good, especially Wes Studi and Robert Duvall.  The movie, while it may not be historically accurate, gave the audience an insight into the issues and adventures of the main characters.  This movie should be in the libraries of anyone who loves a good western or action movie, even those who appreciate a history lesson every now and then.
