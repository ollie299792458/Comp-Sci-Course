This DVD is presented with all the plomp &amp; circumstance that it richly deserves.  The concert, and the DVD, were created with the necessary preparation that suits it's subject, and most of the participants involved with the project.  The Beatles were/are the royal family of Pop Music.  If there is any musician of equal statue, it is certainly Clapton, and his involvement in any endeavor always guarantees that the highest quality, and taste is used in the final disposition of the work.
Many have written here of the glorious show, and the wonderful efforts put forth by these great, and beloved artists who gathered at the Royal Albert Hall that night to give tribute, and celebrate the life, and accomplishments of Harrison, so I won't spout redundant comentary using the same superlatives that you must certainly have read numerous times in the previous reviews in this forum.  But, I will say that it is with great appreciation to all the principles in this effort that I offer my thanks for this gem that I will surely view many more times in the future.  George Harrison will be missed by many, but his music will never be forgotten, and this DVD package is an excellent way to enjoy his music, and honor his memory.
