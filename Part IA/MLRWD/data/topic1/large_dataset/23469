I love this movie. 
Granted, from a mountaineering perspective a lot of scenes are plainly ridiculous: the climbing accident at the beginning of the movie where Peter, Annie and their dad all seem to have bombproof protection and are simply ripped off the mountain all the same - people climbing K2 from base camp straight to the summit, all during daylight on one day - Annie's rope being severed as she is falling into a crevasse - Peter Garret summitting even though he has no previous high altitude experience or acclimatization whatsoever - Monique doing her lunge for the crevasse with one cam in her left hand, groping for the rope with her right hand - it is all a load of crap.
Still, it is great entertainment! Loved the emotional moments, eg interactions between Peter and Annie, Montgomery finally finding his wife (frozen to death), etc. 
Wonderful music and scenery, besides. As to the scenery, for the people critizing that the movie wasn't all shot on K2: this movie was shot in New Zealand, home of Sir Edmund Hillary! This is where he learned the ropes, ok? And yes, where Lord of the Rings was shot in New Zealand too, by the way.
