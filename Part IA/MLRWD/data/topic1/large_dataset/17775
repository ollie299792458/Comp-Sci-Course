I have read Mansfield Park no less than 6 times and seen this movie at least that many.  The movie is wonderfully done and highly entertaining, though it is not an exact representation of the novel.  I find the other reviews interesting.  It's true that Patricia Rozema took some liberties with this adaptation, but I certainly don't agree with some other reviewers that the only similarity between the book and the movie are the names of the characters.  It is the same story, though the screenplay's Fanny Price is based more on Rozema's interpretation of what Jane Austen herself may have been like.  She gives Fanny the thoughts, emotions and writings of Jane Austen herself.  If you have the time, watch the commentary by Rozema on the DVD.  It really explains her interpretation of the novel and includes many facts about Jane Austen's life.  The BBC's Pride & Prejudice, very true to the novel and very enjoyable for me, moves too slowly for the average moviegoer and is too long to watch at one sitting.  Mansfield Park will entertain the average person and perhaps spark interest in her writings.
