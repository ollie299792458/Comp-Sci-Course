This is about a teenaged boy from a broken home, with a mother who thinks only of herself and sex.  She needs "someone to care" but she can't care for her son.  The old guys are fun loving and the movie shows the humor of old age.  You can read the story line from above so I will not bother with that here.

The emotion is there the whole time, but the secret ending and meaning of the title are hidden.  Please get this one and watch it with your kids.  There are lots of lessons in the film!

The acting by Haley Joel Osment was nothing short of outstanding, very emotional, beautiful and filled with true love. It is quite beyond me why this actor has not received the praise and accolades of his peers. This boy has performed so well (the sixth sense, AI and Pay it Forward) and others, each one better than the last. Even at the Oscars when the sixth sense won everybody was shocked that Haley did not get his. His acting in this was even better than Pay it Forward which I found excellent in both performance and concept. What is wrong in Hollywood, don't they recognize real acting talent, what more do they want from this boy?
