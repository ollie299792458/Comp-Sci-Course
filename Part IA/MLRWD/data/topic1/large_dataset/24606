Ummm...this movie is a gore fans classic. It has been afforded this 'classic' status over the years and with good reason. It ROCKS. Fulci has created a movie similar to Romero's in that it explores the zombie vs. man theme, but that's about as far as it goes. "Zombie" (Zombi II) is more in line with Universal's 'voodoo zombie' flicks of yesterday then Romero's social commentary in 'Dawn.' I think the voodoo theme works very nicely and plays out with more straight up 'dread' than did Romero's "Dawn" which had it's lighter moments. Very nicely done.
As for the gore....it's not AS extreme  as you would think, but still nice. The infamous splinter eye-gouging was awesome...one of the best I've ever seen, and then there is some nice throat ripping and one scene of eating of entrails and such, but "Dawn" seemed much more explosively graphic to me. I've seen much more graphic, but I dug the way Fulci created the voodoo-tension and went for the throat with this....check it out, it IS a classic.
