At A Club In London,Hercule Poirot (Peter Ustinov) Overhears Simon Doyle (Simon McCorkingdale) And Jacqueline DeBellfort (Mia Farrow) Celebrating And Toasting Their Upcoming Marriage.When He Next Sees Simon A VERY Short While Later In Egypt,He IS On His Honeymoon Alright,But With Jackie's Best Freind,Linnet Ridgeway (Lois Chiles).And Jackie Keeps Swearing She Will Have Her Revenge.
She Starts An Unending Campaign Of Stalking And Harrassment.When This Stops Working She Decides She Will Just "Appear" Wherever Simon And Linnet Happen To Be.It's A Good Way To Get Under The Newlyweds' Skin,But Eventually This Stops Working As Well.When Linnet Is Found Dead,Poirot Has To Wonder,Was Jackie's Next Step Murder?
This Is Undoubtably One Of The Best Adaptations Of 8 Of Dame Agatha Christie's Movies (That I Know Of) That Have Been Done Yet (Along With Ten Little Indians And,Of Course,Murder On The Orient Express).It's Practically Lifted Right Out Of The Book.I Felt I Was Watching Verbatim Exactly What I Had Read.
It Also Boasts A Dynamite Cast.Along With Chiles,McCorkingdale,Ustinov,And Farrow,There Are Also Stellar Performances By David Niven,Harry Andrews,Bette Davis,Jack Warden,Jane Birkin,And Maggie Smith.And As An Added Bonus-Just Watching George Kennedy As Uncle Andrew,Angela Lansbury As An Over The Top,Has-Been Author Salome Otterbourne (Who Else But Lansbury Could Play THAT!!!!),And Olivia Hussey As Angela's Understandably Embarrassed Daughter Rosalie-MADE The Show For Me.
Aaaah.Camp AND Treachery.And Don't Forget The Bitchfest.Save Me A Seat And Some Popcorn For This One !
