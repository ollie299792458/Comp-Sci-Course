Kate Beckinsale is in this and she hardly fits her angel wings, but she is somewhat less scary than in PEARL HARBOR when she wore clever underwear, or in BROKEDOWN PALACE. She's not as good as in LAUREL CANYON. Oops, I don't mean LAUREL CANYON, I haven't seen that yet. Well, whatever, i can't remember the name of the movie i wa thinking of. Anyhow, VAN HELSING is a pretty good atmospheric piece and the Vampires look more real but i wanted to see more waterfalls in Transylvania. Anyhow the high number of flying things in this disoriented me compared to some Vampire filcks. Still less bloodsucking than you would expect from a movie trying to capture the true circumlutionary postputillious vampire spirit. Not too good for children. My niece went with me, I think she was disappointed because she had Kate Beckinsale mixed up with Kate Bosworth. But I told her not to give up on anybody like Kate Beckinsale, unlike my brother has done, becausse one can learn to breathe clean air at any age. This'll never be my favorite vampire movie. but I've passed two hours in much worse cimenatic torture. Recommended for a pensive day when your excitement receptivity is moderate to lagging.
