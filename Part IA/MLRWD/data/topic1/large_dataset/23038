Briefly, what I like about this movie, well the story was appealing, sweet and warm. Finally I get to see Zach Effron in a role that requires something more than just looking pretty, that he indeed do in this movie, but in a warm way. The little boy acting was really good as well.
My con's, well I did not see any real chemistry between the two characters, it was rather force and the women performance did not impress me. It wasn't the same chemistry I saw in the Notebook for example, Goslin and Rachel were rather intense and believable, specially after the heavy rain in the boat, kind of a coincidence that it have a similar "getting wet" way in this movie as well. Zach is believable in his role and loveable, but I don't know, I didn't see any spark. And in the other hand, I did not like the kid father fate at the end, it should have develop into something more meaningful. Also I felt it to long, I have to fast forward a little bit after an hour in it. And yes I agree with previous review, he is just the perfect man, but well maybe he is just that a good old boy that have seen to much to soon.
