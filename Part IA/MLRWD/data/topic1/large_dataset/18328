Believe it or not, Usual Suspects was actually somewhat of a sleeper when it first came out in 1995...but no longer.  Suspects combines a great cast, an intricate story (don't find too many of those these days), and  outstanding directing.  
What was likely the breakout role for Kevin  Spacey is quickly becoming a cult film noir worthy of quality DVD  collections and has even reached the level of being consistently quoted by  fraternity boys... "Give me the keys ..."
Joining Spacey is  Stephen Baldwin (one of those Baldwins) which turns in a solid performance  as a slightly nuts, yet cool under pressure, McManus (also check him out in  Threesome); Chazz Palminteri (Analyze This, Bullets over Broadway) plays a  tough acting fed who gets played like violin; Benicio Del Toro who does a  great job with smooth Fenster. I'll stop here, but the whole cast is  great.
The beauty of this movie is how the story develops and leads your  little brain into believing the events, names and characters that populate  it.  And when the puzzle finally seems to come together and you think you  are so cool for having "known it all along" and satisfied to have watched a  great movie, director Bryan Singer and writer Chris McQuarrie tear the  puzzle apart like your mean older brother would do only to leave you with a  thousand pieces that could come together in a completely other way.  
Watch Suspects over and over again and discover the subtleties and clues  that are sprinkled around the film.  You'll be continually amazed and  entertained.
