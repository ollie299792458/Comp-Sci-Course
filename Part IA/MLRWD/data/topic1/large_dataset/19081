Like many others, I have been waiting anxiously for my new DVD of How the West Was Won to arrive and, now that it is here, I am afraid I am underwhelmed.

I watched the Cinerama documentary first and was knocked out.  When I saw the HTHWWW excerpts with that beautiful color and seamless picture on my 42" flat screen, I was awestruck.  Then I watched some of the feature film.  The video transfer, while beautiful with the Cinerama lines diminished, is presented as a flat stripe across the screen

The Blu-Ray edition includes a smilebox option for viewing the film.  This is where the image is curved at the edges to truly simulate a Cinerama in the theater. Those documentary excerpts in smilebox with Debbie Reynolds and Robert Preston speaking directly to the three cameras were stunning.  The train sequences when they discussed the stuntman's major accident were unbelievable.  The shot of the curtain opening over the titles with the simulated audience gave me goosebumps.  Finally, I thought, an opportunity to at least approximate the grandeur of an actual Cinerama screening.

The color is superb and the 5.1 sound is magnificent.  The flat image on the DVD version that still has distorted wide images is, at the very least, disapointing.

I hope I don't appear ungrateful for the efforts that went into restoring this classic western, but come on.  Where is the "wow" factor we were all anticipating?

This is how I felt when I bought the restored version of The Harder They Come.  A beautiful restoration neutered by Xenon Pictures failure to master the disc in 16 x 9.

I am still pleased with my purchase of HTWWW, but it was a bit of a letdown.
