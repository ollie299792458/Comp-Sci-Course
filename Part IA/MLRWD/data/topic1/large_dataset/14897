I've always been a Warren Beatty fan. I think his earlier movies were always innovative and refreshing. (Bonnie and Clyde, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Shampoo and Heaven Can Wait). So it was with great anticipation I went to see Reds in early 1982. I thought it was thought provoking, and a history lover's dream. In high school we had to take Americanism vs. Communism (this was during the Kennedy Years 1960-63). However, I have yet to find anyone down here who would share my enthusiasm without being labeled a "communist sympathizer". At the time, I worked for a large metro newspaper and on Monday morning I came in raving about the movie, and you should have seen the look on the "suits". One of them frankly told me, "I'm not interested in communist movies." Well, that was almost 25 years ago. Now I run my own business and I'm still not a communist sympathizer but do enjoy a masterful job of moviemaking. Beatty really did an outstanding job as director as well as Dianne Keaton, Nicholson, Stapleton and others. It is sweeping, grandiose and sad. But back in 1981, when the movie was released you still had a lot of right-winged sentiments and a lot of old timers left over from the McCarthy 50's that saw this movie as communist propoganda. You can look at it anyway you want. I choose to look at it as a fairly accurate historical depiction of the years 1912-17 and the Russian Revolution and all the idealistic Americans involved in New York, and all the heartbreak too. Guess what! Now that I run my own business, I don't have to meet with the suits around the water cooler on Monday morning. Actually, I think we've regressed as a country in accepting different intellectual views. Be careful, If you buy this movie, big brother may write your name down on a list. Seriously, It's just good entertainment, don't take it as a political agenda and you'll be O.K.
