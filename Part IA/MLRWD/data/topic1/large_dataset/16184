This is a most enjoyable DVD. I am a musician, not a dance connoisseur, and my enjoyment of ballet reflects primarily how the dance interacts with a great musical score. Here we have two of Stravinsky's great early ballets, with restored choreography from the epochal original productions by Dyagilev's Ballets Russes, produced by one of Russia's great dance companies, and led by a great Russian conductor. How could one miss? "The Firebird" is beautiful classical dance, with a fanciful scenario and brilliant stage effects to match the inimitably colorful music. I have a copy of the PBS program about the restoration of the "Rite of Spring" choreography. The performance there by the Joffrey Ballet is very good, but this one is better; the dancing is more polished, the costumes more vibrant, and Gergiev's conducting more dynamic. We all know about the riot the original production produced; it's less known that when "The Rite of Spring" was played in concert in 1915 the audience loved it. Seeing this staging, I wonder if the first audience was offended by the choreography as much as the music ... Wouldn't it be nice if Gergiev and company would follow up with "Petrushka" and "Les Noces"? And wouldn't it be great to have well-filmed productions of the two great French ballets Dyagilev commissioned: Ravel's "Daphnis et Chlo&eacute;" and Debussy's "Jeux"?
