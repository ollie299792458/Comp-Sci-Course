Well that was two hours of my life and a squandered free movie rental that I will never have back.  I was so looking forward to watching this movie and it turned into such a sad disappointment.  Here's the story in a nutshell, Isobel (Kate Hudson) goes to France to care for her very pregnant sister Roxie (Naomi Watts).  But Isobel does not take care of Roxie, who's husband has left her for another woman; instead she hops into bed with a young man she just met.  The young lover is annoying at first, but become more appealing as the movie moves on. While in bed with her young man, Isobel plots to hook-up with her brother-in-law's uncle, a conservative misogynistic, but attractive boor.  Meanwhile in a bizarre unbelievable twist, Roxie is being stalked by her husband's lover's husband.  Huh?  Not to mention Roxie's husband's family is scheming to take her possibly valuable, ugly painting.  I thought Isobel was trying to seduce the uncle to uncover this sham, but no, it was just a creepy affair.  It isn't until Roxie's suicide attempt that Isobel takes notice of her sister's heartbreaking pain and dumps her creep of a lover and finally takes care of her.  It's dismal and dark, and a waste of good acting talent.
