I LOVE the message of this film: The media glamorizes criminals and violence. I HATE the way they did the film: Put as much sadistic bloody carnage and brutal beatings as possible in two hours, then add in weird experimental camera work and random bits of animation. I know chastising this film for violence seems silly, but for the most part this film deals with its violence in a far too sadistic manner. I really couldn't tell where Stone was trying to go with this, since some of the violence is presented as an exciting escape from reality, while some was just disgusting for anybody (especially in the Director's Cut). The film would work if the violence had been dealt with in a manner that would make it both limited and evenly portrayed. The outrageous black comedy "Man Bites Dog" is a (ever-so-slightly) less violent and much more compelling film because the violence is presented as being a terrible and anti-human thing to do throughout the film, but gets dashed sparingly with pitch-black humor. In a Hollywood let's-blow-everything-we-can-up huge-budget auctioneer, you can tell the action and violence is fake, so you find it oddly enjoyable. Even in a serious drama like "Requiem for a Dream" or "Fight Club" we see violence as being ugly and wrong. This film can't seem to decide how it wants to portray violence, so it presents it many different ways, which really makes me second guess how well Oliver Stone told the message of the film. The nauseating camera work in the film would have been more compelling if it was used sparingly and viewers weren't simply barraged with it until our eyes hurt. If someone makes another film about how the media glorifies violence, maybe they'll learn that we really don't need to SEE all the violence and that constantly putting gruesome images in front of our eyes isn't effectively getting your point across. Maybe I'm wrong. Before you automatically agree with this, rent it and decide for yourself.
