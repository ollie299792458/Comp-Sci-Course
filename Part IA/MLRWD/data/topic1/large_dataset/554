I love Pink Floyd/Roger Waters stuff (In The Flesh Live is my favorite concert DVD) but I'd avoided this for years because, frankly, I didn't want to see The Wall done by a bunch of people not even remotely connected to Roger Waters' music (Scorpions, Jerry Hall, Cyndi Lauper, etc).  Finally I gave in and what a surprise!  Not only is the stage show an unbelievable spectacle to behold but the music and performers are great.  Van Morrison, Scorpions, Cyndi Lauper, Ute Lemper, Bryan Adams, Paul Carrack, Sinead O'Connor,etc., all do really good jobs with the songs they are given.  The only two performances that I didn't care for were Joni Mitchell (Goodbye Blue Sky) and Jerry Hall (Are All These Your Guitars?).  Joni Mitchell's voice is very good but she embellishes a little too much for my taste and Jerry Hall's speaking part was a bit too over the top.  Other than that, my only disappointment is that this is in (it's original) fullscreen version.  An anamorphic 16x9 presentation (it is cropped however from the fullscreen) does exist on The Wall: Live In Berlin (Special Edition) but this disc is either a) a non-Region 1 disc or b) no longer unavailable.  The 5.1 sound was very good but lacked a bit in the low end.  Overall, the concert is spectacular, the performers are really good, the audio is great, and the video is average.  The documentary is worth watching, too.  I was completely overwhelmed with how good this concert really was and only regret not having gotten the disc sooner.
