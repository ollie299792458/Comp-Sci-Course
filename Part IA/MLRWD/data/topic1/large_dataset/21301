The series episodes range from good to brilliant. To me the best episodes are of an overall quality found only in film (e.g., discovering Adam, the 2 Northern lights themed episodes, the piano flinging, and the Emmy award winning episode where Maurice learns of his Korean son). I must compare this DVD set to other Television shows, and therefore must give it a 5.

The music was a large part of the films and the butchering of the soundtrack is a disappointment to real fans of the show. There are a couple episodes that simply don't work, because they don't make sense without the music. Working in a new doctor is challenging enough. The episode were Dr. Kapra has an emotional lift driving north to Cicely with his wife to the tune of of  Going up the Country on the radio and later has a breakdown in the Brick slamming his hands against the jukebox shouting "I hate this song" makes no sense with the generic blues music they inserted. But at this point, it's doubtful that the studio will be releasing seasons intact with the original music anytime soon. I'd send fans to the individual seasons, but the same music problem exists.

Music aside, the acting, the writing, the cinematography, and direction was a trailblazer and marvel of television. Ignoring sketch comedy shows like Monthy Python and Kids in the Hall, I it may have been the best series to air on television. I'd like to slam the studio for butchering the music, but instead I'll say I would be calling for an extra star if it had the original sountrack intact. If you don't have access to original hi-quality recordings of the shows, then buying the series is a no brainer.

If you don't care about the case, you could even try the seasons independently to decide for yourself (about whether the soundtrack depletion is to big a problem for you) without laying out for the whole series, since the price is not all that much different. Try season Three....
