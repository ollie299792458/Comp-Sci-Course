While nowhere near the original's chaos and creepiness, this release isn't *that* bad.  In the original:
-I liked the fact that the cannibal family was straight from the backwoods and totally isolated (not winning chili cookoffs like in #2, even though that is mildly amusing).  The notion that if you're lost that sometimes you don't find help and are not always welcome, 
-That they really didn't give a damn about their victims (seeing them as just "meat", a carry-over from their past in the slaughterhouse, which I found to be a very interesting theme in the original...a hidden message about capitalism and technology forcing the ignorant and unskilled into doing horrific things just to survive?  And is all this profit and automization worth it?  Again, an intriguing theme,
-The look and feel of the film---grainy, shaky, jarring music
This sequel does pick up on some of those themes, which makes it a better film than the first sequel (I admit though, that in #2 the family dynamics are funny and make the film watchable).  However, this release adds to the Leatherface legacy with a couple key ideas:
-An unlimited supply of family members, who will always kill and cannibalize because this is what they do.  From one generation to the next (as indicated by the *really* old grandfather, mother, little girl) the killing will go on forever.  Also, nice to see some female family members for a change, eventhough their characters are one-dimensional.
-That lone girl in the woods, the only survivor from a previous killing spree.  If only the whole movie was about this!  She was the scariest thing in the movie, this poor girl, trying to stay quiet and hidden, still running and never getting out, physically alive but dead inside.  Imagine the whole forest transformed into a demented cemetery, with pieces of people splayed about or struck into the Fraganaude-like poses in the original TCM.  Being stuck in there, always dreading hearing that buzz in the distance coming closer and closer but realizing that either way you're going to die and maybe it'll be better if you let him find you instead of going mad delaying the inevitable.  *That* is scary.
One last thought:  The TCM theme has amazing potential.  In the hands of a capable director, a real classic could be made.  I mean, imagine how good it could be in the hands of David Cronenberg, David Lynch, or Peter Greenaway???  Greenaway's The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover in particular has quite a few qualities that tie in with TCM that I would recommend for anyone wanting a different take on chaos and consumption.
