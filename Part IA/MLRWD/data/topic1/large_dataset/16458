As a big Steinbeck fan, I just have to ask, "What were they thinking?"  I saw this 1992 version of Steinbeck's classic tale while working as a substitute teacher and was very disappointed.  This version, while using more of the salty language found in the story (the script has all the "Damns!" and "G*ddamns!" of Steinbeck's novel), has almost no dramatic tension and leaves the viewer feeling hollow, as if you had just watched an exercise in an acting class.
The acting is the weakest link in this production's flabby armor.  While watching it, you get the feeling that the entire cast is entirely too aware that they acting and every scene feels forced.  There are almost no moments where the acting feels natural.  Perhaps the biggest disappointment is John Malkovich's cloying, sweet-as-pie Lennie.  Overwrought is how Malkovich plays most of his scenes.  He tries too hard to turn Lennie into a cuddly stuffed-animal instead of a real, human character.  He simply overdoes it trying to work on the audience's sympathies, and ends up making us roll our eyes.  Sinise, on the other hand, is wooden and insincere as George, complete with Sinise's signature unidentifiable, somewhere-in-the-Midwest accent that he uses whenever he plays "ordinary, working folk" (I think he used the same accent in "The Stand").
Sinise's direction is similarly uninspired.  The death scene of Lennie, which should have been the climax of the film, feels rushed, and loses any emotional impact it should have carried.
Now I have to admit that my review is biased.  The 1939, Lewis Milestone version of "Of Mice and Men" is my favorite movie of all time.  The acting is top-notch.  Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney act circles around Malkovich and Sinise.  The entire production is unflawed.
I suggest you stick with the original.  The Sinise version proves you can't improve upon perfection.
