Swingers is one of those movies that just seems to strike a cord with everyone.  No matter who you are or where you from, you can probably relate to these charecters.
The movie itself is about five young, aspiring actors who are trying to make it out in Hollywood.  The main charecter(played by Favreau)recently moved out onto the west coast and seems to be having a hard time dealing with the fact he just can't get a decent job in show buisness.  Not only that he just broke up with his girlfriend back in New York and that doesn't help matters much either.  Bring in his friend Trent(Vaughn)to get him out on the town to help him get on with his life and you have a movie about the adventures of five 20 something guys in Los Angeles.  
Definitly an anti-MTV generation type movie, this movie really exposes the complications between relationships not only between lovers, but between friends.  It showcases the short lived swing craze of the middle 90's that has died way too fast.  Also a diverse soundtrack including Big Bad voodoo Daddies, George Jones and Bobby Darin.
You'll probably find the special edition DVD is chocked full of fun extras including two commentaries in which hardcore fans of Swingers have been watering at the mouth for what seems like an eternity.
