This film is probably the best sword fighting film I have seen with lots of action and a great story line. A film fact is that the guy who teachs the actors how to sword fence has done so many movies from robin hood,  three muskateers and now zorro he is actually in his 70's. Basically the  story involves De la Vega (Anthony Hopkins) who is the original Zorro in  the movie and then after years of him being in jail he teaches  alexandro(Antonio Bandaras) all his skills to continue his service to the  people a master/apprentice type movie. A classic quote from the movie  De  la vega:"zorro was a servant of the people he did what was needed  !" Alexandro "Yes and now he is needed agian". The acting is  superb Anthony Hopkins(enough said), Antonio Bandaras plays the part of  zorro reall swarve and calm and not forgeting the lovely Catherine Zeta  Jones who has a spanish look about her and her accent is well done well  suited to the part. The DVD sound and picture is superb quality and the  special documentary is very interesting, it explains all the planning that  is put into the movie from the staged sword fights to the backround  scenary.
