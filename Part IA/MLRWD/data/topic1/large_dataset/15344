I'm not going to review the movie (that's what my Rotten Tomatoes account is), but the thing is that people who have seen past Underworld movies know exactly what you're getting. This time though, it's just in spectacular 3D. Filmed with RED Epic 3D cameras, I can honestly say that this ranks with some of the best 3D I've ever seen before. As a Film student, I can tell you that it looks spectacular. The clean digital photography added to the fact that the film was actually SHOT in 3D rather than post converted makes a massive amount of difference.

A lot of people have been complaining about the 3D blu-ray because apparently it doesn't play in 2D. Well, when I bought mine from Wal-Mart, it said on the case that it DOES play in 2D as well. If you have a 3D TV, then that means your TV has the ability to convert to 3D as well. All you have to do is turn the 3D off on your TV, and voila! Crystal clear 1080p picture in 2D. The only thing I was rather disappointed with was the fact that there weren't many special features. Being a film student, I was curious to know how it was filmed and how it differed from shooting in 2D. But other than that, I love this movie, and if you're a fan of the Underworld franchise, you will too. Plus, it's Kate Beckinsale in tight leather in 3D. That alone is enough to justify the price xD
