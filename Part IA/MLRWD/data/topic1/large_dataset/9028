Normally I love action movies but this movie was so insulting to my intelligence that I would have given it zero stars if possible. I never thought a non-stop action movie could be so utterly boring - and preachy. The technological falsities and absurdities are so glaringly huge and ludicrous that the makers of this movie were either clearly marketing to the easily impressionable, were just plain ignorant, or both.

However, if you regularly hide under your bed thinking that black helicopters from the Federal government are coming to get you then this movie might be for you. If you think the Patriot Act means that the Federal government is monitoring your every phone call then this movie might be for you. If you think that military intelligence must be 100% error-free before engaging in any military operation and that US soldiers should read every enemy they're about to shoot their Miranda rights, then this movie might just be for you. If you call Islamo-fascist terrorists "freedom fighters" and consider the US bad, bad, bad then this movie might just be for you.
