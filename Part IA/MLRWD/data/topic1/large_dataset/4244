Simply one of most amazing films ever made. I am a Fellini fan. I think Amarcord is wonderful, 8 1/2 is pleasantly bizarre and the Satyricon is good for a laugh. But La Dolce Vita surpasses Fellini's reputation, and should stand on its own not as a capsule of a time passed, but as an enduring statement about life itself. The film is, simply put, as intelligent and complex as anything out there. Sure there is a lot of wealthy indulgence, and this is shown with equal parts celebratory awe and biting criticism, but look at Marcello's relationship with his father. Look at the blond bombshell wandering the streets of Rome with a kitten on her head. Look at the final party, in which a tired actress allows herself to be feathered before saying, with true fatigue, "that was fun, but the party is over."

Marcello Mastroianni gives a truly nuanced performance, and his discontentment is evident in his every word. With one look, he can make the audience sympathize with his dispicable impulses.

As effusive as this is, I feel that I cannot do justice to the brilliance of this film. Forget Fellini, forget the indulgence of the jet-set, this film is about beauty and love, passion and loss. A good contender for best film of all time.
