I love Bill Maher, and I agree with the general idea in this movie.

That being said, I thought that it was poorly executed for several reasons.

Firstly, it felt like a big exercise in Maher patting himself on the back for his views. Am I the only one who felt like he wouldn't let anyone else speak? Consistently, his interviewees would get about five words into a sentence before he would cut them off, often to ridicule them. Because of this, no one ever got the chance to even approach making a point or refuting Maher's claims. If someone did try to continue despite Maher's interruptions, he seemed annoyed and his body language was quite condescending.

Secondly, he doesn't seem to go into much depth or deal with any particular subject with any significance. For example, when he was in the bar with the two gay Muslims, he asked a bunch of questions, didn't allow for them to be properly answered (as per the above criticism I had) and then the scene ended. I was left wondering what the point was in most cases.

Bill Maher does a lot of stuff right, and I think that atheists maybe should be more assertive of their views, so in that sense the message of this film is good. I just don't think that Maher is the right choice to make this particular point.
