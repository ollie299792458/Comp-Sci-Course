This set includes 3 DVD's. A short talk by Mark Blanchard kicks off every DVD. The workouts on the first and second one are 94 minutes long, the third 99 minutes. This is a long time to work out, but if you're serious about practicing Yoga, these DVD's are for you.

Every workout is different, though about half of each consists of postures like Upward and  Downward Dog that are repeated throughout most of the tapes. Each tape ends with a lying meditation. The workouts are very challenging (some postures are so difficult that some might find the workouts frustrating) with postures that include standing on your head, elbows and feet. I bought this set more than a year ago and do one of these workouts each week and can now stand on my head, though not on my elbows or hands. As Mark says: "it might take you two, three or four times. Or two, three or four years". Mark explains a bit more about Yoga during the workouts.

Conclusion: these are tough workouts and it will probably take years before you are able to do everything Mark does in them, but if you're in for a challenge and not afraid of some exertion these are great DVD's  to own. In my experience they are Progressively more fun the more you do them.
