John Singleton is a gifted director. Unfortunately, I think he put a black eye in the gang with this film. Baby Boy is a portrayal of young black america that is not needed. You have a manchild who can't seem to ween himself from his mother. His girlfriend, who for all intents and purposes is a whiny &amp; clingy, seems to be very smart but can't seem to get over her baby's daddy. Snoop's character who has no love for those, including Tyrese's girlfriend (who he comes to live off of after he gets out of prison).  Jody's (Tyrese's character) mom seems to be comfortable with a man who has a shady past growin' reefer in her backyard. I am sure some viewers are going to say, "That's just the way things are." and Singleton is just portraying it as it is. Maybe so but aren't you tired of seeing black relationships portrayed in the worst light possible? While I don't suggest Mr. Singleton give us the Huxatables, may I suggest a much more positive characters than a young man in his early 20s riding around on a bike w/no job, pouting around his mama and making babies he can't take care of or black females who seem to be very smart but will take anything from a man just to have a relationship?
