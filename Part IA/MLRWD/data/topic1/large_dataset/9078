It doesn't surprise me that so many people have reviewed this movie and most give it high praise.  Saw it in its orignal theatrical run (I was a mere child!) Owned it on beta, vhs and now DVD.  This is the first time I  have seen it on video in its original 2:55 aspect ratio.  After viewing it  many times on laser in 2:35, I did not think it would make much difference,  but it does, especially in the "grand scenes" such as the  entrance into the dinner, and, of course, "Shall We Dance?"  I'm  happy to say that I got to see Mr. Brynner in his farewell tour (literally,  in that he was dying of lung cancer), and was enthralled from my third row  center seat that his performance was not film magic but a real thing!  While I agree that the film can slow down at times, that doesn't bother me  because with DVD, I can skip around for my favorite moments which what DVD  is all about.  Not many films hold up all the way through many times, so I  am happy to say that this DVD edition is wonderful, and many more people  should get to know it.  thanks, jt
