Make no mistake about it, this is a bad movie; I can remember when it came out in 1981 the kids in my junior high were talking about how it wasn't very good even though it was one of the big releases that year.

But it's the of sort good bad you can get into and enjoy.  Modern movies, with perfect CGI animation and intense action seem to be missing something.  Older movies that had to make do with limited budgets and effects have more of the heart and soul of their maker's work in them---they also ran in their own world and were fun.  Today they're forgettable; in ten years people will still remember this movie, and may forget there was even a remake in 2010.

Good is Ray Harryhausen's effects, Burgess Meredith's performance as the helpful Ammon - who seems a lot like the old man from "Logan's Run," Neil McCarthy as the nemesis Calibos, and the subtle battle between Laurence Olivier and Maggie May as dueling gods.  Even the post-seventies hairstyles that nobody would touch today seem appropriate.

Tolerable is the R2D2 inspired mechanical owl, and Harry Hamlin's performance is heroic but somewhat wooden; almost like his lines were written straight from the mythology.

The DVD is nothing to write home about in terms of extra features, but the movie looks good.  Overall enjoy it for your memories if you remember when it came out, or get it for the kids to watch and see how they used to do things.
