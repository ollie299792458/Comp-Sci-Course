"Back to the future" was the most successful film of the year 1985, and it is not hard to imagine why. This gloriously entertaining movie is still director Robert Zemeckis' best film to date.
The story itself is  hardly original, but how it is told is outstanding. Not only that this film  is funny, it succeeds in creating a certain atmosphere that is hard to  describe. An atmosphere that you can feel and which distinguishes good  movies from classics. You really connect with all the characters on screen.  Michael J. Fox was born to play this role and Christopher Lloyd is simply  sensationel as Doc Brown. They both will always be remembered because of  this film. But let's not forget the supporting cast. Lea Thompson, Crispin  Glover and of course Thomas F. Wilson are all the perfect choice for their  parts. The score by Alan Silvestri and the Songs by Huey Lewis also became  classics.
Each time someone asks me which movies I find the most  entertaining of all time, I mention titles like: "Raiders of the Lost  ark", "The Empire Strikes Back", some early Marx Brothers  movies, "Pulp Fiction", and for sure "Back to the  Future".
