I am a big fan of the original Predator movie and I can't even express how dissapointe I am by this release.

I won't be wasting much of your time. The video transfer is simply horrible. This can't be called remastering and Fox doesn't have a valid excuse for this unless they allowed some rookie to work on the movie using some average video editing tool. The 2008 version has some grain to it and lots of grain during the dark shots, but at least it preserved the details and that are very important in order to maintain (and this is what bothered me the most) the atmosphere and tension of the showdown between Dutch and the Predator. While some of the daylight scenes MAY look better (but more CGI in my opinion) compared to the previous release, contrast has been really messed up for the night shots and by removing the grain through a shockingly noticeable noise reduction filter, almost every background detail that added to the creepyness of the final fight is gone! Even the DVD versions feature more details than this one during these shot, which is totally unexcusable.

The sound MAY be a bit improved when it comes to dynamics, but unless you own a really expensive, high-fidelity surroun sound system, you won't be able to notice the minor improvements.
Bottom line - not even worth a rental, not to mention buying.

If you already own the previous version, don't make the mistake I made and stick to that one. It may not be a perfect transfer, but it's much more sharper and at least it doesn't spoil any key moments by lacking important details and shadows. This Hunter Edition is a total waste and we can only hope that Fox will release a proper restauration of the movie in the following years. I just hope that the new generation won't be buying this one for their first view of this great movie.
