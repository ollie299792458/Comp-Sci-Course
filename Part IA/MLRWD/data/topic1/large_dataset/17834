After finding this, and its sequel, in my collection, much to my surprise because I don't remember owning them or wanting to own them, I decided to re-watch them.

To my surprise, I found them more palatable than the first time around, though this one still inferior to the second one.

Perhaps it's because I came to the film again with litte or no expectations, as opposed to when I saw it at a sneak preview with huge expectations (despite never playing the game).  It could be that this is literally the first role I saw Daniel Craig in (Road to Perdition being the second).  It amused the hell out of me that American Angelina Jolie used a British accent and British Daniel Craig used an American one (better than Jolie's).

There is still more humor and quirkiness in Lara's inherited Butler and beyond quirky boy-Friday who creates all her wonderful toys in addition to computer hacking with ease.  At this point, I can't help but feel that Jolie simply hadn't gotten comfortable with her character as well as she did in the second.

Still, she pulls off the high-action skills with grace, emotes well when it comes to her dead father (ironically played by her real father, absent most of Jolie's life and then banished not long after this when he announced to the world he thought she was in serious psychological danger when in fact she was at the point that left Billy Boy and cutting behind and had become a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador and adopted her first child).  Her constant, "Hmmm," and head-cock when confronted with something that surprises her even has become less-grating and more endearing now.

For those who have seen it and panned it, give it a second go.  For those who haven't, approach it with the thought to not expect too much out of it, and you'll find it can be pretty fun.  As it is, I had to go raise my previous rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.
