Although this is not the full version of Leonard Bernstein's operetta, it is certainly a spectacular live concert performance from Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall. Everything about this production is superb: the orchestra (conducted by Marin Alsop), clever staging and props, and dazzling performances by Kristin Chenoweth as Cunegonde, Paul Groves as Candide, Patti LuPone as The Old Lady, with supporting roles by Sir Thomas Allen (Dr. Pangloss), Jeff Blumenkrantz (Maximillian), and Janine LaManna (Paquette).

In consideration of "the best of all possible worlds", this is certainly the best of all previous Candides to have on DVD. Oh, how I wished I could have been there!, and now I am with this amazing presentation of Bernstein's masterpiece. And for those who only know of Kristin Chenoweth from "Pushing Daisies" on TV, her operatic skills and humorous stage presence is a triumphal achievement from my view and will simply astound you. That having been said, I must also admit that the cast is perfectly suited throughout, (both in solo and ensemble chorales). Paul Groves is also superb in the lead and Patti LuPone is (of course) a seasoned pro of the Broadway stage.

I am simply thrilled that this production for THIRTEEN/WNET (Great Performances) was released on DVD for all to enjoy for many years to come. Thank you Ellen M. Krass, Mort Swinsky, Jac Venza and Lonny Price! This production ranks 5 Stars in the company of all Broadway and off-Broadway shows. Thank you, Kristin, for being the bright shining star in Candide's eye!

I would rather not spoil anything in this show, so I will just say that if you haven't seen Candide, buy this one without reservation, and you will have the best seat in the house!
