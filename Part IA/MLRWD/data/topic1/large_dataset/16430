This a four hour dramatized mini-series that was originally on HBO, as noted before. Although I'm no expert on Saddam, it's hard not to have absorbed a modicum of information about Iraq and its long-time leader if one has at all followed the news in recent decades (which I have). That said, this series certainly could have shown way more of the brutality and evil of the Saddam regime than it did. If the producers might argue "It was more about the inner circle than it was about the country as a whole" I could only reply that Saddam dominated his country to such an extent--the way Stalin did the Soviet Union--that the two are inextricably linked. So the question arises, why didn't we see the rape rooms, the torture of children, the gassing of the Kurds (surely a true low point), and the draining of the ancient swamps in the south of Iraq? Not that the series was a puff job, but with these aspects all missing, one has to wonder what exactly the producers had in mind? That Saddam betrayed and executed people we see (especially when he seized power), that his family was nasty (especially Uday, his elder son) we learn too--but that doesn't tell the whole story. Were they constricted by their collaboration with the BBC? I don't know, but even if they were, these things still could have been dealt with without being overly explicit.
So, overall, worth watching, but the question of omissions still nags.
