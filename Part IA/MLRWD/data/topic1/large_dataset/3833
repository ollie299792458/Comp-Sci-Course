I suppose I over think the movies I see, because I am very sensitive to the sub-text associated with every movie released. Often it is that adults, and especially Dads, are clueless,(not the one in the movie Clueless, he was awesome) bumbling, and most importantly, impertinent. Please don't hit me with all of the exceptions. It seems that anymore to see a movie that uplifts the customer, we have to go to the animated/CGI studios. Why is that?
"Despicable Me", partially funded by the French government(for crying out loud), brazenly stomps on these current Hollywood values. It is like a photographic negative of the gazillion dollar formula of former Disney movies, about how a kid can grow up. This is how an adult can accept responsibility and find the deepest satisfaction in loving his children(even if they are not his). The women take a bit of a hit here and come off as slightly smarmy. And the cartoon Dr. Evil resolves his inner conflict between his selfish desires and surrendering to his kids' needs.
These days, when kids don't want to grow up, this is an important message, delivered in a creative, entertaining, and funny way. It even gives Tex Avery a run for his money, with over the top exaggerated gags.
It is the emotional core of this movie that the Dad is absolutely necessary to the family. Yeah, sure, he's all the girls have, but isn't that the case for all of us?
