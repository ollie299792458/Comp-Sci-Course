I watched Smallville off and on and here of the 10th season being there last.I bought seasons 1-9 and watched them until season 10 started,so I could catch up.Most of the early season so the same way every episode,so you probaly will get tired of watching them,like I did.Someone always gets knocked out and doesn't remember what happened the week before or the book The Art of War gets quoted alot by Lex or Lex's father and the constintly repeating scenes of conflict or make up to break up in one whole episode kinds of things get old.But season 1-9 were very fun and exciting to watched and season 9 was truly amazing with the JSA and all the other specail appearrances throughout.

But on to season 10.A very hard season to follow or want to follow.They clearly made this season for everyone from the original cast to come back to say there final goodbyes.Which was nice,even though most of it just seemed like a flip of a switch and there they are,so if you missed even the smallest parts of the episodes.You would be completely lost and with all the people comming back made alot of the episodes for this season seemed half assed or as if they just stopped caring about the show anymore,for example,an entire episode about a very rare bow that they spend an entire episode on,ends up getting destroyed the last 5 minutes of the show or the hangover episode.

Where everyone has to find out what happened the night before,which that episode was very lame.I also hate that that there was no main villian that has anything to do with the story at all.Just shadows of the actual person or clones or body switches instead of the clear cut villain like Lex or Zod were in the past.Darksied would just send his lackies to do most if not all his dirty work,which made him look like a giant pussy.It was like he had something better to do because it didn't seem like he got very involved in what was going on.

It all comes down to two things.After 10 season of constint focus was on the Clark Kent's character and not Superman,but in later seasons,Clark gets called the blur,which finally starts separating the Clark/Superman "the blur" dynamic alittle.But in season 10 they just seem to cram the full change of Clark being a nerd,who can't do anything and Superman "the blur" doing all the things he can do overnight and no one noticed the huge changed and thought it wouldn't be odd,but all of the other characters must have gotten knocked out and forgotten the past 9 years of there lives.But the last,but most important,the whole flying thing.I honestly thought season 10 was finally the season where he would fly.Not on the very last episode and for a very short time on the last episode.

To me it just seemed like they were giving the middle finger to all the superman fans,I always pictured superman being the strongest and most powerful hero out there,but in recent years in animation as well as live action,he would rather root for the Batmans or Green Arrow characters because for the least powerful characters they seem to fair alot better than Superman,who get controlled by the villian or knocked out or kidnapped or something stupid like that and in live action does extremely well only not do extremely badly later on.
