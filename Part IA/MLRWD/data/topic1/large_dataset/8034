I saw this movie when it first came out and loved it, and just saw it again on video. This is one of the most under-rated films of the decade. Hollywood just doesn't  like Madonna, which resulted in this  wonderfully-acted film being unfairly snubbed by critics and the Oscar  establishment. Despite the presence of half the population of Argentina as  extras, this is essentially an intimate story that rides on the  performances of the three principals--Evita, Peron, and Che. Although  Madonna's voice isn't quite up to some of the vocal challenges, her  performance is otherwise on the mark. Antonio Banderas surprised me--his  somewhat gritty vocal quality is totally appropriate to his character as a  peasant revolutionary. Nobody smolders better. His feelings for Evita were  intriguingly ambiguous; it was fascinating to watch him veer from hope to  contempt to something close to sexual attraction. And Jonathan Pryce is one  of the premier musical theater artists of this era. What he does with the  rather underwritten part of Peron is a joy to see. Watch his performance of  "She is a Diamond"--two minutes of subtle, superb acting with  voice, face, body--absolutely wonderful. It seems that most of the  naysayers saw the show on Broadway and find the movie a poor comparison.  Each should be taken on their own terms. Patti LuPone is undoubtedly  stronger vocally than Madonna, but you have to give the latter credit for  taking on a huge challenge and (mostly) pulling it off. And I never thought  Mandy Patinkin's light tenor was right for Che--Banderas, though not half  the singer Patinkin is, has an earthy vocal quality that works better in  this role. I recommend this movie highly for all lovers of musical theater.
