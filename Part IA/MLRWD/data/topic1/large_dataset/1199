I love this film for many reasons. The beauty of the people, their garden, natural area, and home inspire a sense of warmth and calm while watching the birth of a third child unfold. There is also a lot of commentary, which adds information and perspective to the story of the birth.

Water birth, by nature, is less graphic. And combined with the calm and trusting family we see on the screen, this makes an excellent video for preparing older siblings for birth.

The one negative review saddens me and I feel it is a reflection of the fear-based lens our culture uses when looking at birth. The fact that she calmly takes her baby up (and is not driven by fear of the water, the baby's normal color at birth, etc) is what makes this such a great video. The mother in the story is a midwife. She has seen many, many babies born and knows when it is appropriate to be concerned about a baby's wellbeing. This is a beautiful, healthy, natural birth in which the family (including "big" brothers) are present, supportive, and supported. Just lovely!
