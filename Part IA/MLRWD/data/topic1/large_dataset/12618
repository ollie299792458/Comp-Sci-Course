Absolutely the best black and white transfer I have ever seen of a DVD. There are no drop outs, blips, hairs, tears, burns, noise, or anything that  shouldn't be on this film. Warner must have had a pristine original  negative sealed away for this DVD to look so good. The lighting is rich,  luminous, and the grays beautifully scaled lending excellent depth to the  picture. After seeing "Casablanca" on TV and video this DVD is a  revelation. The picture is presented in its original theatrical aspect  ratio of 1.33:1.
The sound too is crisp and marvelously preserved. There  are no pops, blips, buzzes, drop outs, or volume changes. Instead we are  given a soundtrack, that while still monophonic, is the best yet heard. If  any complaint could be made of digital audio it's that the sound is too  forward and harsh for some ears though on the DVD it is only slightly so  and those of you with Cinema EQ on your home theater equipment won't have a  thing to complain about.
Extras like the Lauren Bacall (Bogey's  widow)-hosted special, "You Must Remember This" and the original  trailer (in poor condition compared to the feature), are better than  average and the documentary includes interviews with people who were  involved with making "Casablanca". The production notes are  actually interesting to read but then they would be given the twisted  production history of the film.
All in all Warner has produced a  lovingly-crafted DVD edition of a movie loved by millions all over the  world and nothing about it disappoints.
Time may go by, but  "Casablanca" has become digitally-fixed and now, finally,  physically ageless.
