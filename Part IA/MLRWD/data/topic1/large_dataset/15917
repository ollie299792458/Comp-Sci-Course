I like to see a Shakespeare play updated to modern times.  This actor/director Ralfe Fiennes does with some success in Coriolanus - he takes a Sarajevo-like setting and calls it Rome.  The story revolves around an arrogant but very successful soldier, his arch-enemy and the wrath of political enemies.  Fiennes, in the lead role, does a great job of showing how unlikeable this man is.  Gerrard Butler puts in a wonderful performance as the arch-enemy to whom Coriolanus turns in order to get revenge on his fellow Romans after he is exiled from Rome because of the political intrigue as well as his total antipathy to the common people.

The film has a few surprises, in particular the wonderful performance by Vanessa Redgrave as the very proud, politically astute and ambitious mother of Coriolanus - it is she who has shaped the warrior and also his distaste for the common people.  In that lies the man's weakness.  There is also a bit of Oedipus in the story in the attachment of Coriolanus to his mother.

The film is wonderfully filmed and the battle scenes are graphic and realistic.

It only takes a few minutes to get the ear working on the old English language but it sounds wonderful and natural from all the actors.

A good rollicking tale of arrogance, revenge, vengeance and the inevitable results thereof.
