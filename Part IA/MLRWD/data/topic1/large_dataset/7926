I think that Growman's review is very helpful, and I would incorporate the majority of his comments as my own.  However, I am not sure whether the director's intent may have been "cherish life, love each other more."  Maybe so, but trying to figure out what the director intended is really a moot exercise and quite frankly irrlevant to the review of the film.  What this film did for me, I felt, was showing how different violence can be perceived: violence in its raw form without explanation, and violence with a seed of vengence.  By having the sequence of events played out in reverse, my initial reaction to the brutal death at the beginning of the film was "oh my God, why?!"  Then, I watched the scene again after watching the whole film, and my reaction suddenly turned to "Yes, he deserves it."  I wasn't proud of my second reaction, yet I think it does speak the truth to human nature.  By the way, anyone noticed that the person who was killed at the club was not the right guy??  (the rapist had a tape over his nose, who incidentally was watching his friend getting beaten to death by Pierre).  I am not sure whether Alex was indeed the one who suffered the most, considering that Pierre goes to jail for life having murdered someone in third-party self defense but against the wrong person . . .
