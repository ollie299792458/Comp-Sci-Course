I was 12 when I first watched the miniseries and it was pretty scary. Stephen King's novel is one the finest vampire novels. Enough time has gone by that it should be remade, keeping some changes thta were made for the TV movie, but adding other elements from the book, including fixing some of the plot holes. The major one is (and I can't believe I've never heard anyone else mention this) that Susan Norton and Mark Petrie are captured by Straker. Mark escapes just as Ben and Dr. Norton (in the TV movie) are arrrving. Ben kills Barlow as the sun sets and then sets fire to the Marsten House, burning the vampires inside. So, how does Susan appear at the end as a vampire? Barlow never got out of his coffin. And, if somehow the other vampires got her, (we see them waking up and Susan is not in the cellar)she would have burned up with the others. No, this was overlooked because Barlow was not dispatched in the novel much later, at Eva Miller's Boarding House. But with the condensing of the book to TV, this major gaff got by everyone involved. Still, it is a good TV movie with man fine moments. I just wished that the film makers had paid more attention to the details.
