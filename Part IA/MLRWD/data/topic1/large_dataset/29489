20 years ago another act like this was made by Bob Geldof to bring new attitudes against one of the most biggest problem of mankind... Well, twenty years later we're seeing that the poverty is growing and now many countries have been "shoted" by this problem...

It's very hard to say if this act, to promove shows around the world against the poverty, using singers and famous groups it's the best thing to do... But I think we need to have a position about this subject using some kinds of "guns", and the music is good way to touch or even to send a message for the people and to the government...

Well, about the dvd what can I say? A great box with a lot of music... You'll have about 10 hours of music and shows.. I liked that they promoted this stuff including all the main languages on the subtitles, english, german, french, and portuguese (thanks god!)! Great sound and a great images from the shows around the world...

I can give an important value to this event to get the reunion of the Pink Floyd after so many fights and discussions through the years.. Well, if they could come back and play again, why we can't believe that the poverty can disappear?? : ))

Great show and package... Buy it.. You won't be disappointed...
