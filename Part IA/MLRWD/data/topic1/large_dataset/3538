Let's settle one thing straight away:  Clive Owen is incredibly magnetic, virile and mesmerizing.  You would think, given all of those atributes - and more - that he could have chemistry with a door mat.

Alas, Jennifer Aniston proves that theory wrong from her opening moments on-screen.  To say she is poorly cast is to greatly understate the situation.  She may pull off light ensemble comedy, but Derailed proves that she is incapable of portraying sultry, femme fatale characters.  She doesn't sell the part in the least.  Yes, she's pretty in a Barbra Streisand, eyes crossed, healthy honker kind of way.  But even with the experienced help of Hollywood hairdressers and makeup artists, you don't buy her as someone who ensnares men.  It's almost laughable, except, of course, this isn't a comedy.

So she's not good.

But Clive?  Clive does what he can with a predictable role.  He physically embodies the lackluster Charles of the beginning of the film, and, as Charles increasingly becomes frantic, he lets us live that too.  Is Charles likeable?  Well, no.  It's difficult to like a man whose inability to manage his homelife leads him to believe that he is entitled to have an affair with a woman he meets on a subway train.  Never mind that at home is a sickly daughter.  And never mind what he's willing to sell off from that daughter to get himself out of a very bad situation.  You can't like Charles, even if he is played by Clive Owen.

The rappers - Xzibit and RZA - do good jobs with, again, predictable characters.  Vincent Cassell makes a fabulous bad guy with his slurpy French accent and triangular head.  Even Melissa George, in her woefully underwritten role, gives us a little something.

But Jennifer?  Wrong, wrong, wrong.
