I regret the postponement of watching this GREAT movie! I can say that this is one of the best Kevin Costner's movies ever made! I am not going to discuss the movie events because I can see that so many reviewers already did. But what is truly great about this movie is the sound track, special effects, drama and highly driven emotions all the way 'til the end. The weak points in this movie are: 1. The movie is kind of long that at some point you might feel that it's slow! But it pulls back the threads and events develop in a way that you enjoy! 2. The DVD has a poor mistake since the first side contains only 74 minutes of the movie and you have to flip the DVD to the other side to continue watching the film! And if you have mistakenly placed the DVD on side B you'll start watching the second half of the movie without warning which might spoil the movie for you! 3. With such a big budget and excellence, I wonder why would the director make a mistake in presenting a wrong Muslim prayer! If you notice, when Morgan Freeman reaches England with Kevin Costner he starts praying after he asks about the East direction. But he prays not as how Muslims pray, which I find a big mistake! The director should have studied the real performance of the prayer instead of presenting a fake simulation. Other than that this movie is a MUST see and is a great collection next to other great epics such as Gladiator, Brave Heart ...etc.
