I happened upon this little masterpiece while visiting my sister in Minneapolis. I saw it at a local art gallery by the name of "The Walker". I think, I was probably the only one out of the three of us who attended in our small group who absolutely loved this film. It was so demented, so twisted, and so unbelievably hilarious, that I began to regret living in Florida, where such films are non-existant. No heavy worded review here, simply a solid thumbs up. If you enjoy cynicism, creatively revamped, and artfully employed... you'll love this film. Its almost like taking every fault you might find with a family, amplifying it to an astounding end, and then just taking a sharp left into insensability. This film has it all, an abusive son who is then bullied by his peers, a lactating mother hooked on heroin, a father who not only delves in necrophelia, but lest we forget incest, and a number of other things. Thats alright however, as everyone is sucking on mummys nipples at the end. Its then you smack yourself in the face with the proverbial hand of understanding, and exclaim... "Oh now I get it". Yeah... its great.
