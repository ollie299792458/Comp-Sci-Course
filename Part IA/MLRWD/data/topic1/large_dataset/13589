This movie keeps you on edge from start to finish. Kurt Russell does an excellent job as Eldon Perry, a cop who is burdened by his evil side and it doesn't help when he works for an evil police captain, who is played brilliantly by Brendan Gleeson. Scott Speedman does a great job playing Bobby Keyo, an idealistic young cop who is dragged along with Eldon in their boss's schemes. The plot of this movie is about the investigation of The Jack Of Hearts case which is during the time of The L.A. Riots. Jack Of Hearts is a convinience store where there was robbery and murder and the two guys responsible for it are informants for the crooked boss of Perry and Keyo. The one man determined to bring down the crooked vices of The L.A.P.D. is Sargeant Arthur Holland who is played brilliantly by Ving Rhames. Russell and Rhames gave Oscar-worthy performances and everybody else did a great job with their roles. This movie is not Training Day but it keeps you guessing until the very end. A truly nail-biting movie!
