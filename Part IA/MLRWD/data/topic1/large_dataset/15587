Things I learned from watching Cobra:

Stock brokers, thugs, burglers, weight-lifters and other various and sundry folks like to meet in abandoned warehouses and clink axes together in unison thinking of the "new world"

If you're stabbing an innocent woman by the side of the road, don't get caught so easily

Scissors are great for cutting pizza

The killers of the New World are willing to blow up an entire town, kill people in all ways imaginable, create huge attention trying to avoid attention...?

Cobra can bump his 1950 Merc into a bunch of cholos and get away with it unlike today where he'd get his head blown-off

Shopping carts bounce into the air when you shoot them with shotguns

If you're robbing a grocery store, destroy all the produce and canned products and shopping carts using up your ammo right away then shoot a kid wearing a Raiders hat who you promise to let go free

There was a time when Brigitte Nielsen looked damn good

"Call the Cobra" should be a standard cliche when psychos take over grocery stores

A guy walking around a hospital with bizarre slicked back hair and a huge body-builder physique carrying a giant dagger with a conspicuously guilty face fits right into the hospital wards

Don't put too much catsup on your fries

If a woman ID's you committing a heinous murder, just dye your hair and that changes everything!

If you're inside a grocery store during a hostile takeover trying to free the hostages, reach for a Coors!
