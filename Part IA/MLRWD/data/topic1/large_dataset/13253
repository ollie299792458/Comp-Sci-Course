Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans is an excellent film. Dramatic, action packed, emotionally stirring, hauntingly beautiful music, and with top-notch acting.
I have seen the original release only, so I won't comment on the director's cut dvd. What troubles me is this - the dvd release (1:2.35 non-anamorphic, letter-box matted director's cut), having read just about all the web reviews, sucks, and now that there is to be another release (Jan. 23), it's to be matted in 1:1.85 anamorphic? Hello, ever heard of the original, theatrical release version into dvd in 1:2.35 anamorphic matting? It's either do something right, but the rest wrong; then, do the rest right, but do one thing wrong... Duh.
This is a great movie, but until the people in Hollywood get it right (quality digital transfer, maintaining proper theatrically released matting, anamorphically enhanced, and digitally mastered), I'm not purchasing it. The same goes for movies like Die Hard, The Rock, and Armageddon (all great movies but matted in non-anamorphic letter box format). 
Examples of great dvds: The Matrix, Braveheart, and Gladiator (all matted in anamorphically enhanced, 1:2.35 theatrical release version, keeping in faith to the original film, plus lots of extras).
I'm sure I'm not alone in demanding only the best dvd transfer. Bottom line: Great movie, lousy dvd, and awaiting the correct dvd release version of this movie, that is if it ever gets released.
