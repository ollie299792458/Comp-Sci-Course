This television series is addicting, I bought this along with the rest of the series in July, and I finished it in 1 month! There were some days were I was watching this show, and looked at my phone, and realized that I had spent the entire day doing nothing but laying on my bed and watching Nip/Tuck. I didn't even eat anything! Anyways the series is a nail biter! Liz Cruz is hilarious, Kelly Clarkson plays a character who is someone so not like her, Ladies... Christian, and Sean aren't hard to look at are they? I mainly bought this because when I was in middle school (2006-2008) I just got into the show, I saw the very first episode when I was 9, 4 years later, season 4 has started... I was up later, couldn't find anything to watch, and I couldn't sleep so I came acrossed this show, I was like what it this?! I was hooked, I watched most of season 4, I was only 13 during this season so after staying up late watch Nip/Tuck 11:00pm - 12:00am I was tired in the mornings. I kept watching, I eventually lost track the episodes, and suddenly Kimber was prenant, Matt was a Meth Head, Julia was a lesbian, and I have no idea who this Connor kid was at first. So I watched season 6, hoping for another season, than that was it. Years later, I got a job, and discovered this good/bad thing call Amazon.com, when I was looking for a CD for cheap, and I found it on here. 67 packages in the last 2 years later... I am an addict! I bought the whole series, and I was very excited to start watching this again, and being old (19 year old, and in college) I understand it.

So now I have finished the whole series, and it is so nice to know that I can restart the the series all over again whenever I want. Now if only SVU was cheap on here, I would never go outside.
