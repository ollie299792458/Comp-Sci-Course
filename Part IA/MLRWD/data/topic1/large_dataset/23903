"Mystery, Alaska" is probably the best movie you never heard of. For starters, its cast is incredible: Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria, Colm Meany and Burt Reynolds (to name a few) appear, and the acting is as good as the cast would make you hope. 
On top of that, the story is really very good, and the script is expertly written; the movie tells the tale of a small town (Mystery, Alaska), where the central fact of life is the game of hockey. This obsession manifests itself in an event called the Saturday Game, where the town's hockey team plays teams from neighboring towns on a frozen over pond in astonishingly cold weather. But the game, and the town that depends on it for its common bond, becomes strangely manipulated by a turn of events that proposes that Mystery's team play the New York Rangers a game of hockey on the small town pond.
You don't have to be a hockey fan, or even a sports fan, to appreciate this movie. The life of this small community is magnificently portrayed, and the story promises something for everyone: drama, comedy, sports, you name it. I heard about this movie from a friend, or I never would have known it existed. After renting it, my wife and I liked it enough to go buy it, and everyone we've shown it to has loved it. I can unconditionally recommend it. Enjoy!
