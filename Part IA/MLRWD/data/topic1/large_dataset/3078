I read with interest the, on the whole, excellent reviews for what is in my mind one of the very best gangster movies ever made. For those who may not have seen this movie, this movie was originally destined for tv in  Britian, but got such good initial reviews before release it was decided to  make the movie into a full theatrical release, and the rest is history or  so it goes. Bob hoskins is simply made for the part of the top london  gangster trying to make a deal with the mafia to revitilize the docklands  in London. In the midst of the mafia representatives visit all hell breaks  loose. before you know it the IRA has blown up a number of his businesses  and he has no idea who or why. The manner in which he picked up and  interrogated other gangland characters was interesting ( see the movie )  and his explosion at his chief lieutenant, and subsequent murder, is  appaling. The storyline is wonderful, the dialog gritty and real, the  acting beyond words. wonderful, wonderful movie. Oh yes, the music is great  too. the ending is also great.
