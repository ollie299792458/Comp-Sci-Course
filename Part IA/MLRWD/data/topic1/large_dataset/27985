I greatly enjoyed Will Smith's acting in this movie.  He is a top-notch actor to begin with, and he turned in a fine performance.

Yet the special effects seem a bit warmed over.  Had I not seen the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, I may have enjoyed them, but it seems Gollum from the movie adaptation of Tolkien's opus has been cloned and rewarmed.  Perhaps they did this to save money, having blown more of the budget on the top-notch title character, Will Smith.

Of course if this is the case, I have to say I generally applaud the choice of a good actor/actress over whizz-bang SFX's.

Mostly, I chafe under the tone of despair that this movie cast.  It is difficult or impossible to adequately discuss my problems with this movie without spoiling it, so in respect for movie viewers, I conclude this point here by merely saying that I flat-out DO NOT RECOMMEND this movie.  (Despite Smith's believability, depth of character, and ability to get us to care about his character.)

Furthermore, don't get me started on the extra features!  If you think the MOVIE was dark, don't even go to the extra features menu!!!
