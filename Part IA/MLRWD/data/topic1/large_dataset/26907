"All Jewish Holidays are about remembering Mama, I'm tired or remembering." "Tired or not, you're going with us, young lady. Grandpa Will and Grandma Belle are expecting the entire family, and that means you too."

Every year Hannah hates going to her family's Passover Seeder. It's always so long and so boring. But this year is different, Hannah doesn't know it yet but she is about to change time periods into a life completely different than the one she is presently living in.

 Jane Yolen has written over 150 books in her long writing career. The Devil's Arithmetic is only one of the few I've written. Mrs. Yolen's writing style is definitely a type of writing I like to read. The types of books she writes really take you into a world beyond our world to discover things most people never get to discover.

 If you are the type of person who likes a book that takes you into your own world, and has probably happeneds  before, then The Devil's Arithmetic is a book you should read. In my opinion, it was one of he best books I have read in a really long time.
