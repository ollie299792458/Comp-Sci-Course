I bought the novel by Henry James who I think is absolutely wonderful but never finished the book. I cheated and rented the movie and I enjoyed it well enough. At times Uma Thurman got on my nerves but it is not her fault as much as the character she portrayed-sneaky, manipulative, deceptive and unfaithful.  I was kept on the edge of my seat throughout though-trying to figure out how this tangled weave would become unspun. Happily, I was quite pleased with the outcome. It appears that morals stood up -or at least to a degree.  It is hard to truly understand what James had its characters really thinking and feeling throughout the movie. What was lie and what was truth, but it gave me more of an incentive to pick up the book and finish it to get better character analysis and insight. I loved the movie "Portrait of a Lady" and enjoyed Kidman more than Thurman. Nonetheless, this is a good movie to rent when snuggling in on a winters eve! Then again, that is just this reviewers opinion!
