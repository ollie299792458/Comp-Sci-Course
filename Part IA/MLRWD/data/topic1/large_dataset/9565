Broadway rats always denigrate Rosalind Russell's performance as Rose in this film version of "Gypsy," preferring instead the Broadway bombast of Ethel Merman's original performance, but pay no mind -- she's terrific.  I guess those same Broadway rats always conveniently forget that Russell originated the lead role in "Wonderful Town" (currently in revival on Broadway) to great acclaim, but no matter.  Merman always defended Rose's excesses and monstrousness and inexplicably thought she was a "warm" character, but Russell's performance demonstrates that she is well aware of the character's voraciousness and selfishness.  Russell's Rose is a monster, but a surprisingly sympathetic one.  And no matter what anyone says, her singing is great and very affecting -- I don't think any subsequent Rose (Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bette Midler, Bernadette Peters) has done a better job with Stephen Sondheim's clever lyrics on "Some People."  And oh yeah -- Karl Malden, Natalie Wood and a very young Ann Jillian are terrific as well (as are the very talented dancer who plays Tulsa and the three hilarious strippers who essay "You Gotta Have A Gimmick" with such aplomb).  In short, "Gypsy" is a fabulous film musical (even though they do leave out the great "Together").
