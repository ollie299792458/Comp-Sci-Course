While this movie differs from the book by Miguel de Cervantes - it's songs, acting, direction, and script are superbly entertaining and inspiring nonetheless. At the height of the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, the Kennedy and King assasanations, and with my embittered parents talking divorce, this movie came out when I needed something to believe and hope in. The point of the movie voiced by Aldonza is that "It doesn't matter whether you win or lose but rather that you are true to the quest;" or as Saint Paul said, "Fight the good fight." One of my sisters still draws inspiration from it. It is understandable then why this musical remains so popular. While the novel - Don Quixote can be reread for both amusement and inspiration, so too should this movie be watched over and over again.

It is tongue in cheek humor at its best, with the lessons of maintaining faith and hope in an oppressive world. O'toole, Loren, and Coco all do great jobs along with Harry Andrews as "the governor"/inn keeper and John Castle as "the duke"/Sansom Carasco. Those who are overly critical and cynical of the movie should try something a little despairing like the existential authors of the mid twentieth century. With the world in the shape that it's in now, we need to be reminded to keep the faith.
