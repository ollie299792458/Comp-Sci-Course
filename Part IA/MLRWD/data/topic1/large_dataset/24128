Carrie is a classic movie, and this movie doesn't quite fit as a sequel.  It's mostly a love story between Rachel, who is suppossed to be Carrie's sister and Jesse, the "nice" football player.  The plot of this movie is pretty good: Rachel's best friend (Mena Suvari, in a small part) kills herself after being dumped by one of the jerk football players, and afterwards Rachel theratens to tell the authorities so he can get arrestted for statatory rape. Jesse and Rachel fall in love, and the stereotypical stuck up cheerleader girl, Tracy gets jealous cause Jesse dumped her for someone unpopular. So naturally, the jocks and Tracy want to get rid of Rachel.
This movie could have stood well on it's own without making it a sequel to Carrie, cause it doesn't go with it at all. Also, the movie says that Rachel's and Carrie's father is the same, but in the novel Carrie's father died. They should researched more before making a movie, and  They should have just remade the original.
