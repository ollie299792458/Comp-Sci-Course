There are several things about this DVD which i found to be very annoying. The biggest problem i had is that the DVD, being Volume one, does not contain the first five episodes of this classic Disney cartoon.  The first five episodes were a five-part miniseries called "the Treasure of the Golden Suns" that introduced many of the characters and lay the groundwork for the all of the followig episodess.  I was really dissapointed they were not included on the DVD.  You can check this out yourself.  Read the episode list on amazon.com, then compared it to how they actually aired (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DuckTales_episodes). So in reality this DVD has episodes 6-32, not 1-27 as advertised.

The other things that i was dissapointed about were the following:

1.  Disney placed trailers to its upcoming movies, like The Chronicles of Narnia

2. The sound quality was poor.  I dont think they even attempted to improve it for this DVD.  When you look on the box it plain says "DOLBY DIGITAL MONO SOUND".  I just expect more out of a DVD, even for cartoons that aired in 1987.

After everything i have said about the DVD release, ff you were a true fan of the show like i was, then this DVD is still probably worth buying just so that you can have your own copy of Ducktales.
