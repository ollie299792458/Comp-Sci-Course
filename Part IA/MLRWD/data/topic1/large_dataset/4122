I liked this movie.  The most amazing thing about it is that it was made without any "added in", typical, one might even say, mandatory, Hollywood nonsense, such as "love interests" and rah-rah racial war propaganda.  I read a lot about WW2, especially the Pacific naval campaign and I found this to be accurate in all major areas.  Sure, one could pick it to pieces about minor facts, many of which may not have actually been clarified until after 1960 when this film was made, but none of these are critical to the central point of the story.  Halsey has come down through history as a rather "salty" character in speech and actions.  This does not come out in the movie, perhaps, in part, due to Hollywood codes of the time.  Perhaps because that, in itself, may to some extent, have been a media exaggeration. I found the choral, musical score to be very interesting and also very atypical for Hollywood.  But, the MOST atypical facet about the movie is that it leaves you thinking and you can count on one hand how many Hollywood films DO NOT draw all the conclusions for you.  Well worth viewing.  My appreciation for the Director, Robert Montgomry and actor, James Cagney has just shot way up for having the courage to make this film, this way "just stick to the facts, Jack", and the emotional sensitivity to portray these historic figures like this.  Certainly this film is unique and it must have brought them a lot of pride to make it.  As I watched it I kept saying to myself "I can't believe they made this in Hollywood".  Even our "news" isn't this straightforward and unbiased today.
