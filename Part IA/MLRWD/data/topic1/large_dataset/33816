The fact that we had to wait from 1997 ti'll now to see a good sequel of the great movie Starship Troopers is just ridicules.
The first movie was awesome and left a lot of potential for a sequel but both the second and the third movie destroyed all hope and were just two big middle fingers to all the fans.

After watching this one I feel that the Starship Troopers franchise have potential for a great comeback with some more sequels from the team that did this one. Even though its good and WAY better than the previous two, it has some flaws.

The storyline is good but the movie is too short. To get all out of that story it would really worked better with maybe a two hour + or so so, this one feels like they rushed it.
The bugs looks really good except when they run, then they look stupid as Sh*t. All the characters and animation looks very good but the voice actors arent that good..

One thing that this movie had that the previous two didnt have was some great characters. while the others had some really boring characters that didnt do anything to the storyline or so, Starship Troopers Invasion have som great characters that you can feel for while watching it, and they all do their parts! ;)

To sum up: its a REALLY big step forward from the second and third movie, this I would really call a movie worth watching :)
Its entertaining with lots of action scenes, but too short. I hope only for the next movie (if there is one coming) that it will have bigger action scenes in open fields or valleys like the first one, instead of getting stuck on a starship or a spacestation like all the other ones.
But it feels so great to have a new great Starship Troopers movie, and I will support it and buy it.
