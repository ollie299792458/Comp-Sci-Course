I got introduced to Jared Leto through his band 30 Seconds to Mars and ever since I've wanted to see this movie. Sure enough, I saw it for the first (and only) time several months ago. You can tell it's a completely different movie the second the DVD screen comes up. As for the movie itself...holy, holy cow. I think most of us would not want to see it again. Is it good? Yes, it is. Is it too good? Yes. And that's exactly why most of us would say no to a second viewing...

It's brutal, nightmarish and very, very real. Darren Aronofsky has pushed us to the limits of what is acceptable in movies and what crosses the line. Because it's unrated, it serves as a well-deserved warning to the general public. Some people probably won't be able to see it through to the end because it's so extreme. My mother couldn't. But even though it's extreme, it still remains a very realistic demonstration of the mechanics of addiction, volatile hope and complete destruction. I have to agree with Jeff Shannon on this movie when he says here on the product page, "Requiem for a Dream is a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior."
