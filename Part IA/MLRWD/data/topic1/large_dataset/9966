I loved this movie!  True, it's not great art and the aliens looked like a cross between Predators and the monster from BUGS BUNNY (except for the white Converse high tops... "Monsters are such IN-teresting people!") BUT I enjoyed it from start to finish. This was my first view of Daniel Craig (I'm not a James Bond kind of person) and the character was VERY good.  It was all such tongue-in-cheek and had so many really amusing quirks and twists!  My personal favorite was Paul Dano as Percy -- his characters are usually so moody/emo/dark-and-twisted that it was a pleasure to see his face light up in a smile AND his reaction to Jake Lonergan was hilarious.  Going from spoiled rotten kid to mewling, terrified kid in the jail allowed him to really show his stuff!  True, Harrison Ford's character was predictable but the characters were allowed to grow.  Don't take it too seriously -- it doesn't take itself at ALL seriously -- and I think you'll like it.  BTW, is there anyone else who wondered how that HUGE alien got into that teeny-tiny X-wing ripoff fighter?
