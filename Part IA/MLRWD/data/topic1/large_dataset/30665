After waiting over 20 years for a werewolf movie on par with "The Howling" and "An American Werewolf in London", I finally found one, even if it is British and I've never heard of any of the actors. Who cares?!! It rocks! While the plot is nothing spectacular--British soldiers fight off 8 foot tall werewolves in the Scottish highlands--the acting, the action, and the pretty good FX make up for it. We get some likable heroes (Cooper and Spoon!), a wonderfully vile Special Ops guy who has a secret or two, and a character named "Bruce Campbell". Ha Ha.

 The werewolves were thanksfully not CGI generated. While they look fake in a few shots, the filmmakers were smart enough not linger on them for long periods of time, instead showing them in quick cuts or in shadows. Bravo!

 I do have a few minor complaints. Sometimes the actors thick accents and British slang were hard to understand. And the DVD (or at least my copy) doesn't have English subtitles! Gggrrrrr! Oh well, a small price to pay for the first good werewolf movie in a loooonnnggg time. Enjoy!
