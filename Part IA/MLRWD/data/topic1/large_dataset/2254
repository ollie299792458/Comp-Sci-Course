I would rank this movie as one of my favorite. It's a shame it has not been given the credit it deserves.  The story itself is a breath of fresh air from all the other Sci-Fi movies that assumes that people do not have a spiritual belief in everyday life.  This movie dares to explore that part of us that most people in this world believe. The fact that so many movies in the US avoid this topic is more of a matter of political eliteness than what people really do and enjoy. I noticed that one comment even dared to say that the movie did not do too well was because it contained spiritual aspects.  That analogy couldn't be furtherest from the truth.

I remember when the movie was advertised.  It was one of the worst advertising I have ever seen for a great movie. Sony may have spent a lot of money but they wasted it.  Whenever I show this movie to people (and I have shown it to quite a few), they all really enjoyed it and were impressed by it. Many of them had not even heard of it (due to bad advertising).

This movie is a great classic. It was unfortunate that it was not presented or advertised correctly. Someone should definetly create a sequel to it.

By the way, a great movie does not need to be made from a video game.

On the contrary, a video game based on this movie would be excellent.

Rent the movie and watch it with friends and you'll see that it is better than most of the movies you have probably watched and you will most certainly will want to buy it. I won't say it will be the best but it does rank up there in the top which is why I give it five Stars - *****
