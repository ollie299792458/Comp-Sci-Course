Most horror films end in a predictable fashion that you can see coming a mile away.  The best, Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, the Exorcist, Suspira, Re-Animator, American Werewolf in London, Texas Chainsaw, The Thing (Carpenter's), Candyman, keep you guessing, where is this one going...  Add Ginger Snaps to the list of the greats.  Interesting and original (not the psuedo horror of Scream...enough already...and PLEASE no Urban Legend 3, mr. studio guy...we did NOTHING to you).
I picked this one off of the home video shelf, and on the quest to find good horror, this was a relief from much of the other crap out there.  
A synopsis might ruin the story, so do yourself a favor and check this one out.  And maybe one day, studios may STOP spending money on Friday the 13th X, and Halloween 8, 9, or whatever the hell number they are releasing soon and put the dollars toward original ideas.  Till then, minus the big screen horror mircles a la Blair Witch (ruined by morons again with an unecessary second part), we'll keep looking hoping for more Ginger Snaps like magic at the video store.
