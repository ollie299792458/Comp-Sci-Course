If you have even a passing interest in Native-American culture and affairs, you must see this movie.  It brings to light the ( ongoing ) friction between the F.B.I. and the other F.B.I. ( full-blooded Indians ).  You'll see nothing overly romantic here, only the appalling poverty and violence on modern-day reservations.  As mentioned in other reviews, the performances are outstanding, especially Val Kilmer as the initially uptight and all-business G-man and Graham Greene as the ball-busting good guy and honest cop.  There is a great sense of humor that develops between the two ( and the old wise man ) as Kilmer's agent lightens up and shares a camaraderie with his fellow Sioux.  In addition, the panoramic shots of the reservation's natural beauty ( What must it have looked like teeming with elk, buffalo, and the free Indians of many Nations? ) serve to underscore the heartbreak and further the emotional pull of the story.  A definite recommend, and a reminder that despite many hardships, including the murderous corruption of the all-Native reservation police force, Indian culture still survives and it needs to be protected from the never-ending greed of outside interests.
