Come on people. 5 Stars? I only gave it 1 cause I had to put something in to rate this.

I know there are some of "YOU" viewers out there that compare this to JAWS or BLAIR WITCH - but please, tell me how? At least those movies (Jaws being a classic) were interesting.

This is "truly" a low budget movie, with no name actors and with the plot consisting of them being lost at sea. A couple wondering if they would be rescued or eaten alive at any moment. But, I assure you that if you watch this movie that you'll long for them to be EATEN just to end the movie and your own misery!

If you don't fall asleep through it you might be tempted to skip through it (like I did myself) to find any part that looked interesting. (A bit of advice, keeping forwarding til it's over)

The hotel scene was boring, nevermind the bug in the room that was almost impossible to find and kill (totally ridiculous). And, come on... 20 people on a boat. Now do they actually have to show 19 of those people diving in one by one? I mean, really, I got the point after the 4th and 5th person jumped.

And, though they do say this is a true story, how do they know that this is what really happened? Maybe since the husband had commented on a homicide/suicide, that he paid the tour guide to leave his wife behind? Maybe the couple fought so much that they both swam off their separate ways - One having a cramp drowning and the other being ran over by a boat. Now that would have been interesting.

"Castaway" w/ Tom Hanks was a great movie and far more interesting and entertaining than this one. And hey, that was 1 ACTOR, ALONE, on a deserted ISLAND. I'd take him and Wilson anyday over these two floating around.

My advice to others considering buying or better yet, Watching this movie is...  Sit in your bathroom and stare at your toilet for 79 min. If you find that interesting than hey, Best of LUCK!!!  :)
