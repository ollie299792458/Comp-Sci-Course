This DVD ought to be taught in film school as a lesson in making bad movies. The list of extras alone is instructive: the DVD includes not one, not two, but FOUR alternate endings. The disk also features a ridiculous number of commentaries for a film of this kind, and they're alternately telling and absurd. (Example: Leelee Sobieski talking about how particular Stanley Kubrick was about his orange juice. The poor guy must be spinning in his grave.)
Storywise, the film depends on a series on contrivances starting with a refundable airline ticket and the nonsensical purchase of a CB radio. It's conventional thrills are seldom particularly thrilling, and a villain who might have been scary instead seems to have super powers of the Michael Myers/Jason/Freddy Krueger variety.
There's one effective scene early on as the brothers played by Weller and Zahn put their ears to a motel room wall and hear the first consequences of their practical joking, but the rest of the movie is utterly predictable and, again, contrived. When the principles end up in a Nebraska cornfield, you can practically hear the writer(s) saying "Wouldn't it be cool if they ended up in a cornfield?" (Getting them there turns out to be more difficult than perhaps anticipated.) Then there's the climactic motel room trap: "Don't open the door! No, don't open the door! No, you don't open the door either!"
Inept and unscary, "Joy Ride" is ripe for mockery and thus merits a couple of stars.
