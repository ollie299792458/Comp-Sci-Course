Army of Darkness is pretty much just what the title suggests, an over the top send up of those zombie pictures. Significantly different from its predecessors Evil Dead 1 and 2, Army of Darkness lacks the comic gore and genuinely frightening moments of the first two, but makes up for it in the sheer hilarity of Ash's classic one liners and the skeleton animation. the story picks up exactly where Evild Dead II ended, with our hero Ash stranded in medieval England. Once again, he must battle the forces of the dead and recover the necronomicon (the book of the dead), with the help of his chainsaw hand and 'boomstick'.
The transformation of the character Ash from the timid teen in Evil Dead I to the chainsaw wielding badass in Army of Darkness is great to see. Bruce Campbell is probably the only actor who could have pulled off the role of Ash with aplomb and style. His macho grace and rugged "good looks" truly carry the film. Watch for Embeth Davidtz (she of "Mansfield Park" and "Bridget jones' Diary") as Ash's medieval amour who doesn't quite grasp the concept of pillow talk.  You need to see Evil Dead II to fully appreciate Army of Darkness, but can skip Evil Dead I. Rent this film, watch it with friends, and you'll be quoting the one liners forever.
