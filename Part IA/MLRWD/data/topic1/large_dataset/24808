I don't usually watch miniseries, but fairytales are always fun, and this, I loved!  The locations were beautiful, the premise entertaining.  The cast was great! Diane Weist made evil somehow dignified, Kimberly Williams did a  great job of playing the modern twentysomething (whining and all) even  while surrounded by talking dogs, singing rings and the occasional troll or  dwarf.  It was great to see John Laroquette again, and Scott Cohen (why had  I never heard of him before?) took a great character and made him  unforgettable!  The one flaw I've always seen in fairytales is that the  love interest is a bore - he either doesn't have much of a personality, or  only shows up at the end to save the day with a kiss.  Replacing Prince  Charming as the love interest with this wolf was a stroke of genius, and  Cohen gave us his all, making Wolf walk the line between criminally insane  and flat-out charming - sweet, edgy, naive, earnest and frightening all in  turn.  To those who are concerned about the length: It flew by and I was  sad to see it end at all.  This is not to say there weren't flaws.  The  trolls were way overdone, there could have been tighter editing, and I was  a little dissapointed in the resolution, but any production that could hold  my attention for ten hours over a two-week period and leave me wanting more  had to be doing something right.
