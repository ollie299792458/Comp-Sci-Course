I agree with comments of other 5* and 4* reviewers, but I must give this DVD 3.5 stars. Why the 1-1/2 stars lesser? Because Megadeth do NOT kick ass hard enough. Nope, they don't.

Though songs are played to perfection, it lacks the bite of Megadeth's Megadeth - Rude Awakening [DVD], which, according to me, is a far superior concert. Just hear Mustaine and Pitrelli shredding on all songs ("Dread and the Fugitive Mind," "Hangar 18," "Holy Wars," come to mind), then DeGrasso annihilating the drum kit during "In my Darkest Hour," and see the crowd frenzy during "Hangar 18" and other songs... the whole DVD gives you an uncontrollable adrenaline rush. Astounding.

Some of my favourite songs lack the brooding and melancholy feel - for instance, "A Tout le Monde" has got a peppy feel, as opposed to the gritty gloomy mood in Rude Awakening.. the drums towards the finale in "In my Darkest Hour" are not a patch on DeGrasso's frenetic pounding in Rude Awakening..

(Gripe, gripe) I also think that the best way to start a Megadeth concert is Mustaine snarling "Let me introduce myself." Except perhaps, "Hangar 18" or even better, "Five Magics" (which sadly, has never been played live till recently).

4 stars because Amazon does not allow 3.5 rating, and I anyway dont think 3 stars does justice to this great concert.
