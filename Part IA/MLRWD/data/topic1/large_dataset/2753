This is a searching film, a film that searches for the answers as to what happens in the metaphysical realm at the threshold of death. As the story begins, Charlie and his brother, Sam are in the winners' circle. They are great both at sailing and at their academics. However, a fatal car crash soon changes all that.

Both the brothers die in the crash, however, only Charlie is eventually brought back to life. However, it would appear that his crossing over into the realm of death, even though it may have only have been for a few minutes, has changed him. He is now able to communicate with the dead, maybe his 'sixth sense' has been awakened by this experience.

Over the next few years, Charlie has abandoned going to university, and has taken up a lowly job maintaining a graveyard, where every early evening he meets with Sam. He also has an encounter with a former classmate, who had joined the U.S. Marines and was killed in action.

**** Potential Spoiler Ahead ****
---------------------------------

The film is just about to stall and go into a nose dive when enter Tess, a young pretty independent sailor of some renown. A romantic relationship starts to develop between Charlie and her. It is at this point the story blurs and a romantic game of "find me" in the dark turns into a life and death search and rescue event.

Charlie is able to discern a message from Tess, indicating that he needs to find her, in order to save her life, this is apparently the reason why he was given a second chance at life. The movie has its sad moments, but overall, it is quite uplifting. Never say die.
