In the 1975 underwater classic "Jaws" Roy Scheider shouted "you're going to need a bigger boat" and in 1978's "Piranha" we heard the classic line "Sir, the piranha are eating the guests". Trying to capitalize on the success of Jaws from three years earlier, Roger Corman produced a little B-movie gem called "Piranha" in 1978; it was scripted by John Sayles and directed by Joe Dante. While "Piranha" never reached the status of "Jaws" it did provide B-movie fans with enough blood and gore to satisfy them and it quickly became a classic in its own right.

Far up into the hillside in an abandoned Army testing facility long after the Vietnam War, a lone scientist named Dr. Hoak (Kevin McCarthy) continues his genetic research on a school of mutant killer piranha. Nobody knows of the scientist's existence or the mutant piranha until some hikers go missing and a rookie detective named Maggie (Heather Menzies) stumbles across their gear at the abandoned facility. Maggie believes that the hikers stopped there so she enlists the help of an unlikely hero in the form of town drunk Paul Grogan, played by veteran character actor Bradford Dillman to help her search for them.

After Maggie foolishly drains the military containment pool in an effort to find the missing hikers, the two of them quickly discover the facilities deadly secret and it becomes a race against time to save the unsuspecting residents down river, including a kid's summer camp and the waterfront amusement park of Lost River Lake. Can Maggie and Grogan reach the summer camp and amusement park in time to save everyone? Can they stop the Piranha from reaching the ocean? Is there anything that can kill the Piranha? You'll have to buy your own copy to find out.

Fans will be very pleased with the new 2010 DVD release of "Piranha" from Shout Factory. The new video transfer used by Shout factory is the best I've ever seen. Not only does this movie look great, it sounds great. This new DVD version from Shout contains numerous special features and I enjoyed all of them. The disc packaging and disc artwork is well done; even the slip cover is reversible. This is another great addition under the "Roger Corman's Cult Classics Collection" from Shout Factory.
