Most movies may leave you wondering if it was worth the money to upgrade your setup to Bluray, but Pixar movies will prove just how much of a difference there is.  This movie is beautifully rendered with crisp details (so many features of the monsters' skins and furs that I had never noticed before), and the sound may not be mixed 7-channel but it is encoded in DTS Master which provides phenomenal clarity and fidelity (fitting for a movie that won several awards for sound and music).  In my wife's words, "It's better than when we saw it at the movies."  Similar to "Up," this title comes in Disney's new Blu++ format where you get the Blu-ray movie and special features, a DVD copy of the movie and a digital file copy for use with your PC/Mac or favorite portable media player.  It's my opinion that this is the smartest thing Disney has ever done.  Having the DVD copy gives parents and children an option when traveling (plenty of vehicles with DVD players in them) or spending time at a different location where a Blu-ray player is not available (we have grandparents living on a farm in the middle of nowhere and friends who haven't upgraded yet).  The digital file is great as well.  Right now I use this to turn my iPhone into my own personal in flight entertainment system, but in the not too distant future I can see providing my daughter with an iPod of her very own.  Disney says all their movies will be like this going forward, and I wish they would go ahead and re-release all the existing Pixar Blu-ray catalog in the new format.  Would love to be sporting a legal copy of "Cars" and "Bug's Life" on the iPhone.
