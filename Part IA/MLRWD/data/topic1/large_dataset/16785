I'm a reasonably seasoned horror-phile, and yet this movie made my skin crawl - atleast for the first half where the main character discovers that she is endowed with 'extra-ordinary' insights subsequent to her corneal transplant. Overall, the theme hems to the expected formula and the eventual resolution is more-or-less predictable. However, the ambience for the first half of the movie is extremely successful at being *creepy*.

Stay away if you are looking for mindless gore. Think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CYLJ">The Others</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FI59">The Sixth Sense</a> instead. 'The Eye' employs atmosphere & tight framing to create nauseating claustrophobic chills. It manipulates your imagination more than the visual senses.

The only reason I give it a 4 stars is because I felt that the latter half of the movie wasn't quite upto the standards set by the former.  Most of the strong points of the presentation are exhausted by the first half. But then again, it is my subjective opinion only. And oh, the movie is definitely worth a watch.
