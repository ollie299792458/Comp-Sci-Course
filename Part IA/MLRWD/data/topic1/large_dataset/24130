This movie is just fantastic, from it's wonderfully unique look, it's GREAT soundtrack (Disney's best!Elvis is still the King!), and it's uplifting message of "ohana", a Hawaiian word meaning "family, or,no one is left behind or forgotten"!! I suggest parents pay close attention to the rating(PG) because little ones below the age of 6 may think acting like Stitch before he finds a family and happiness would be a good idea (it wouldn't be, though he is darned FUNNY when he's bad, as well as when he's good). Lilo is a very sweet but lonely little girl and acts out occasionally. which is understandable, because she misses her parents ( they passed away in a car accident which is referred to, not shown, in a very tender and sweet scene).She is being raised by her older sister, and is incredibly endearing and lovable!!!She and Stitch find their way to better behavior through love of each other and their "broken but still good" family. The end is very uplifting and leaves the wonderful message of "ohana" for familes of all kinds and sizes. A must see!!!
