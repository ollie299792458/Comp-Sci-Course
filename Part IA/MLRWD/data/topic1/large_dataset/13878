Nigel Tufnel, (clearly the brains behind Tap, since without him the band can only muster a "cozy" 10 minutes of material,) serves as idiot savant in this free form jazz exploration.  When deconstructing the sublime ennui of the band as they amble through North America's more selective auditoriums, one notes an existential transition in their perspective (often too much perspective.)  From their other-worldy travels during the Flower People period to their joint festival appearance with a puppet show, Spinal Tap demonstrates the resiliance that defines the human spirit.  Tufnel, in particular, is driven with a desire to always go one louder, with his amplifyer, his solos, and his backstage culinary demands.  I for one was particularly moved when Nige tells David, "do a good show,a'right?" after informing the band that Sex Farm was climbing the charts in Japan.  In that moment we see the transformation of the Id to the Superego, the lifting of priorites from just performing Tonight I'm Gonna Rock Ya (Tonight) to preserving their enduring friendship.  I found Tap to be a moving tribute to near-competance amidst a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry.
