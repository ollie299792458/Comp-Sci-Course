After many years of waiting we finally have something to show for it, Charmed on DVD!!  The first season of this show was enough to make you either love it or hate it. Now the power of three can set us free.  I have compiled an episode run down with plot lines so for those who have never seen this great show you can decide if you want to invest in it.  If you are a Buffy and/or Angel fan and still have not really watched Charmed might I suggest you make the purchase.  You won't be sorry!
