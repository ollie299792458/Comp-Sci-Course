At this point, I'm sure pretty much everyone has seen the movie so I won't go into the details about why this movie is so fun and rewatchable.  Overall, this is a good blu-ray release as far as content.  The blu-ray is bare bones, however this release includes the DVD that has all of the extras from the last DVD release(yes, it has Kevin Smith's and Scott Mosier's commentary track).

Now for the bad.  The packaging is awful.  The case looks like a normal blu-ray blue plastic case until you remove one of the discs and reveal the spaces or holes in the plastic.  And the best part?  The holes are right where the disc is resting in the case, which means if any blunt or sharp object hits the case, it will go through the thin plasic sleeve cover and the paper cover and damage the disc.  I imagine amazon will have a lot of damage returns with this one since they are sending it in a bubble lined envelope (it really needs to be shipped in a box).  My blu-ray cover was punctured in the front and the DVD was slightly damaged by a very visible scratch.  Fortunately the disc still played just fine, but now the Road House front cover has a small hole right on Patrick Swayze's neck line.  Lovely.  I won't be returning it since the same thing will probably happen again (possibly worse) and both of the discs play anyway.

The eco-friendly packaging was a HORRIBLE idea.  Since I like my discs to have some kind of protection, I'll be putting the discs in a different case and tossing this eco-friendly junk.  They might as well send these in a thin paper sleeve.  It's ridiculous.
