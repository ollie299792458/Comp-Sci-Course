This is just a quick review but I had to say that although the image quality of the movies is great (Toy Story 3 looks fantastic) the packaging, frankly, left a lot to be desired. It's a good idea - to have it literally as a toy box - however it was badly designed for the following reasons:

1) The lid of the "box" is kinda flimsy. My 4 year old loves the Toy Story movies and he wants to pick up the box and look at it, but I feel like a bad daddy because I'm afraid he'll break that lid. It's just card and the whole thing hangs together like a cheaply produced paperback.

2) There's no insert to describe what's on each disc. Big omission, imho

3) All the discs stand vertically in foam padding that has been specifically designed to allow the discs to slot in and out. Major problem here - you can't get the discs out easily and it's impossible without putting your fingers on the non-printed side of the disc (ie, the side that actually gets read by the player). I can see some playback issues here... some slim cases, slotted into the toy box, would have worked much better... but I guess it's cheaper this way.

4) The codes for the digital copies are in an envelope... stuck to the inside of the box. I can't type what I thought when I saw this because then my review would be rejected. What idiot thought that would be a good idea? You either have to rip the envelope out or very very carefully try to gingerly remove the inserts from the envelope if you don't want to rip anything.

So... five stars for the movies, three stars for the packaging, averaging out at four stars in all. Pixar is amazing - it's a pity the marketing idiots at Disney are not.
