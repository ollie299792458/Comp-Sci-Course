Once in a great while, perhaps a generation or so, a film/focumentary comes out that truly transcends "sports entertainment" and crosses the line into what can be best described as life-changing. This is the best way to start to explain CM Punk's Blu-Ray "Best in the World."

This tale is truly one of an underdog who rose up, did things on his terms, didn't sell out, stayed true to himself, and achieved success in the way only he could. Punk had everything going against him: poor family life, socially awkward and didn't fit in, physically small for a pro wrestler. He did not let anything stop him in his laser-focused quest to be the Best in the World. The viewer is given behind-the-scenes access to Punk's early wrestling life, his family and friends' first-hand accounts of how he is as a person, and his attitude. His attitude is how he would eventually be dubbed the well-deserbed title of Best in the World. No one would stand in CM's path of stardom because in his mind, he was destined for success and failure was the proverbial non-option.

The interviews with Colt Cabana, Chris Hero, Natalie Slater (@bakeanddestroy) are telling and heartfelt.

As a guy who is the same age as Punk and have gone through simiar struggles, his story and rise to fame is an inspiration and I was completely moved by watching the 3-Disc set. This transcends wrestling and is about life. What will you do with your life? How will you leave your legacy? What will you do to become your own personal Best in the World? Have you lived your dash? I've owned the DVD for nearly 24 hours and have watched it twice (I do have a full-time job as well).

If you get nothing else out of my review, please just go out and spend the $25 or less and get this. Wrestling fan or not, you will become a more inspired person by watching CM Punk's Best in the World.
