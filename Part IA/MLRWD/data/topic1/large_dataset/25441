Warning : this review will have spoilers.

I saw this for the first time (and last - I can't watch the ice cream sceen again) last night. Ok movie, but I felt like I was watching a remake of "Night of the Living Dead" more than a gang movie. The way the gang members silently walked about outside and just mindlessly rushed the building later despite getting shot so easily, they seemed more like zombies. Granted, zombies with silencer equipted weaponry, but members of the mindless undead just the same.

As for the confrontation between the father and the gang members who killed his daughter, I found that very unconvincing. I think it would have been much more believable had he not found the gun in the ice cream truck but instead just rammed the gang members' car off the road with his own and than beat them to death with a tire iron (would have been more emotionally satisfying as well). It would also explain why he did not get into his car and drive away (which is something I did not understand).
