Torch Song trilogy was a life defining moment for me. It showed me that the world was open to homosexuals and that we could lead productive lives. You have so many different types of people in this movie that it breaks the ground of stereotypes by showing that one class of people is not definable by one single act. It teaches a lesson that I still hold true to my heart, and that is that you treat everyone with the simple respect that you know that they are a human being, and that the people that don't show you that simple respect don't have a place in your life. It makes you happy, and it breaks your heart when you see families that define love as not something between two people but something between two people of the opposite sex. Love knows no boundaries and to limit Love is to limit yourself. The movie does goes through a myriad of situations but it never lies to the heart and always stays true to life. Anne Bancroft is amazing in her portayal of a mother who doesn't understand but still loves here family. Harvey Fierstein is an icon with all his nuances and quircks but is always throwing out one liners that I still quote to this day in everyday conversation. Matthew Broderick is adorable and what else can you say. The music was my first exposure to Ella Fitzgerald which I will forever be thankful for because it makes my heart soar and the musical numbers in the movie make me laugh. This movie is one of my favorites, maybe because it meant so much, allowed me to come out to my family, but I think that it can touch everyone's heart and help anyone through any situation because you learn to focus on yourself. Sorry for the sap...You changed my life with this production and I can't thank you enough.
