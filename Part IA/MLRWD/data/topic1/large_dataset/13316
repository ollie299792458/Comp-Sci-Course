Guy Ritchie had a hit with "Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels" (which didn't agree with me). "Snatch," however, is one of my favorite movies and is one of the DVDs that I watch on high rotation. There are a lot of actors you'll recognize including Jason Statham, Alan Ford, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones, Benicio Del Toro, and Brad Pitt. 
The movie takes place in London and involves a huge diamond, a jewel thief with 4 fingers, boxing promoters who are being pressured by an underworld kingpin (who feeds people to pigs), an Irish gypsy who loves his mother, a band of amateur thugs who can't do anything right, and a couple of hired hit men. You'll love the opening sequence of rabbis discussing theology, a Russian assassin that won't die,  the run-away dog that squeaks, and Brad Pitt's gypsy-talk. The dialogue is witty, the bare-knuckle fight scenes are well choreographed, and the gunslinging is exciting. If you enjoyed movies like "Ocean's 11," "The Big Hit," and "The Big Lebowsky," you'll love "Snatch."
