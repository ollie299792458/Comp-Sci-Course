What makes The Manchurian Candidate so appealing?
Made with the feel of a Twilight Zone episode, the psychological concerns of the Cold War are totally unearthed in this movie.  From patriotic symbology to transitional trickery, the film includes almost everything a film critic desires: realistic drama, non-ending suspense, fight scene, love sequence, stimulating props and locations, and more.  I would even go as far as compare it to Nolan's Memento for a 1960's movie audience.
Like many have probably said before me, you would be wise to watch this film a few times over; It's packed with hidden messages 'left and right.'  Even if you follow a political viewpoint different from those praised, the concept of political extremism is so fasinating it scares me.  The garden scenes are impressive.  Sintra, Harvey, and Lansbury's roles are convincing and powerful.  These reasons alone place Manchurian Candidate along with my top favorites.
Even though I understand why it was done, I would have to say the only real let down for me is the negative portrayal of women in this film.  Janet Liegh serves as every guy's fantasy (who would go dump their fiancee for a sweaty guy who can't even look into her face?) while Angela Lansbury is never given a chance for redemption.  Harvey's "Make like a good housewife" quote also is upsetting as well.  Although a concern in this film is the role of women after World War II, I would have to say Frankenhimer could have done a better job by not plastering such negative connotations.  It would make the movie more believable and user friendly. 
Never the less, the Manchurian Candidate has my vote.  Sure, the ACLU probably likes it too, yet I can't help it.  It's only a movie, right?  Left?  Hm.  Well anyways, this definitely should be the candidate of any DVD collection.  Enjoy.
