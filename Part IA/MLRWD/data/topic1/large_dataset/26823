I picked up this film primarily because of the fact that one of my favorite actors (Jack Nicholson - Frank Costello) has a starring role in it. For his acting the the movie, I surely was not disappointed. The Departed is a film with Mind-blowing plot variations and shocking revelations which culminates in a violent and stunning end.

Leonardo DiCaprio (Billy Costigan) and Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan) are both in very interesting roles, seemingly polar opposites, who actually have more in common than they would ever realize. Placed as a mole in Frank Costello's criminal enterprise, Billy Costigan was a young recruit, chosen by his superiors to infiltrate and ultimately take down the organization from the top. Colin Sullivan, on the other hand, groomed from a young age by Frank, becomes a sucessful trooper, right out of the academy. He becomes a mole for Frank, feeding him information on department activity in an attempt to prolong and save his enterprise. Colin looks to Frank as the father figure, and Frank seems to take Billy under his wing as well.

What follows is a stellar performance by the entire cast, with a story that is as intense, as it is violent, profane and shocking.

One warning, the film clocks in over 2 hours, and you cannot miss a minute of it without being lost... However, even with the length of the movie, it doesn't ever seem to lag, I couldn't imagine that any of this movie should be cut. A very compelling, imaginative and true to life plot with an ending that will leave you in a stunned silence of contemplation.
