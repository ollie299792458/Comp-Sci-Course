Carole Lombard came from my hometown (Ft. Wayne IN) and I have always been a big fan of William Powell.  So it was a welcome treat to experience The Criterion Collection of My Man Godfrey with both of them in it.  Gregory La Cava directed a wonderful movie that is as relevant today (with the Forgotten Man concept) as it was in 1936.

A family is involved in a scavenger hunt and they have to find a Forgotten Man (a person who is wanted by no one and undesirable by society's standards).  After William Powell tells off one sister (who wants him for her Forgotten Man, he goes with another to help her win the scavenger hunt.  The plot evolves from there.  I will give nothing away because the joy of experiencing this without any foreknowledge is like experiencing your first kiss.

The Criterion Collectio of this wonderful movie has a beautiful commentary which explains some of the parts of the movie that you might miss, either because of the era it comes from or or the breakneck speed of the comedy.  As usual, Criterion has outdone themselves in restoring another part of our American heritage.

If you get the chance, see this movie.  It has the capability of becoming a favorite movie (even if you are one of these narrow minded people who won't watch B&W movies).
