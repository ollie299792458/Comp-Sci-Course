I saw this movie in the theatre when it came out in 1982 and have been a big admirer or it ever since.  Norman Bates is released from incarceration in a mental facility, and seems to have all his faculties about him if not a bit stiff and nervous.  But lo and behold, the sister of the woman he brutally murdered in the original Psycho is out for revenge.  Norman returns to his duties at his hotel to find it's being used as a haven for drugs and prostitution, and on those grounds he fires the manager (Dennis Franz).  He takes a job at a local diner where he befriends the despondent Mary.  Mary reluctantly agrees to stay with Norman while she works out problems she's having with her boyfriend.  As it turns out, Lila Loomis, the sister of Marian Crane, is hellbent on driving Norman Bates crazy again by leaving notes as his dead mother, calling him as his dead mother, and sneaking around the house.  Slowly, Norman begins to question his own sanity when people are being reported killed that he has no recollection of.  Maybe he did do it after all, he wonders.  The beauty of this film is the mystery, that you never truly know what plot twist the film is going to take, in the spirit of Hitchcock.  Exhuming graves, dredging the swamp, deception, and murder are some thrilling elements of this film.  The atmosphere is wonderful, with some incredible cinematography and a soundtrack that compliments it's dark beauty perfectly.  Will Norman Bates be driven back into the insane asylum?  Buy this movie and find out if he deserves another chance.
