If you enjoy "coming-of-age" and childhood reminiscence tales in
the HOPE AND GLORY and MY LIFE AS A DOG vein, this is a film that
you should add to your "must-see" list. This is a sweet, endearing
comedy about boyhood, friendship, and the joys of filmmaking. Will
(Bill Milner), a lonely boy who spends most of his free time drawing elaborate adventure stories, meets up with school bully
Lee Carter (Will Poulter), a felonious little thug whose only
non-criminal activity is his amateur film project. Discovering Will's vivid illustrations, he strongs-arms Will into collaborating
with him on his movie, an ambitious sequel to the "Rambo" series.
Their efforts to complete this epic make for some genuinely hilarious episodes, while at the same time their growing friendship
gives this film some truly touching moments.
  Not only is this film funny and moving, it's also intelligently
done and doesn't resort to the kind of crude would-be humor typical
of most recent comedies; despite centering on the world of pre-adolescent boys, there's not a hint of the kind of vulgarity that's
assumed to be popular with that age group--no cheap jokes about
flatulence or other bodily functions, puerile sexual humor, etc.
The friendship of the boys is handled well, too, without any forced
sentiment or insincere emotions. This movie would be ideal for nearly any age group.
  The DVD includes some wonderfully funny commentary featuring director Garth Jennings and the two young stars. Another bonus
feature is an actual short film that Jennings wrote, directed and
starred in as a child! Don't miss this fun, inventive film!
