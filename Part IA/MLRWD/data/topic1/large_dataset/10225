Comedies rarely age well because few things are worse than having to listen to stale jokes but thankfully this film is more than just about the jokes.  Don't expect to laugh a lot but do be prepared for a heartwarming film about not settling in life and about being prepared to take chances.  The cast put up very good performances; although I liked Cage better in "Raising Arizona" Cher however did deserve her Oscar for her work.

This dvd version however is a disappointment although I have to say the sound quality is very, very good having been given the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround treatment so that it does justice to your home theatre system.  I especially enjoyed the restaurant scenes where you get to hear even the plates and utensils as if the customers were eating just next to you!

The picture quality though is a massive disappointment with white spots and other imperfections in many of the frames although I guess I lucked out in that I have the Standard Version and not the cropped "widescreen" version that other reviewers have moaned about.  There are no special features worth talking about on this version although I've heard the Deluxe Version does and so if you want more than just the film itself on your dvd then perhaps you should go for that version.

With the advent of Blu-ray, the powers that be should take the opportunity to do a Director's Cut version in anamorphic widescreen and with a much better restored picture quality to go with the already very good Dolby 5.1 sound that this dvd version has.

In the meantime, because of the poor picture quality I'd recommend you give this particular dvd version a miss.
