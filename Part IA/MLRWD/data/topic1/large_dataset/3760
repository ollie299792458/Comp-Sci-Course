I consider myself a theater afficianado...OK, a theater snob even. That said, I don't expect a 6 hour mini-series about the American musical to lavish 10 minutes on SHE LOVES ME...

Alhough this is aimed at a broad audience, the producers have done a masterful job trying to condense a hundred years of Bway history into 6 hours. It has been assembled with intelligence, taste, and great care, as opposed to that shoddy made-for-video

interview show (The Legends who were there) which is self-indulgent pap.

This wonderful achievement will stand the test of time as a magnificent perspective on the American musical theater. And the DVD allowed me to skip or scan through any references to Andrew Lloyd Webber, Les Miz, Cameron Mackintosh, Disney & some of the other disastrous invaders of recent years that have done all they could to destroy the Broadway musical. I understand why the producers chose to include that material. You can't make a new docu without acknowledging these events, but I can omit them from my viewing if I so desire.

BUY THIS!
