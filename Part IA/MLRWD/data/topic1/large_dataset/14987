I have to admit, this is the best comedy I've seen in years.  It can be vulgar and offensive and definitely earns its R Rating, but for those who can stomach some insensitive humor there is much joy to be found in the witty dialogue.

Alan aka "Fat Jesus" is definitely the scene stealer of the movie.  Every one of his lines seems to lend itself to the category of "instant classic".

My only complaint (and the reason I am giving it 4 stars rather than 5) is that I could have did without a few of the over the top references (and a couple of the racy photos at the end) - otherwise it is comedic goal.  I have a feeling that the theatrical release will be much better than any directors cut or unrated version that is sure to follow as the theatrical release was racy enough by my standards---and I tend to be very open minded.

Edited to include the following:

After purchasing and watching the Blu-Ray, I must state that the extra features (including the "lost pictures") leave a little to be desired.  The BD transfer is excellent the no artifacts were noticed.  The sound quality is also up to par with other Blu-Ray releases however if you are purchasing this on Blu-Ray buy it for the movie itself as the special features aren't that special!
