This movie is hysterically funny and yet touching as well.  An Alabama momma wants her son to be happy and, upon finding out he's gay when he breaks up with his boyfriend of five years, decides to help him find a mate.  First, she and her sister get a neighbor's teenage son to help them get on the Internet to look for men for the son (that scene was a real hoot).  Then, by going with her sister to a gay club, where the two old ladies met drag queens and leather boys, her neighbor's underage son again, a gorgeous stripper (who's an art student), and a host of other stereotypes from the bar.  So fish out of water, yet it works, kind of.  Then the son decides to marry the daughter of an anti-gay preacher and his wife and the story became a combination of "La Cage Aux Folles" and "Auntie Mame," as Momma had to rescue her sweet boy from the sharks.

I actually laughed out loud more than once in this film.  Touching scene near end when Momma assures her son how much she loves him "just like he is" and wants him happy.  I was lucky to have a mother with that attitude, but I know too many others are not so lucky.  Not a deep movie, not deeply moving or worthy of major screen awards, but not at all badly done and quite amusing (if highly derivative), and some really good eye candy in the supporting characters.  If you just want a light, fun evening with some laughs, this one will fill your bill.  Enjoy.
