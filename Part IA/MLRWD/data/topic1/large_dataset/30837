Wow! The more you see this film, the more you LOVE it!! Complex, bright, thrilling, the love themes between the main characters is weaved through out. The actors are individual & interact beautifully. Wonderfully, masterfully directed. This film noir piece of brilliance is a natural buy for your collection, esp if your into 40's movies. This is not a flick, it's a movie. The commentaries bring depth & understanding to a movie made in the long ago & far away of that era.
Gene Tierney is lovely, angelic & a mystery. She's perfect in this role, but she's only in the later half of it! Which is 1 reason why she didn't want the role. The detective falls in love with a dead woman, only to find out he's 1 of 3 men so possessed. The murder victim becomes a murder suspect. Clifton Webb, in his first on screen role, fresh off the stage, is wonderful as Waldo & was nominated for an Oscar. We see a young Vincent Price before his thriller era. All are great.
But mostly, the sweet & intense interaction between the painting & the love theme -- inseperable elements-- is so telling & omni present, that they're almost another main character in their ongoing presence & impact, casting a love spell over the viewer.
