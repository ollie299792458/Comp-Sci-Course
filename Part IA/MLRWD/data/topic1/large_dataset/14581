I have to agree with the some of the other reviewers of this movie, that it is a real stinker. And Wood Harris is not a bad actor, but in this movie he is given the impossible task of playing unarguably the best guitarist who ever lived. Jimi was one of a kind and I doubt that we will ever in our life times see another such original or innovative musician. So from the beginning, the movie is a failure in attempting to achieve something that should have never even been attempted.

And yes, the music is horrible; not even close to the beauty and passion that Jimi created. It also sort of plays fast and loose with the some of the facts of Jimi's life and does not really make the viewer understand what demons he was fighting at the end, which I believe would have made the movie so much better.

I read somwhere last year, that the Hughes Brothers were thinking about making a movie about Jimi. Well they should watch this movie and then do the exact opposite. But I really believe that it would be almost impossible to make a movie about Jimi that would be true to his life and what he stood for, and one that his fans would accept.

So I agree with some of my fellow reviewers, don't waste your money. If you want to know about Jimi and his music read ELECTRIC GYPSY or JIMI HENDRIX: MUSICIAN or Sharon Lawrence's book. And if you want to see him playing as only he could, watch Monterey Pop, Woodstock, Jimi Plays Berkley or even Band of Gypsys.
