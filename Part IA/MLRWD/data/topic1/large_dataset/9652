It's April 2003, and I just viewed the DVD for the first, second, and third time. This may not be a politically correct movie with the war today, but it is one of the best I have ever seen. Meg Ryan, although with limited time in the movie, showed more than just being a cute actress, which she has been stereo typed as. I think the unpredictability of how the ending turns out, shows she is one of the top actors today, and should play more serious roles. This was an Academy Award performance.
Denzel, as usual was perfect and so believable in the role. He is without a doubt one of the finest actors of our times. The movie, with the flashbacks, emotions was directed and produced that kept the audience glued to the movie, and brought tears at the end.
How I missed this movie when it came out, I don't know, but the casting and acting should have won this movie and Oscar or Golden Globe Award. War is ugly, and ugly things happen we prefer not to know. This movie portrays what families should be told, and although necessay, war is never glorious. This movie should be dedicated to all of the unsung hereos of our Nation that have lost their lives to protect ours. And the true cost of our freedom.
