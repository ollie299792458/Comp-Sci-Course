When The Fifth Element was first released, it was received with love and hatred....it bombed in the U.S but was a massive hit in Europe and Australasia. Thats the thing about this movie, it is a foreign movie. This movie is french french FRENCH!! It is quirky, bizzare and downright hypnotic. I refuse to beleive that someone did not crack a smile at how different ad explosive this film was.
The film is set hundreds of years in the future and "evil" is heading towards Earth, and the elements of earth, water, fire and wind need to be combined with a fifth element to save the world. But things eventually get complicated leaving a retired military expert and a bisexual DJ to save the world. Now, you see what I mean! No American could come up with a movie such as this! It is a complete joy to see this movie unfold.
And it is all thanks to Luc Besson. He brings this movie to life with his bright colours and smooth, relaxed angles which create a world of hypnotic feel and energy. 
This film is different, it is VERY different. And if the execs. are mad of at it, well what to you expect when you give $90 million to a french director?
Crazy, bizarre, energetic, hypnotic, sexy, rude, insane....these are the words that describe this amazing film.
