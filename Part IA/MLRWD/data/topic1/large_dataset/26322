I bought this DVD about three years ago from a private dealer via the Amazon.com site. At the time, you could not find this DVD at any of the local retailers, so I had to pay a little extra due to supply-demand economics.  It was worth it as this movie is a film worth owning.

Supposedly this story, Fargo, is based on a true story. I've enjoyed it at least 20 times and will without a doubt watch it countless more times. In my opinion it is one of the best movies ever made. It has elements of several genres including drama, suspense, action thriller, and dark comedy.

The film starts out in a Fargo bar (Merle Haggard's "Big City" is playing on the jute box) where car dealer, Jerry Lundergarde, is making a deal with two ex-cons to kidnap his wife in order to get ransom money from his father-in-law. Jerry gets greedy and the plan is foiled by a smart woman police chief who is pregnant.

The acting and actors all did a superb job; even the bit part actors were great. I'll never forget the chief's husband, Norm, and his silly stamp campaign. And the chief of police, Marge, played by Frances McDormand who made the movie so credible with her Minnesota accent and mannerisms. Then, there was the big swede who now has a part on Fox's "Prison Break." And let's not forget Jerry Lundergarde and his wealthy but over-controlling father-in law.

This movie is a classic in every sense of the word. It is unique in that there has never been another movie like it. I still wonder if anyone ever found the million bucks that the little hood hid in the snow. I've even considered going up that way, and doing a search of the area. I think I'll wait, though, until the snow melts.

Needless to say, I love this film. The last time I watched it was about a year ago.  Since it has been a while, and I have the DVD, I think it's about time for me to pop the disc in the player and enjoy it again.

If you haven't seen Fargo, give it a try. You'll likely like it if not love it. Ya! Ya! Ya!
