A TRUE WORK OF ART compared to the overly-special effects ladden
 one that starred Edward Norton,Liv Tyler,and William Hurt.At least,
 Ang Lee focuses much,much more on what really makes a truly great
 film.And that is a great character driven story,with great
 character development,thus letting us know what really makes the
 main characters,in the film that we are watching,tick and helping
 us know whether we should really care if they live or die.And it's
 such a shame that so many HULK fans bashed this one to bits,
 because all they could care about was action and special effects.
 Not that special effects and action do not matter,because they do.
 Especially,in a movie about the Incredible Hulk.But the special
 effects and action certainly do not need to over dominate the movie
 either like they did in the franchise sequel/reboot film,''THE
 INCREDIBLE HULK''.And what Ang Lee did with your so typical
 kung-fu chopsuey martial arts flicks and managed to turn into one
 of the most beautiful films of all time as he did with "CROUCHING
 TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON".He also did the same with your typical comic
 book superhero flick.
