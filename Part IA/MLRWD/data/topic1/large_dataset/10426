Girl, Interrupted very much changed the way i look at films. It has all of the elements that make up a superior movie, and i am truly shocked it didn't win 'Best Picture' at the Academy Awards (let alone get nominated).
I first saw this movie on t.v. late at night as i was flipping through channels. I had looked it up in the t.v. guide and read that Winona Ryder (my fav. actress) was in it. I was debating between it and "Saturday Night Live". Thank GOD i chose "G.I."
This movie is my all time favorite in the midst of my comedy collection. The book is good also, but i enjoyed the movie far more. 
It hits on a lot of subjects that you normally don't find in movies. The acting was incredible. Not only Winona, but Brittany Murphy, Whoopie Golberg, and Angleina Jolie. The suicide scene was amazingly acted. Right after that scene, it went into a commercial, and my jaw was hanging open for all of it.
if you were looking for a recommendation, you can probably tell already that im going to give it a good review, but hear (read) this: "Girl" is not for the timid. Although it is a masterpiece, i can almost guarentee it'll have you shaking a few times. I strongly recommend it for people with a "fine" taste in films, Ryder/Murphy/Jolie fans, and just anyone who needs some excellent entertainment. I've also found that it's not just a girls movie. Many men were also touched by it also.
So do yourself a favor. See my favorite movie ever, "Girl, Interrupted." And don't just see it, BUY it!
