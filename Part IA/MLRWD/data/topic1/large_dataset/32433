On paper this was the greatest card ever for a raw or smackdown alone PPV. But it then becomes even better when their are three 10/10 matches and 2 very colse to that.

1. shelton Benjamin vs carltio Intercontinetal championshp
Great start back and forth action just carltio looks kind of sluggish at the end and shelton benjamin loses which is sad becuase of how underrated he is. 8.5/10

2. christy vs victoria womens championship
Christy belongs in TNA as a manager she didn't belong in the ring as the top women. boring as hell 4/10

3. Kaane vs edge
the crowd really got into this one and rightfully so it was brutal both men sold very well. great storyline intense this was great. 9/10

4. Shawn micheals vs kurt angle
Did expect a crappy match no a 9.5/10 would be dissapointing for these two even better than wm 21 10/10

5. john cena vs christian vs chris jericho for the WWE championship
Wow even cena didn't screw up this match great intense fun great ending 10/10

6. hell in a cell match Batista vs HHH for the world heavyweight championship WOW fued of the year and top 3 brutalsit matches of the year sure they didn't go outside the cell but come on will their ever be someone with more balls than Foley the answer no.
