It is funny to me that the moment something becomes popular (i.e. jim jarmusch) that the only way for the cool to remain pretentiously cooler than everybody else is to write silly and pendantic reviews where they bash the new.  the movie is not boring, the people who watch it are boring and they are so used to watching commercials and experiencing cheap cinematic ejaculation that they never actually pay attention to what they are watching.  if something isnt layed out in their grubby palms then they complain for having to work for it.  guess what, the one redeeming quality of this movie is exactly that, it makes you work for it.

all of the characters in this express crystaline reflections of there selves refracting off the forever frozen prism that is jarmusch's world.  he sets the actors into floating scenes regarding one of the last great american traditions left.  coffee and cigarettes.  maybe it's because i read primarily that i was able to appreciate this movie but i personally feel that in a country that has struggled for its identity since its birth that jarmusch has captured a fragment of its essence.  a beautiful work of american impressionism, and f@#$ all the haters...
