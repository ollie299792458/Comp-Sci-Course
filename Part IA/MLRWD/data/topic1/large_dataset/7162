Unlike it's remake "Where The Boys Are '84", which starred over-the-hill actors as college kids, "Where The Boys Are" cast young, college-aged stars. One interesting thing about this film is that it could have spawned a big, money-making blockbuster soundtrack album, but it didn't. Aside from the theme song, plus 2 others sung during the film, music is not a big part of this movie, story is. Another interesting thing about this movie is the outdoor location shots. Unlike Elvis' "Girl Happy", five years later, which was very obviously shot on a studio backlot. Most movies of this time & especially this genre were not shot on location, that's why this movie had a larger budget for it's time ($4 million). It's refreshing to see the stars on Las Olas Blvd. headed for the beach, & at the famous Elbo Room bar in 1960. Location shooting became common & taken for granted years later. The story revolves around four college girls on their way to Ft. Lauderdale for Spring Break. The movie is ahead of it's time because it shows young woman, on their own, furthering their education. It's also very dated because getting married seems to be the main thing on their minds. Connie Francis is fun to watch, but I feel she was miscast as someone who was supposed to be unattractive. No one pays attention to her & it's not very believable (she's not a big fan of this movie & I can understand why!) Dolores Hart had a Grace Kelly vibe going. She later left acting to become a cloistered nun. This was Paula Prentiss' film debut & she has an endearing, goofy persona/quality. Yvette Mimieux is cast as the dimbulb who sleeps around hoping each guy who beds her will fall in love with her (ugh!!). George Hamilton, Jim Hutton, & Frank Gorshin portray the "boys." Unfortunately, there isn't a really good looking dude among the main males (but there are some hot "extras" in the background scenes). The movie starts off frothy but ends on a serious note.
