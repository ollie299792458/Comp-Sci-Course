This is a modern Japanese rendition of the famous Zatoichi movies and series of 1962 and up.  When you think of Samurai movies - you must not leave this one out.  Zatoichi - the common man's Samurai - famous and beloved by generations of Japanese - has come to the big screen in a big way.  Zatoichi is a highly moral and skilled swordsman who travels about olden days Japan.  Two things set him apart from other Samuari movie characters - he uses the unorthadox upside down grip on his cane sword and he is blind.  This doesn't stop him from defeating scores of his enemy.  This movie is very well done and the acting and sword play is excellent.  The lead actor was actually a comedian in Japan but who is obviously very skilled with the sword.  His portrayal of Zatoichi is supurb.  The underlying theme of all Zatoichi films is one of morals.  Good over evil.  There is humor intermixed with drama and the everflashing cane sword of justice.  If you are at all familiar with the Japanese Samurai films of old - you must have this for your collection.
