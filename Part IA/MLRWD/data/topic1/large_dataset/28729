I remember watching these as a kid and they are just as fun now as they were then!  What's even better is that now you can fast forward through the theme music at the beginning of each episode -- once was enough.  There seem to be plenty of extras, which I have not yet viewed.  In addition, there is an option to turn on individual episode introductions by Stan Lee.  There's nothing better to get you revved up than an intro by Lee!

The video transfer seems to be very good.  I haven't noticed any major artifacts or anything, and the colors seem correct too.  The audio transfer is very clean and in the original stereo, as broadcast.

This is definitely a worthwhile buy, despite the overall cost.  Just look at it this way, for $1.73 an episode you can watch them as many times as you'd like.  This is great buy!

**I would like to note that I did not give this item a five star rating because it did not go above and beyond - something like a Dolby Digital or DTS audio mix would warrant it such a rating.
