Neil LaBute is known for making film where his main characters are forced into a very unfortunate position, usually by the cruelty and sadism of others.  As I was waiting for the premiere of The Shape of Things, my friends and I were taking bets as to who was going to get screwed and by whom.  I say this because as the events of the film unfolded, my group of friends was not only impressed with the film in spite of having those expectations, but that no one was able to even remotely guess what was about to happen, or how it was going to happen.
 This film was first written for the stage, and it was performed in both New York and London before being adapted for the screen.  That's something that shows in the film, as the scenes within the film are lengthy, without a lot of movement of location within scenes.  There are any scenes of characters walking from one place to another, every action happens within the context of that particular scene. This has an interesting effect of the film, one I enjoyed on the grounds that Neil elected to leave the performances and the dialogue as the primary fireworks of the film, rather than attempting to use other devices to express the story.
 The cast was the same group as performed the piece on the stage, Paul Rudd, Rachel Wiesz, Gretchen Mol and Fred Weller.  All of who give the film its depth, humor and ultimate message, which, rest assured, Neil has not lost his desire to engage the audience in questions concerning societal conventions, in this case, concerning the boundaries of love and relationships.
