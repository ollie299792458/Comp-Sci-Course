There are three stars in "Twister": the obsessed, almost vindictive woman who wants to defeat tornadoes, the obsessed, ingenious man determined to thwart tornadoes with technology - and the American Corn Belt, where superfluous humans and their artifacts are scrubbed from the landscape every year by tornadoes. Although they're not alone in chasing twisters, the Paxton/Hunt team is the focus of the movie - and this team is no bunch of Evian-swilling Sierra Club wimps. One of the best scenes shows the team stopping for a quick (feast) of steak, eggs, mashed potatoes, and gravy ("Meg's gravy is famous - it's practically a food group") at Hunt's character's aunt's home, right slap in the middle of Tornado Alley. The professional camaraderie in this team is wonderful, especially when we see how the members of the other team (led by Cary Elwes) don't get along so much as they get in line. (Critic Emerson will probably be played by Elwes the same way, if anyone ever makes a movie of his life.) By the way, I bought a copy of the soundtrack album - and then threw it away: none of the wonderful, driving original music is on the CD!
