basic, basic plot: Boy meets balloon. Boy and balloon hang out around Paris, despite others' efforts to separate them.

I had put off seeing this because it sounded hilariously boring. (In fact, I believe that the old tv show "The Critic" had this movie as part of some kind of joke, insisting that it was the eponymous critic's favorite movie to exemplify his pomposity.) I wound up watching it the other day late at night because it was short and I wouldn't stay up...and was definitely wide awake afterwards. I won't go into too much detail about what happens in the film because it's so short, but I will say that I found it very enjoyable and I will watch it again sometime to get a better look at the effects used in giving the balloon personality, as well as the final scene. I'd say that the last scene, which is both a surprise and visually stunning, has been aped by the Bravia advertisements and innumerable directors. It's really unforgettable and even a bit shocking - quite refreshing for someone who has grown inured to CGI and other cinematic trickery.

DVD print: I thought it was clear and the colors came across well, but the person watching it with me said the faces were a bit muddy and some of the scenery too dark. Not sure about the scenery claim, however, as I thought the streets of Paris were meant to look darker in contrast to the gloriously red and oddly oversized red balloon. In any event, it's lovely and you won't be angry because it's a Janus/Criterion film.
