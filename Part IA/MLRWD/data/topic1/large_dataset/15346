Let me start out by saying that this DVD is worth buying just for the plethora of extras: the behind-the-scenes sequences, the director commentaries, storyboard pitches, games, outtakes, and so much more. It's hours and hours of entertainment in itself.
As far as the movie goes, I generally enjoy this film. Eddie Murphy is fantastic as Donkey, showing off once again his ability to successfully bring oddball characters to life. Although people have complained about the "one-liner" feel about the movie, Donkey never ceases to make me laugh, no matter how many times I've watched the movie. John Lithgow is terrific as well, perfectly devious as Lord Farquad. My one (very big) complaint is Cameron Diaz's performance as Princess Fiona - during the entire movie, she sounds like she's reading monotonous text, and at the same time trying a little too hard to be excited. Her interpretation of her character comes off like someone in a bad high school play, and the dialog could have been written better for her part. Most of all, I'll never know why she specifically was chosen to be the voice of Fiona, as Diaz's voice really has no special "quality" about it. Where Murphy, Lithgow, and Mike Myers bring life to their characters, Diaz falls flat.
