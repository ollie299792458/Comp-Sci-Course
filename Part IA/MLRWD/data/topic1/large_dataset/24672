McNamara is clearly spinning history and running from his ghosts. I once read that he was known for simply making up any 'facts' he needed.

His comment in the film that "None  of our allies supported us (in Vietnam)" would come as a surprise to South Korea,Thailand,Australia,New Zealand and the Philippines - all of whom had troops in Vietnam.

He claims to have opposed the consensus of military leaders to bomb Cuba during the missile crisis, but then goes along with them for their recommendations of the conduct of the Vietnam war - saying later that he should have spoken up. This is a man who wants to have it both ways - and always be on the right side in the judgment of history - or so he thinks.

His reflections on the bombing of Japan are also somewhat curious. He neglects to mention that the Japanese civilians were warned by the US Air Force to evacuate 26 cities - but their leadership cynically dispersed the wartime industries into the residential areas and kept the civilians there. The Japanese government was to blame for what happened to their civilians - just as they were to blame for war crimes committed by Japanese troops. Taking events out of historical context - as McNamara frequently does - is the mark of someone who is trying to explain away actions at the time in order to conform to current political correctness.

The documentary is technically excellent - but having other voices to contradict McNamara on his many self-serving statements would have added more context and additional depth to the work. But that is solely (and correctly) the editorial judgment of the filmmaker.

All in all - an interesting soliloquy from McNamara, who was a participant in many of the events that have shaped our times.
