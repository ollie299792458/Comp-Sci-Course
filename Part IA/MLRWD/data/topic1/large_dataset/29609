I hate to disagree with foks that said the two actors that played Bonnie and Clyde looked convincing, but Dunaway and Beatty were in actuality much older than the real Bonnie and Clyde and I have always felt, too old to play the character roles.  Dunaway was 27 when she made the movie and Beatty was 30.  The real Bonnie was 19 when she met Clyde, just out of high school the year before,  and he was 20 and were 24 and 25 when they were killed.  I guess those old photos just make them look older, or perhaps it was the way they dressed. But they were in fact what CW Mosses father said in the picture "just a couple of kids" Beatty and Dunaway were much older and more sophisticated than the real characters.  Another character which was way off base was Blanche. I just finished reading "my life with Bonnie and Clyde" by Blanch Caldwell Barrow (a hell of a book and highly recommended) and she was a very attractive, once again a very young 21 year old girl when her and her husband Buck took off with her brother in law and Bonnie. She was nothing like the less than attractive and annoying character in the movie. The only other thing I had a problem with was Bonnies hair do.  The real Bonnie was not blonde but a redhead and she did not wear her hair anything like Dunaways character.  The hairstyles of the 30's were usually waves and very close to the head or bobbed. And if you really want to get technical, when Bonnie was killed she was wearing a red dress, red shoes and red hat, not white.  Thats hollywood fo\r you I guess.
