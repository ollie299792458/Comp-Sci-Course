Britannia not only rule the waves - stiff upper lip and all - even the desert of Pasadena, erm, 'Suristan' isn't safe....

Neither is the Crimea, for that matter.

Errol Flynn, King of all Swashbucklers, is one of my all-time favorites, one of the most brightly shining stars Hollyweird has ever produced, and he's in top form in this wildly imaginative epic that mixes facts and fiction from various different scenarios of British (and everyone elses')imperialism at its' height.

If you're into historical facts, this movie will have you in tears, if you're more a fan of dashing, old-fashioned, devil-may-care heroism, you'll probably end up recreating 'The Charge' on your bicycle in the driveway, eyes flashing, lance leveled......

For those of you who care about such matters (hopefully everyone), many horses were injured and killed during the making of this film, so it may be a wise and conscientious decision to get a used or otherwise non-premium edition of this classic adventure.
