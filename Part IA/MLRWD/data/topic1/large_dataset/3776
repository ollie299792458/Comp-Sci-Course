Count Von Krolock(Ferdy Mayne), bears his fangs and licks his lips. His pale skin reveals that he has thirsted through out the winter months in transylvania, Romania and gives a chilling triumphant laugh. He says to both Professor Abronsius(Jack MacGowran), and his faithful assitant Alfred(Roman Polanski), ..."I must leave you now..... See you later gentlemen....MEDITATE... on awaiting YOUR turn"... Then leaves them prisoner at his gloomy castle to await his return later to.......
The Fearless Vampire Killers is a movie you will either love or hate, (I love it). If you like the idea of a european based, cold, snowy, winter where you rug up to a warm fire and heat your own hands with the breath that you huff from within your own lungs and listen to the locals gossip whilst enjoying a warm soup in the santuary of an Inn, then you will like this movie, trust me.
If vampires, and comedy tied in with this, sound appealing, then The Fearless Vampire Killers is your movie. Abronsius and Alfred are travelling to transylvania to hunt down and destroy the vampire race that at this point only Abronsius and Alfred beleive in, but when they arrive at Shagal's(Alfie Bass), Inn then the truth of the village they are accomodated at is revealed, Shagal's daughter(Sharon Tate), is taken victim by Krolock and the two Fearless Vampire Killers set out to rescue her and ultimately mankind. Along the way they perform in a manner that is humourus and woefull. But this movie is not woefull. It is a smash hit that deserves much credit, as it has the "feel", of an old Hammer Horror production with great laughs and a great cast.
The perfect Friday night late movie with no lights on except the Television screen and a warm wood fireplace with just a random hint of crackle as the wood within burns...
