This film is wonderful, a true classic, and I'm glad to see that it is finally being released on dvd.

Polanski set out to make a spooky, spoofy fairy tale and he fully succeeded. The production values are excellent. Visually the film is dazzling, it is full of breathtaking snowscapes and eerie, elaborate sets. The music score by  Polish jazz composer Christopher Komeda (who also scored Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, and Knife in the Water) is the best ever composed for a horror film. Full of soaring, wailing voices Komeda?s spooky score sets the tone of the film marvelously.

The cast is great, especially Jack MacGowran and Polanski as the bumbling vampire killers. British character actor Ferdy Mayne is a wonderful vampire count, and Sharon Tate is beautiful and funny as the dizzy heroine, Sarah.

This will be a delight for all viewers who are cool enough to appreciate the film's unique charm. It is (as one would expect of Polanski) definitely a one-of-a-kind jewel, and successful on every level.

I love the cover art. I'm glad to see they are using the cool cartoon from the film's original poster and ad campaign. Good for Warners.
