As a younger child, I grew up listening to the Spice Girls. Spice came out when I was 7, and SpiceWorld when I was 8. Although Spice is amazing and definitely has some great hits, I must say SpiceWorld is my favorite Spice Girls album. It starts out with their huge hit, Spice Up Your Life, one of my favorites and a very popular choice among fans. Next is Stop, an upbeat song that makes you want to dance (they even made up a cute and easy dance to go along with it!) Too Much is the theme song to their movie of the same name, which is a slower ballad. Not a bad song, but not one of my favorite songs by them. Saturday Night Divas is a great song with a slower, sexy melody. One of the best songs on the album in my opinion. Never Give Up On The Good Times is guaranteed to put anybody in a good mood, with its catchy chorus and upbeat tempo. Move Over is one of the songs used for their Pepsi commercials, shorter but very good. Do It is another one of my favorite songs ever. Its positive lyrics and fun melody never fail to make me want to get up and sing. Denying is a great song, very typical Spice Girls, with each member having a part and Mel B having her little rap-type section. Viva Forever is a really great song with great lyrics as well. The Lady is a Vamp is a classic song that mentions many famous people, including Elvis, Norma Jean, and Bob Marley. I can honestly say there isn't a song on SpiceWorld that I dislike. 5/5/, an A+ album in my opinion :)
