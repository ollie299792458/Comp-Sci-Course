I believe that this was a great-great commedy. The actors where hillarius with very good roles. The story was nice and clever and personally I enjoyed each and every line-dialogue that existed in the movie!! The atmosphere in the movie was great and I believe that the director did a talented and wonderfull job developing the movie as he takes the maximum out of every actor in the movie.

  The romance within the comedy kicks in just about the right time and despite the high speed with which the movie goes on(its just a movie after all) I really loved the whole concept.

  To all people who like comedies-romantic comedies you will certainly like this one more or less.

  As for me this is one of the best comedy films I have ever seen and it came as a great surprise as I rent it from the video club not knowing anything about the plot or the movie.

  Having seen some negative remarks about this film I am not a great film reviewer or anything and I judge this film without comparing it to other older ones regarding the plot etc. I don't care if this film copied an older or it stole the plot, or the story was silly, of men are silly etc!! Simply this was the best (non-black comedy) romantic film that I saw the last few years that I liked and enjoyed each and every minute of it! Imagine that the second time I saw it I couldn't change the channel and whatch the 3rd Harry Potter film that I had just rented (there goes another extra 2 euros for keeping the film for another day). Instead I watched the film that was on tv (sorry Harry)
