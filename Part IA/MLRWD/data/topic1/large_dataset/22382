Just watched this DVD again last night.  Emerald Forest and Dances with Wolves are two of my all-time favorite movies... because perhaps both movies show humans as they were meant to live (hunt, eat, sleep, have sex, that's about it).

No point in re-reviewing the film here, others have already done an excellent job.  My review is of the DVD itself.

One of my pet peeves is DVD covers that claim Dolby Digital sound when in fact the best you get is Dolby Pro Logic.  This is one of those instances.  Do not be fooled by the Dolby Digital claim.  This DVD is NOT encoded as such.

Video quality is so-so at best.

What happened to the subtitles?  There is some dialogue where subtitles are missing.  There are misspelled words (another silly pet peeve of mine).

The DVD is still worth a buy because it's cheap and I wore the VHS out.  This movie is in desperate need of a deluxe edition.  It features a wonderous, haunting soundtrack that deserves first-class audio treatment.  Unfortunately, the movie wasn't a big hit so I'll be surprised if we ever see one.
