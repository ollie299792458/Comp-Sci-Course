When this season was on TV, of course I was much younger, and the 1st episode I ever watched was Teacher's Pet, and I was confused, because I loved the movie, and she is a vampire slayer, why was she fighting a she-mantis, so I didnt watch it after that.  My mother recorded the Welcome to the Hellmouth episode for me, after watching that I was hooked, now I see that it was nice that they put more demons in it, its awesome. Even though the acting is kinda lame, this season is still good. I dont know what that one person was talking about not having special features because it even says special features before you watch every episode, look for it. It has commentary on Welcome to the Hellmouth, The Harvest, Angel, and the Puppet Show by Joss Whedon.  Sarah Michelle Gellar I think is the perfect Buffy.  My favorite episodes from this season is Welcome to the Hellmouth, Angel, and Prophecy Girl, I even got a little emotional when she didnt want to die.  The clown in nightmares shocked and scared me where I ran out of the room screaming because Im scared to death of clowns, so all clowns haters be careful. All in all a good season, gets you into the story of Buffy's life, but wasnt she a senior in the movie?? Ive always been confused about that. So buy this DVD its worth every penny.
