If you're hoping this film will satiate your need for a tale of romantic love that softens the greediest of hearts, you will at least be rewarded with disappointment, but at most, an uncomfortable feeling of reticence. 
Yet if you think of it as a cynical romp through a world in which love is dead and romance is an accessory, you might have some fun. 
Catherine Zeta-Jones is pretty, catty, shallow, funny enough, and ultimately replacable. Casting a more endearing woman might have helped the romantic side of things, because it is too easy to disbelieve her genuineness. George Clooney on the other hand is extremely funny and self-deprecating (his relationship with his teeth is particularly funny). He is as shallow as Catherine's character, but much more likable, which keeps the film entertaining.
The art direction is charactertistic Coen Bros. - dark, but richly colored, making for a farcical ambience throughout. The jokes are wicked and clever as usual. 
If you're a Clooney fan, you'll love it, a Coen Bros. fan, you might enjoy it, but a romantic comedy fan... well, you're probably better off going to rent a Meg Ryan film.
