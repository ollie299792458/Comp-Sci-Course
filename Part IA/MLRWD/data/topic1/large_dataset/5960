I was excited when I first seen the preview for this movie, advertised on the Resident Evil Extinction film. My biggest hope was that the movie would be good because the more films they make, the worse they get. This film was refreshing, along with being completly CGI, they also bring back 2 Resident Evil alumni, Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, both from the Resident Evil 2 video game. The film develops its own story and plot, (with elements from previous games and films) and turns out to be suprisingly great. Without exposing to much of the story, the umbrella Corporation has went out of business, and renegade employees have released the G and T Viruses on the black market for sale. Now the viruses are being used for terrorist attacks, and "Wil pharmaceuticals" has developed a anti-virus to both strains, but many suspect foul play by the company. drama ensues, Claire and Leon have to stop another outbreak of the viruses. It was more like a thriller then a horror, the blood and gore is VERY limited almost nonexisting. There is also some hint of a love story as Leon seems to be torn between Claire and Angela. Overall, I enjoyed this film, I loved the flashbacks to game sequences from the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000I1BJ">Resident Evil 2</a> video game sprinkled throughout. If you like Resident Evil this is a must have.

Now Im going to rag on the film, even thought I love it and gave it 5 stars. I felt that since this was a CGI film, they were going to have a lot of blood, guts, macabre and gore, but there wasnt, which really disappointed me (I love hardcore horror!!!). The constant dust ALL OVER THE PLACE was extremely aggrivating, in an attempt to make it look real they added that, but it does more harm than good. Also, at times the characters mouth movements dont match the audio track, its like watching a subtitled movie. And, I didnt like how they kind of threw the plot in your face and didnt give it time to develop, everything happens so fast, you gotta watch it twice to REALLY understand it.

This movie also came with a lot of special features. Most anticipated, was 2 different previews of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012N94WO">Resident Evil 5</a> video game coming in Feb '09. I enjoyed the blooper and gag reels, they were EXTREMELY funny!! A fake interview with Leon. They included 5 trailers for this film. There is also a lot of interviews with cast and creators. No commentary unfortunatly, but the interviews with the writers and directors goes real in-depth and is very long, so that slightly makes up for the lack of commentary (filmmakers explained this was like "Resident Evil 4.5, i.e what happen after <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B69E9G">Resident Evil 4</a> game). They also had a character bio for everyone on the film, some with pics and videos.
