I have seen this movie going on 20 time's!!!It is so interesting my husband asked me?,if we could watch,The Virgin Suicide's again???And for him to ask me this,the movie must be excellent!!! As most of us women know that our husband's or boyfriend's dont really get interested in watching a certain movie over and over with us,well my husband proved to me that this movie is a 10...My husband dosent watch movie's with me,did you get that???Okay,this movie is very entertaining,it is about 4 boy's growing up in the 70's,and these boy's are so obsessed with a family's daughter's,The Lisbon girl's. First you have the youngest girl,Ceceila who is 13,next is Lux who is 14,then Bonnie who is 15,and Mary who is 16,and last Therese who is 17.The girl's seem to have it all,and everything look's normal to the outside world,but inside that house it was anything but normal.All the girl's are blonde and pretty,the boy's watching the Lisbon girl's are infatuated on them.Ceceila has 2 suicide attempts,she slit her wrist's the first time,came home 2 week's later,(The father persauded the mother to let the Lisbon girl's throw a party,for Ceceila) while the party for Ceceila is on way,Ceceila goes to the mom and ask's to be excused,the mother complies,and Ceceila goes to her room and jump's out her window,making her second attempt a reality...After this the hose really changes,the parent's played by Kathleen Turner and James Woods are very strict catholic parents,overprotective,who never let the girl's really become a woman.I feel the mother is at fault a little more than the father...The 4 boy's that were in love with the Lisbon girl's comes into play.... The girl's all of them committed suicide....This movie is a depressing movie,but there are some good scene's when the girl's are at the dance.Remember Danny Devito was Ceceila's shrink.I ordered the book,and the soundtrack to the movie,it's that good...All the acter's were excellent,the music score was excellent,all together we have a winner.A must see,and read.I hope my review was helpful to you....thank you for reading my review...Teresa Tomsic~
