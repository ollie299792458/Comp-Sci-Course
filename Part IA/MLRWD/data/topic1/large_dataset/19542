If you're reading this, I am probably preaching to the choir.  If not, do please know that this mid-90's trilogy is just about the best daikaiju eiga (sp?) ever, with really special effects, solid storytelling & acting, and less of the silliness that detracts from this type of film.  We're a looonngg way from the lesser, MST3K-ed Gameras with alien chicks trying to eat little boys' brains here, folks!  I titled this Grateful because we finally have the trilogy on Blu, with strong transfers and some (although not many) extras.  This is a good given that physical media will be dead in the foreseeable future and the Cloud will never be able to render these films with this detail; if it someday can (or does), let's face it, these films are not likely candidates for that jump.  Best of all - way inexpensive!  If you *have* seen these movies and are wondering, get 'em.  The transfers are dandy, the effects hold up to the scrutiny, and the films really are as good as you remember.  If you are one of those who have not seen them and are perusing Amazon or were led here by a link, wondering what all the fuss is - take a chance.  The price makes this an extremely low-risk venture, and if you're at all comfortable with GODZILLA, GORGO, WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS, KING KONG, and the real winners of the genre, these belong in the conversation.
