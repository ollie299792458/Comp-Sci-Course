This one was a crashing bore. Scorsese put all his energy into fancy sets and flashy camera work and neglected to give us a fresh, interesting story or credible characters. A previous reviewer wondered whether Scorsese is incapable of making films set in times or places not his own. On the evidence of the last 10 or so films Scorsese's made, I'd say...Yep. GoodFellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, the first half of Casino--these are all f*cking brilliant! (An exception to the rule is the eminently forgettable Bringing Out the Dead, set in modern NYC.) But his other films--GONY, Kundun, The Age of Innocence--are duds, every single one of them. 
The DVD is annoying. The movie is spread out over two discs, for no good reason except to drive up the cost. 
A couple of earlier reviewers here suggested City of God as a good alternative to this disappointing movie. I agree. If you want to see a brilliantly rendered saga about criminal gangs running wild in lawless slums, COG is the movie to get. It was the best film of 2003. Interestingly enough, its structure and narrative style are closely patterned after GoodFellas. Scorsese is being outstripped by his disciples.
Upshot: Skip this dud and rent or buy City of God.
