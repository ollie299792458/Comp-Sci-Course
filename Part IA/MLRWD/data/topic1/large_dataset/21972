I'd been reading about and hearing about this movie for as long as I can remember. And after watching "Shadow of the Vampire" with Willam Dafoe again playing the "elusive" Max Schrek,(and I still think he should have won the Oscar that year for Best Supporting Actor, thank you very much), I decided to finally buy Nosferatu.

I held off for years because of reviews I read about poor video quality, bad transfers, etc.  All I can say about this issue from Criterion is that IT ROCKS!!!!  I'm not a big fan of black and white movies, much less silent films (Metropolis excluded). But I was very impressed with this one. The picture is crisp and clear, you see all of the great lighting nuances. It looks fantastic. And as for the villian, he is easily the ugliest, creepiest vampire ever. I don't know where they dug Max Schrek up from, but he was either one of the greatest character/method actors of all time, or "something else" entirely. Not that it matters.

Now I understand why they tried to [...] his look in the original film version of Stephen King's "Salem's Lot" instead of sticking with the way King described his vampire in the book as starting out as an old gentleman gradually getting younger with the more victims he has his way with. I first saw that when I was very small, and the first time they showed "the monster" I bailed off the side of the couch and that's where I stayed to watch the rest of the show on tv.

This version of Nosferatu is wonderful and well worth the money. I'm glad they introduced the original score back into it as well. It adds a lot of ambiance. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase of this wonderful classic film and I'm ecstatic that it managed to survive, despite the fact that all copies of it were supposed to be destroyed just because Bram Stoker's widow had her [...] in a wad over copyright issues.
