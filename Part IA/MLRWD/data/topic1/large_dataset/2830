I felt this would be the end-all and be-all of anime, I should have been a little more realistic. The stop-and-go nature of all the films can be annoying and there are big gaps in between features. Most are disconnected from films and only two are a continuation. I suppose my favourite was 'Matriculated', it's the most appealing to me, visually. The plot ideas are mildly cool, these are mostly about projecting big ideas onscreen through animation. The main feature lasts about an hour and twenty minutes, the rest is unentertaining but deep background or ads for other Matrix products. 
  It would definitely make a better rental than 20 dollar purchase. None of the shorts were given enough time to really flesh out many ideas, there are advantages to this, but you can't get attached to any characters or ideas much, and it doesn't flatter their hard work. I felt that the Second Renaissance 1-2 compiled a backhistory of the Matrix very nicely, but maybe some of that should have been explained better in the films, instead of Lock getting a stupid bracelet from his girlfriend to represent 'faith'.
