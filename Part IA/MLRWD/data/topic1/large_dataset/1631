Connery returns in this third installment of Bond films and puts in a masterful performance as James Bond.
From beginning to end it is magnificent, seeing Bond blow, drive, smooch, charm and slap his way though  what is arguably the best ever Bond film.
Gert Frobe is splendid as the  evil, twisted Auric Goldfinger the international gold smuggler who wants it  all - and appears in what must be two of the most tense moments in all the  Bond movies - a round of golf at the historic Stoke Poges Golf Course and  THAT scene with the Laser.
We've got the usual array of gadgets including  the introduction of Bond's sleek Aston Marton DB5 Car complete with machine  guns, oil slick, revolving number plates etc. 
US (Korean Born) Olympic  Wrestling Gold Medalist Harold Sakata takes on the mantle of Goldfinger's  mute valet "Odd Job" who has a marvellous weapon (a steel rimmed  bowler hat" which he uses to great effectiveness throughout the  film.
Honor Blackman plays Pussy Galore the main love interest in the  film and she doesn't disappoint putting in a fine performance.
If there  is one criticism it is Cec Linder who plays Bond's CIA chum Felix Leiter,  the character seems to be completely inept throughtout the film, which  doesn't tally with Jack Lord's masterful performance of Leiter in Dr.  No.
After all is said and done, this is a classic, and should not under  any circumstances be missed.
