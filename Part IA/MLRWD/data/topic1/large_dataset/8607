Law Abiding Citizen is a smart new suspense thriller movie available on Blu-ray from Anchor Bay on February 16, 2010.  Directed by F. Gary Gray, the film stars Gerard Butler as Clyde Shelton, a father whose wife and daughter are killed while he is tied up.  When lawyer Nick Russo (Jamie Foxx) works out a plea bargain with the 'real' killer who testifies against his accomplice, Shelton feels like the legal system wronged his family.

Ten years later, Shelton returns to seek revenge against the man he blamed for his family's death.  Law Abiding Citizen is not your typical man seeks revenge thriller.  Shelton has much greater plans than taking out one man.  Instead, he intends to punish everyone involved in what he believes is a corrupt and bureaucratic legal system.

When Nick and his cohorts discover that Clyde is more than just a wronged man, and that his background is designing and developing killing machines, they realize they are in trouble.  Clyde begins to systematically kill everyone he blames for the death of his wife and daughter.  Unwilling to break the law and kill Clyde in cold blood, Nick struggles to figure out how Clyde is killing from prison and how to outsmart his intelligent nemesis.

Law Abiding Citizen is a brilliant and intelligent action film with a clever and original concept.  The audience is perplexed by a difficulty in deciding which side of the story to be on.  Initially, your natural reaction is to root for the emotional revenge of a man who lost his wife and daughter.  However, as the story carries on, Clyde takes on more of a villainous role and Foxx's character comes forward as the film's protagonist.

If you want an action-packed, smart, and entertaining suspense movie of a new mold, Law Abiding Citizen is a must-see Blu-ray release for you.  The Blu-ray includes a variety of cool special features and bonuses.  You get the Unrated Director's Cut with commentary and interviews.
