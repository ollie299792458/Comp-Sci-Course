At times, this movie was hilarious!

During a few scenes, my friends and I ended up doubled over, laughing until our stomachs hurt. Rules of Attraction is filthy, bombastic, and dark. Bret Easton Ellis has a great talent for satire. Although ridiculous and often disturbing, it's an extreme, entertaining view of college life. I'm glad my mother didn't watch this before I left high school, it probably would have given her nightmares. Don't watch this with your family if you want to avoid awkward silences. The three main characters are so impressively devoid of serious goals and motivations, anyone taking this movie too seriously will probably despise it. The same goes for American Psycho, another adaptation of one of Bret Easton Ellis's impressive novels, and probably my favorite movie of all time.

Ian Somerhandler puts on an exceptionally good performance in this film, I was surprised. He never really did anything for me on Lost, and serves as primarily eye candy on The Vampire Diaries. But I was impressed; he not only has looks but also charm. Out of all of the characters, he was the one that felt that most tangible. I greatly enjoyed his scenes and interactions with the other characters.

A few key parts from the novel didn't make the cut for the movie, which was mildly disappointing. They didn't properly convey the awfulness of Sean Bateman's character either. I think the writers were too easy on him. My friends also experienced occasional trouble with following the storyline, seeing as they hadn't read the novel. Also, the backwards filming was rarely welcome, in my opinion. But overall, this movie was all of the things I wanted it to be, and conveyed the novel well.

A great cult classic.
