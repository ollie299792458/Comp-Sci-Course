I walked in with high expectations, I left wondering, is there any movie more stupid than this? The main problem is so out there that the most naive person on earth wouldn't be caught into thinking, could this actually happen? Ok, it starts out with a team of explorers in the Arctic when a giant crack opens in the ice. Is the explorer dead? No! At the last minute, with what? 50 pounds of equipment on his back, he performs a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-style jump across 10 feet of empty air and saves himself. Then the scene goes to a labratory and it shows that the earth will be frozen in a few days in a totally. So, because of global warming, giant expensive-special-effects waves come into New York and people run into a library which, for whatver reason, is filled with food and blankets. Then, voila, everything's frozen! So, the terrible actor's character's father says he'll rescue him from the library. We all know how boring the library is! He succeeds thanks to the main character using a pay phone underwater! So, in conclusion, this is a really stupid movie. A reviewer said this is good because its realistic, unlike Independence Day. I'd have to say  this is as unrealistic as Independence Day. No person,e ven a little kid, would see this movie and think, could the world freeze with giant tornadoes and hurricanes any day? Also, this movie is boring. We all saw previews and craved it until it came out. But, lots of the movie is set in that stupid library. (What's with the wolves! That is one of the lamest scenes I've ever seen in a movie period.) Even the disaster scenes could be more interesting. We saw the best parts in previews! So, in concluision, if I was to give this a report card, it would be:

GRAPHICS:A

STORY:D+

ACTING:D+

CHARACTERS:D

WATCHABILITY:C

LOGIC:F

PS. Why 2 stars instead of one? The special effects are beautiful. Also, sorry; this review does ramble.
