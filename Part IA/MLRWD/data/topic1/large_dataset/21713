This is the story of saving lives -- physically and spiritually.  Sissi is a nurse in a psychiatric hospital who is fated to connect, on several occasions, with Benno, a "warrior" (actually, a former soldier) with a dead soul. As the film progresses, the lives of these characters and even other, more minor characters intersect. The plot weaves together the various individual threads of the characters' lives.  The characters fall into each others lives seemingly by coincidence, but one senses that there is a guiding hand putting each character in the right place at the right time.  This is a much more thoughtful film than "Love, Actually," which uses the same device of connecting seeimingly unrelated characters.

While this film has correctly been criticized by viewers as slow moving, there is a lot to like here.  There are some incredible scenes. The manner in which Sissi's life is saved, and the place, is unforgettable -- it is something I've never seen before in any film.  The patients in the psychiatric hospital accurately reflect their love for Sissi through the prism of their various illnesses.  At bottom, though, this film is about escape (from empty, soul-destroying lives) and redemption (through love).

After watching the film, be sure to listen to the audio commentaries, which provide a great deal of insight into the making of various scenes and what Tykwer was attempting to accomplish.
