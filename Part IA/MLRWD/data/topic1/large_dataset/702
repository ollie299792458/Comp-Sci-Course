this movie was filmed excelently and would make a... really good anti-drug ad. plain and simple. the movie was filmed expertly. (forgive me for repeating myself ) the style changing to fit the mood. things like lenses, pacing, and cuts. the sound was superb. which i used as a segway to my next comment. the score was EXCELLENT. im not so much a fan of the most popular main theme, but those sort of coney island dreaming songs and the one at the end titled "meltdown".
my only problem(s) with the movie is just the way it made me feel. i didnt really ever wanna see it again afterwords. it fascinated me but i didnt feel... i dunno... good, watching it. it felt like something was horribly horribly wrong. i got the same disturbed feeling from "a clockwork orange". another fascinating masterpiece of stanley kubrick ( one of the greatest directors of ALL time ) if you have a weak stomach.. you may wanyt to avvert you eyes at times. the performances where convinceing and the story, although semi-plotless. now im giving it a 4 because... i didnt like the way the movie made me feel. BUT, i thought the movie was excellent.
