I love this movie, yes its over the top and maybe you're best chances of surviving the end of the world are if you're driving a limo.

I didn't read all of the other 500+ reviews to see if this was already done, but I want to mention the speacil features on the DVD vs the Blu-ray (single disc).  On the DVD are; "Time For Miracles" Music Video by Adam Lambert, Commentary with Writer/Director Roland Emmerich and Co-Writer Harald Kloser, Deleted Scenes, Alternate Ending, Roland Emmerich: The Master of the Modern Epic.  The last of which is segment about the director.  On the Blu-ray are; movieIQ and BD-Live connect you to real-time information on the cast, music, trivia and more while watching the movie,
Picture-In-Picture: Roland's Vision-Includes Pre-Visualization, storyboards and behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with filmmakers, cast and crew, Commentary with Writer/Director Roland Emmerich and Co-Writer Harald Kloser, Alternate Ending.  On the blu-ray we don't get the deleted scenes or the Adam Lambert music video.  We do get the movieIQ and BD-Live (if you have internet connection) and the picture-in-picture commentary "roland's vision".  While watching the picture-in-picture commentary, you unexplainably lose the translation subtitles (used when they're in France and China for example).  There's no reason for these subtitles to go missing, there's still room on the screen for them to appear.  I also don't know why the took away the deleted scenes.  But, overall, getting a blu-ray is about the picture and sound which are both better then the dvd version.
