This documentary was the first I'd heard in any depth of the Michael Peterson murder case, and the apparently unjust verdict (according to what one is led to believe in the film) led me to dig deeper into the case, which I'd suggest every viewer do before casting lots with these filmmakers and their pals, Peterson's defense team.  It's a very interesting case, which makes for a very interesting film.  Unfortunately, the film omits a good deal of the evidence against Peterson, including most of what jurors relied on to convict him. No kidding.  Look it up.  Whether the French film crew were simply inclined to favor a guy who likes wine and swings both ways, or seriously weighed all the evidence and came to believe Peterson was innocent, they've produced a movie told essentailly from one point of view, with the occasional excursion into enemy territory only included to drive home stereotypes about the other side -- i.e., that the DA's team are Southern homophobes and family members who oppose Peterson emotional wrecks.  Still, when all was said and done, the jury found the guy guilty beyond a reasonable doubt for reasons the film chooses to delete. Then, insult to injury, they imply the jury came to its decision for no good reason at all.  Filmmaking most foul.
