unfortunately, this movie should not have been called "the gospel" or anything close to the gospel. it did not glorify the reason for the gospel (the good news),which is Jesus Christ, and didn't even come close to expressing anything that would spark anyone's curiosity into the actual gospel.

part of the plot in this movie was when the church needed a new building and did not have the funds for it. there was hardly any prayer involved or church participation to raise money. boris kodjoe's character saved the church with HIS talents and with HIS money. the church was of no use to him,but he was used by the church. in essence,his character was glorified,not Christ's and sends out the message that the church will put a stamp of approval on practically anything, so long as it benefits the church. never mind the condition of your soul,or how your life is as a christian: you can be living however which way you want,call yourself a christian and the church will look the other way as long as you are benefiting their "needs".

at the end, David the main character,surrenders his life to GOD--but who specifically is he surrendering it to?  nowadays,the mention of GOD doesn't necessarily mean a thing. we all know that, yet the movie is called "the gospel".

all i'm saying is there is a boatload of other titles the writers and producers of this movie could have chosen to name this movie, like "the gospel music entertainers" or "the somewhat prodigal son". if you're going to call the movie, "the gospel" then make it about the gospel or put accurate facts about the gospel in it as your primary point,with your secondary point showing black american church culture or gospel entertainment.  otherwise, it just falls flat and it becomes another entertaining,toe-tapping attempt to portray humanism, not christianity/the gospel.
