...then perhaps this is your cup of tea!
A puckish exercise in style over substance, some of the best British character actors of the early seventies attack their roles with alacrity!  ("Ham" served as dessert?)
Vincent Price is in top form as the villainous Edwin Lionhart, Shakespearean thespian wrongly presumed deceased.  Former "Avenger" Diana Rigg decks out in a number of amusing disguises as Lionhart's daughter Edwina, ranging from male drag to blonde ingenue.  An original "Avenger" (way back in the beginning of the series, when Patrick MacNee was his sidekick), Ian Hendry  (as  head of The Critics' Circle) keeps things emotionally well grounded.  The remaining cast are suitably quirky self-absorbed cardboard characters, ripe for bumping off with temerity in manners inspired by scenes  from The Bard himself!
All the players here dig in with relish, as one might expect from anyone who ever received hash notices in theatrical reviews.  All the guilty parties concerned appear to have had a fun time while making this bit of camp horror fluff.  The story is remarkably similar "The Abominable Dr Phibes".
After this movie, Diana Rigg compiled a book of nasty theatrical criticism entitled "No Turn Unstoned."  Vincent Price and Coral Brown met during the making of this film, and afterwards they wed.
