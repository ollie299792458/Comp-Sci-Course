I LOVE this version of Annie! It's AWESOME! I don't know why so many people hate it when this movie is clearly better than the one Disney put out in 1999. The cast is better, the songs are better, and the sets are more realistic.
I really don't see the comparison between the two movies. The sets, like the mansion and the orphanage, are much more realistic in this version than the other one. The orphanage is a dump in this one, which is what it's supposed to look like. The mansion is gorgeous, which it is supposed to look like. The cast is so much better in this one, too. Albert Finney plays a much more realistic Daddy Warbuckst than Victor Garber. I love Aileen Quinn as Annie. She fits the description perfectly: 20% tough, 80% charm. Aileen Quinn looks more like Annie than Alicia Morton,too. Where are Alicia's curly locks? They don't appear until the end. Carol Burnett is a much better Ms. Hannigan than Kathy Bates. She does a much better job in the song "Little Girls." Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell, Geoffrey Holder as Punjab, Edward Herrman as FDR, Tim Curry as Rooster, and Bernadette Peters as Lily are awesome, too.
