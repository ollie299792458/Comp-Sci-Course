I can honestly say that I've watched The Price Is Right ever since I was a baby (or at least a toddler) and grew up with it. Call me weird, but for the past 5 years or so I've searched the web for TPIR sites hoping to see early episodes of the show. With The Price Is Right being into its 36th continuous year on the air, I never thought I'd see as much as rerun of a previous episode. And now here I am watching a younger, dark-haired Bob Barker being introduced on a 1972 episode of The NEW Price Is Right - and all I can say is WOW!!!!!

It's no wonder The Price Is Right has been on TV for so long. An episode from over 30 years ago is just as exciting as a current episode (before Bob retired, of course). This DVD set is a treasure! It contains 4 episodes of the 1950's and early 1960's shows hosted by Bill Cullen. The rest is all classic Bob Barker shows from 1972, 73, 74, 75 and Bob's entire final week as host. You also get the very first hour-long show with the Showcase Showdown. All the famous pricing games and memorable contestants are here as well as the opening cards and ticket plugs.

If you are a true Price Is Right fan, YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO OWN THIS DVD SET!!!

And thanks to Amazon.com for shipping it to me so quickly! It arrived to me MUCH sooner than I expected.
