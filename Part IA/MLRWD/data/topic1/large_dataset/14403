I just recently bought Purple Rain on dvd.  It is now my all-time favorite movie!!  Prince is one of my favorite artists and I love the messages behind his music.  I had the soundtrack way before I saw the movie.  So it was more enjoyable to sing along with the songs.  I am also going to see Prince in Atlanta on 8/10.  I can't wait!! If his performances are anything like on PURPLE RAIN I can't wait.  They are completely mesmerizing.  I have to say though his music more than made up for his acting skills. Apollonia was delectable and Morris Day was funny and is quite talented himself.  But the last 20 minutes after Morris Day performs the Bird is where the real magic happens.  I finally understood the message behind the music.  PURPLE RAIN was already one of my all-time fave songs, but after his father whot himself in the head, it made it that much more emotional.  The guitar riff in that song is the heavens opening up!  THere has never been a song more beautiful than PURPLE RAIN then he goes into another one of my faves I WOULD DIE 4 U its also a beautiful song with some of the best lyrics I have ever heard.  Even if you're not a Prince fan, watch this movie.  It is one of the most important musical movies ever!!  You know Prince won an Oscar for the score, plus Grammys so you know it was good.  I mean this movie is in a class all by itself just like Prince, in a class all by himself!!
