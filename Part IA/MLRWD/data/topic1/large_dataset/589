I know that Batista, to the eyes of some, is an accomplished wrestler/entertainer, but for the vast majority of WWF/WWE fans that purchase these DVD set, it is to relive the accomplishments of wrestlers who have had a stellar career.  I believe that the biography portion of this DVD set will be great because it is based pretty much how his biography, which was released a couple of years ago, was set up.  I thought that the biography was honest, real, and emotional for him to discuss those aspects of his life with the general public.  As far as the matches on this set, I agree with the other people who stated that they are decent and for a die hard Batista fan, this set is a must buy.
What about all of the other wrestlers from the past who deserve a three DVD set of their top matches and feuds with a documentary that haven't had the honor of getting one made.  I have listed a few with the hopes that someone at Titan Towers rips off these ideas for the future: Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase, Ravishing Rick Rude, Andre the Giant, Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff, Owen Hart, Bobby "The Brain" Heenan, Trish Stratus, Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat, and Chris Jericho.  I would love to see the WWE release sets for Kurt Angle and Sting but that's a dream until they leave TNA.
These are just hopes and dreams for me.  Until those dreams come true, I will just wait with fingers crossed!
