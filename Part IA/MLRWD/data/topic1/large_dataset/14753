all you reviewers are right, this film is gutsy, controversal, dark, and lurid. As a gay man i dont find it rude or an insult to homosexuality. there are to this day and age a certain group of gay men who are working class citizens, pay taxes and contribute to society that enjoy this lifestyle depicted in the film. It does exist in big cities to small towns. Then there are gay men who simply choose not to be involved in this lifestyle. Friedkins own film from 1970, THE BOYS IN THE BAND focuses on that group of gay men who are happy, witty, sad, hilarious, and thought provoking. It is these gay men back in 1979 1980 that despised this film back then and to this day. - kudos to AL PACINO for taking on this role. he is a very open minded actor doing gay related work from playing gay in DOG DAY AFTERNOON to the great ANGELS IN AMERICA. Yes CRUISING is unsettling to watch at times but so are alot of other films like NIGHTMARE, a ghastly 80s horror film i just reviewed here on amazon. heck, THE WALKING DEAD is unsettling to watch and thats on cable tv. point here is CRUISING is just a movie like PSYCHO, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and BASIC INSTINCT all with gay lurid undertones that all had there share of controversy in there times of release. Like franky said RELAX.
