This film has been reviewed so many times I won't address the campy humor and fresh take on the "horror movie" genre.  Evil Dead is and will remain a cult classic and now we have it on blu-ray in a "limited edition" which could mean that it is limited to as many as they can process.  Every few years they give us a new reason to buy the film.  I anticipate the "extended version" will be available in a few years.  It is the limited edition version I am reviewing here.

Blu-ray does clean up the picture some but the biggest improvement in my opinion is in the sound.  The better the sound the better the presentation  Older films like this one can be cleaned up digitally but I personally do not like enhancement and prefer the digital master to be made from a good analog source rather than attempt "improving it".

If you are a true collector and you own one of the other DVD releases, this one is great to have but I don't feel there is enough improvement to warrant buying it again.  The extras are fun, and I am not sure if they are available on any other release.  Does anyone know the answer to that?

Still, I love this film and it will be loud on 10/31 this year, hopefully lending a scare to the ambiance of the evening....
