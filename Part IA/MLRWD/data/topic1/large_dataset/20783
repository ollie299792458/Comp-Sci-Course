I've been a moviegoer since the fifties and had the supreme pleasure to behold many great films on the silver screen. But Martin Brest broke the mold when he made "MEET JOE BLACK". Positively, and without question the finest movie I've ever seen. I turned 62 last year. I had seen the movie several times since 1998. But, I started watching it again with a renewed vigor, primarily because like most of us (who rush through life, not stopping to smell the fragrant roses along the way) I realized like Bill Parrish that I'm definitely closer the the end, than the beginning. Or, am I closer to a beginning than the end? Every nuance, smile, grimace, frown and glance by each and every actor is so utterly and totally focused and perfectly scored with swells of emotion that one must view this masterpiece over and over to even get a glimpse of the profound concepts explored in this epic.

Now, after viewing this film scores of times, I weep with Bill Parrish when he contemplates the wonderful gifts of his life and the fleeting moments that remain for him. Each of us should view this film and reflect upon our lives; God-given gifts of our families and friends that touch our lives as we touch them and marvel at this masterpiece that we call life "how quickly it passes".

You must...."MEET JOE BLACK".
