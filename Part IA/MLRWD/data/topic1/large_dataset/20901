To say I love this movie might be an understatement, and for all the reasons I love it you can read lots of other's 5 star reviews and add a ditto from me.  It is touching and lovely.  But, I wanted to write a review in response to all the people who were upset about others enabling a mental illness, how unrealistic this way, how weird it is that the town supports Lars and goes along with the idea of Bianca... If you watch the special features you'll hear the director talk about her vision... that this is a sort of fairy tale.  A world where people have nothing but love and compassion and patience instead of the opposing things that are all too common in our "real world." This is about what would happen if we were loving and wanted to help others all the time, instead of judging them and feeling self conscious about looking silly or feeling foolish ourselves.  It seems to me that those harsh reviewers of this movie have a hard time even watching a movie and letting go of these things so it is no wonder to me that this didn't connect with them in any meaningful way.  I'm sorry they are missing out, because it is a really beautiful idea, something I aspire to, and something I wish everyone could embrace a little more whole heartedly.  This movie is the best sort of fairy tale I could imagine.
