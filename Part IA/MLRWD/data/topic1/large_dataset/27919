Bringing back Knight Rider was a wise choice. I didn't watch the original growing up, but I had a friend who did and she and the original K.I.T.T got me into watch it. I became a fan 2 months before the 2 movie came out. I wasn't happy at 1st with Justin Bruening taking over the role of being the new Michael Knight, but I grew to like Justin and all the other cast. Today Knight Rider was awesome. K.I.T.T was awesome has he can change into the different cars and do different things. I love how Justin could just take whatever he wanted to look at and move it across the dashboard. "Fight Knight" was my less favorite to watch. I only watched it if I had too. My favorite are "Knight Fever", "Knight Of The Living Dead", "Knight To King's Pawns", " Knight In The City, and "I Love The Knight Life". Its always fun to watch the episodes over and over. I just hope someday down the road we get our 2nd season.

Weather your a fan of the original or a fan of today go out and buy this Knight Rider box set. It is to buy and to hold cause we have no idea if we are getting a 2nd season and a 1st season is to hold onto a life time.
