This film wasn't too bad, I worried how Tom Hanks would do at such a role but this is also the man who made himself fit into the role as Forrest Gump so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. And he did well in this role as well. A lot of the movie is very quiet when he is on the island and you just watch him trying to survive alone on the island. I always worried there would be a threatening person or creature on the island that would eventually attack him but I guess they thought that Tom Hanks being alone on the island was more dramatic, and I could see that. This film has a feeling of great lonliness and that was the point and they did it well. And then at the end when he goes back home, not everything is perfect, or a happy ending. It's just an ending, that signifies a new beginning for Hank's character. A very realistic ending, and I was glad to see that.

Overall I really did like this film. It's not the sort of film I always watch but Tom Hanks made it work to be an interesting film, and for most of the time a quiet one- and it's not easy for a film to be both interesting AND quiet so yes good job Cast Away.
