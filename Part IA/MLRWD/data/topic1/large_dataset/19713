I saw this film many years ago, and when it finally arrived on DVD, I knew I wanted it as part of my collection.  Excellent screenplay, with an well chosen cast to complete a heartfelt story of a quaker family just prior to the civil war.  A beautiful music score that truly enhanced a well acted film.  The only downside was that the film was not released in stereo, and the quality as far as the audio was bland.  This was odd since stereo in motion pictures was first released in 1953 with the film The Robe.  Afterwards films were released left and right with this new format, since the fifties brought us numerous musicals.  Even so, if it were not released in actual stereophonic sound, it could have been enchanced for better quality.  This is true of much older films, such as How Green Was My Valley in the early fortys.  Rent this film, and you will be amazed at how they were able to take the music score and separate all the instruments so you would swear this was originally released in stereo, at a time it was unknown.  At any rate that is my only complaint.  The film itself is truly worth watching with the whole family. They don't make them like this anymore. Five Stars!!!
