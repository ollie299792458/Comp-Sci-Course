I am not a very fancy art lover, who spends 30 minutes gazing at the out of focus paintings of monet and trying to come up with some feelings towards it( I tried, and couldn't, to the disappointment of my date!!), I am however, an amateur photographer, I dabble in terms such as Aperture, lighting, kind of a junior. I got interested in Kubrick work when I bought 2001 on blu ray, the equisite depiction of space, and shots of the moon surface were captivating, so I started looking at some of his other work, until I stumbled upon this one.
This is by far the best cinematography I have ever seen, as a matter of fact, Kubrick used a special lense built by Carl Ziess for NASA apollo moon exploration program, with the incredible 0.7 F stop, highest ever used in film history ( up until now no film maker has even tried to use that lense). Certain scenes Kubrick uses three candels to light the entire scene, thats it, a perfect work of art.
This movie is like gazing at the monalisa, and then all of the sudden she starts talking an acting. Actors walk out of portraits on the wall to interact and have a dialog. As with all Kubrick movies, you need to watch it more than once to discover it more. first time I rented this, I was bored within 45 minutes ( most of the story is about some british royalty wearing tight pants), Then four months later I re rented it just to look at the candle scene( I muted the sound), I was debating whether I should buy it or wait for the Blu Ray to come out, but finally I said this is something I need in my personal collection. Definitely a captivating display of images.
If I ran the guggenhiem, I would take off all the Monet and van gogh paintings on the wall, and post frames from this movie up there.
