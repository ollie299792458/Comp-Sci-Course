Here's how I saw the movie.

During the first 10 minutes of my very first time watching it I thought "Oh, lovely! A movie about a bunch of queers"!  After another  20-30 minutes I thought "Well, they aren't doing anything too weird. This movie isn't too bad".  The last part of the movie was "I hope these poor guys do alright. They aren't having much luck so far".

I've seen it like 15 times already and it's one of my favorite movies. It isn't about three drag queens (OK, two queens and a tranny) at all. It's about three interesting people trying to get across 1,000,000 miles of the Outback Desert. These guys are very likable and you really start to care about them.

Oh yeah, for those of you who don't care for guys dressing like women* there's one character who's a Hot Chick Stripper.

All in all a very good movie and the scenery is amazing!
