You got Casino and you got Goodfellas. They are both great movies, but in the world of mafia movies The Godfather is the best of its genre and the best in movie history. Godfather 2 was one of the top 10 movies of all time for me. But nothing compares to the original, first Godfather. This movie is a masterpiece of enormous proportions. Marlon Brando plays in one of his best performances of his life. Ultimately what he is known for as, Don Corleone. Al Pacino puts in his best performance of his career. This movie has so many scenes that are classic. Some of the most brilliant scenes are the baptism scene during the end, and the dinner at the Italian restaurant with Solozzo. I'd name more classic scenes, but I'd run out of room. Plus, the thing that I love about the Godfather is its blend of the family and crime. This movie makes you realize that indeed criminals are bad people, but in their own merits, have hearts. This movie has many one-liners that never get old. "I'm gonna make him an offer that he can't refuse", "Monday, tuesday, thursday, wednesday", "Sleepin with the fishes" "One day, and that day may never come. I may call upon you to do a service for me...." "Going to the mattresses" and many more are just some of the classic one-liners from this movie. Francis Ford Coppola could not have done a better job with this movie. The acting, the story, the screenplay, everything, is great. If you haven't seen this movie ,you're probably the only person on the planet that hasn't, see it now!! Better yet buy the Godfather DVD Collection.
