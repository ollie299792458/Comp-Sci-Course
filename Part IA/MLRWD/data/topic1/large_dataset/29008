I initially saw this movie simply because I love the medieval era and nearly everything associated with it.  I wasn't too sure whether the 80's soundtrack would work well with this type of movie, however I was soon convinced of the pure genius of it.  It is basically a Cinderella story of a poor boy who becomes a knight.  What surprised me was how humor was woven into the movie and how it's scenes were phenomenal (although that may be just because I love the medieval era).  This movie did have one area which I actually hated.  It took place at a dance where our hero is put on the spot to dance.  He begins dancing with our fair lady and the music is of that age, but then, of all times to switch it to another style of music, it switches to some horrible 80's song and all the dancers begin to do modern dances.  I feel that the modern dancing in a movie such as this ruined that particular scene.  Otherwise, the humor is wonderful, the storyline better, and the ending is of course well worth it.  Other than that one bad scene, it's definitely worth the buy.  I haven't bought it yet, (due to budget constraints), but it's on my personal to-do list.
