This movie is a classic....  It took every sacred cow and idea of political correctness and burned it like a fine steak.  You find yourself laughing at things that in polite society people just don't laugh at.  I have read the other reviews that put down this "30th Anniversary Special Edition".  But if your buying any movie for the added commentaries, I'd say don't buy the movie.  Blazing Saddles Needs no Commentaries, the movie says it all.... either you'll love it, or you'll be offended by it.  If your offended by it well no amount of talking by Mel Brooks will change that.  But if you get it.... if you really get the joke, then you will spend the whole time laughing histerically like I did.  There is really no need to have some long winded commentary.

So in short while I might even agree with the person who didn't like the Commentary part of this edition.  I purchased my copy for the MOVIE.  And I was not disappointed.  Again, plan to either laugh until you pee yourself... or to be offened.
