I chose the movie, How to lose a guy in 10 days, to review.  I was very impressed by the movie.  It is a cute, romantic comedy that I can watch over and over again.  The plot of this movie was very funny, interesting and showed creativity.  Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson), a writer for a magazine in New York City, has to write an article on how to lose a guy in ten days, using the mistakes women frequently make to drive men away.  Benjamin Berry (Matthew McConaghey), an advertising executive, makes a bet with a few co-workers that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days, if he wins the bet, he will get a huge account from his firm.  Although the ending was very predictable, it was cute.  The stars, Hudson and McConaghey, are partially what made this movie a success.  They have great chemistry on screen and both are hilarious.  Hudson kept me wondering what crazy things she was going to do next to drive McConaghey away.  My favorite scene is when Hudson and McConaghey sing their own version of the song "You're so vain," it is so funny.  I think all of the things Hudson did to drive McConaghey away are hilarious and the way McConaghey reacted to the way she was acting is so funny and kept me interested in the movie. I admit, when I first went to see the movie, I thought it was going to be a sappy love movie, but it is not at all.  Although, it is a romantic movie in a way, the comedy keeps it less emotional and corny.  It makes you want to laugh at one time and then it is so sweet the next minute.  I love it! As a whole, I really enjoyed this movie and I would definitely recommend it to others.
