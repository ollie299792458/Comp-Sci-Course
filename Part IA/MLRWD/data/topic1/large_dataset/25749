Here we go again, Uwe Suck rapes another cool horror game, talk about being a real-life legend killer. Kristanna Loken who played the wooden T-X in Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines plays a wooden and boring version of Bloodrayne.

All I can say is this film is about Rayne is after Ben Kingsley for killing her mother. Revenge never tasted so bland. I can't believe Michael Madsen stared in this crap-fest, is he trying to kill his career after it was saved by Quentin Tarantino? Michelle Rodriguez already has a bad record in life, I guess she wants to add I did a Uwe Suck film in her record.

All these actors in this film and they all act like drunks on the set. This film is boring, bad acted, bad visuals, bad editing...it's bad everything. It looks like a poor Sci-Fi Channel original film.

If you wanna watch BloodRayne, just watch yourself playing the game on the Playstation 2 and XBOX. Sorry, BloodRayne, you're now a victim on Uwe Suck's video game killing list.
