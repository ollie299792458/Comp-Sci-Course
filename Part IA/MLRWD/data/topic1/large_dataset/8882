I am sorry but I get so tired of the poor reviews so many critics write about films such as this movie that are pure enjoyment and entertainment. This movie is just that kind of movie...there is never a dull moment and isn't that part of what movies are all about. Sandra Bullock is perfect for this role and while the premise sounds a little lame before you see the movie after seeing it I think anyone will be pleasantly surprised. If you are expecting an Oscar style movie...no you won't get it. If you are expecting to laugh alot and be entertained...you will be. This movie is totally delightful and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is funny, light, laughable. I loved it and I think anyone else will too if you allow yourself to jsut be entertained. Bullock is so funny and so great at this type of movie and she learns allot about herself throughout the film so there is character growth too. It will also give you a new appreciation for what the women in beauty pageants put themselves through. Bottom line...THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE!!
