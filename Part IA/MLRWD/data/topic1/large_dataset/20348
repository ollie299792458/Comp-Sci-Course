This is a comedy with wit and heart.
When the cast and crew of a Hollywood film are run out of one small town for the "fetish" of the lead actor (Baldwin) they must quickly relocate to yet another SmallTown USA.
They are assailed almost immediately by the townfolk, who want a part in the film. The director has his hands full meeting and greeting people, trying to get the movie made on time (and within the budget). The actors are struggling with their own moral dilemas (Baldwin is flirting with disaster in the form of an adoring fan who's just a tad underage and Sarah Jessica Parker doesn't want to show off her breasts in a contractual nude scene because she's found religion). And the poor writer, whose art is being torn apart by actors, producers, and necessity of sets, is just looking for a typewriter to complete the rewrites they're demanding of him.
His quest leads him to a local bookstore, where he finds not only the typewriter, but love, as the woman working the counter turns out to be as intellegent and well read as she is beautiful.
Crisis after crisis ensues, with everything happening around the intersection of State and Main.
When Baldwin is caught with his underage fan, all seems doomed, as the writer is confronted with the moral dilema of having to testify against the star and cancelling the production (and blacklisting himself in Hollywood forevermore) or lying, and losing the affections of the woman he loves.
It all boils down to a surprise ending, that I cannot reveal. All I can say is that this is a film with a great deal of thought behind it, and a brilliant satire of the Hollywood world.
