My wife could not endure this movie!  In fact she gave up on it in the first 15 minutes.  But it intrigued me enormously and so, fortunately, I forged on.  What a little gem.  Sure, it will make you uncomfortable and it will definitely offend many, but it is an extremely well crafted movie that deserves your consideration.

Today, when most movies are pablum, this movie rises above the usual mediocre fare.  It IS an adult movie appealing to adult sensibilities.  Stacy Edwards, as the vulnerable and deaf Christine, gives a spot on performance that, were there ANY justice in the world would have been considered for an Oscar.  Aaron Eckhart, as the ruthless, conniving, and manipulative Chad is, simply, malevolently indelible.  You'll not soon forget either his character or his performance.

This is Neil LaBute's first effort at writing or directing and it will be a tough act to follow.  The performances that he coaxes out of his cast are simply marvelous and his writing was fantastic.

The movie ends with an unexpected twist which both shocks and disgusts the viewer but which manages to intensify the impact of the movie.  At the end, as throughout the movie, Eckhart is the personification of evil and Christine, the embodiment of good.

Both Eckhart's and Stacy Edwards' performances are riveting, but without the hapless Matt Mallory as Howard this morality play would not have been complete.  Mallory's performance was perfectly modulated and delivered to perfection.  Mallory's character is neither good nor totally bad, but weak.  And his weakness leads to all sorts of problems.

I recommend this movie very highly, however I have still not been able to get my wife to see it.
