This DVD contains the feature length pilot that introduced the new DC Comics animated series 'Justice League' from Cartoon Network and the critically acclaimed Bruce Timm. Timm has previously worked on projects such as the hugely influential and Emmy award winning 'Batman: The Animated Series', 'Batman Beyond' and several animated Batman feature lengths. 'Justice League' takes a step back from the dark environment and stories in 'Batman: TAS' and brings a fresh, colourful take on the JLA (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash and Hawk Girl). The series main audience is children but don't let that put you off because there is a lot here for adults that most children wouldn't get and the stories are entertaining. The animation and voice talent is excellent as you would expect from a Bruce Timm show, although Wonder Woman can sound bored or detatched at times. Other than that my only other complaint is that Batman is often away from the action and the rest of the team and has lost some of the dark charm displayed in previous shows and the comic books. The series improved after being sanctioned for a full season with characters and stories both developing but this is a good introduction to the show and is enjoyable for both children and adults, especially comic book fans. The DVD also features character bios and an exclusive web link.
