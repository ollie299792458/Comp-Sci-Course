The Wudang YMAA Taijiquan DVD is one of the best releases ever by the YMAA. The YMAA always produces superior quality books and dvds for martial arts both internal and external- and the Wudang Taijiquan DVD is a shining example. When I first learned that Zhou Xuan Yun of Daoistgate.com was creating a Taijiquan DVD, I immediately pre-ordered a copy. When I recieved it in the mail I found that was a personal lesson with a world-class Gongfu Taijiquan Master. Xuan Yun is simply amazing, and his instruction is absolutely phenomenal. I was especially excited about the DVD because I love Wudang Gonggu, and there is very little published educational material available about it. The instruction and demonstration is of the highest quality, and the Taijiquan sequence is both comprehensive and beautiful. Anyone, whether beginner or master will immediately fall in love with this release.
As a dedicated Martial Artist, I feel very blessed to live in an era where such sacred tradition and teqhnique are freely and openly taught. Zhou Xuan Yun is a wonderful teacher, and I strongly reccomend this DVD to everyone.
