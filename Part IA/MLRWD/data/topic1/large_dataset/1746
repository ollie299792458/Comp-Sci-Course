What really sets this video apart from other stage productions is that it was obviously directed for a video audience. So many other stage productions (Riverdance, for example) are merely filmed during an actual performance, where the cameras have limited access, the sound is generally poor and the lighting designed for the theater audience rather than the home viewer. Not so with Joseph! This production is clearly directed specifically for the home viewer - it looks and sounds wonderful.
Donny Osmond is a likeable Joseph and Maria Friedman, a huge talent, is absolutely perfect as the Narrator.
The musical, a pop opera, is brilliantly concieved by Rice and Webber. The changes in musical styles to fit the various dramatic moods will bring a smile to your lips (especially the depiction of Pharoh - I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it yet. It's almost laugh out loud funny).
The sets, the production numbers, the lighting, the performances, are all top notch. The video is a "must see" for adults and kids alike.
