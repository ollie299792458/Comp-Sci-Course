This wonderful series finishes up by resolving the Lord of Terror arc. When we left off, Urd was possessed by the mysterious entity. Belldandy had removed her power limiter to attempt to save her sister and the world. but h can freely move between and possess other bodies at will, making him impossible to pin down. The Almighty sends down the Valkyrie Lind to kill the Lord of Terror, but as long as he possesses someone that Belldandy cares about, she won't let Lind finish off the Lord of Terror. The way he was finally brought down... well I certainly didn't see it coming.

The final two episodes were specials in Japan, I think. The first involves Urd reverting to her child state and Skuld being advanced to an adult age.  Both of these episodes were nicely done and touching, and seeing chibi-Belldandy AND Aoshima getting more Urd-style punishment makes it even sweeter. Problem is, now all of us AMG fans have to wait until Season 2 is released.

The entire series has been wonderful, with great storylines and beautiful animation and characters, and the final volume is no different. Highly recommended.
