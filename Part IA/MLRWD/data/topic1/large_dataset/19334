Chinatown has been my favorite film since first seeing it seven years ago.  Over the years, my enjoyment has grown with each viewing.  The letterbox edition I recently purchased adds to the already outstanding production  quality with which I was previously aquainted.
This film succeeds on  every asthetic and entertainment level imaginable.  The mood,  characterizations, and pacing are outstanding.  The movie is an omage to a  gone, but not forgotten, film style, while the story and setting  simulateously pay homage to that lost era.  It stands as a hallmark of  modern filmmaking, unparallelled.
I keep wanting to write more and more  about this film I adore so much, but the highest praise cannot do justice  to this movie.  Not everyone will enjoy it.  The ending will alienate many  viewers.  Each moment draws you into the story, like a hypnotic trance, and  then the ending is as unnerving as anything ever put on celluloid.
I  encourage everyone to see several, "mandatory" films; Casablanca,  Citizen Kane, It's a Wonderful Life, The Apartment, Schindler's List, The  Seventh Seal.  This stands alongside, if not above, any of them.
Other  greats in this style are The Third Man, The Maltese Falcon, and The Big  Sleep.  The French Connection is a giant step down in quality, but decent.  It carries a similar style with similar themes and is from the same era,  the 70's.
