Jesus of Montreal is a multidimensional masterfully narrated story of an actor Daniel Coulombe whose great talent and dedication to art lead him to take his role of Jesus Christ as an alter ego, which gradually takes over his own personality. The spiritual transformation happens not only to him but also to the artistic crew of volunteering professionals recruited by him for the performance of a religious play. The play - originally written by a Catholic priest and a friend of Daniel - is altered by Daniel through a firsthand interpretation of the New Testament in the light of the recent historical evidence. The firsthand interpretation just as that of Jan Hus or St Francis invites censure of the Catholic Church. (After all, from the point of view of the institutionalized faith any personal faith is a heresy.) The play is banned and Daniel Coulombe with his disciples repeats the fate of Jesus in a modern and slightly comic setting. This gives a very strong flavor of irony to the film. Although all the issues touched are extremely sensitive, Denys Arcand's rendering of them is so anaesthetized that there is no pain associated with the relentlessly truthful depiction of the humanity and its faith. It is as if we are kept in a cradle of love set sailing through the ocean of misery.
