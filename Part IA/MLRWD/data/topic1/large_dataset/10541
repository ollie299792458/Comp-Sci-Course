Harvey Milk's political career only lasted 11 months but his impact continues to resonate 26 years after his death.

Watching this Greek drama unfold during the 1970s one can only imagine how Milk would react to gay and lesbians emergence in the mainstream. Although his time was short, he can justiably be cited as an influence in the fight for gay rights.

For those of us who were not aware of him during his lifetime, Milk's charisma is apparent to the viewers of this film. One can understand why the city of San Francisco was enveloped in grief after Milk and George Moscone's murders and can only wonder what might have been had they lived. I challenge anyone to try not to tear up watching the scenes of the march after their deaths.

The film is powerful enough where one even feels sorry for Dan White, an individual who was in over his head against more politically saavy opponents.

Because this DVD was released during the film's 20th anniversary, my main complaint is why doesn't the special features give an update on some of the supporting characters. Rather than listen to the director and editor drone on in the commentary about how certain scenes were shot with natural light, I would have preferred updated information on people such as Jim Elliot (A seemingly unlikely supporter of someone like Milk. The commentators could have let us know, is he still alive?), Sally Gearhart, Jeannine Yeomans, Tory Hartmann and others.

Other than that, I give this film a high reccomendation.
