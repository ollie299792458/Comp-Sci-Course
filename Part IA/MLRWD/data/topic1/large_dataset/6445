I have loved this movie since I first saw it.  And I have now seen it many times over a 15 yr period.  I usually can't even watch most movies more than once, but this one enchants me every time.  It was a real sleeper when it first came out in theaters and it's been that way ever since.  I kind of wish they'd given it a more memorable title.  The scenes in this movie are burned into my memory and I still laugh at the same things each time I watch it again.  I agree with the other reviewer who said if you liked Northern Exposure, with its quirky locals, you'll like this movie.  I think also if you liked the movie Arthur or similar movies with odd,funny and memorable characters, you'll also like this movie. I too often have told people its among my all time favorites and gotton a blank stare.  Very few people know of it.  But its up there on my favorites list along with Arthur, Life is Beautiful, Like Water for Chocolate, Tampopo, The Green Mile, The Sixth Sense, As Good as It Gets, and many others of much more recent vintage.  I wish more people would view it and introduce their friends and family to it. It's full of British humor yet American sensibilities at the same time.  At times its almost Monty Pythonish, but more subtle.  It does make you laugh.  It's worth owning and watching over and over again.  In the same way as  Breakfast at Tiffany's, Casablanca, and It's a Wonderful Life, this is a movie to cherish. It's a pure delight.
