Any movie of this genre is by definition already a mediocre film, and the makeup, dialogue, (and in this film the sound synchronization) work well to preserve the stereotype. Because of this, it easy to overlook the film's real highlights.

As a cultural artifact this film is pretty progressive. The elements of sex and gore are surprisingly avant-garde for 1959 and still remain very effective. The plot is also very concrete, as the film doesn't bite off more than it can chew. However, probably the greatest highlight is the cinematography. The driving scene in the beginning uses cameras planted low to the ground on the sides of the car, and really give a sense of the winding course and speed of the car and the sudden shock of the accident. A steep-sloping camera angle soon afterward emphasizes the difficulty the Doctor faces walking up the long staircase to his front door. Handheld, unfocused cameras communicate a feeling of dizziness with amazing effectiveness in a later scene where the doctor druggs the model with sleeping pills. Also, the use of lighting in the dance club scenes are particularly interesting.

This film breaks a lot of interesting ground, but the sophisticated aspects of this film are eclipsed by the unprofessional nature of the genre itself. Perhaps this is the wrong kind of movie for the right kind of director.
