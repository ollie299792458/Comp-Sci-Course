If you have ever REALLY been in love, or wanted to be, you will relate like a bulls-eye to this film. I can't think of one thing that could be changed to improve this movie, and I can't say that about any other film.

The devotion of a mother to a husband lost in war, a little boy to an art and to the provider of that art. A town to the images from a far off and very different world. Then this little boy becomes a man constantly looking for the devotion from a woman, that ideal love he discovers from collecting film edits over many years. In life, he can only find love and devotion in the images on a screen.

There is great joy and great regret, the director and writer play your emotions like a drum.

Don't miss this, buy it, give it to people you love or to someone who needs to understand the difference between love and simple lust or infatuation. You laugh and you cry, I'm a guy hardened by the bumps in life and it brought tears streaming down my face. Get this, I have a number of different copies, but on Super Bowl Sunday, it was shown on TCM, and I found myself unable to turn the channel to the game, it's that special and engrossing.

Enjoy,
