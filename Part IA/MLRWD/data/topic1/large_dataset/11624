This is a timeless tale of a novice nun named Maria (Julie Andrews) who is sent to be a governess for the seven von Trapp children. Their father, the autocratic widowed Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), is big on authority and discipline; he uses whistles to call them, has them line up by age, wear uniforms, etc. But the arrival of the freewheeling Maria changes all of that. She introduces spirit, fun, and best of all music back into the house. The true tearjerker is when the Captain joins his children in singing the title song to the Baroness (Eleanor Parker). She not only captures the hearts of his seven children, but ends up capturing the captain's heart as well. The attraction is immediate, but it's not until later in the movie that the attraction is realized with the breathtaking 'Laendler'. That does not, however, mean it's not present. Try the scene where Maria and the Captain are yelling at each other- can you say sexual tension? The impending Anschluss adds an element of danger to the story, and the acerbic Baroness keeps the story from being too sugary.

I am a definite devotee of this film. Christopher Plummer makes a dashing Captain, Richard Haydn is an irreverent Max Dettweiler, and Eleanor Parker gives another splendid performance as the Baroness.

But it's Julie Andrews who steals the show. She *is* Maria, wholly and completely. With her breathtaking voice and superb acting skills, she takes this glorious film to a whole new dimension. This film is without a doubt the best musical ever made.
