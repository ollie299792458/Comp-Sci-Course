Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window" is my favourite movie of all time, so I was thrilled to find that Universal were releasing it as one of their magnificent Collector's Edititon. Let there be no doubt about the cinematic qualities of this feature, this movie is what it is all about! If you must buy one DVD this year, let it be this one. It doesn't get any better than this. Having said that, I would like to comment on the technical quality of this "Collector's Edition." This is the one negative aspect that I could find. The extra material is very good, however, taking into consideration the many difficulties  that the restoration team encountered while trying to save this movie, I (for one, at least) would have liked to see more about how it was actually restored. And why wasn't the 2000 re-release trailer included, when you can find it on the Internet? Also, I miss a separate audio track with  commentaries from the cast and crew, not to mention the restoration team, led by James C. Katz and Robert A. Harris.  And finally, and this is single most important issue in connection with this release, why did they make such a lousy transfer of the movie itself? It looks like it was made in ten minutes or something. Maybe a new THX certified transfer would be preferable for subsequent releases of this movie, i.e. on the second edition of this DVD. In my opinion the "Vertigo" Laserdisc edition looked sharper and had less noise than this DVD version of "Rear Window." And I think that they did a wonderful job with the "Vertigo" DVD transfer, so I don't understand why this one needs to look so second-rate. Really, this doesn't change anything, though, you should still buy at least three copies of this movie! They don't make movies like this anymore.
