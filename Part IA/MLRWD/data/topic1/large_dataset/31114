I've always been a huge fan of the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull, so initially I was skeptical of this soundtrack, worrying that it may get in the way of the message of the book.  Although I've never seen the movie which the music was designed for, this album keeps pace with the "Endless Human Potential" message of the book.

Neil Diamond should be very proud of this work, because as other reviewers have stated, it really has the ability to withstand the test of time and even gain new listeners from the my cynical "generation Y".  I go to sleep with it playing almost every night at college, and even during the day when I'm trying to work on stuff.  It seems to be catching on, because I always have people ask me questions like, "who sings that?", "what's it called?", "where's it from?", and now I have managed to make most in my dorm a believer in "the gull" if you will.

Overall, its perfect music that curtails itself to any atmosphere, and that's hard to find.  (as of right now, I believe the lowest rating on the reviews here was a 4 star, and that too is a testament to the greatness of the album)
