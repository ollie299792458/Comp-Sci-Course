It is about time this series was released. What a wonderful series. Ron Harper and James Naughton were perfect as the (blond and brunette a la Starsky and Hutch ) astronaut duo. I wish they would bring the series back and put Mr. Harper and Mr. Naughton  back to work as the astronauts. They are plenty young enough! How great that Roddy Mcdowell (Galen) chose to do the series. Booth Coleman (Zaius) and Mark Lenard (General Urko) were marvelous, also. Some of the guest stars (William Smith, Marc Singer, Sandra Locke, etc.) were fantastic to watch. There was great action and a great plot on every show. There was also a moral message with each show which was nice to see. The wonderful series is everything I remember as a child. This series should have lasted at least several seasons. The DVD quality is great and 20th Century Fox is to be commended for bringing this series to all past, present, and future Apes fans. My children love it. Now if Hasbro would only make action figures based on the series like Mego did in the 1970's. I recommend this series to everyone.
