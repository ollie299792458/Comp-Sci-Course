I thought this movie was outstandingly done. It had a great directer (W.S. Anderson) and great actors (Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodruiguez, and more). The crew worked very hard on the set and i'd have to say they did a fantastic job with the low budget that they had. The underground facility was magnificant and done all very well. The zombie make-up creator was brilliant and made the other zombie movies look like 80's movies (no offense). The suspenseful parts really made me jump, like when you think the people are really survivors, you put your arm around them and get a chunk clean right out of you. The first zombie really freaked me out, she was really well done and played a good, fairly short part, LOL, credit to the make-up artist. While watching the movie I came across the first undead scene and heard some really great Manson. Manson's scores were really well done and went along with the movie really well. Like the undead scene I was talking about, the SWAT team scene when they first enter, and even the childish waltzing music of when they find the Red Queen. Overall this movie is my favorite movie of all time, cant wait till the sequal. I own it on DVD and love the extra features (zombie make-up tests, commentary by actors and director, the making of Resident Evil, scene selection, etc.) If you have not seen this movie, rent it now, you will not be dissapointed. The other reviews sound pretty dissapointing, but it isnt as bad as they say it is. It is deffinitly a saturday night classic, haha. Credit to a wonderful Director, Outstanding crew, and Amazing actors, GOOD JOB ALL!
