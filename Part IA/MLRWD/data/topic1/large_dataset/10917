Not only is this a great example of the kind of stylish, elemental period thriller that Hollywood is utterly incapable of making, it's great fodder for examination of race issues in pre-psycehedelic England. Sting once said that Jimi Hendrix was the first black man he ever saw in the flesh, and with that in mind I was struck by the way the image of the black man is used in this film (voodoo ritual scenes complete with frantic bongo drumming) to convey that telling combination of evil and exoticism. When Hendrix hit the London scene - around the same time this film was made - he was described as the "Wild Man of Borneo", with the same overtones: frightening but sexy. Whether you see this as racist or just an expression of repressed sexuality - or both - is for armchair sociologists to decide. In retrospect, the portrayal seems less overtly racist than just kind of naive, the last gasp of an uptight culture about to get "Experienced" by Lucy in the Sky, Satanic Majesties, Tommy and the rest.

 That said, this movie is a great yarn that accomplishes what horror directors can't do anymore: write a script that knows when to take itself seriously and when not to. Modern horror films just push the plausibility envelope to the point of stupidity, and overwhelm themselves with special effects. Movies like POTZ have a great sense of pacing and perspective, with just the right amount of this here and that there. Am I making sense? Just watch the movie and you'll see what I mean!
