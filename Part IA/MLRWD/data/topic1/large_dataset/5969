"The Zen of Screaming" is a pretty good instructional video. Others have dismissed it as one big advertisement, but I think that's unfair.
To be sure, a lot of the "Melissa's so cool" sections could've been cut out. But, the video does have a plethora of good ideas and exercises that are readily applicable to singing or screaming.
It includes techniques on breathing, how to use your diaphragm to increase your power without messing up your vocal chords, voice maintenance tips, etc.
Another gripe is that the brief snippets where they cut to a live show, and the music bits that introduce each segment are WAY TOO LOUD when compared to the speaking voice of Melissa and the participants. It gets annoying.
I recommend taking notes as you watch, that way you can keep those tips and exercises handy.
The audio CD is very good, except I think most of the exercises are too quick. She should've extended them a bit more.
 In short, while this is certainly far from perfect, you will learn very useful things that will definitely help you be a singer with more control, and avoid injury.
