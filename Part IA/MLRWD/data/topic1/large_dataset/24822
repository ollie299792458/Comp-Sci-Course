First, this is a film adaptation of a Clive Cussler novel.  Clive's novels are not Tolstoy, Steinbeck, or F. Scott Fitzgerald.  They are adventure, action novels - more James Bond, than James Thurber.  And so the action and scenary, take on more impact than the characters and plot, not to say that there isn't a plot.  Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConauchey) has more background and interesting quirks than James Bonds, and his side kick/ buddy Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), romantic interest and protagonist Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) round out of the good guys, with William H. Macy as Admiral Sandecker.  The bad guys include both the classic mercenary industrialist and authoritarian small country dictator.  The film opens at the end of the American Civil War, with the final sailing of a Confederate ironclads, and continues on to Saharan Africa.  Special effects do not dominate the film nor are they so noticeable until you view the special features on the DVD.  It is a classic Hollywood action/adventure film populated with heroes and villians, not anti-heroes and neurotics.  Red-blooded adventure, taking no prisoners, and keeping the romance light.  Ends with a bang, not a song (like Ishtar)!
