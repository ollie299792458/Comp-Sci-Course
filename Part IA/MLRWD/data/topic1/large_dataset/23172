Watching the commercials for this movie, I was sure it was going to be one of the funniest movies I would see this year. I was wrong!
Steve Martin plays a lawyer who is looking for love after divorcing with his wife because he was always too busy at work. He thinks he's going to meet a gorgeous blonde lawyer, but instead he gets the shock of his life- Charlotte!(Queen Latifah)
It's funny how persistent Charlotte is, like how she throws a party inside his house, etc. She gets along great with his two kids. But sometimes I felt like the comedy was more titled toward to the R rating than PG-13.
There are some references to sex, alchohol, etc. and the comedy is very racist. If you think this is a flick the whole family will enjoy, I'd have to stop you there. It's probably suited for ages 14+.
This just teaches you to not always follow the commercials.
Bringing Down the House is very funny, but isn't worth buying. I'd rent it at blockbuster or whereever if I was you.
Overall, this movie is worth watching though! It's funny, heartwarming, and You'll LOVE IT!
