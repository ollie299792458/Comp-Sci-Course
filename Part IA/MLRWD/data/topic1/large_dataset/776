Not only does Used Cars capture the wicked vein running through the U.C. salesman, but it is perfect Zeitgeist (like Jake and Elwood's Bluesmoble) documenting a generation the only way it could be documented; the end of the crazy 70s and its reckless gas guzzler, the all-or-nothing attitude or lets run for the 80's. Yea Jack Warden and Kurt Russell were'nt acting; Russell having just expired from a Disney contract, Warden simply GREAT. Every line is permeated with little white lies in a dialogue driven toward not one truth. My favorite is the exchange the morning after Luke was run out of town (hahaha) between the three salesman and the dog. "Well your gonna have to talk a little louder, uh, he's not here."  Yea Russell's Earp falls short. Garrett Graham and the rest of the characters are almost better in support. If you have even the barest sense of humor, this baby revs. Also, lets not forget the cameo by Lenny and Sqiggy. This film is one of the great ones. And remember 50 bucks never killed anyone.
