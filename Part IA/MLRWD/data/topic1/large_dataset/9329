I'll be the first to admit that "The Vow" is not a prime example of cinematic genius or anything, but I think most viewers who choose to watch it will get out of it what they want- an inspiring love story with two good-looking actors and some very romantic and sad scenes.

The story follows Leo (played by Channing Tatum) who has a whirlwind romance with Paige (Rachel McAdams). In a freak winter accident, Paige flies through the windshield of a car and wakes from a coma with the past five years of her life completely forgotten due to amnesia. She has no idea how her life has changed so dramatically from the time that she remembers, and she has no recollection of her love for Leo. Though discouraged by Paige's family and friends, Leo is determined to remind his wife how and why she fell in love with him.

I thought the chemistry between the two central characters was great. Channing Tatum has come a long way from his Step Up years. While the concept was interesting, the true story of the couple the movie is based on- Kim and Krickitt Carpenter- is quite amazing and I recommend reading about them after watching this movie.
