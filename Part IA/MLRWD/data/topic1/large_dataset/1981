"Waking Life" was beautiful,philosophical,inspirational and a little surprising. I felt like I was watching a lecture on existensialism, with the speaker being a 7-11 checkout guy who had one too many Slurpees and was using his sugar buzz as an excuse to poetically smother his customers. A mix of artistic innovation and theatrical self-examination, it is a cartoon like journey through our imagination that is definately worth experiencing. Visually, each frame of film was a work of art in and of itself. If our subconscious mind is without boundary, then why can't our conscious lives be without limitation? "Waking Life" seems to ask that very question and by doing so inspires the audience to look within themselves and Wake UP! It is a grand collage of art and personal philosophies that dreams its way towards revelation for every second of 90 minutes. Overall, the only weakness to me was the casting choice of Charles Gunning, the teenage protaganist. He was very meak and uninteresting as a lead character. He reminded me of one of those museum tour guides who is so boring that he is completely ignored up until the moment someone gets lost and needs directions to the gift shop. He was obviously chosen this way intentionally so as not to distract the audience from all the "meaning of life" speeches that were constantly tossed out at us. Nonetheless, groundbreaking and a must-see!
