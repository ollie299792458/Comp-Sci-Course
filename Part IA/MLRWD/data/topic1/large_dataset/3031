Once you get over the shock of seeing Ghandi's evil alter-ego swearing, prowling and generally spreading menace, it becomes all too clear that Sexy Beast is a shallow, lowest common denominator heist flick, that looks to cash in on the strong returns of other recent Brit-gangster movies. As in the unbelievably overrated Snatch, the presence of strong, exaggerated cockney accents and an endless stream of profanity and violence seem to constitute both the plot and humour of this supposed 'dark' comedy. What is hilarious is hearing critics like Peter Travers fawn over the 'deadly, and darkly comic, duel of wits' between Logan (Ben Kingsley) and Gary (Ray Winstone.) Apparently lines such as "Tell me you'll do it," "No I won't", "Yes you...will!" constitute sharp dialogue and edge-of-seat tension. For me, hearing Kingsley say "Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes!" over and over again leads to irritation followed quickly by boredom. Any semblance of a plot is largely absent, and it was hardly surprising to find out that first time director, Jonathan Glazer, used to make music videos. Like Guy Ritchie and David Fincher, Glazer relies on video-clip trickery, rarely keeping the camera still for more than several seconds at a time, except when focusing in on Kingsley's menacing stare. Such effects are of course necessary, lest the glaring lack of plot and well-constructed dialogue be exposed.
