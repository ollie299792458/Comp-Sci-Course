I purchased this with only having seen the trailer.

Having seen Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle I had no hesitation in buying this.

This movie has the same theme running through like his previous movies someone poor just trying to get by.
In this case a father just trying to all he can for his son by sending him to a private school while living in an abandoned building, and scraping by.
UFO sightings start to appear in his area, but seem like a hoax.
While rummaging through a waste dump looking for shoes or anything useful he finds a strange ball, which he presents his son.
The ball turns out to be more than what he expected and will change their life.

Do not expect to see as much crazy cgi visuals as in the previous movies, they are there but not nearly as much.
This is more of a story about a father and his son, how they love each other, fight over his school work and the father wanting only the best for his son.

It has some great moments and well worth purchasing.
