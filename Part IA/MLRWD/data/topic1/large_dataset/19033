This movie did not get the pre-release hype it deserved.  While many reviewers have commented on its similarities to Risky Business, those similarities are only superficial.  Yes, this is a teen romantic comedy.  Yes, it has at its central characters an all American adolescent guy and a hot girl with a sex industry worker past.  And, yes, the opening romantic musical theme sounds a lot like "Love on a Real Train - Risky Business", probably because the original music was done by Paul Haslinger, who was a member of Tangerine Dream for most of their memorable music soundtracks (but not a member of the band when they did the soundtrack for Risky Business).  That is where the similarities end, however.

Where Risky Business was about getting out of trouble caused by being smitten with a prostitute, The Girl Next Door was about voluntarily getting into trouble because of genuine love for a girl that just happened to be an ex Porn star.  As far as movies about being young, in love, and under pressure go, they don't get much better than this.  I really liked this movie, however I can't imagine why the DVD is rated UR as opposed to R.  My guess is that with any imaginative editing, at all, it could have easily been rated PG-13.  It certianly doesn't push the boundaries in the other direction (toward NC17).  If you were ever young you probably will really like this movie.
