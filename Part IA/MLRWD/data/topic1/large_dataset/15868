C'est arriv&eacute; pr&egrave;s de chez vous (Man Bites Dog) is a mocumentary (fake-documentary) from Belgium, released in 1992.  It is a masterpiece.  Some people just don't like it, and you wonna know why?  It's because they  probably don't have the mind to understand what it is about.  From what  I've seen, I think the film isn't about one particular subject.  That's why  some people feel cheated.  That's how I thought the first time I saw it.  But I guess the film is aimed at how all human beings are the same.  If  they're poor, rich, black, white, young, old, nice, mean, helper, or  killer.  The main character, Benoît Poelvoorde, is a serial killer.  He  kills for money, and for pleasure.  Basically, all that is done in the film  is the crew hangs around Poelvoorde.  When you're watching, you'll probably  say "This is boring, all we're watching is his everyday life.  It's  boring."  And that is very true.  All you're doing is watching what he  does in his everyday life, which is boring.  Very boring.  But at the same  time, you find yourself attached to your seat.  I don't know why I was, and  you probably won't know why you were either.  What this film taught me was  that there are two sides to every single person.  Benoît Poelvoorde was a  cold-hearted, $h!+ talking, serial killer, yet at times he seems like your  best friend, like you know him so well.  And that's what the film is about.  No matter how bad a person is, they're still a human.  You find so much  incommmon and uncommon with eachother.  And that's what the film is aimed  at.  It's about nothing, but there's a purpose and lesson to it.  I'm 15,  and it's rated NC-17, so I watched this film illegally, but if you're a  parent, and your child is used to seeing blood, let them see it, they'll  like it just as much as I did.  It's not a family movie, but it's a  learning movie.
