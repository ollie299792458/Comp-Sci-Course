I love direct to DVD horror movies. I don't go in expecting much, and I can just enjoy the film for what it is. However, when a movie goes to the theater, I expect something more, something that makes it worth the cost to watch. Thank goodness I saw this on HBO and didn't have to buy theater tickets, or even rent it. I would have been much more disappointed than I am.

The movie plot is very horror basic. Without offering too many spoilers, a troubled family moves to a small town and into an odd house everyone else shuns. Suddenly, the youngest member of the family, a small boy, is troubled by unseen forces, and his older sister must find a way to not only save him but her family.

Anna Paquin plays the older sister, and while normally a talented young actress, she isn't given a chance to do much in the film other than run around without a proper bra. All the actors hand in sub-par performances which does nothing to help a poor script and boring special effects.

There are tons of great horror movies out there, both classic and modern. Silent Hill, Tod Browning's Freaks, Tales From the Crypt- the list is endless if you want some nice horror on DVD. But don't waste your time or money watching this. It would be bad even if it were direct, it's criminal it ever made theater.

Not recommended unless you really need something to help you sleep.
