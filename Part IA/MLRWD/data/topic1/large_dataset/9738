A stunningly disappointing outing for Messrs. Wahlberg, Phoenix and Gray precisely because we all know - courtesy of 'The Yards' - just what kind of sublime cinema these gentlemen are capable of creating together with the right kind of material.  There are two movies here.  The first is a well-crafted, character-driven drama focused on what are, admittedly, somewhat hackneyed themes -  a family torn by the tensions between the tearaway black sheep of the family living on the fringes of gangland and his strait-laced cop brother and father.  This movie, which ends around the half-way mark following a cleverly innovative car chase, and which is almost worth watching if only for Ms. Mendes's breathtaking decolletage, is replaced by something which even Steven Seagal might have turned his nose up at unless he was short the price of a large pastrami sandwich.  Stretches belief I know but trust me.  Even my Better Half, who can quite happily watch David Caruso in 'CSI:Miami' for days on end without so much as a snigger, was convulsed with uncontrollable giggles at the laughable quality of both script and acting in the last 30 minutes.

After what was an almost Oscar-worthy turn in 'The Departed' a couple of years back, Mark Wahlburg seems to have decided that a paycheck is a paycheck.  Toward the end of the movie he sits in the passenger seat of a police car with his head resting on the window, eyes drained of all emotion.  One can only imagine that he has suddenly realized just how terrible the script is.  Oh and Eva, Eva, Eva.......We love you but you have to start checking the scripts first rather than going straight to the costume department.

If you have to spend the money, spend it on a copy of 'The Yards'.
