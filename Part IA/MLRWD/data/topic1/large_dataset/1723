I (partially) agree with the Amazon reviewer: "It seemed like a good idea in 1973: a musical scored by Donovan about the life and times of St. Francis of Assisi, the passionate ascetic who expressed love for God by loving nature. But the finished product was something else. Filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli (Endless Love) makes a decorous effort at communicating the ideals of Francis and even tweaking the character toward flower-power relevance. But the result is feel-good fluff, a boring movie that doesn't penetrate its subject as much as reinvent him toward a modern bias. Graham Faulkner is entirely forgettable in the lead, and Donovan's songs on this project aren't exactly first-rate, either. --Tom Keogh"
HOWEVER - even though this is not the best interpretation of St. Francis, and the music is, indeed, too hippie and forgettable, one has to understand that this movie is created in the same period and with the same thoughts as Romeo and Juliet.
It is still a powerful film - maybe I am biased by the fact that Francis is my favorite saint and I will never get tired of him - even though this view is somewhat superficial compared with others.
The sequence with the pope is incredibly powerful. Better than the rest of the movie, and it makes me think how good this movie would have been if it would have been built the way the last sequence was built! I am still recommending it and giving it the whole five stars.
