I am a movie connoisseur and I love THE EXORCIST. However, many do not. A good friend of mine hated it and I know of others who do too. I first saw this movie a few years ago because I have always heard of it but never saw it and wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I must have been only sixteen and decided to rent it and watch it alone (so as to not be persuaded of my judgement by a prejudice either way). Anyway, I turned off all the lights when no one was home and started the movie. Well, the music freaked me out from the start but I must admit that the first hour or so is BOR-ING if you aren't into "informational" type horror flicks. I am now (there aren't many of us out there), but wasn't then. So, I liked it. But there is, contrary to belief before actually seeing it for yourself, not much action in the whole movie except for the main exorcism. The main reason the movie scared me is because I am a deeply religious person and I know that that is possible. That sort of thing has happened and does still happen. Reguardless of what people say, it's possible and it touched a sore spot in my psyche. The main reason most people are not fans of THE EXORCIST is, in fact, because most of it is "boring". Is is an old movie and that's another reason why most people don't favor it. Nowadays it's all about blood and guts and don't get me wrong, I love a good blood-bath, but to me, the "ghost" and "demon" type movies are scarier because they are realistic. It depends on your taste if you'll like it. But don't take my word for it, rent it and see for yourself. Happy haunting!
