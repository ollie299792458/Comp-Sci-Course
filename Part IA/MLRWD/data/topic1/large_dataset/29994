Well, look, it's a very silly movie.  If that isn't what you want, then make another choice.  But if you yearn for some light adventure fare, then pop the popcorn and pull up a chair!

Parents have little to fear.  The monsters might be scary to very young children, but the violence here is 50's-style.  One of the big mysteries of Mysterious Island is how a man can be shot or devoured by an insect the size of a house without shedding a drop of blood.

The computer graphics special effects are pretty fake-looking, but so was the Harryhausen stop-motion animation used in the 1961 version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JDRG">Mysterious Island (Widescreen)</a>, and people still love watching that.  The bogus CGI does make the film less frightening, so that's more good news for parents.

It's not exactly an educational film.  One feels compelled to point out that pirate ships don't come equipped with back doors, and that spiders, even giant ones, aren't filled with pistachio pudding.  But all that isn't enough to spoil an afternoon of good clean fun.

Scan the bargain bins of your local discount store.  You might be able to find this film packaged with a copy of Journey to the Center of the Earth (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HMFCT4">Journey to the Center of the Earth with Bonus DVD: Mysterious Island</a>).  I got both together for five bucks!  That's $2.50 for Mysterious Island, which is actually a two-part mini-series.  So if you're like me you'll jump at the chance to get a cheap cheesy monster movie!  Such a bargain!
