This is not a traditional action based war movie. In fact, apart from one mission near the end, it is set entirely on the ground.
However, the film shows the real horrors of war in a matter of fact way that no other film of  the time did. For instance, early on the doctor commenting on a severely  wounded, delirious pilot: "I wouldn't have believed it if I wasn't  looking at it. You can see his brain."
The film dissects various  leadership styles, showing the merits and faults of each - but in a  dramatic way. Col. Davenport, who cares about his men, and gets their  loyalty - but who eventually crumbles under the strain. Hard nosed General  Savage's by the book "they're men - not boys" style - until he  begins to care too much as well. And General Pritchard overlooking it  all.
Henry King knew he had a great script and cast. He basically just  pointed his cameras at the actors and let them get on with it. The film is  full of long one-take scenes. The scene where Savage dresses down Gately  clocks in at some 6 minutes of continuous film with no cuts. 
No  violence. No "lurve" scenes or romance. Just a deeply rewarding  film experience for adults looking for more than mindless action.
