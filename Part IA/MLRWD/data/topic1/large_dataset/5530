First I will say that this film is a must-see; it is a great one.  For some reason, only five copies were made available at my local video store; as a result, this film was unavailable for a good month after it came out because it was constantly rented out.  It appeals to a wide audience on a variety of levels and is just an extremely well-done film.

The film is wonderfully cast.  I was already quite familiar with Shia Lebeouf from the Disney show "Even Stevens" and from the (also great) movie "Holes".  But this movie greatly heightened my appreciation for young Mr. Lebeouf; the movie is quite dramatic and intense and this young actor played the part as if he were Francis Ouimet himself.  The part of Ouimet's caddy, Eddie Lowery, was played by young Josh Flitter.  Flitter's acting shows the same integrity and maturity that his character, Lowery, seems to have had back in 1913 at that US open.  Both performances were A+.

Bill Paxton directed this piece and does an extraordinary job with the cinematography.  We see Harry Vardon mentally shutting all the people around him out as he concentrates on his swing; the people on camera slowly disappear as into a cloud.  We see shots made by Ted Ray take off like rockets.  We see close-ups of shots made in dense rain digging up the mud; of shots made from water spraying the water onto the air as the ball flies securely toward the hole; of shots made from the sand pits sending sand flying as well as the golf ball.  The game is at least half the movie, and it is very well filmed.  Even if you know nothing of golf, you will appreciate the filming of this piece and the sense of excitement it brings to your heart.

This movie actually made me want to take up golf (I have never played)...it was that good.  I give it an A+A+A+A+A+...that's five A+'s for five stars!
