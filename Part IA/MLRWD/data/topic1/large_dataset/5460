I have been earnestly viewing films of Montgomery Clift and am mesmerized by his emotional acting ability on a level I am not accustomed to seeing on the big screen, often by what Mr. Clift does not say rather than when he is speaking his lines. Montgomery had this inherent talent - often expressing his action in subtext performance rather than through spoken dialogue, IMO. I have never really observed this astonishing talent from watching other actors' performances to the extent I do when watching Montgomery Clift's films. He was so convincing, he did not appear to be acting at all.

I am able to discern what Clift's characters were feeling and saying before he spoke his lines, because Montgomery provides me with that privilege through his engrossing talent. Like they say - the eyes are the windows to our souls. Montgomery Clift had a rare gift of expressing his personal emotions by enchanting us with his feelings, humbly and in a restrained manner that was both alluring and gripping, making us want more.  Montgomery Clift was remarkable in achieving empathy for his characters in this manner of Method Acting. As a result, I am buying many of his films from Amazon.

It would be a worthy undertaking if a feature film were made about Montgomery Clift, considering his auto accident that subsequently interrupted his career, igniting an apparent fragile personal life already frail, which contributed to his arguably foreseeable downward spiral. It is odd how one regretful decision and turn of events can alter one's future that leads to inevitable adverse consequences and tragedy. "The Misfits" is one of several films I highly recommend, in which we are privileged to view and to become enthralled by Montgomery Clift, one of Hollywood's most underrated actors of the twentieth century.
