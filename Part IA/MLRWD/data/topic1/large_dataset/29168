I by-passed this movie several times. I thought it was a Civil War movie because of the title.  Ultimately I bought it because I'm a Jeff Bridges fan.

It's been several days since I watched this movie, and I can't stop thinking about all the implications of the events that transpired in this movie.  I keep stringing together "what about this . . ." and "what ifs . . ." that go way beyond the movie itself and enter into my everyday life -- the terrorism that has crept into all of our lives since 9/11.

I think what is scariest about this movie is the idea that such an educated person could be so easily manipulated and used as a tool for a terrorist group.  If a man who lectures about the perils of terrorism to his students in such a thought-provoking way can be sucked into such a horrible scheme, how do we less-educated or less-perceptive individuals avoid such dangers?  As a parent, I honestly could see myself reacting exactly the same way to the boy in the street, to my child wanting to be included and have more friends, and ultimately to doing anything to protect my child who is in danger.

I used to wonder how any rational human being could be sucked into these terrorist groups to the point of turning against their own country.  After watching this movie, it seems like it would be just a matter of finding a person's trigger point.  That scares me.

I will be more vigilant and watchful now, more than ever before, but . . . "will that save me?"  God, I truly do hope so!!!
