Another sequel, I feared for the producers and writers. The first and second were in their own class but was it really worth their while to risk creating another sequel after the way Chucky was killed off in Part 2? As  well as this, the film was released a year after the second which sounded  to me like this was just written in a day or two. The horror and suspense  have disapeared in this movie, comedy and humor take the leading themes.  Andy has now grown up, played by Justin Whalin who never really did much  for me here or as Jimmy in the Superman series. In military camp to  hopefully forget about everything life can be normal again. But Chucky  returns once again to do harm. The plot is totally unbelievable here-  Chucky's blood enters that of another goodguy doll now in production. How  incredible can that be? Brad Dourif is back as the bad doll who does in  fairness provide some decent humour. But that's all that keeps the  disapointed fans watching really. Andy must finish the fight once and for  all and protect young Tyler from being Chucky's next victim. Routine,worn  out horror saga which was just made to squeeze more money out of the  creased series.
