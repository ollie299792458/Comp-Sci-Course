This is a little known film which deserves to be widely seen. Sean Bean (my favorite Lord of the Rings actor) is terrific and the acting on the whole is excellent. The directors aren't afraid to have moments where nothing interesting seems to be happening--and then moments where you really get a feel for how SAS would act in combat. At times I almost thought I might be watching a documentary. Most refreshing, the director tries to realistically convey his scenes--not tie everything into some profound metaphysical truism. There is a message here, but you aren't hit over the head w/ it so many times that it sucks the life out of the actors/scenes/dialog.

It's true the budget for the film wasn't huge and there are a few scenes were an editor might have been a little more liberal w/ the cutting knife. However the acting and realism of many of the action scenes/dialog more than make up for the lack of expensive design sets.

and btw, the packaging of the DVD/video is pretty silly--but don't be put off. The film is marketed for teens wanting more Schwarznegger, but the best audience is one more seriously interested in history.

Four stars because there are a couple of over the top scenes that do a disservice to the rest of the movie. The lack of budget however is made up for by some of the most realistic military scenes I've ever seen.
