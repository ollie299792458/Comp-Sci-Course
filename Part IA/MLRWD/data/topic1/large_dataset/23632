This is one of the three westerns I would choose for my "marooned on a desert island" library - the other two would be 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' and 'The Shootist'.  'Once Upon a Time in the West' runs a close fourth ... and 'Silverado' is right behind that one.

The current copy of M7 is my fourth. We've worn out 2 VHS copies and a full-screen DVD.  It plays beautifully on the widescreen set. The detail is amazing compared to the old days of VHS on a 21" screen. How we lasted that long with a small screen is a wonder...

The first time I saw M7 was in the late 60s. I curled up with my grandfather in his recliner on a Saturday evening and we devoured bowls of popcorn and pretzels with the occasional sausage pizza. [Remember 'Saturday Night at the Movies' which used to run on prime-time TV?] We had a standing date every weekend, provided the movie was worth watching. It is one of my favorite memories of time spent with him - that and Yankee baseball.

I've watched it so many times, I could probably quote each role.

BUT - this issue/copy I noticed an error ... whoever wrote the liner notes goofed.  They listed Yul Brynner and the six others as: "...are Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Horst Bucholz, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and Brad Dexter." HOWEVER - Eli Wallach played Calvera, the bandit chief, NOT one of the seven.  The missing seventh member was played by James Coburn.

If you must have only one western in your DVD collection, let it be this one.  You won't regret it. It's worth having if only for the soundtrack! The opening music raises you right out of your seat and makes you take notice of what's to come.  And - what's to come is well worth watching! Trust me on this -  we currently have 45 DVD and 64 VHS westerns in our collections [ only 8 duplicates ].
