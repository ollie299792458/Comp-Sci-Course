After watching Public Enemies the first time in theaters I decided to see it again. As soon as I found out when this movie was coming out in December, I put it on the top of my Christmas list. When I got this movie for Christmas I noticed that there was a sticker on the outside cover saying exclusive bonus disc with interviews with Johnny Depp and Christain Bale(Best Buy Exclusive). This made me very pleased because thgis is one of my favorite movies of all time and I love special features. The movie itself looks amazing and the blu ray exclusives picture in picture and historical timeline are nice as well. But thats not why this is one of my favorite movies of all time. That reason belongs to the director: Miichael Mann. He didn't build any sets for this movie, he shot all on location. and when I mean location I mean location, in fact the exact same location the real Dillinger was held at Michigan State Pen. was were Michael Mann shot that scene. Also in the scene, the shoot out at Little Bohiemia, Michael Mann filmed at the actual Little Bohiemia that still had bullet holes from the original shoot out between Dillinger and Purvis. If you didn't see this movie in theaters or did and are trying to decide wheter to buy it or not. Remember this line Bye Blackbird Bye Bye.
