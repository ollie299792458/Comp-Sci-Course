"I have seen beauty in the most fragile of places.
I have seen the book...
I have seen the book that turns darkness to light."

A film so beautiful, only a Blu-ran can do it real justice!

Nominated for a 2010 Best Animated Feature, Secret of Kells is a movie that almost nobody has heard of because of a limited US release.  But it is by far and away the best film in its category.  A compelling mix of both Christian history and Celtic mythology, the story tells a fairy tale of Brendan and his quest to preserve and finish the most important book in history.

Beautifully animated, with rich colors and emphasis on simple geometrics, the film is shows why movies are a *visual* medium.  Utilizing a "flat" 2D style, with richly decorated backgrounds, and a varied character design, this motion picture is a true work of art.

Once again, Blu-ray is the medium this film is meant for.  Even DVD would fall short, due to its reduced color reproduction and resolution when compared to Blu-ray.

Please, please grace the US a Blu-ray release!
