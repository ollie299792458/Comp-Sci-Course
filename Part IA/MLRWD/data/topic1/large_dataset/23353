'21 Grams' tells the complex interconnected story of how three lived intersect both tragically and redemtively following a car accident. Paul (Sean Penn; Mystic River) is a terminally ill math professor, in desperate need of a heart transplant. Christine (Naomi Watts; The Ring) is a former drug addict, whose just now getting clean -- with the help of her family. Jack (Benecio Del Toro; Traffic) is a born-again-Christian, who was an ex-convict, now preaching the Gospel to others. In a tragic car accident, all three of their lives will be forever touched. Jack is driving home from work when he fails to see a man with his two kids walking, he accidentally kills them. The family happens to belong to Christine, who just happens to be recovering from drugs. Then there is Paul, who just gets Christine's husbands heart. '21 Grams' power lies in it's acting, no lie there. Sure, it does have some kind of twist like 'Memento,' however, '21 Grams' is a much better film for many diffrent reasons. The main one: the acting. Benecio Del Toro lights up the screen as Jack. Some of his most powerful acting ever. If you thought his performance in 'Traffic' was powerful, you haven't seen nothing yet. Naomi Watts turns in a solid performance as a grieving widow, who loses both her spouse and her two children. Sean Penn turns in another Oscar-caliber performance as a terminally ill math professor, whose own life is in termoil with a unhappy marriage. All in all, '21 Grams' was shunned at the Oscars (Del Toro and Watts deserved their nominations, and above all deserved the Awards) for nominations in both Best Picture and Best Director (Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu) -- not to mention the fact that Penn should've had TWO nominations for Best Actor (this and his win for 'Mystic River'.)
