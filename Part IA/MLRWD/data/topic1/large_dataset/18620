When remaking a classic and staying within the time period that the novel was written in, the film makers should stay within the author's intentions as well. Now had they updated the movie and changed it to a more modern time period, then I would understand the undertones of feminism or activism so prevalent, but in my opinion, it's not completely appropriate in this version. 
Costuming was great, the "look" of the movie was dead-on and spectacular. It was the over-tones of feminisism I take issue with. Sure the March family is "ahead of it's time" and "different." The movie expertly captures that on the screen. But some of the speeches didn't ring true to the original. Once again, had they updated the tale to a more modern time period I would have believed it more having read the novel and knowing the characters and their intentions.
Casting was great. Some reviewers had a problem with the actresses who played the roles of both Amy and Beth. Well, I tend to agree. Kristen Dunst did a great job portraying Beth, but she was too tall for the part! That is OK for stage and you can get past such minor annoyances, but on the big screen it is hard to get around visual appearances. Dunst did a great acting job though, her Beth made me cry harder than all the rest of them. Very believable and heart renching. The dual-Amy bit was irritating. One actress would have been preferable over splitting it between two actresses. It changed the mood terribly but didn't ruin the movie.
Jo March is one of the best characters in literature and she is brought to life beautifully by Winona Ryder. What  plum role, what an amazing actress. 
Over all, I loved the movie. It is a perfect holiday movie to watch with the family and enjoy again and again.
