Although I don't think the show was better than the older episodes of the Simpsons, I do think that during the time it was on the air it was better than the Simpsons. The show is really fond to pop-culture junkies or just people in need of a good laugh. Unfortunatly, FOX cancelled it and it's not coming back. To all of you angry fans that hate FOX for cancelling it, don't. It wasn't FOX's fault. The show stopped because the cast and crew split up. Luckily (in my opinion) South Park has been getting funnier. But still I'm thankful that the FOX production companies are immortalizing this classic series on DVD. 
The thing I like most about Family Guy is the range of inteligence that it appeals to. Whether your a know-it-all super genious with high standards or a complete moron the show is sure to please because it's funny on so many levels.
For fans of the show this is a must buy. For newbies, find a friend who is a fan of the show. Unless your in the category of the pretensiously snobby, Family Guy is sure to please.
