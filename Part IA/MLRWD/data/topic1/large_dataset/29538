Having trained in karate, judo, and aikido for nearly 35 years, I tend to see nearly anything that's even loosely related to the martial arts. Before seeing Ong-Bak, I had no knowledge of Tony Jaa. I didn't know if his style would stand out when compared with Speakman (Kenpo), van Dam (acrobatic kicks), Seagal (aki jitsu), Norris (traditional kick boxing), Chan (cool stunts), or the myriad of other martial arts stars that have graced the big screen. That said, I was very impressed with Tony Jaa's unique Muay Thai style. His incredible use of elbows, leg kicks, speed, and flexibility are a thing to watch. Fantastic!

The story is very simple, its dialogue cheesy, and the villians are cliche. And yet, there's something special about this movie. I think it's the grace and focus that Jaa brings to the screen. Highly recommended!

Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful.
