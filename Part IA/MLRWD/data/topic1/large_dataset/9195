I was so dissappointed that i didn't even watch the whole thing. i got half way through and then got the disc out and watch local news! now before buying the dvd, i've read all of the reviews here. yes, i should have not bought the dvd according to the reviews here, but hey....there's only one way to find out. with the price of $12, i can afford to throw that money away.

i hated it! I really did.

I also didn't really like Black sabbath that much. their style of music is boring to me. I've heard a lot of people saying that tony iommi is one ofhte best guitarist out there. I feel that that is bull crap! i can play like he does! his style is so basic. i thought he was gonna be another steve vai, satriani, or ynwie, but no, this guy runs through the basics all day long!

black sabbath songs are crap! hell....i'm not into any bands now except zepplin, the datsun, velvet revolver. even they are getting boring! I want something new! come one you damn music industries!!!! pump out some more artists. the hell with britney spears and bling bling on mtv!
