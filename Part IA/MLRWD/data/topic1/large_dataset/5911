I would always rate this John Wayne movie with 5 stars, however the transfer onto DVD made me pull off 1 star.  I love the fact that this movie is finally show in widescreen format (ratio 1.85 : 1).  However, the movie  is very dark throughout.  Certain night scenes were almost completely black  on my screen.  Problem here is that most of this movie is shot during night  scenes, so lighting would have to be dim.  What Paramount failed to  recognize was that they needed to "brighten" up the picture some.  The few day scenes were in great condition, and the soundtrack is  excellent.  As for the plot, it's a loose reworking of Rio Bravo, and it is  just as good.  In my opinion, this was the last movie that John Wayne made  as a nimble action hero.  From here on, he eased into more senior roles.  One last note, I own a 50" projection screen TV, so naturally the  picture is darker that a tube.  My brightness was turned up full.  But on a  tube, the picture will be brighter.  So if your going to see this on a  monitor tube, and not projection, it is probably going to be ok.
