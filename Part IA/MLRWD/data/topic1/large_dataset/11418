The movie is far superior to The Da Vinci Code since it contained suspense, betrayal, murder, a detailed look inside the Catholic Church without the anti-Catholic slant, a look at some aspects of choosing a new Pope, and wasn't an overtly critical essay like Da Vinci. Director Ron Howard even corrected some inaccuracies from the book. Tom Hanks got a better co-star with Ayelet Zurer. Fiesty and full of hope for the future not a critic. Ewan McGregor, as always, was brilliant in the film and, in my opinion, stole a lot of thunder from Hanks. Ayelet Zurer was the only one exhibiting his acting prowess. The movie was intricate and fooled you to the end. It actually, despite Hanks and Ron Howards anti-religion slants, told what a real Catholic was and what a bad one was, and how God can work in mysterious ways. Stellan Skarsgård stood out as the Swiss Guard chief. Without Stellan Skarsgård, Ayelet Zurer, and Ewan McGregor, this film would have been poorly done with an expensive budget.

Tom Hanks was the star but really the story and his fellow actors, especially the other three I mentioned, poured a lot of heart in this movie and upstaged him.

The movie does have some humor and is not heavy. If you don't know the ending, you'll be shocked who the real villians are. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and is NOT anti-Catholic. The story's twist and turns, sometimes ending back at the begining, and the awesome cast make this movie an incredibly worthwhile experience. I'm pretty sure some Pope ended up Pope the wrong way in the past. However, this movie is inspiring even for Christians and Catholics if you set aside your inquisition tendacies. God works in mysterious ways even though Dan Brown, the author, Tom Hanks, and Ron Howard definitely didn't want it too.
