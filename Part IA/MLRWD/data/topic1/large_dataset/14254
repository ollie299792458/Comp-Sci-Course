The simple words, "Existential Detective" drove me to the theatre. Who has ever heard of an Existential Detective?

"I Heart Huckabees" follows four people on their quest to discover the meaning of life. However, with the inconspicuous detective duo, Tomlin and Hoffman, the quartet find they're getting more than what they bargained for. With body bags, snooping trash bins, and listening in on conversations, the detectives try to discover the meaning of their clients' lives. But when their clients get enough of the feel-good-everything-is-connected-happiness, they cross over to the dark side - to nihlism.

The film is a lot more philosophical than I had imagined, and thus, very smartly written. "I Heart Huckabees" is strange, but for a point. You may find yourself going back to your college philosophy class, saying things like, "What is is," or "Nothing comes from nothing."

I don't think that "I Heart Huckabees" is trying to be a lesson in philosophy, though. Indeed, in the end, our protagonist finds a happy medium between la-la land and nihlism, which baffles both sides of the spectrum.

Overall, a very intersting movie. But don't watch it if you're sleepy... Four stars!
