This is a very well updated remake of the original from 1965, as the cast and dialogue is very well put together. Also the scenes are very realistic and shot brilliantly, I would have to say one of the better remakes I have seen this year.

The plane crash was one of the best scenes in the whole film as it is done extremely well. The main characters being Frank Towns the pilot (Dennis Quaid) character brings a lot to the film as I feel he really holds the movie up as he is a likeable character that you can relate to. With other great characters like A.J (Tyrese Gibson) who brings the funny side to this film as he plays the co-pilot. Also you got Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi) who plays an unusually character as he really stands out from the other passages, but plays a very important role within the film.

I think that this film is very enjoyable and intense to point of making you watch to the final scene, if you like these types of survival films you'll just love this one.
