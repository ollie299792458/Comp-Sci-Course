As a fan of the anime episodic, and anime in general, I was really looking forward to seeing this film, however I was sorely disappointed.  Not because Saya, David, and Louis are portrayed differently than in the show -- I expected that, and I enjoyed seeing these characters in a different light.  As mentioned by others, the promotional materials on-line and the box both promise a run time of 83 minutes, but that's a lie... they appear to be counting all the bonus material, including trailers.  Also I found the animation quite distasteful, the story to be completely lacking, and all of the secondary characters to be uninteresting or even annoying.  A lot of people gave this movie great reviews, and I really wanted to, but after watching I couldn't help but feel a bit like I'd been robbed.  After finishing the film after barely twice the length of a single episode of the show (with all the commercials removed), I literally went back and watched the whole thing again on fast forward and checked the menus thoroughly to see if I had somehow missed some of it.  Sadly I hadn't, but I still feel like I did...
