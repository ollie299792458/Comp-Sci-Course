...I mostly wanted to add another viewer type that may enjoy the movie: students of history.
I first saw Rashomon in an upper-level history class required to graduate.  The reason for showing this particular movie makes sense when you think about it; the viewer and the court in the movie have to do exactly what historians do all the time.  An incident occurs - in this case, a murder.  When speaking to four different witness, you'll hear four different accounts.  (It's interesting, too, that even a dead man has his own view and not some omnipotent third-person perspective gained from his switch in planes of existence.)  Though this is pretty obvious when you think of criminal investigations, people rarely think of this when many, many years have passed.  We start to believe that anything written way-back-when is the gospel truth, but when you're lucky enough to find a record of an event, it will be tainted by the same points of view as are depicted in the movie.
My favorite case-in-point: watch the way the bandit and the man fight when described by one of them compared to the way the peasant sees it!  It's worth a giggle.
