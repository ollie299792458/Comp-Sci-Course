Dying, aging and dysfunctional famlies are subjects that do not prompt much laughter, but "Marvin's Room" a film, based on the stage play of the same title, manages to mine together those issues along with discussion of sibling rivarly, love and friendship, and the end result is a lovely film, low on schmaltz and sacharine, and high on intelligence and class.
Streep and Keaton play sisters who have been alienated for much of their adult lives, and are reunited when Keaton's Bess is in need of a bone-marrow donation. Streep's Lee comes with her children, and is also reunited with her father, Marvin (a stunning Hume Cronyn), and dotty aunt (a glittering Gwen Verdon). Leonardo DiCaprio (pre-TITANIC) plays Lee's rebellious surly teenaged son. DiCaprio one of Hollywood's brightest, but most unused talents gives a performance of vulnerability, passion and beauty that one can't help but make favorable comparisons to James Dean or Montgomery Clift. Streep is predictably good-though she doesn't seem to connect to her character, as well as her co-stars do. Keaton does the near-impossible in this film-she steals it from Streep. Her Bess is not saint, but Keaton manages to glow, regardless. Actually both DiCaprio and Keaton outshine Streep. Their chemistry is beautiful. Keaton's appearence is stunning because, while attractive, she allows herself to be transformed into a dowdy Florida hausfrau. Ravaged by illness, age and weary, Keaton looks as if Annie Hall went through a hell of a mid-life crisis. Yet, by the end, when the genuine goodness of Bess shines through, and the viewers realize that Bess feels lucky that she was able to take care of her bed-ridden father, Keaton becomes beautiful.
Robert DeNiro has an amusing bit part as a forgetful doctor in one of the film's many amusing comic reliefs.
