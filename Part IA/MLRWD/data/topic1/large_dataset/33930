Quality in movie making is often judged by Hollywood glitz and flash, computer-generated special effects, high-dollar stars, and big budgets. This film has none of these things, therefore it is a perfectly excellent film.

"Roan Inish" brings to life the oral storytelling tradition of the Irish people. In what some in the literary field may term "magical realism," this film places the fantastic alongside the mundane, and though there are moments of revelation and surprise for the characters, these two seemingly separate worlds co-exist harmoniously. A prime example of this is the character of Tadhg, whom all but the film's star, little Fiona, believe to be "daft" due to his deep connection with his past, and his understanding of the selkie mythology of which that past is composed.

This movie accomplishes the telling of a complex story through the use of native Irish actors who seem to have a real feel for the storytelling tradition, as well as the use of simplistic special effects and magnificent camera work. It is a gentle, simple, yet fascinating tale of one little girl's dream of finding her lost brother, and the mysteries she uncovers in the quest. A better movie for the entire family has not been made. This is by far my favorite movie of all time.
