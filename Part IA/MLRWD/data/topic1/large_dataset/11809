I have to agree with Rey and some of the other reviewers. I felt really eerie and disappointed when I finally learned that Joshua was supposed to be Christ Himself. And while I can enjoy a good Christian fantasy, I can't except the portrayal of Jesus using the "S-CKS" word that is so prevalent in today's society. That is a dirty word straight from the devil himself and maybe the origination of the word has hidden itself from today's generation, but I grew up with it in the public schools (60s and 70s) and it was dirty then and it is still dirty today. Some will say, "Oh but you missed all of the togetherness and unity that is also portrayed". Sadly this is the method that Satan has used so successfully in today's (and past) society. He paints a really pretty picture making it look like God and then just throws in a little sin here and a little sin there just enough so he doesn't upset the masses. Over time he keeps doing this until one day you find yourself asking, "What happened?". Specifically what happened to righteousness and holiness? What happened to prayer in the public schools? What happened to the sanctity of marriage? Why is the divorce rate now higher among Christians than non-believers? This movie also has Joshua proclaiming that the fear of God is a bad thing which could not be further from the truth. Jesus himself said, "fear not men who can only destroy the body, but fear God who can destroy both body and soul!"
