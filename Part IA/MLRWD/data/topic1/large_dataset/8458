I first saw this movie years ago when I had a terrible crush on Richard Gere (what a hunk).  I recently bought this for "old time sake", watched it again (years later), what a great movie.  Richard Gere is a superb actor, so is Deborah Winger.  A love story with true grit - more real than most stories I have seen.  The one part that everyone seems to love is Deborah standing by the jukebox, desperately trying to act like she is not interested in Gere - was that great acting or what?  In the interviews behind the scenes with Richard he says he thought that the ending was too much - too unreal.  He was surprised once he saw it on film how it worked.  It does - it is a great movie in my opinion.

I had the opportunity to work with Richard Gere years later in a movie as an extra.  I met him (heart beating fast), he is one of the kindest person's in show business.  A really great guy.

I recommend this movie in any collection - especially for the gals who loved and still love Richard Gere.
