I promise I will not ruin anything about the movie....Mr. Brooks is a great stand-alone movie, however, it should be noted prior to viewing that its the first part of a trilogy...think it will make the ending even more enjoyable/understandable.

Kevin Costner has one of his finest performances yet....a sociopathic, brilliant serial killer who somehow has emotions and loves his family so much that he tries to fight his "urges" to kill. From a psychological standpoint, its an extremely intriguing film delving into such issues as whether someone can pass along sociopathic tendencies to one's children, how a murderer can maintain "normal" relationships with family members, the stereotypical serial killer mentality of wanting to show off his acts by taunting police/investigators, etc., whether or not someone with homicidal tendancies is an "addict," etc.  Also, from a legal and criminological standpoint this film is also interesting, with many twists and turns as the plot unfolds.

Overall, I thought the acting was great, the concepts terrifying and the movie truly an exciting ride. I wouldn't consider this a "horror film" per se, it wasnt really scary; rather, its more of a psychological thriller. I highly recommend it, but really only for teens and adults- dont think its appropriate for young audiences. Can't wait for the next installment!
