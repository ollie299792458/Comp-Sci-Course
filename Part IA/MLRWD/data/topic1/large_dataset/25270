Season 4 begins so disjointed from season 3 that one wonders if it is the same "Bramwell".  New characters appear with no explanation and certain roles suddenly have different actors.  Not to mention the fact that season 4 destroyed the reliability and consistency of the characters of Dr. Marsham and Dr. Bramwell, it also included jumpy camera work, close ups of frenetic action which revealed nothing, exaggerated close ups that were completely inapppropriate to the story as developed.  Dr. Bramwell's sexual tryst fully clothed with her new paramour was totally out of character and unbelieveable particularly because the writers had not even developed any chemistry between the two characters.  And what in the world was the purpose of the 4th season to rid The Trift of its founder?  What a total cockup as the British would say.  I can't understand what made the writer, Lucy Gannon, write the fourth season as she did.
I'm very sorry that my memory of all of these wonderful characters was sullied by this disaster of a fourth season.
