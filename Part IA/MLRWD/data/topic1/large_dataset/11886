Three Kings isn't an easy watch.  The director and his cinematographer purposely mesh strange film lighting with strange colour filters.  The film has got a sandy look which isn't pleasant.  The lighting is too harsh for my liking.  Why David Russel opted to film Three Kings like this, I don't know.  But what I do know is that behind the annoying techinical problems lies a serious and important issue.
I love Dr Strangelove.  That movie is an all out laugh a second movie on the absurdity of war.  Three Kings cannot be compared to it simply because it never attempts to compare.  Three Kings doesn't make fun of the war as such.  There is a lot of humour here but it comes more from the characters than the situation.  In fact, there is nothing at all funny about the situation.  The war is over.  The Iraqis want the Americans out of their country.  But they are still holding innocent prisoners.
The performances are top class.  George Clooney chooses his parts well and here, again proves his calibre.  Mark Wahlberg is given the most intense scenes and doesn't disappoint.  Ice Cube defies his ridiculous name to make good a difficult, unflashy part.  Spike Jonze is used for comic effect and is also successful.  
Russel direction is outstanding.  The Iraqis are not bad guys in his mind.  His views are very objective and fair.  His use of startling images like the unforgettable bullet-eye view are possibly unnecessary but this man knows how to tell a story. 
Three Kings is not always interesting.  In fact, the movie does sag at times.  And is also often too conventional.  I didn't enjoy the reporter sub-plot.  The lighting was also unkind.  
Three Kings is a good movie with a great cast and a promising director.  A promising director however, who must have failed addition in school.  There are 4 kings, are there not?
