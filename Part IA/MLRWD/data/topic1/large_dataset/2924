The cartoon we all love is back with a new release, continuing where the Phoenix Saga left off.  These are the original versions, not the syndicated versions aired on Disney-XD.  Personally, I'm on the fence as to whether or not I prefer the syndicated versions or the original.  The syndicated versions show no cuts for content (these episodes were NEVER longer than 22 minutes, including the intro and outro) but do show some corrections of animation mistakes.  For example, in "Savage Land, Strange Heart (Part 1)" (which was later changed to "Savage Land, Savage Heart (Part 1)" for the syndicated edition) Sauron's dialog is incorrectly dubbed to Ka-Zar's lips during their confrontation.  This was fixed in the syndicated version.  Another example is in "Savage Land, Strange Heart (Part 2)" where Storm, in a fit of rage, tears off her communicators.  The communicators stay on sfter she grumbles "leave me alone" but as it cuts to a new angle they are missing.  This was also fixed in the syndicated version.  However, disregarding these subtle differences, I encourage any X-Men fan to purchase the series on DVD.  Many of us have waited a long time for this.
