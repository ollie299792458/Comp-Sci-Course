The first season of Fox's extraordinary series 24 opens the door to a new  conceptual mode for TV: real time drama. This is a revolutionary concept , especially for this day and age, where so much is predictable and controlled-as in corporation/government controlled. Perhaps THEY are not aware of what they have unleashed. One might also posit the notion that the "far-fetched" conspiracies in this first season are not so far-fetched when one considers there's a war being fought based on complete misrepresentation of the facts. There is the argument that George W went in to Iraq to get even with Sadamn for trying to kill his dad for the Gulf War humiliation Iraq suffered-much like the central premise for the events that unfold in this first season of 24.

As the song goes, "The news today will be the movies for tomorrow," 24 seems to take current politics and twists the plot-with the help of a super patriot who demonstrates what we used to call "natural born killer tendencies." Crisp editing, excellent split screen techniques along with Jack's pathological violent streak make 24 entertaining because it's ultimately topical: what can we really believe anymore from our government?
