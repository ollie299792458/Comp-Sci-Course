For the 1978-1979 television season, Hanna-Barbera produced sixteen episodes of a third season of Scooby-Doo, Where are You! for broadcast on ABC. These episodes follow the episodes of Scooby-Doo made in 1976 and 1977 for ABC, and are more similar to those episodes than the 1969-1971 originals except that Scooby-Dum, a semi-regular character from the 1976 and 1977 episodes, does not appear.

ABC began airing these episodes on Saturday mornings at 8:00 AM EST beginning in September 1978. The show was canceled in November 1978 after nine episodes; the remaining seven first-run episodes were broadcast during ABC's Scooby's All-Stars block at 10:00 AM, which was originally broadcasting reruns of the 1976 and 1977 episodes. These 1978 episodes have been aired in syndication as part of The Scooby-Doo Show since the 1980s, but are to be released on DVD under the title "'Scooby-Doo, Where are You!: The Complete Third Season.
