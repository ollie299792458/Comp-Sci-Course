Sure, this movie is a mish-mash of Mad Max, King Arthur, and Dragonslayer.  Sure there are holes and a few question marks in the plot.  But then again...we're watching a movie about dragons and the people who live in a future time where dragons rule so, why question it to begin with?
  I was afraid of seriously cheesey dragon effects a la Dungeons and Dragons, but WOW was I pleasantly surprised! The creatures were well textured and moved almost cat-like.  The fire they breathed didn't look all pixellated like a lot of fire done with CGI.  That all combined to deliver a good-looking (?) set of monsterous dragons.
  The sound was probably the best I've heard in a long time.  The theater I saw it in is set up for Dolby Digital surround...and let me tell you:  this movie made FULL use of the sound system!!! Dragons flying all around you..and when they growled..whoa..puts a shiver down your spine!!!
  Go see it, don't believe it....just enjoy it.  The actors are all excellent, even though at times the British actors's accents were so thick it made understanding them all but impossible.  This movie is around 1 hr. and 40 minutes long...not too short and not too long...but long enough enjoy the heck out of yourself!!!
