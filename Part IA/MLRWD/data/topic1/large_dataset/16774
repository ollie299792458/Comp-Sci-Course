This is an excellent film. Billy Bob is a clean-vut barber who keeps to himself. His wife married him because she liked that he didn't talk very much. It is a tragedy of epic proportions, with great performances from all involved.

The only thing for me that holds this back from being a FIVE STAR film is the fact that in EVERY SINGLE SCENE someone lights up a cigarette or is taking deep drags on one. That alone justifies this film's "R" rating. When watching this film, it seems that they are encouraging people to be "cool" and that smoking is a pleasurable thing. The most notorious moment for me is when Frances McDormand is sitting in the bathtub and asks her barber husband (Billy Bob) to shave her legs. He walks in somberly with a cigarette drooping from his lips and she tells him to give her a drag. This is a putrid moment that just drove me crazy! But then, that is just my opinion.

Overall, the film could have been as good and greater if it did not have the incessant smoking throughout. The plot is slow yet intensely emotional. If you don't mind smoking, then you will probably enjoy this dramatic tragedy. If you are as strongly opposed to smoking or have children who are interested in seeing this, you should review the film before letting them see it.
