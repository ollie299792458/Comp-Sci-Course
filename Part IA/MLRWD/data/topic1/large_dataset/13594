People, I ordered this movie awhile back, and got 2 copies. The latter for the special effects, for the interviews, etc. That was great. Its my ALL TIME FAVE AND I MEAN THIS. I'm a huge huge proponent of helping women who suffer, who do things in self defense, to survive. I loved the actors, geena and susan, and the MUSIC, by Hans Zimmer, every morsal of this movie is my soul. I do not hate men. I am simply, one who loves this movie and have ever since it came out, and even moreso, over time, hence, the late review.

So, I am biased, a bit.. but that's just me. As a western girl who loves the road, and travel, and the southwest this appealed to me all the more. As a woman who is of that genertion, and one who challenges things, and defies things, and lives in denim, this is me, as well. We usually love, what we are about, but aside from all of this, its about women taking their lives and livng by the laws they believe in,and that fierocity, and I do love that, but thats my quirk. And, knowing what Susan Sarandon feels politically is in harmony with me too, and is some years later, but.. hey.. that's just me.... here out in california.. and I 'll probably expect that the majority reading this, will not agree.. but thats ok too.
