I loved this movie! I saw it last night, and I was not in the least bit unsatisfied.  1980 fear was born, 2003 the two biggest names in horror come together to finish things.  I think this movie was good for many reasons, the first being the girls, the second was that this movie combined two franchises better then I have ever seen done, third the soundtrack was awsome.  This movie was about a murderer named freddy krueger who was burned alive in his house after killing a bunch of the towns children, after he died he went after the children in thier dreams, but the towns people found a way to defeat him so-to-speak and that is forget about him.  Freddy needs fear or he can't kill, so he finds a way to bring fear back to elm street, he disguises himself as jason's mother and enters his dreams where he uses jason's love for his mother to convince him to go to elm street, and the fun begins, but after jason brings back fear, he doesn't stop killing, and that brings fear to jason instead, so now freddy must destroy jason in order to once again rise.  The best part of this film was the fight scene, I liked how it didn't go one way, and the advantage kind of swayed b ack and forth amongst the two.  As for who won I probably shouldn't say, but I think you will all be pleasently surprised.
