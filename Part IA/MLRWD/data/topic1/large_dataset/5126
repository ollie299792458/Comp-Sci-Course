First of all, it's obvious this isn't the type of movie that would be everybody's cup of tea. Let me tell you why it was mine though. Being someone who really loves old time blues music it was like a video track to all great blues tunes! It reaches to the heart of the music and tells a great story at the same time.... The title itself was taken from a song by 1920's bluesman Blind Lemon Jefferson.
Take a nymphomaniac who has paired off with a weak-willed man and then through fate introduce her to a world wise ex bluesman with an obsessive religious streak and every character's issues are out on the table. The acting performances in this movie are compellingly believable and well done. From the first fifteen minutes of this movie forward you are drawn into the lives of these people and you can't help wondering how things will turn out for them.
Most profound of all though this movie is a powerful and gripping story about love & redemption. While liking blues music may give you more of an appreciation for it, this is hardly a requirement to enjoy this film. It's the type of movie that when it's over you walk away feeling like the world is more hopeful and bright. The best advice I can give about this movie if you're thinking of buying or renting it is DON'T JUDGE A MOVIE BY IT'S COVER!
