When a Western devolves into an outright howler it's brutal and grimacing to endure.  (I have loads of respect for a gripping, well-made Western.)  So I crawled all over my couch while watching WILD BILL, a contrived, cliche-ridden train wreck that literally had me blushing for the likes of many terrific actors, including Jeff Bridges (in the title role), Bruce Dern, James Gammon, and the forever-brooding Diane Lane.  None of them deserved a clunker like this; here's hoping a passle of agents were promptly given their pink slips in WILD BILL's aftermath.

We're all familiar with the legend of gunman Wild Bill Hickok and his exploits from Abilene to Deadwood.  But here Bridges portrays Hickok as a high-strung neurotic who goes into a tizzy when. . .someone touches his hat.  (And there are several howlers as a result.)  Meanwhile Ellen Barkin shatters every caricature of a drawling, slang-hurling, tough-as-nails Western tomboy (playing Hickok pal Calamity Jane), and no one, I repeat, no one, is more annoying and irritating than a sniveling David Arquette playing sissified villain Jack McCall.

And then I kept asking myself:  Why is Christina Applegate even in this movie?

We're privy to several (actually, too many) grainy, black and white flashbacks that lend little to the Deadwood sequence, and the hostage non-event in the saloon is so lame I was absolutely cringing in my chair as I watched (mortified).  But fear not:  Wild Bill ultimately mows down the bad guys using two six-shooters that, miraculously, never run out of rounds, and Calamity gets to beat up a couple of misfits to boot, making WILD BILL the ultimate howler that it is.  But comedy shouldn't be this painful.
