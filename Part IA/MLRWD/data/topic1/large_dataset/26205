A German mobile artillery unit in North Africa during World War 2 stops at a desert oasis only to be ambushed by a specially organized group of soldiers so they can take the gold carried by the Germans. Fast forward forty years and introduce some offspring of those soldiers to some really pissed off German corpses. I believe I have covered the plot without taking 90 boring minutes to do so. This was about as much story as the film-makers started with, before they started padding the film for time. The direction, lighting, sound, etc. are horrible. Did I mention the acting; as soon as I find some I will report back. As though 'Oasis of the Zombies' were not bad enough, then comes the dubbing. The dubbing at times is the only entertaining part of this movie since the action and emotion represented on screen rarely is represented in the dubbing (for example: a running screaming character on screen has a calm voice dubbed in). Even with an occasional laugh provided by the dubbing, that cannot stop this film from being a solid sleep inducer.-Bob
