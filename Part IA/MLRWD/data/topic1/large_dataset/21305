I was interested to see how the movie makers would translate a huge book into a feature film and agree with many that they lost most of the feeling as well as much of the story arc.  Alas, that was bound to be the case.  But the casting of new characters was good in that the new actors were all accomplished without being overpowering.

Having enjoyed the actor/director interviews and in-depth behind the scenes footage in the previous movie releases, particularly #3, I found myself highly disappointed with the bonus material on this release.  There was a feature with a whirlwind of 10 second interviews stitched together with old movie clips to replace the actor/director interviews.  The Tonks tour was cute, but very shallow.  There were far fewer deleted scenes than previous and none of them helped in capturing the emotion that would have underlaid the plot or given additional insight.  And the movie editing section was rather silly.  In short, the material was lacking.  While I would understand that if the producers wanted to do something different for the bonus material on this release compared with previous ones, they went too far the other way.  It seems like they could have at least done some real-time commentary on a few scenes.

So keep this DVD in your collection.  But be prepared to fill other people in on the plot after they watch it.  And don't spend the extra money to get the bonus material.
