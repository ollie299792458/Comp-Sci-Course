I can't say that I hate A Nightmare on Elm Street V: The Dream Child. I simply didn't like it, which is more than to say that I hated the film.
The characters that managed to survive The Dream Master (was there any? It's been so long!) didn't return in this film, if memory serves me correctly. I don't remember seeing Alice in the previous films. I was always fascinated with the idea that there was a dream child that Freddy could use. If the child was dreaming, Freddy could go in through the child's dreams and kill Alice and her friends.
It seemed to me that this film was a downgrade from the previous ones. It makes close to the bottom on my list, with Nightmare II being the very last. There are many people that will say without lying that they didn't like the movie. And I'm not trying to bash the movie. I'm just giving my opinion, which is that I don't like the movie, and Freddy's comedic side, such as when *SPOILER Greta falls asleep and Freddy begins stuffing food down her throat and says "bon appetit, b**ch!"
Otherwise, the film was okay, but I still had a few issues about it, things I didn't like about it. I think that had this film have been made today with Jackie playing Freddy, it might be a better film. It, just like the Chucky series, took an unfortunate turn for the comedy, instead of the uneasy darkness the film deserved.
So, Nine, Ten, The Series Ends... When?
When I saw this movie, I was waiting anxiously for the producers to finally kill Freddy. I was getting tired of the comedian known as Freddy Krueger that killed people in their sleep, the one that kept coming back to life, no matter how and for how long he was dead for.
