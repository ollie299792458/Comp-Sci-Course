This is the sort of film that makes going to the movies fun. And it makes owning a home theatre system even more so. This film is the most cliched, overblown, obvious creature feature you have ever seen, with ideas  balatantly stolen from other films. But this film works! Treat Williams is  not your typical square jawed action hero, as you'd expect to find in a  film like this, but nevertheless he carries the film well. Famke Janssen is  the token female (in an otherwise all male cast) and its shows. Her  inclusion into the cast was an obvious crowd puller and to allow for some  kind of romantic sub-plot between her and Williams.  The film is just  plain fun, and anyone who complains that it isn't plausible or realistic  needs to purchase a sense of humour.  While the DVD doesn't contain much  in the way of extras, i still recommend this disc to anyone who likes a  slam bam action blast, with the final edge-of-your-seat chase sequence sure  to have you cheering at the end.  Lovely sound, and decent picture, this  disc is one you should own, if not for any reason but to test out your  speakers.
