"All the President's Men" remains one of my favorites. Not only was it produced so well, it's also a textbook for screenwriting.
Woodward and Bernstein's book of the same title was an account of their Watergate reporting. In it they very wisely referred to themselves as a unified, second-tier character in third-person, which allowed them to get out of the way of their own reporting.
William Goldman's screen adaptation was inspired and brilliant. The job of any screenwriter adapting a work is to realize the smaller, and separate, story within the original that will be the cinematic story. Although Richard Nixon was Woodward and Bernstein's main character, Goldman realized the cinematic story was about two young reporters unheard of outside the DC area, and that without guard Frank Wills discovering a piece of tape on a lock things most likely would have remained that way. The action, then, is in the newsroom, not the White House.
Any serious screenwriter hopeful should read the book, then take apart the film version to see how it's done.
