I went to see this movie with my girlfriend over the summer.  When it was over we did not say one word to one another except "WOW!!!" Later, when we were over all the emotions it brought out (Anger, Sadness, and deepened Patriotism) we were able to discuss it with one another.  We realized that we had forgotten just what had happened and how it had happened.  It reminded us of what we are fighting for around the globe.

After seeing this movie, I realized just how emotional 9/11.  It is not that I didn't realize when it occurred, it is just that I was too young to fully grasp what had happened to our country.  This movie is scary in the way it shows the two officers having to fight to stay alive beneath the rubble, as well as the emotional turmoil their families are going through not knowing whether they are dead or alive.  It makes you realize just how much we take for granted in our daily lives and how at anytime our lives can be snatched away from us as quickly as they were given. This movie is an amazing accomplishment!!!  It is just so emotional and thought provoking.  The acting is great.  Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena do an awesome job at depicting the two Port Authority officers having to fight for their lives and survive.

I would reccomend this movie to everyone living in the United States of America. Hopefully it will serve as a huge reminder of the tragedy that occurred on 9/11 and America's fight to survive and band together.  On that day heroes were born and worked constantly; night and day, to rescue those men.  It is a movie about heroes, survival, and patriotism and it is wonderfully done!!!!!
