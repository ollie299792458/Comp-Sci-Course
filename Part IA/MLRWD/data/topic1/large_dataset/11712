I love this movie!!  I must admit however, that when I heard the title "Corpse Bride", I thought this movie might be gory or really scary.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  Tim Burton's Corpse Bride tells the story a young man named Victor Van Dort (Jonny Depp) who is going to be having an arranged marriage to Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) who's parents have arranged the marriage, to save them from the poorhouse.  It should be said that even though Victoria's parents Finis Everglot (Albert Finey) and Maudeline Everglot (Joanna Lumley) are cold and uncaring, Victoria, on the other hand, is sweet and kind-hearted.  And I have to say, Victoria's parents ARE scary.  Finis Everglot looks like a fat, bloated, toad and Maudeline Everglot, has a really creepy hair-do and a wierd chin.

Back to the story....
Victor can't remember his wedding vows and the wedding rehersal is a disaster.  Victor runs off to the forest to practice his wedding vows.  While there, he finally gets it right and places the wedding ring on what looks like a tree root.  But is in reality, a finger.  It is then that he meets Emily (Helena Bonham Carter), a half-skeletonized beauty who was murdered years earlier by the evil, scheaming, Lord Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant.)  A charming sociopath who charms young women, murders them, and takes their money.  It makes you wonder, how many other women has he murdered.  I have a feeling that Emily wasn't his first victim.  And personally, I think Lord Barkis is a serial killer.  But that's a whole other story entirely......

Ok, I'm not going to spoil the ending.  So you'll have to rent it, steal it (just kidding), or watch it on Netflicks.  Either way, you need to see this movie.  You'll love it!!!
