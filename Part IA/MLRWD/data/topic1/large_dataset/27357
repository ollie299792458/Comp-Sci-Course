I saw the second movie first and really liked it, so I rented the first one.  Big disappointment.  The story had almost no depth at all.  You really didn't get to know the characters.  There wasn't much of on the edge of your seat excitement. 
Also, I noticed some things that didn't make sense- this movie didn't have much scientific logic to it.  For instance, the guys chasing the two time travellers needed them alive- yet they shot at them!  Further, even before they shot at them the two ran- when they didn't have any reason to.  And that older guy (won't say who) that knew what happened, wouldn't tell what happened for no reason that I can see.  These things and more were just to irritating to overlook.
But, there were some surprises and some paradox stuff that did make you wonder.  And there was time travel.  So, the movie wasn't a total loss.
And maybe I would have liked it better had I seen this one BEFORE the next one.
The sequel was really good- atlot more excitement and suspence, and more character depth.
The sequel was about a horrifying alernate reality created by time travel that the main character of both movies- I forget his name- was the only one who knew that this wasn't the way things were supposed to be. (He remembered the orginal reality)
It seems from other reviews that if a person likes one movie (1 or 2) they probably won't like the other.  But, then they are very different movies.
