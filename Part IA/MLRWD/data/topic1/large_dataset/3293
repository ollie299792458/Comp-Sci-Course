I rented this movie with my friends at a sleepover, and it was horrible and totally predictable.  Also, the characters terrible and stupid beyond belief.  For example, after his wife is pushed in the well, Quaid leans as far over the hole as he can and yells as loudly as he can, oblivious to the fact that the psyco is in the woods behind him, "ARE YOU OKAY?!"and even though the wife is frantically yelling, "DALE'S UP THERE, GET AWAY!"  Quaid just says, "OK, I'M GOING TO GET YOU OUT!"  Even though you're expecting the murderer to jump out and finally finish them off, it never happens!  That was probably one moment where the movie was not completely predictable.

Also, the plot was pretty rough and didn't make much sense.  The director also made some pretty stupid decisons.  For example, Quaid finds a retainer and a few teeth in the driveway and immediatly comes to the conclusion that Dale brutally murdered all his kids and his wife.  I don't think that's enough evidence to tell that someone was murdered.  There was also a family that Quaid's family became friendly with that added nothing to the plot except that they gave Quaid's daughter a horse that was killed by the psyco.  The death of the horse was also completely predictable.  Also, nothing at all happened in the first hour of the movie and my friends and I were actually considering turning it off we were so bored.

The highlight of this movie was when the each family member found a snake in the room each of them was in at exactly the same time.  Then they all started screaming and running around the house in hysterics and eventually decided that the roof would be the safest place ( Quaid and his wife also went on the roof when they were being chased by the murderer and got themselves trapped).  This scene was actually quite comical.  My friends and I had fun watching this movie because we love watching stupid horror movies, but if you're looking for a real horror movie, I'd try something else.
