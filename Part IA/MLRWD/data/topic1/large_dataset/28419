I ordered this DVD in haste, failing to notice that it is NOT the movie version I loved so well.  My first clue should have been that it listed Patricia Routledge instead of Angela Lansbury in the cast.  Overall the performance was fine, but the quality of the recording is abominable.  Why is this Shakespeare in the Park production being marketed instead of the Hollywood version?  The colors are washed out, and at times the sound is indistinct.  I can only assume that the movie version of the same production is not available on DVD yet; otherwise, why would they market this grossly inferior production.  George Rose, Tony Azito, Rex Smith, and Kevin Kline are outstanding in their performances, as they are in the movie.  Routledge is "so-so".  Linda Ronstadt is terrible.  Her voice is flawed with warbling and mumbling that makes the libretto almost impossible to distinguish.  The only song she performs which I understood was a puzzling rendition of "Heavy the Sorrow" from "HMS Pinafore".  What is THAT doing in "Pirates"??  I can only assume that she possessed it in her high school repertoire and had begged the producers to let her sing it.  Yes, I was rather disappointed with this.
