Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets definetly matches the orginal and in my opinoin even surpases it. Harry's second year at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry is filled with mystery, laughter, mischief, danger, and of course magic. Harry recieves a worning from a house-elf named Dobby. Dobby warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts, but Harry does not listen. Soon after his arrival at Hogwarts, students are being found petrified! It seems the attacks are related to the Chamber of Secrets, so the trio of Ron, Harry, and Hermione set out to solve the case.
  First I'll start with the acting. All of the young actors did much better. You can see much more confidence in Harry this time around. At first it's strange how Ron and Harry's voices have changed, but you quickly get used to it. All of the adult actors once again do great.
  The special effects are also much better this time. Quidditch is more realistic and Dobby doesn't seem fake and isn't annoying. In my opinoin the monster of the Chamber of the Secrets, is by far the best effect in the movie. That battle is awsome!
  The flow of the second movie is very faced paced and your never bored. I do think that the movie should have been longer so that you could understand the plot a bit more though.
  In conclusion this movie is awsome! I can't wait for the dvd to come out! The music is also very good. This movie is a must see!
