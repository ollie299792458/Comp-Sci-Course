Several years ago, I got into a conversation with two friends. It was around Halloween and the subject turned to horror movies. The question was then asked, "What's your favorite vampire movie?" One friend said Salem's Lot, the other picked Bram Stoker's Dracula from 1992(Gary Oldman-Winona Ryder version). Without hesitation, I picked this film. From the moment, the opening credits come on the screen with James Bernard's chilling theme playing, you know you're watching classic horror at its finest. Christopher Lee provides the right combination of good looks, personal charm, eroticism, and at the same time animalistic terror in his portrayal of the Count. It is a performance clearly unmatched in the six sequels he later did. Peter Cushing is excellent as Professor Van Helsing, combining the perfect balance of kindness and compassion with a single minded purpose and devotion in destroying Dracula.  Michael Gough, Melissa Stribling, and Carol Marsh are terrific in supporting roles, especially Gough as Arthur Holmwood. It is an excellent retelling of the Stoker tale, although some of the elements and settings from the book are clearly omitted. The film's climax with Dracula and Van Helsing battling each other in the Count's library of the castle is the best ending to a horror film I've ever seen capping an outstaning directorial effort by Terence Fisher. I've been a huge fan of Hammer Horror most of my life and this is without a doubt their best film ever. A must see for any fan of the horror genre.
