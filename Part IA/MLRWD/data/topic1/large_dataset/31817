Why the heck release this film again packaged with 30th Anniversary printed across it with only difference being in "Gold Printing"....To Richard Fleischer or perhaps Jerry Leider, if you want to sell The Jazz Singer - the Neil Diamond version release it in the Blu-Ray Format at least!, Digitally enhance the picture quality while you're at it, and as far as I can tell all the effort that went into the sound recording aspect of the film still stands up but again with today's enhancement technology that could be improved as well, from what I remember reading somewhere there were up to 30 tracks of sound recorded during the scenes of Jess's first public appearances, now that's gotta sound pretty good through today's home theatre amp's.

And please dont use fake widescreen techniques like "Enhanced for 16x9 TV's" where the ratio is 1.85:1 talk about losing parts of the image, PLEASE use a digital anamorphic encoding procedure or a similar anamorphic technique where all pictures elements of the original 35mm film stock ARE faithfully reproduced in a Widescreen format, you can do it, lets not wait until the 40th Anniversary!....this film is worth the extra attention because you will get fans of Neil Diamond buying copies if we know the film has been given the right respect that Fans deserve and not just another "Anniversary" release....for heavens sake!
