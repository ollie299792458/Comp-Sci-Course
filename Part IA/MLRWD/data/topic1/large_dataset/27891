Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon - Ang Lee
This film has tremendous performances from Chow Yun Fat in his first action role and Michelle Yeoh as his star crossed lover.  The fight scenes are improbably dazzling and once again Yuen Wo Ping, who choreographed The Matrix makes the film a dazzling display of movement with action sequences that literally take your breath away.
The Director, Ang Lee has made the film palatable to American and European audiences.  Check out the genre change as Jen (Zhang Ziyi) chases her lover across the desert and the film magically becomes a western.
The film is primarily about traditional Chinese society and its inability to deal with the encroaching equality of Chinese women. The three main female characters all centre around the figure of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat).  They all show different kinds of female role.  Wife, Daughter and the woman who is rejected by society for her refusal to take on one of these valid roles.
The character Jade Fox is excluded from society for stealing secret wisdom, which has only previously been available to Men. Jen is allowed this knowledge only when she redeems herself by turning to her father figure Li Mu Bai.  This shows brilliantly the struggle between Chinese women and traditional influence.

Jen, the main protagonist  is fighting against traditional Chinese values in the form of an arranged marriage.  She is a gifted martial arts expert under the tuition of the rogue Jade Fox.  Li Mu Bai  wants to teach her himself.  He takes on a patriarchal role, attempting to harness Jens' skills in a legitimate way.  
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a visual masterpiece with amazing scenery and out of this world choreography.  It offers a high-quality, subtle plot with full character exploration.  The film has also won four Oscars and four Baftas, so this should be an indication of its tremendous quality. It is also the first film to bring Chinese cinema to western audiences on a blockbuster scale.
