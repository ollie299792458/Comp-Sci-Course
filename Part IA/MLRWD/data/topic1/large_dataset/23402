I'll start my review by saying of all the film's I saw from 2010- The Social Network, The Kids Are All Right, Inception, The Fighter, Toy Story 3, Salt...etc, all excellent film's btw, none had the effect on me as Black Swan.

  This is a powerful, frightening, thought-provoking, and unforgettable picture. Natalie Portman is outstanding as a truly pitiful and tortured soul, who's soul purpose in life is to be perfect. She plays it quiet, but looks as though she on the edge of exploding. This was a most deserved Oscar win. The supporting players, especially Barbara Hershey, are all excellent as well. Director Darren Aronofsky does an wonderful job at creating a claustrophobic and dream-like atmosfere, the cinematography and camera work are outstanding. And the classic, traditional Swan Lake score really makes the film work and incorporates itself beautifully. It's clear this film has people sharply divided down the middle, some find it brilliant (I'm of that camp), and some hated it. I can see that, it's not for all taste. But don't think of deterring me from my opinion. I've seen many, many films, and this is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Yes, I would call it a masterpiece.
