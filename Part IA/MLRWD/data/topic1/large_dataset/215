I caught this movie in a hotel room while on a business trip. I had never heard of the movie or Temple Grandin. First off let me say, THIS is the type of actor's role that should win an Academy Award for best actress. Claire Danes WAS Temple Grandin in this movie. If acting is the "Suspension of Disbelief" Claire nailed it.

Now for Dr. Grandin, WOW! That is all I can think of to say about such and extraordinary person!  She is the type of person our schools should be holding up as a hero, a role model and a great example.  If Temple did not have people around her who loved her and who encouraged her to try new things we would not even know who she is. Instead of being looked at as disabled or defective she was looked at as unique and inventive. God only knows how many Temple Grandins have been relegated to mental institutions where they have wasted away or worse yet were aborted and were never given the chance to enhance mankind.  Thank you Temple Grandin for being who you are!!
