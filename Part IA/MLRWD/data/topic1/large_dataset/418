I played all Wing Commander computer games and i consider myself a fan of the series. And i congratulate Chris Roberts on his long-time dream, to bring Wing Commander to the big screen. Roberts may not be a Hollywood  director, but he has something, many others lack: Vision. He created the  hole series. And his passion definitly flows through the movie. His various  allusions to Homer's Odyssey are also a nice addition. The music score is  absolutely fantastic. The themes have been composed by David Arnold, who  also composed the epic themes from Stargate and Independence Day. The  special effects are really great. Roberts own company Digital Anvil created  some effects that are on the same level as ILM effects. But the movie also  has its weeknesses. The biggest one are the Kilrathis. The look rather dull  compared to the computer game series and they appear only in two scenes.  Too bad! The storyline also has its flaws, but it is never boring.
The  actors are very good. Matthew Lillard really gets on ones nerves and J&uuml;rgen  Prochnow gets another chance to play a naval captain. (Greetings from Das  Boot!).
All in all, the movie is fun. Every SciFi fan should watch this  film.
