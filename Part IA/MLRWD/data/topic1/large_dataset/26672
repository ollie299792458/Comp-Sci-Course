I work for LCE, and was horribly dissapointed and felt like even though I saw the movie for free, I still paid too much for it.
The acting wasn't done too poorly, however the actors can never ever admit to working on this movie if they ever expect work again. The plot was extremely thin, and the horror and gore was just ... well it was stupid!
Everything about this movie was stupid, its a waste of time to go into what was done wrong in making it... its a waste of time TO HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE.
The reviewer on here who gave it 5 stars obviously saw something different from everyone else or is so far warped from seeing feardotcom that he no longer has a grasp on reality.
If you do not work for the MPAA or are a film critic, please, please, do not subject yourself to this punishment!
No 2 hour combination of multilation, child pornography, holocaust footage, dubbed episodes of sailor moon, scat-porn, or Leprechaun movies could be worse than Feardotcom, it is completely and udderly the most awful two hours anyone could make.
Worst Movie Ever.
