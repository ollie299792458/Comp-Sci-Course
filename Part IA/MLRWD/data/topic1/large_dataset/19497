Overall Good thriller, certainly not the best but satisfying.
if youve seen the trailer thts the only plot line you need to know till you actually watch the film. there are people who meet in a motel and people start dying...
the rest i dont think i ,or anyone whose seen the movie should comment on. ive seen movies which go really good the first two acts,and then fall flat in the final plot line revealing a formulaic twist. cos its the in thing. identity is different in that respect. it goes on autopilot pretty much for the first two acts then becomes ingenious on a very simple idea. 
if you know thinking movies youll have it figured somewhat.
now this film doesnt give you a big shock at the end, it nurtures you through twists delivering the final act through sense. there are clues laid throughout the film,watch everything closely.
when one says that, people think it means look at the camera framing closely or what happens in the background but i dont mean that. i mean look at each character within the plot, what their motivations are,intentions, what they do at certain times etc
the film is directed well but could be way tighter, if this film was visually stylish it would become a cult classic but James Mangold cant handle the noose around a plot's neck too well, now if David Fincher (seven,fight club) directed this, it would be very very cool. during some points the movie seems like it will go down to being laughably bad..but dont let this fool you. its deliberate. 
its somewhat an agatha christie whodunnit with hints of a slasher movie which turns the rules and stereotypes of horror/thriller films on its rear end. 
i think thats a fair review because this film is all about plot. 
its a good watch,recommended
