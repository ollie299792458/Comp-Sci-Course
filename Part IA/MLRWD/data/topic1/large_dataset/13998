For the fan of classic Cleese, you will not be disappointed.  This movie is blessed with a spectacular cast and a superb script.  The comic timing and sheer talent of the cast, make this one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever watched.  There are so many memorable scenes in this movie, it is difficult to describe without resorting to spoilers.  One thing I will say, however, is that this film has made an indellible impact on my family.  Hardly a family gathering will go by, without someone saying, "Oh do shut up, Porche!"  Some of the most hilarious scenes, in my opinion, are between Otto (Kevin Kline) and Ken (Micheal Palin).  Strangely, even though the character's are supposed to be a band of thieves, you can't help but almost root for this gang of underdogs.  Speaking of Dogs, some of the scenes may not appeal to animal lovers.  However, these scenes are handled in a fairly cartoonish and very "Monty Python" fashion, so I don't think they will insult the sensibilities of most viewers.  This movie was given an R rating, mostly for dialog and a brief view of Cleese's buttocks, but I doubt that it would even receive a PG-13 rating now.  While it is not a movie I'd recommend for young children, as the humor is likely to be over their heads, I recommend this as one of the funniest movies I've seen in the last 15 years!
