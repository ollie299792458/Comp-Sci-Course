Mark Whalberg,Tyrese Gibson,Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund star in Four Brother, the story is no so original as well, there is a lot of shoots like a old-new fashioned cowboy movie with a lot of violence and very strong language, the acting at some point is going to the mediocrity(except Terrence Howard and Mark Whalberg), with some sterotypes, Bobby Mercer(Mark Whalberg) chacter was very influential  for his family specially for his youngner brother Jack Mercer(Garrett Hedlund),the Andre Benjamin chacter wasn't so friendly and Tyrese chacter was likeable all with his diferences like a good family, their had only one objetive in this movie "kill his mother assain", in my opinion the ending is pretty confusing but not all(not a confusing ending like "Donnie Darko"), the direction was good not  at all ,I know Jonh Singelton can direct good films and this a good example of that,very pretty good movie,the DVD is loaded with a lot of excellente features i enjoyed a lot,Overall a good movie with excellent action sequences, good rental or a good buy if you like action films.
