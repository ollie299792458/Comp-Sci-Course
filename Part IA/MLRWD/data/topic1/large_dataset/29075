Sam is a high school student who lives with her mean stepmom and stepsisters. She's a straight A student, a hard worker, has a great best friend, and has an online romance. She decides to meet her online friend at the school dance, only to find out that he's the popular Austin. Sam isn't popular and has doubts about being involved with Austin.

She has a great time until she has to leave the ball and barely makes it to the diner, when Fiona (her evil stepmother) comes to check up on her. There's a lack of character development with Austin, he barely notices Sam and when he does he usually doesn't give her much time to get to know him. Austin seems a little too self-absorbed. I guess what's missing is that Chad Murray and Hilary Duff don't have chemistry.

It's also hard to buy a plot where Hilary Duff isn't popular, because she probably would be in high school with her blond hair and good looks. I think that the movie could have been better, it'll probably appeal more to teens than anyone else.
