I wanna give this 5 stars. I want to, I really do. The movie certainly deserves it, but as many others have pointed out this is flawed perfection. The quality is fine, the sound is great, there are more than a few decent extras but there's just one teeny tiny little annoying thing about this release... IT'S NOT IN WIDESCREEN!!...&lt;B>This origin story is a nonstop ride of great animation, a couple of thrills and chills, a few laughs and some awesome action. Not to mention some of the coolest dialogue. It elegantly introduces the three superheroes in a way that makes it easy to hop on board the powerpuff express for all the newbees while the older fanbase have lots of in-references and origin secrets to keep them smiling. Great stuff except it's NOT IN WIDESCREEN!! Sorry, but with a design like this it really loses some of the quality when you crop the sides of the image. Not to mention the framing gets all off balance. Hey, WB, here's a tip for you: Powerpuff girls target audience is NOT 5 year old girls who can't digest their saturday morning cartoons if they don't fill the hole tv screen. Contrary to what you may think their biggest audiences are MALES age 10-30 and we DON'T appreciate you slicing and dicing our favorite animated characters. PLEASE give us a speciel widescreen edition. Not this cropped and trimmed PAN & SCAN [crud]. Sheesh...
