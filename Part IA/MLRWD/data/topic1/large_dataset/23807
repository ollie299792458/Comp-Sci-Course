The film was viewed on a 50" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player. The AQ and PQ are both crisp and clean. Unfortunately I missed the film on the festival circuit, but am glad I finally had a chance to see it. Sam Rockwell does an absolutely fantastic job playing dual "roles", and the special features which discuss the technical aspects of achieving such shots, as well as the entire look of the film, with a relatively small budget, are very interesting. If you're interested in film at all, from its technical aspects, you may like to investigate the featurettes, especially on the visual elements. Another striking element of the film is its score. Though simple and repeating, for me, it matches the isolation, repetitiveness and loneliness of Sam's character, as well as his predicament, very well. The twist in the film is not necessarily shocking but blends into the story seamlessly and further elevates the film as a modern sci-fi film with a quiet, yet powerful temperament. It's not your typical "trapped in space, with a creature" type film, and without giving anything away, it is an interesting character study, psychologically, as well as visually. The film was shot for 5 million, and for its objective of shooting a sci-fi film with interesting visual elements, I found it to be very visually appealing. Definitely check this one out, it may surprise you.
