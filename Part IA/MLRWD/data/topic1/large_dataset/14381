To start off, I have to say that this movie is wonderful.  People had been reccomending it to me for what felt like years, but I never got around to watching it.  Finally, I saw it, and I have to say that I am sorry that I waited.  Jeff Bridges was awesome as "The Dude," and John Goodman could not have played his role better as Walter, the Viet Nam vet bowling psychopath. But there was something strange at the beginning of this movie that I wonder if anyone else might have noticed.  In the beginning, we see "The Dude" buying a few groceries, for which he pays by check.  The date on the check is September 11th.  Stranger still however is that seconds after we see the check, we see a shot of a TV screen behind the cashier which displays George Bush, the original George Bush.  The first thing that comes out of his mouth is the statement: "This act will not stand," referring to a situation in Kuwait.  So everyone who has it run out and double check this, and anyone who doesn't buy it now and see one of the funniest, and most visually stunning movies ever.
