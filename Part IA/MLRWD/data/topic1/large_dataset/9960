Finally season one of Will and Grace is available sadely there is not much special features. For special features there is an interview with the cast and themend features. Now with the story of the show Will & Grace are best friends. Will is a gay lawyer and Grace is a straight interior designer. They both live in New York. Grace is engaged to a real jerk, but when that relationship falls apart, she moves in with Will. This is only supposed to be until Grace finds a place of her own, but she and Will end up with each other as permanent roommates. Also in the cast are Jack, Will's flamboyant gay friend and Karen, Graces' secretary/assistant who doesn't really need to work because she married money several times. Sean Hayes plays Jack and he dose a great job and I think is one of the funniest charactors/actors to be on tv. Megan Mullally plays Karen who also is one of the best charactors/actresses to hit tv. Season one is the best season of the hit tv show which is currently on it's 8 which is it's final season. You'll laugh your head off watching this season.
