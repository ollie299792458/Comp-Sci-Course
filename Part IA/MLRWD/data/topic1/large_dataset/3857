This Movie is the first review for me on a movie so please bare with me. Ghostbusters the Movie is one Super Movie. Many ideas in this movie were based on the study of Ghosts and such. Much of the charctor of this movie that Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and Sigourney Weaver add a great depth to the charctors and plot of this movie. There seems to be nothing lacking in this movie. Even the music in the movie is classic. Let me now review this dvd in detail:Movie charctors: This is where this movie stood out the most. Bill Really knew how to make the humor come out. There is so much to talk about in this movie. The extra charctors for little screens is another thing that made this movie such a hit.  ..  . . .100% Movie Plot: The story is pretty good tho I sometimes question some screens and over all I had wished they had left in the Pott /Ramis love thing. It hurt a tad. But over all this movie has a great Plot. . . . .95%  Movie effects: Some of the best of the 80's anyways. Most effects worked great and made the movie work but once or twice I didn't really think the effect really did it's job.  . . . .90%Dvd features: This one is good on this note. The deleted Scenes were not so good to me but the Commentary did work well. The drawings you also get to see really shows you how deep this movie was.  . . . . .95%If you like this movie I suggest: Ghostbusters 2, Candyshack, SNL in the 70's - early 80's.
