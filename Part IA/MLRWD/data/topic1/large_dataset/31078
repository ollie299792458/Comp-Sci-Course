Don't waste your time!

This movie is terrible- Sean tries to save it but unlike most of his work, this movie has virtually nothing to recommend it! The only good thing is a few [less then 5] minutes of prety everglade pictures and a feisty grandma!

Do not waste your time with this clunker!!!

I found myself trying to turn it off several times and now strongly wish I'd followed those impulses as I feel as it I wasted almost 2 hours of my life. The first two thirds of the movie is spent with one of the most unrealistic view of the judicial system that Ive had the misfortune of seeing recently. Frankly, Law and Order is more realistic and often has a better plot and better writing!

It makes presumptions that make it look easy to get out of jail when we know its not. The last third is spent wishing the bad guy would just win so you can get to the end. There is no surprise at where this movie takes you and it must have been written by a neo-nazi or white supremacist.

The bad guys motive is so undeveloped that it put this movie into the racist catalog. Is this perhaps an understandable revenge[against a character so unsympathetic I was rooting for it's death]? Or was the motive a psycho-serial killing? The answer: both- is what makes this a truly rancid turkey!
