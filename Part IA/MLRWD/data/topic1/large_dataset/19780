This is the first film I have been tempted to give 5 stars to. I just don't know about 5 star ratings. People seem to give them out so readily, and I am not so inclined to see perfection in everything that I like. This one, though, is a close bet. After some serious consideration and re-viewing of classic Holmes films, I really believe this to be the absolute best film, of both the Sherlock Holmes character and of the Jack the Ripper story.
I don't need to add to the chorus of people giving synopses of the movie, but I feel compelled to share my glee that this has finally received the class A DVD treatment. I first saw this when it was released theatrically, and managed to catch it a few times over the years on HBO or some other movie channel. I have so many good memories associated with this film. The cast is fantastic (special nod to James Mason and Genevieve Bujold), the ambience and look of the film is exemplary and really takes you to the foggy dank East End of Victorian England. It is spooky, funny, thrilling and pastoral all at once.
I implore you, if you have any interest in this time period, Ripperology or Holmes, do not wait any longer to get your hands on this. Things of this quality have a tendency to be underappreciated and go out of print, as this was for so many years.
