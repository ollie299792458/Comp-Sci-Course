I didn't expect to like this movie. Reading the description it seemed kind of like a purely guy thing- a la "Saving Private Ryan." But it turned out to be a pretty good historical tale of a very turbulent time in English history.

This is the story of the second English civil war between the royalists and the parliament. More specifically it's the tae of Oliver Cromwell and the general of the parliamentary forces, Fairfax. Fairfax's background is royalist, as is his wife, and they have problems reconciling themselves to the new world and lack of power of the king.  Soon they betray Cromwell, though they mean well but in the end it is Cromwell who in his lust for power destroys the very goal they were fighting for. A republic.

The costumes and sets are great, the acting is very good and while the script is a little cheesy (and I think compressed in timeline of the real protectorate) all in all this movie is worth watching if you're into history, an anglophile or a particular fan of any of the actors in the movie.

Four stars.
