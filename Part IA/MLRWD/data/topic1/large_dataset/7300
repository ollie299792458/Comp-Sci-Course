My understanding is that only 17 episodes will be on this DVD.

You will see on most episode guides that 17 episodes were shown for Season 1. However 22 episodes were actually made but only 17 aired because of the success on Grey's Anatomy when it first in America. The final 5 episodes were shown at the start of Season 2 so they just appear to be Season 2 episodes. Some of the episodes were reworked so that it looks like the new cast members were part of this. If you look carefully, the new characters in Season 2 do not actually appear on screen with the old characters of Season 1 (Monica Potter, Rhona Mitra). In fact those leftover 5 episodes were so butchered that they were merged into 4 episodes. The episode "Race to Ipsa" actually has never aired.

Anyway, it would have been nice to the DVD be released with either the full 22 episodes of Season 1 as intially made for television OR have the 17 episodes on the DVD with a 'bonus' 5 episodes in the special features section.
