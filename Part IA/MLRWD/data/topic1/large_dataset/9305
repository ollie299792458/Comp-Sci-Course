Johnny Deep never seems to get the recognition he deserves. He is a talented actor...don't agree?  well this is america, I'll let it slide. In  my opinion though Johnny is a good actor. He picks roles he likes, that  interest him and perhaps that is why he isn't a hollywood golden boy. He  was a busy boy though last year; sleepy hollow, arstonauts wife and this  little seen movie The Ninth Gate. A movie about a guy looking for a book?  That is going to be interesting?  Well yes, especially when it is believed  that the book was partly written by satan and hold untold power. The movie  revolves around Deep's character Dean Corso a rare book dealer contracted  to authenticate a very rare book and search out the other possible copies.  His search leads him in theft, murder, and satanic cults. It holds your  interest (or at least it did mine). Unfortunately I found the ending a bit  anticilmatic. I would say it ruined the movie, however after following  Corso on such an interesting and twisting journey I was hoping for more of  a pay off.
