Prince puts on a [good] show with his new skin-tight NPG band. This DVD is much more entertaining that the Rave concert, because you can tell that it comes from the heart, and is comprised mainly of new music_ even some excellent cover tunes.  The Rave DVD was more of a " Las Vegas" style show with all the hits lined up, but this one reads as new and exciting material. Personal favorite: Strolling/ U want Me.  It's refreshing to hear a new song about something other than god, these days. U Want Me is so Saturday-Night-Sexy and Silky Smooth_ great jazzy flava. This concert isn't preachy_ it's just really funky ( for lack of a better word at midnight). Eric Leeds may look like a professor these days, and he'll teach you things on sax too_ he's still da Bomb.  Also, I have no problems with the sound quality.  I understand the picture quality to be conceptual as the visual style of the DVD_ I'm surpirsed that some people didn't get that.  I highly recommed this work. More than merits a review, but a view.
