This is a powerful, beautiful film I originally saw at my local film festival and found out it was nominated for an Oscar in 2005.  I'm not sure why it took so ridiculously long for this film to come out in a Region 1 DVD, but this is one that you should not miss!

Daniel (played by the remarkable Michael Nyqvist) is a world-renowned orchestra conductor who must leave his glittering lifestyle on the world stage because of a health problem (a weak heart).  He decides to go back to the village where he was raised to live quietly, although we find out his childhood there was not ideal.  His plans for solitude and quiet are thwarted when the local church choir seeks his opinion on their musical ability and he cannot say no.

Daniel's involvement in the music and the lives of the choir members of this small village becomes an amazing journey you shouldn't miss.  Because of his influence in these people's lives, what had been left alone or hidden beneath the surface starts to be known and acted out or acted upon.  Things happen!  The film provides much to ponder about human nature and behaviors.  This is no Swedish chick flick.

Others I know who saw this film also loved it.  One woman said it was the best movie she had ever seen, and a man I know was surprised by how impressive this film was.  I highly recommend this film for the experience it will give you!
