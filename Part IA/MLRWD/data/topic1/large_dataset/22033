I've looked at this film many times and have just received the DVD. I was never a big fan of Barbara Stanwyck or Clifton Webb but in this film they are both wonderful. Instead of trying to tell too many stories as some Titanic films have, this keeps it simple and absolutely heart rending. I am not a weeper at films but the end of this film always makes me cry. Maybe it's the stark beautifully photographed B&W but from first scene to the last you can't look away. What was it Norma Desmond said in Sunset Boulevard? "we had faces". In this version of Titanic, even the little boy had such an expressive face that it was amazing to watch.  Every role was a jewel of casting and performance. Who cares that it wasn't specifically accurate? This film takes you there and makes you care. I know that everyone says that "A Night to Remember" was much more accurate but it just wasn't as good a film. I thought all of the Special Features were wonderful except the commentary by the film critic. He can't say more than two words without saying "uh" which is terribly annoying. The other commentary is excellent and the documentary about Titanic is great.
