I am a big R&J fan.

The version with Clair and Leo is my very favorite. why? it nicely contemporises everything in the world of verona italy, making the characters seem more real and understanding than ever before.

Leo and Clair's chemistry is to die for as the pair cuddle in bed the morning after their wedding night . ..

"Then let me be taken! let me be put to death! i have more care to stay than will to go! come death and welcome! juliet wills it so!"

and when romeo and juliet meet for the first time at the party, they see each other through the opposite sides of a fish tank and the flirting is heart melting.

"Did my heart love til now?" romeo whispers to himself as he watches juliet dance reluctantly with her future fiancee.

Mercutio gives an outstanding performance and is the most memorable mercutio yet. he brings the character to life and is more real and vibrant almost than anyother charcter in the play. in other words, he steals the spotlight and runs with it.

if you won't buy this movie, you'll want to after you rent it. it's a tale that will leave goosepimples up the backs of your arms as bodies are carted away and the prince bellows at who he feels are the culprits.

"All! Are! Punished!"
