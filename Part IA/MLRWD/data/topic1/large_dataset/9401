MAN! This movie creeps the hell of me!!!

Of course! like most of the horror movies, is low budget! BUT is still a good film! I mean... The picture quality is VERY clear, the "baby monster" desing was VERY CREEPY (I don't understand why most people don't see it that way), the sound quality was good and the acting was also good but don't expect an oscar-winning acting.

The reason that this movie is HORRIBLE is that the concept is very scary! I mean... This baby is an UGLY one with fangs, claws and horrible baby wails! eww!, when the baby or monster come out of his mother he kills every doctor on the room! and then while his parents are suffering he is out in the town killing everyone he sees by CHEWING THEM!! OH MY GOD!! The movie is also VERY BLOODY! (specially the milkman scene), the corpes that the baby left are chewed and all cover with BLOOD!! HAHAHA!! There are a lots of killings on this movie so be prepared to enjoy some dead fest! HAHAHA!!

P.S: The ONLY thing that I didn't like was that the gory scenes were so fast that you could hardly see the killings, but is still BLOODY and SICK as hell!

Adios!
