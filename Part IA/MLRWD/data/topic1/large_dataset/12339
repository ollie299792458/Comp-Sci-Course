Where do I begin? Quarantine is a hit-and-miss.  I'm not comparing Quarantine to REC. I'm not saying that the movie producers can't come up with an original idea. I'm just saying I expected more from a American remake of REC. My friend told me that this movie is more violet than REC, which is undeniably true. However, that the only good part. Everything else feels like the cast was just going through the motions. Like they didn't actually plan out the movie, at least not the scary parts. This movie lacks the excitement that a person feels when they feel trapped. What the hell am I saying? I saying this movie doesn't get me rallied up to see the scary parts. It just feels like a Saw movie, you know what comes next and you couldn't care less. Scary movies are about getting revved up and being scared like there's no tomorrow. This movie displayed no excitement of any sort. Who cares? Well, as a prominent fan of horror movies, I can say that this movie is just garbage. It's like watching "An idiot abroad" doing a Halloween special guest starring Ricky Gervais. That's an retarded observation! Well, you can't tell me this movie doesn't feel like watching "An idiot abroad" doing a Halloween special guest starring Ricky Gervais. Honest to God, I began watching Quarantine expecting it to be amazing, and yet, it failed to deliver.
