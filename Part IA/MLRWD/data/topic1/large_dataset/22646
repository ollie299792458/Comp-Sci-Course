This original 1931 classic has seen several releases over the past twenty something years. First on VHS with restored footage that had been deleted by censors in 1931 including Dr Frankenstein's ecstatic delivery of the line: "In the name of God, now I know what it is to be God!" The Legacy Collection from 2004 gave us an improved picture, some related extras, and other original Universal titles that include the name Frankenstein like "Bride of.." "Son of.." "Ghost of..' and "House of...".  And now we have the 75th Anniversary version with even better picture and sound as well as many of the extras included on previous versions with the addition of the wonderful feature documentary "Universal Horror." While I consider the multi-film Legacy set to be the best deal because of content, this 75th anniversary version is worth buying as well because of the the improved transfer and added documentary. I expected a 75th Anniversary release of 'Bride of Frankenstein" since there is a newly restored print avialable but since we are one week from Halloween with no word it doesn't seem likely.
