MASH is one of my top 10 favorite TV Shows of all time and it is a joy to see the antics of these Mobile Army Surgical Hospital doctors.  I am not a big fan of seasons 1-3 because the characters seem to too cartoonish for me and story lines seem a little weak.  I guess the producers wanted to keep close to the movie which was a little on the corny side.  With these faults, the show remains a classic for all generation and the dialogue is rather simple to understand.  Season 1 set the tone for the introduction part of the show to millions of viewers.

If I rated Films or TV Series based on whether I liked them, I would have rated the entire series a 5 or a 6, but I rarely do this.  Each episode is high quality and the sound is great.  They bring back the joy I originally had when I first saw them minus the commercials (which are really not that important.)  One problem exists the DVD itself dose not have a lot of features.  You can not "play all", there are no filmographies or even a list of the extra and cameos that made M*A*S*H one of the best shows.  It would have been more interesting to see where all those extras went off to do.

I highly recommend the series with these limitations.

Enjoy
