I thought this documentary was quite good in terms of the number and different types of births shown. When they say "orgasmic birth," I  feel they are trying to explain an undefined feeling that occurs when birth happens. Birth is sexual and many people fail to realize that. This documentary celebrates that fact. Like sex it can be clumsy at first but once you get the hang of it you're set. Many women orgasm during labor. The film is not telling you to "get off on your child's birth." The film is describing the incredible and pleasurable feelings that occur within your mind and body while birth is happening. There's pain from the contractions, slight pleasure from the pushing, and something else you cannot describe. The indescribable feeling is the "orgasm." It is an unearthly feeling to give birth naturally. Besides the sexual orgasm of birth can't always be avoided seeing as the baby's huge and passes over you g-spot(it's a matter of sensitivity I think.) Some women have it, some don't, and only one person actually feels it in the film. She kind of goes on forever. Other than that the film is sweet, funny, difficult, and spiritual. There isn't enough information from the notable people in the film. Great if you just want to see a number of births on one DVD. Not too informative but that's what books are for.
