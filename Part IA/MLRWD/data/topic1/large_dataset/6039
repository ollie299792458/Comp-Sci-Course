Preamble: Had this production appeared on HBO or ABC I would have considered it an entertainment, and given it 4 or 4.5 stars. But it was produced on the History channel, and claimed extraordinary adherence to historical accuracy. So, by the criteria of the production itself, this item is being reviewed as a dramatic historical documentary rather than an entertainment.
It is a ludicrous fictional account of the feud that follows none of the scholarly research (Waller, Rice, Pearce, Alther, T. McCoy, C. Hatfield). But it looks real good, so it will be believed, and will define the feud for all time to come. ps, I grew up in Pikeville, and know the history intimately.
Examples: The battle of Grapevine Creek was the result of a Phillips incursion into West Virginia, not a rescue attempt by the Hatfields. No rescue was ever attempted. Anse and Ranel NEVER confronted each other with firearms.
Asa Harmon was noted for his sobriety, and Ranel did NOT become a drunk after his cabin was attacked.
Nancy McCoy had 2 children by Johnse and did not leave him until he tried to kill her. Twice.

Ranel McCoy was in no muster list for any military unit during the Civil War, and did not serve with Anse. Local tradition has it that he formed a Home Guard (militia/vigilance) unit in 1863, was immediately captured by Union troops, and spent the war in an Ohio prison camp. But even this cannot be proven.

As noted by a correspondent,his grave marker and other documentation, they even get McCoy's name wrong. He was born Randolph. He was called Ranel or Ran'l. He was never called Randall.

I could go on for pages, but will summarize this way. This has all the historical accuracy of a Kevin Kostner movie. Oh, wait.
