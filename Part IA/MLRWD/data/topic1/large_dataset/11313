This movie was highly recommended to me while living in Japan by nearly everyone I met. Originally released in theaters in 1988...and it being 1994 at the time I scouted the local video stores and purchased a copy.
Was I blown away.
The movie opens 21 Sept 1945, in a train station in Kobe, Japan. A young delirious boy, dying of malnutrition calls his dead sisters name one last time before joining her. Two janitors cleaning the train station and piling up corpses for burning noticed that Seita has just expired. Before placing his body atop the other corpses they go thru his pockets to find anything of value. They find a tin candy can with ashes and bones for contents. Deeming it worthless one of the janitors pitches the can into a nerby rice patty. Seitas body is burned and a few moments later the narration begins by young Seita as two fireflies fly out of the can.
The movie was written and directed by Isao Takahata, who published a book in 1968 by the same name. He lost his sister Setsko in the war and never forgive himself for not being able to save her.
This movie was crafted with love and dedication and the animation portrays that in every scene. You must add this to your collection. Never has any movie so moved me....
