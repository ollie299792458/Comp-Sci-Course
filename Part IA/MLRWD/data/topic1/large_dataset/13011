First of all, let me first establish the fact that this anime is based on a shounen manga...which translates to:

THIS IS A KID'S ANIME.

That's right. Shounen anime/manga is a means of entertainment that targets young boys ranging from elementary school age to 18 years of age. Yes, that's on the same level as Pok&eacute;mon if that's what you're thinking. Anyway, having said that, if you are expecting a "Ghost in the Shell/Ninja Srcoll/Basalisk"-esque plot then prepare to be disappointed. Again, it's a kid's anime-- chalk full of over-the-top antics, slightly perverted humor, and lots of blatant ninja clich&eacute;s.

I don't mind any of that stuff. I love this anime and tons of others (and this is coming from a young woman who put's Darwin's 'Origin of Species' pretty high up there on her good reads list). Simple things can be quite enjoyable if given a chance. I think that Naruto should be given a chance. If you'd rather test it out before purchasing however, simply reserve 30-minutes of your time to Cartoon Network and check out an episode. Easy, yes?
