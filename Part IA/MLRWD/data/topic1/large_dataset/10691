This movie's comedy is not everyone's cup of tea because it's very unique. This is a very random film and it takes a real lover of Will Ferrell (and a person with unique sense of humor) to laugh it "ow now brown cow" and "the human torch was denied a bank loan." But if you like that sort of thing, then you will absolutely love this film. I did.

Pairing David Koechner, Steve Carell and Will Ferrell made a great cast, plus the addition of many other fine actors, although I myself don't really care for Fred Armisen. Later on, Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins appear in the Battle of the Newsteams, which is one of the high points of the film. Brick Tamland (Carell) and his absolute stupidity are hilarious, like the times when he is, out of no where, just holding a grenade, when he says the most idiotic things like "I love lamp" and "I'm Brian Fantana", and when he kills the "guy with a trident."

I personally believe that the dialogue and the "Afternoon Delight" song are what made this film. To hear Will Ferrell's take on what "San Diego" means is highly amusing. I love everything about this film, honestly. Ferrell's rendition of "Aqualung" by J-Tull was also pretty nice.

If you don't like random dialogue and you prefer a more intelligent comedy, don't buy or watch this film. If you like Ferrell's work in Talladega Nights (directed by the same man, Adam McKay) and his brand of comedy, then you will love this movie.
