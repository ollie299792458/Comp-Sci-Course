I got this DVD after reading all the praises for it, and because I found myself less than satisfied by both the M&uuml;ller and Ponnelle Tristans. What a big mistake that was. Patrice Chereau's production here is certainly unconventional and in the first act I find myself annoyed by the numerous sailors on stage distracting the attention from the principal singers. Then there's that bleeding Isolde which of course doesn't make much sense, but opera production has always been a love it or hate it affair, so I guess some people will end up llking this production.

But the real killer of this Tristan is Ian Storey, is he singing as Tristan or King Marke? My god, his vocals is beyond awful, can't he at the very least sound like a tenor trying to give good vocals? Unless you are a big fan of Kermit the frog's singing I suspect you will feel the same way too about his vocals. And that guy who plays Kurwenal was quite weak too, together these 2 make the third act a real chore to listen to. DeYoung was alright but nothing great, Salminen and Meier of course delivers but can't save the production from the rest of the cast.

All in all, considering that this Tristan is about 7 bucks more expensive than the other Tristans it's hard to recommend this Tristan. Does anyone know of a Tristan that's better than the M&uuml;ller and Ponnelle DVDs? I'll try the Lehnhoff DVD next but it's more expensive than the rest.
