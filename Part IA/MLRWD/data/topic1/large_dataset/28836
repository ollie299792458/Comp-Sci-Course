I - along with an untold number of others - have been waiting a very long time for this movie. We have been following it from the time it was announced Colin Firth would be in the movie (February 2004). We followed the production - scouring the internet and everywhere else for pictures and all the details we could find. We waited as the original release (Easter 2005) was delayed and then the US folks waited even longer as it opened here three months after the UK.
Owning a website, I had quite a bit of advance knowledge of the context of the film, but I have already been 4 times. I went opening day to the first showing. Later that night I took my daughter (well, she's 27, but still loved it). The next day my husband wanted to go (he likes Kelly M) and couldn't say enough good things about it. I have since gone by myself once more. Once in awhile you just want to sit back and be entertained. You don't want a movie that you have to pick at or pick apart. Nanny fits the bill. This is a movie for all ages. I never go to childrens movies anymore, but I wouldn't classify it as such.
I'm a bit weary of the Mary Poppins comparisons. This movie stands on its own as "Nanny McPhee."
I'd just like to add a side note about Colin Firth. He doesn't and hasn't always played the romantic lead. Take some time and check out his dramatic works, which he has done more of than romances and/or comedies. If you missed the last 3 dramas he was in 'Girl With a Pearl Earring - 2004' 'Trauma - 2004' and 'Where The Truth Lies - 2005,' give them a looksee and then go for some of his older works. The man is talented and versatile.
Of the overall acting in this film, you couldn't have cast it any better.
