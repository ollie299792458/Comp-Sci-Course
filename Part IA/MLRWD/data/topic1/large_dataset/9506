When Camelot was produced in 1967, I was in the Army.  I first heard the title song when my room mate had it playing on his reel to reel tape player at Two Rock Ranch Station in Petaluma, California and was immediately smitten by the music.  I was discharged from the service in Oakland, California and returned to St. Louis, Missouri via Los Angeles where I was given a tour of the Warner Bros Seven Arts Studios in Burbank.  The throne room set was then in the process of being disassembled and I could tell that the artists who had created the wet rock wall effect which consumed an entire sound stage had been very good at their craft.  I had no idea what the signifigance of that visit was until I returned home to see the film at a local theater.  The music, the sets, the acting, the singing, and the story all come together to create and experience that you remember forever.  Franco Nero and Vanessa Redgrave did, in fact, fall in love during the production and had a son.  I also remember reading that a stunt man had been killed during the filming of the jousting scenes.  I guess I'm still old school for when I was able to buy this film on DVD, I felt that I was cheating the wonderful people who created it.  I was never a great fan of the musical, but this movie is truly in my top ten list of best films ever made.  Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
