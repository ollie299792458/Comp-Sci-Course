Although dating from 1947, this film is in no way "dated."  It is sweet, funny, and ultimately moving in its limning of the meaning of Christmas.  It's hard to believe that the cast could be bettered.  Cary Grant could, of course, capture an audience by reciting a telephone book, but here he's not just reciting anything.  He's completely convincing in his portrayal of the angel Dudley.  His co-stars, Loretta Young and David Niven, are equally convincing in their roles, and there are no weak links in the supporting cast, although I cannot resist noting the special pleasures provided by Monty Woolley and Elsa Lanchester.  And a real salute goes to the young actress (I'm sorry I don't know her name) who appears as Debbie.  I usually have an urge to strangle most child actors and actresses, but not this one.  She's utterly natural and believable, and she deserves large kudos.  (The boys in the snowball fight are also good, but their appearance is too brief to be singled out more.)  This film has become a Christmas classic, and one viewing shows why the distinction is fully deserved.
