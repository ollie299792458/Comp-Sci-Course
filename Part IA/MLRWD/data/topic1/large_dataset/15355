...and this is one of those films. It is both hilarious and touching. It is also one of the most realistic films about teenage life that I have ever seen. Ellen Page is amazing. I loved her in "Hard Candy" - her performance, not her character - and I loved her in this film as well. She IS Juno, and you care for this young lady and her ordeal. Ellen Page is an amazing actress, and I cannot wait to see her future films. The rest of the cast is also excellent. One thing that must be mentioned here is the writing. It is so funny and so honest, and all I have to say is that screenwriter, Diablo Cody, is a genius when it comes to words. Some people have said that this film is derivative of Wes Anderson's work, but I totally disagree. It is Jason Reitman's best film so far, and I liked this one better than "Thank You For Smoking". The music is also very quirky, and I liked it a lot...

Please, do not miss the chance to see this one in the theatre! You will laugh your head off, and you will come out of it deeply moved. I loved this film!

SEE IT!
