Those who read my reviews know that I judge a horror movie on the basis of my JUMP FACTOR. If you saw Part One you know what this is about, and if you didn't I am not going to spoil it. So, I'll break down my rating:

New Ideas Since Part One: 1  ---  Nothing really. It is a continuation of the original.

Writing/Acting: 3  ---  Not a lot of room for big action, but nuance acting was poor. Not much story/plot here. Typical.

Speed at which movie gets going: 3  ---  A little too much time on the initial "search" scene, after that, it's ON!

Ability to draw audience into movie: 5  ---  I felt like I was right there in the caves with them!

Comic Interlude: 3  ---  "Now I wish I was back in water.."

Blood/Gore/Disgust: 5  ---  Most definitely!

Jump Factor: 5  ---  I knew what to expect, even so, some scenes made me jump!

Sex Appeal (Ms. Mendoza Only): 5  ---  Splunkin'!

Action Sequences: 5  ---  Part One was great because of the fight scenes. This one carries that tradition!
