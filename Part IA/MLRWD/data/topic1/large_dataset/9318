I picked up Volume 1 and Volume 3 of the A & C sets yesterday, 10/23/04, at Suncoast and I hate to say it but there are still defective copies floating around. I went to watch my favorite A & C film last night, Hold That Ghost, and lo and behold, the disc is defective. On one of my players, a top of the line Malata, the film wouldn't play at all and you bearely hear the skipping audio over the menu screen. I tried it in my other player, a top of the line Sony, and the same thing. No play and audio over the menu screen. Finally, I tried it in my cheap Samsung and the Universal opening logo actually came up but then the transfer just froze, broke up and pixilated. I had to settle for watching Who Done It? and although it played, the audio was terrible and it wasn't because it's an old movie, the audio transfer portion of the release for this film was just poorly done. It breaks up and fades in and out throughout the film even while being played on my Sony home theater system. Buyer beware!!! A poor product from Universal!!!
