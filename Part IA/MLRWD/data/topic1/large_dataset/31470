I need to say that I saw this production of "La Sonnambula" at the Met with Dessay and Florez. Was I confused by the staging? Yes, a little, not enough to spoil the evening. But, I never dreamed that I would hear and see performances that would come close to the famous Sutherland/Pavarotti recording.

Dessay and Florez were superb (both singing and acting) the night I saw "La Sonnambula." The modern dress helped me believe that their characters were really in love in a way that seldom happens in opera. This DVD was filmed at a different performance. But I suspect I was slightly disappointed in the DVD only because watching an opera live, especially with two charismatic stars, is not the same as watching in a neighborhood theater, PBS or DVD.

After viewing the DVD several times, here are some other observations: pro: my confusion about the staging was easily resolved by the end of Act One, Michele Pertusi, Jennifer Black and the chorus give fine performances, how I wish Bellini could have written more operas so Dessay and Florez could do this again and again; anti: the setting is basic and never changes much, except for the two sleep walking scenes.

Mary Zimmermann's production did work completely for me, but I understand her reasoning. For the several reviewers who mentioned that Zimmerman was booed on the opening night, you must really be upset at the way operas are often staged in Europe. This was pretty mild.

So finally buy the DVD for Dessay and Florez. Even if you do not like the staging you will get your money's worth by just listening, although you shall miss two of the most attractive singers in opera today.
