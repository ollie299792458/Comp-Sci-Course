This movie is one of the best Disney movies created in animation. First off, Megara was there making all the other Disney Heroines cower at her feet because she is more tough and witty then they would ever be, and she is so different from all of them. Sure, this story is totally off the original myth, but it teaches kids to compare and contrast from the real thing if you put it that way. I absolutly love the style of music, with the Muses and all the other inspirational songs such as Go the Distance. I Won't Say (I'm in Love) was sung beautifully by Susan Egan. Her voice brought out the attitude and sass in Meg, and how perfect the hunky naiveness in Hercules is. The romance between those two is amazing, better then other Disney Classics. The colors and animation is one of the best seen, and I have to say nods to Disney on this. It's a true shame, it didn't get more welcoming then it should have. Way to skip it's tenth annaversary in 2007 also Disney, no offense. But come on, this DVD needs more EXTRAS!!!!!!!
