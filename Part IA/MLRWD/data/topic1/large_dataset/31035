Perusing the wall of "New Releases" at Blockbuster Video - and being overwhelmed by the sheer wretchedness of the available inventory, I was forced me to give this video, "The Cell", a try.  Hey, my wife likes 'serial killer' movies and, wow, this movie purports to explore the inner psyche of just such a demented character.  Later that evening, after my wife and I had muddled through this lousy film, I was inspired to warn my fellow amazoners.  This film blows.  First, much more than one would expect, this is a conventional, dopey, "FBI guy trying to track down the sadistic, vicious killer" type movie.  In this one, our killer likes to videotape his victims drowning in a glass cell and then watch the tape while torturing himself. Eeewww!  The twist is Jennifer Lopez, who works in a lab which allows her character to enter the dreams others.  When our killer psycho goes catatonic, it is up to Jay Lo to enter his dreams to find out where his latest (soon to be drowned) victim has been hidden.  Sound a bit familiar?  Actually, there is not a single shred of originality to be found in this film - anywhere.  The dream sequences are visually striking but pointless.  What do we learn about this vicious murderer?  He's actually a cute little boy deep down inside, and if his mean old dad hadn't abused him when he was little (by, among other things, holding his head underwater for too long WHEN HE WAS BEING BAPTIZED), he wouldn't have turned out being such a bad bloke after all.  Leave it to Hollywood to turn a baptism into a brutal scene of child abuse.  What else does one expect after years of such moronic offensiveness?  The performances are just plain tired.  Vince Vaughn acts like he can't believe his own lines.  Jay Lo, honestly, isn't much of an acting talent - but she is pretty and puts on lavish costumes for the dream sequences.  Overall, this one is a "thumbs down."
