I was going to write a long review about how much I loved ANTM on TV, an how disappointed I was in the DVD. I was going to go on a rant about censorship, and how a reality show should never be censored for television if it is being marketed for DVD. I was going to write a long review about all of these things, but then I thought "why bother"? no body cares anyway. Viacom doesn't care, UPN doesn't care, and CBS doesn't care. this is what happens when billion dollar conglomerates control Hollywood. they don't give a rats ass about the audience, and they just what to sell us low quality DVD's like this. if they ever put season 2 on DVD, I hope they put a bit more effort into it than they did season 1.

my wish list for season 2:

1. uncensored video footage.

2. two audio tracks, one censored for TV, and the other uncensored for DVD.

3. extra video footage that was never aired on TV, and extended judging panel footage, similar to the extra videos that are shown on the website.

4. photo gallery, and model biography, and a where are they now text bio.

5. a video introduction to every episode by tyra banks, or at least one of the producers.
