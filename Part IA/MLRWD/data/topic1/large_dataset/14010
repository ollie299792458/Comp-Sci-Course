Yep!!  This Horror movie fanboy since the age of 8 finally got himself in a Horror movie.  Being behind the scenes and speaking with one of the co-writers made me appreciate just how hard it is to make a movie.

Two thumbs up and an extra dismembered thumbs up from me.

It's a made-for-TV movie.  I enjoyed being in it more than my right nut and watching it was SO cool.  Especially seeing myself multiple times.  WHOO HOO!!!!

And all you naysayers?  *Pfft*  Relax.  There are far, far, far worse movies out there.  And, I'm talking movies that had multi-million dollar budgets which Zombie Apocalypse did not have.  Zombie Apocalypse pulled off exactly what it was supposed to do: be a zombie movie that had a few new twists and homages to previous zombie flicks.

I'm buying this movie in all it's formats.  Blu-ray, regular DVD, iTunes, etc.  I don't recommend everyone do that.  But, I do recommend at least the regular DVD version if not just from iTunes.
