What can top Raoul Julia in "Overdrawn at the Memory Bank" (yes, Public Television at its finest) asking the eternal question: "Ma, 'my nuts?"  At least there are bits of Casablanca thrown in here and there, and everyone gets to pretend they're in a much better film.

Space Mutiny is also a riot - if you believe that space takes place entirely inside a warehouse, with speed demons riding souped up golfcarts.  Plus, this film features one of the few meetings where anything was actually accomplished.

Girl in the Gold Boots is also quite funny, with a star who stands out because he just doesn't care much about anything, and he's the one with the most redeeming qualities.

I disagree with the other reviewers who panned Hamlet.  First, even if Mike and the bots aren't as funny here as they are in other episodes, my understanding is that the underlying story is considered pretty good.  And heck, when else are you going to get the chance to laugh all the way through Hamlet starring Maximilian Schell?  Look at it this way, if you or your kids are required to watch a film of Hamlet, this is the one to watch.

Four really awful cinemas, I mean films, four top notch MST episodes.  What more could you want?
