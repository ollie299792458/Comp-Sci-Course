What a disappointment! In no way does this twisted mess do even remote justice to the 1951 masterpiece. What was unique and compelling in the original is obviously absent in this casual remake.  Even though this god-awful screenplay basically stuck to the story, key plot elements are replaced with special effects describing swarms of hungry metal termites, which in a humorous way reminds one of the jellyfish swarms in Spongebob Squarepants.

However, it was the movie's ending that was it's ultimate undoing. It was as if the production team ran out of film. You find yourself asking "Is that it"?  Why would an incredibly intelligent species travel across the universe to teach the destructive, seemingly incapable of learning, humans a lesson and not make it perfectly clear to every moronic member of mankind just what that lesson was before departing?

Stupid, weak and watered down, this folly is a total waste of Kathy Bates and Jennifer Connelly's talents. The movie would have best concluded with Keanu Reeves holding up his paycheck to the camera staying "...how soon can I deposit this?"
