Like the title says.

This movie is definitely nothing amazing or something you can consider in a top ten list of greatest movies of all time.

Kill List was highly suggested by friend of mine who has almost the same film taste as I, so I took it in to consideration to watch it.

Not bad for an independent budget. The story just leaves a few questions you have to answer yourself. Yep, it is one of those movies. The ending is your own interpretation of what you think. Although the director has discuessed what he believes the ending represents, it still has you thinking "but why?" I mean, the director said "what he believes" the ending could mean....not what it means. So, yeah....you're own interpretation pretty much.

I also asked myself why I watched this movie. I felt irritated at times, but I wanted to finish the movie. You feel it is a dark, gritty hitman movie, but then you start wondering where the film is going.

For those who know a lot about movies and can predict a films outcome, you'll be irritated. Those who hate short films that feel too long, you're gonna be irritated.

It's not awful or the worst movie ever made. You're just gonna have that feeling of being incomplete and keep asking why the hell did this happen and why did it end this way.

Rent it.....at a video store cause $9.99 here is way too much. or just "1channel" search it.
