I watched this entire season box set over one weekend.

I've never done that before, with any television series. I just couldn't stop.

There are many things to pinpoint that makes this show rise above the other Superman incarnations (including, sadly, the initially promising Smallville which has turned into just another teen soap opera), and television in general.

First of all, the characterization of Lois as a strong, brilliant, independent woman, slightly annoying but intoxicatingly endearing, is a refreshing change from Margot Kidder's ditzy Lois or the original series' damsel-in-distress. All of the acting is totally believable, including the minor characters. Guest characters include all sorts of familiar faces, including Robert Beltran (Chakotay from "Voyager"), Mike McKean, Jerry Hardin ("Deep Throat" on The X-Files), and more.

Furthermore, the writing is superb. The characters are truly intelligent people, even Cat (Tracy Scoggins), the gossip columnist, and the decreasingly-naive Jimmy.

The chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher is possibly even better than the Mulder/Scully chemistry on The X-Files.

Most of all, this series is exciting, and funny, and just plain entertaining to watch.

Maybe I'll watch the whole thing again next weekend. Meanwhile, everyone should buy this box set, so that they'll release the rest of the series without further delay.
