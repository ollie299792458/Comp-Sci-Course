I have been waiting for Rhoda to come out on Dvd for So long!  I am always amazed when I go the store and see dvd releases of tv shows that are  new shows, but you can't get all the seasons of MTM (the BEST comedy on tv, EVER)  Who decides what shows are put out? I mean come on,  the crappy shows seem to come out as soon as the current season ends! I enjoy reading all the reviews on amazon because I can tell you are all true fans of the show. My review is simply this: I loved Rhoda so much that I will take whatever they put out. I think if you reallly loved the show,  it is worth the money.  I already bought and watched all of season one,  now I am wondering how many YEARS until season 2?? I wish they would simply offer the entire series on day one.  I would buy it no matter what they charged for it. (For Rhoda & MTM only)  I was very dissapointed in the "extras" with Rhoda.  I too would like to have seen some interviews with the stars of the show. (I wonder if they will put Valerie out on dvd?)  The season one dvd of MTM had the best extra stuff but then the other seasons had nothing much.  Oh well.  I am so angry over the bright idea to release the entire series after we bought seasons 1-4,  but alas, I will buy it because these sitcoms of the '70's are worth it to me.  Especially RHODA. She was always my favorite on MTM and I was so happy she got her own show.  I did wish that they had just killed Joe off instead of divorcing them though. Rhoda waited too long for it to not work out,  but that is just me,  lol
