Amores Perros, which could only be loosely translated as "Love is a Bitch" is a fabulous movie--and is meant to be experienced--as Inarritu, its director has said as one long scream.  And it is just that, but with enough tonal variations to render it a cinematic opera.  The threads or maybe bloodlines of a number of disparate lives interweave in this thickly textured look at Third World post-modernism, which although may sound like a phoney label, is apt, because the movie eschews the stereotypes of Mexican life and zeroes in on characters caught in a whirlpool of need, poverty, egocentrism, and anarchy.  This is a political film that is never polemical.  The plots, actions, characters carry you away like a combination roller coaster/haunted house--which both keeps you on the edge of your seat because of its intensity and violence, while mesmerizing you with the seriousness with which the characters struggle with themselves,their society, and a growing anomie.  Happily Inarritu eschews rehashing mock-documentary social realism whose tedium can be seen in another recent Latin American film "City of God," and comes up with an original work of art.  See the DVD to get an inside look on how the dog fights were staged (especially appropriate for animal lovers who might be turned off by the scenes of dogfighting for profit).
