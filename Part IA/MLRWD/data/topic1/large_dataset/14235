Well, I expected more from this cast.

First off, this is a fairly masked rip-off of Dan Brown. Symbology, professors and grad students saving the world (or something like it), and how intellectuals are really like you and I - only better.

The plot... wasn't bad. They get a star for that. The narrative moved along fairly swiftly, and the actual story was pretty engaging. However, the whole narrative centers around one cryptic series of symbols that Wood must decipher in order to stop a string of horrible murders. This leads him on a chase around Oxford, fighting to find the clues he needs to stop the horrible events from transpiring.

I won't give any more of the plot away, but when it all falls down, I personally was left a little more than disappointed. This plot had so much potential, and not even the fairly well-versed cast could save it when it started on a downward spiral.

Now, I know common movie review ettiqute points at the actors for not fulfilling the vision of the writer and director, but I don't hold much against the cast here. This was a writing problem, and the plot should have been addressed much more thoroughly before it headed to production.

In any case, it's good for a watch if you don't have much else to do, but don't bump anything else in your 'to be seen' pile for it.

2/5.
