Milla Jovovich, Robert DeNiro and Edward Norton all give stellar performances in this totally pointless, plotless film.  It is the actors alone who carry this film, because there's nothing else there.  Every time the film seems like maybe it's finally going somewhere, it pulls the plug and deflates.  It does this over and over again.  This movie isn't about anything.  There is a nihilistic nothingness at its center that is truly depressing to see. The most common line you will read about this film is that an inmate is using his wife to help con the parole officer into letting him out.  Not even that basic statement is true.  In fact, there is no underlying framework to this movie at all.  It's filled with people that have meaningless lives, saying and doing meaningless things, and by the end of the film it's impossible to say exactly what happened or didn't happen.  Edward Norton should have won best actor for his role, no contest.  But the great acting is about the only good thing to say about this film.
