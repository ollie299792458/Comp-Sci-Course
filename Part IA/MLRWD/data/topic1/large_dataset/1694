I heard an interview with Kevin Smith about this movie. He said he wanted to try to make a movie like other directors that he really admired made. The kind of movie where you finish watching it, and you're like "Wow". Quentin Tarantino, Sam Peckinpah and the Cohen Brothers were his inspiration for this movie. Did he succeed? In spades. If you've ever wondered just how good Kevin Smith can be, as a real film maker, and not just a supremely talented comedy writer/director, I don't see how he could have done any better.

If you like Quentin Tarantino, you're going to like this movie.

This movie is violent, and some of the scenes that really aren't that graphic are still deeply disturbing, and then you find yourself laughing at really inappropriate moments. I can't remember the last time that a movie has delighted me this much.

Usually, when I watch a movie, I can think of something somewhere that I would have changed. When I finished this, I could not think of a single thing that could have been done any better. This is up there with "Pulp Fiction", "Reservoir Dogs" and "Fargo".

Don't come to this movie like some of these others expecting silly over the top comedy, it's just not that kind of movie. Don't expect to get a lecture on the evils of...well the evils of anything really. It just isn't that kind of movie. This is a movie for people that love great movies. If you love the movies and directors I've mentioned here, then you're going to love this movie. It really is that good.
