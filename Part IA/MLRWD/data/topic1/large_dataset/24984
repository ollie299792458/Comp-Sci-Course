In other words, I LOVED IT!  Yes this is a very explicit,bloody, politically incorrect, occasionally offensive Carpenter film.And that is precisely its appeal for a certain male audience (you know who you are!).  On paper it may seem like a pretty unoriginal, unambitious yawn-fest.  But Carpenter pulls it off with such style and successfully combines the best elements of several B-movie genres: the horror flick, the spaghetti western and the run of the mill tough guy action flick.  Spirited performances from all the actors, simple but shockingly realistic special effects and a great soundtrack help to polish off the entire package.  It is a much better vampire busting movie than Blade, in my opinion.  As long as you treat it as a fun B-movie flick you'll enjoy it (that is, if you enjoy this genre to begin with).  If you go into it expecting an oscar nominee for best film, then you will most likely be quite disappointed.  But honestly, how can you go into a movie about a bunch of tough guys who kill vampires and expect an oscar winner?
