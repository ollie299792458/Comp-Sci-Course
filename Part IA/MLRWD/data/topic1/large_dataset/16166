I don't know if this movie went nowhere at theaters because people mistook it for a western, it was poorly promoted, or it's just too damn smart for success. It made for a real surprise on DVD, though. What starts off as a moving romance (albeit kind of creepy due to the massive age difference), slowly turns into something dark and (eventually) violent. I wouldn't call Edward Norton's character evil (as some reviews have). I don't think that his actions are premeditated and I don't think they involve malice. (That is debatable though. The movie, rightfully, doesn't make it perfectly clear.) I think he's a troubled man who has an emotional breakdown when he realizes he's losing the only thing he really cares about. With just some minor changes in the script, David Morse's father could easily have been the traditional, 100% bad guy and Norton could have been the hero who rides in to save the day.

The acting and direction are top notch all around. It is seldom that a movie of this quality and maturity is made anymore. There is none of the pretentious artificiality of so many independent films, and none of the compromise common to most Hollywood films. Not quite a masterpiece, but the type of movie that mature, intelligent film-goers should be seeing none-the-less.
