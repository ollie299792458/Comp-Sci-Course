I can't wait for this movie to be available. It's been many years since I've seen this movie (I was in my early teens and my dad wanted me to see it because he thought it was such a great movie...and he was right). The  details are a bit vague in my memory but this is what I recall. Donald  Sutherland is I believe an architect, restauring old buildings (churches).  He and his wife loose their young daughter (she is maybe 4 or 5 years old).  Sutherland ends up with work in Venice and takes his wife there. In the  dark alleys of Venice they believe they see their daughter, wearing the  same red raincoat she wore when she disappeared. A blind elderly psychic  lady tries to help them. I know my description is not much but it has been  so long since I've seen this it. It is just stuck in my memory because it  made a real impression on me. It is very suspencefull movie and I recommend  it to anyone. The end is shocking and you must deal with a little blood  (not much...I promise! ) Please please if you are at all interested, sign  up and vote for its release. You won't regret it. The scenery in Venice is  very dark and eery and if you have never been to Venice...it really is like  that, small alleyways, easy to get lost. But during the day, it is a  beautiful city. The movie capures that atmosphere.
