If you're a fan of the Planet of the Apes movie series, you will be very pleased at the blu-ray transition.  This campy delight really pops with blu-ray.  I watched it on a 58 inch plasma, and it lost very little crispness.  I was too young to see it first run at theaters, but I'll bet this experience rivals that one.  In fact, it's so clear, you'll no doubt see things you never saw when watching it on standard TV.  I never noticed the masks on some of the "extra" apes were much less detailed.  Some had black orbs where their star counterparts had eyes.  No doubt a budget issue back then.

If you've never seen the original Planet of the Apes movie, but only the more recent remake, you will probably chuckle at this one.  But the rendering of the city buildings is brilliant, it seems to take a chapter straight out of the Flintstones, and bring it to life.  Owning the blu-ray is a bit like owning a piece of history, since it's been the forerunner to so many science fiction stories.  Though the movie drips with tongue-in-cheek sillyness, Charlton Heston still belts out a memorable performance, with his incredulous stares and absolute distain for the apes.  This film is a cult classic, and blu-ray does it proud.  Two thumbs up!
