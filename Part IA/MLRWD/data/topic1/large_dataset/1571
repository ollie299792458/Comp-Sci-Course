Buffalo '66, directed and written by Vincent Gallo, is an incredible film about this guy named Billy Brown, played by Gallo himself. Billy was a man who was severely down in his luck, from having neglegent parents, terrible luck, and dysfunctional relationships. The root of his anger and bitterness definitely comes from his parents. His mother (played brilliantly yet uncharacteristically by Angelica Huston) was so obsessed with the Buffalo Bills that she disowns Billy since he was born on the same day the Bills won the Super Bowl in 1966 and she couldn't go to the game (and they haven't won since).The story starts off with Billy being released from a 5 year jail sentence ("I was innocent") wandering the streets of Buffalo looking for a bathroom. He finds one at a dance studio, in which he runs into Layla (played by my favorite actress, Christina Ricci). He kidnaps her and somehow persuades her into pretending that she's this girl named Wnedy and that they are married, along with a whole barrage of lies, to impress his parents, not that they really care anyway.After that, Billy and Layla still go places together, but yet Billy is still very bitter and won't easily open up to Layla. He had many emotional scars and trauma (all shown in the movie) and contemplated doing a terrible act of revenge. Then he experienced an epiphany in terms of what would happen if he did it, with Yes' classic epic "Heart of the Sunrise" used effectively, and from there he finds himself in a way, and the film has a surprising ending. This film dealt with human emotion in a non-cliched way, and contained great music and even better acting. Definitely a new favorite film for me.
