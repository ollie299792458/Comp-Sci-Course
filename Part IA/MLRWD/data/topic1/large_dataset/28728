Imagery was creatively sick and horrific in a lot of places. This movie spooked me. Acting was mostly decent. Effects were creepy. Its a good stupid horror flick. But, I really did not like how it was mostly women who get tortured and killed.

Most of the action is really implausible. How exactly can a dead-person intentionally kill a living person, or operate machinery, or perform surgery, or break down doors, or activate an electrical grid, or show up on film or video? We're not talking about zombies, either, I mean, in "House On Haunted Hill" the deadies have no bodies left.

Seems pretty silly to me. If the deceased could do any of those tasks, we would really have a job-shortage in the world, wouldn't we?  All our jobs would get taken by dead people who have more experience, and who work without pay. Furthermore, the dearly-departed could do little about their wages (or lack of), because it seems unlikely they could ever form labor-unions.

If I remember correctly, in the original movie, everything was explained by the trickery of the character played by Vincent Price, who was alive, at the time. But this remake is all about an evil house. How can a house made of bricks, mortor, wood, and sheet-rock get possessed?  From which Home Depot do you buy possessed building-materials?  Can't say that I've ever seen any satanic-plywood or psychopath-shingles at any lumber-yard, I've ever been to.
