I have been a huge fan of The Sopranos since the amazing first season aired on HBO and it's wonderful to see how these characters have developed so far. Look at Christopher Moltisanti (played by Michael Imperioli) and how he changed from being a rookie in the first season, seeing his near death experience in the second season and getting made in the third season. Most people looked at the sex and violence that the show produced over the years and some people just don't get the jist of the show. How can you turn on your TV and watch the latest season watching the show for the first time and then speak negatively about it? Thinking that it is just a spinoff from The Godfather or GoodFellas or any other mob related movie for that matter I find it ridiculous that people spit on the show because it's not living to their expectations. If you don't like the show change the channel and watch those crappy reality shows and soaps that America has produced. The Sopranos has depth and meaning and most fans like me see beyond the violence and sex and view it from another direction.

I will definitely buy this when it comes out and I cannot wait for the sixth and possibly final season. David Chase you're are a mastermind.
