The problem with The Royal Tenenbaums is that people thought it was going to be a hilarious comedy.  It is not.  The movie is quite amusing and I consider it to be quite realistic, but hilarious is not the correct discriptor for most people.  The movie becomes more beautiful every time I watch it, and remains one of my favorite films of all time.
This movie is about an eccentric, but applicable, family with some interpersonal issues.  The movie does not revolve around a single character, but instead revolves around a series of individuals.  The viewer comes to recognize eash character for what they are, and while some are unorthodox, ok they are all pretty unusual, he or she cannot resist developing an affinity for them.
The picture quality of this DVD is quite excellent.  I bought it used for a nominal amount, and it was well worth the money.  The extra footage included on the second disk is also worth the money.
Once you eliminate the belief that this is like Dumb and Dumber, the movie is quite enjoyable.  I don't understand why there is so much criticism of this movie.  It is definetly worth a rental anyway.
