The 2007 brand new beautifully color enhanced version of "Miracle on 34th St." is not the same color version as the one made in the '90's.  It is also certainly not the same as the first color version made in the '80's.  It's a brand new 2007 color technology produced color version.  Whoever thinks this is the same color version, be it the AFT color version of the '90's or the bad '80's color version is wrong, this is an excellently color enhanced 2007 version.  I know this for a fact because I watched the '90's A.F.T. version and the new Legend color version side by side as I watched this movie Christmas time 2007.  The new version is sharp, clear, colors are nice and bright (no more brownish or dark reds, the reds are now bright and red red) and the movie now looks like it was originally shot in color.  That's the best complement you can give a colorized movie.  It's beautiful.  Even some colors of things like ties, dresses, scenery background on the wall are different colors now than they were in the '90's color version.  Watching these side by side on a split screen I could see first hand the vast improvements this 2007 version is over the past color versions.  This ain't your Daddy's colorization anymore.  So get over the snob/elitist comments.  Welcome to a big beautiful colorful world.  B/W you're thru.  Now please color ALL the rest of the drab b/w movies and TV shows then I'll be in heaven.
