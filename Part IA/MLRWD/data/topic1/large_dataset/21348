omg i love this set i loved this series ever since my girlfriend made me watch it! at first i hate dthis show i thought it was too girly and had no real plot. boy was i wrong! i absolutly love this show im flying through it i got it a couple days ago and already am on the fifth disk of the first season!! the packaging was nice but a lil too girly i have to hide the fact that i have this set from my friends cuz if they saw it i'd never live it down! but i absolutly love this set and any fan or newbie to the series would love this set i must say that my only concern is the fact that since they crammed this set together with every episode they put each season in a paper folder thing that im afraid will scratch the disks after a while and the extras aside from wehats on each disk arent that important. i mean it comes with 2 books. one is an episode guide that shows a lot of photos of the cast and a synopsis of each episode and its orginal release date which was fun to read but the other book is useless and no fun. it is a book of pop culture referencesthat were brought up in the show so i dont think its important because if you didnt get them when they were relevent then its just stupid to get them now. its like getting a joke long after it was told.
