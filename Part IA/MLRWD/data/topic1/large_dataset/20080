Unfortunately, this movie, being a remake, has to be compared to the original.  And in this regard it fails miserably.  Details notwithstanding, these are my reasons for disliking this remake as compared to the original:

1.  The original is much more believable (as far as sci-fi alien invasion movies go).  This remake attempts to look and sound smart, but comes off as being stupid (ex. an astrobiologist who also happens to be an expert in anesthesia?.....ridiculous.)  Whereas the original does not necessarily pretend to be based on scientific principles.

2.  Klaatu develops a conscience in the Keanu Reeves version (and in one scene nonetheless).  This is completely asinine.  Klaatu is supposed to be merely a messenger from an alliance of planets.  In the original he not only doesn't really care for humans, but it wouldn't matter anyway.  He doesn't have the authority to stop the destruction of the earth.

3.  For me, the biggest downfall of the new version is how the ultimate message of the movie gets rewritten.  In the original, Klaatu leaves and basically says "if you humans don't get your crap together, we're going to annihilate you; but the nidus for change is yours."  In the new film, Klaatu simply saves the world because he wants to.  There is no human responsibility.  In the old movie, you come away with a desire to change the world for the better, but with this version, you're just thankful that this alien dude had mercy on us.

Two stars because the special effects are fantastic.  Overall, I was disappointed with this movie.  In my opinion, get the original version, and don't waste your time with this remake.
