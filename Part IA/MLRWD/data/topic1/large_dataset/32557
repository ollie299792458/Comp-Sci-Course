The early scenes in this movie give a pretty accurate taste of what is to come. Confusing, clipped dialog among a bunch of people who are evidently some sort of clandestine government agents (even this is unclear) on a power-trip, who have robocop-personalities and speak in harsh often incomprehensible sound-bites. We are given early proof that these are trained killers and, what is sobering is that such people may very well exist in the current xenophobe-paranoid US administration.

Despite the confusion and frightful lines, devoid of any humor or humanity whatever, the plot is so flimsy that the general idea emerges quite easily: a political figure, running for office, has his daughter kidnapped for the white-slave trade and his handlers stage her fictitious death to avoid exposing him as an adulterer.

Nevertheless, the hero (with whom I could not feel a single milligram of human sympathy); robotically played by Val Kilmer, becomes embroiled with some predictably evil Arabs and travels to Dubai to rescue the sniveling brat. This fellow seems to leave behind him a trail littered with corpses everywhere he goes - and we must imagine there is a squad detailed to follow him around, cleaning up his messes, but they don't ever appear here.

This movie is an utter waste of time and celluloid.
