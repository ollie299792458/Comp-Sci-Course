OK, so it seems the world is split into 2 categories, the people who love boondock saints, and people that would rather turn up their nose claiming it to be 'animalistic' and primal.

They spout the usual rhetoric: "Who are they to judge who lives and dies". The movie itself is a counter argument to that, which says: "Who are you to stand by while innocents die around you?"

Still, watching what is an amazing movie does not condone one or the other. The way it's shot makes it very easy to get into, and excited about (The brothers getting ready for action, switching to Dafoe analysing the scene and giving comments, then seeing the action unfold).

Also, Dafoe gives a great and varied performance about a eccentric genius detective.

If you enjoy a well shot movie with a bit of a skewed slant on religion thrown in, you'll love it. If you're the sort of person who'd rather not make waves, deplores open violence but gladly backstabs friends and co-workers, and generally thinks they are better than others, you might not enjoy this movie so much. In fact you might not enjoy anything that does not involve demeaning others much at all.

But to all those who do not fit this category, please, do yourself a favour, watch the movie (especially the deleted scene involving mothers drunken phone call) and enjoy what is a cult classic movie.
