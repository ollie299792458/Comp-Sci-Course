The wonderfully versatile Tom Hanks stars as Josh Baskin, a 12 year old boy who makes a wish on a carnival wishing machine. His wish is to be 'BIG'....and to his amazement wakes up the next morning with the body of a 30 year old. Confused and frightened at being thrust into the adult world, Josh (with the help of his best friend) runs away to New York, where by sheer luck he lands a job in a Toy company. There he discovers the advantages of being big: freedom,money,unlimited toys and junk food. But he's not prepared for what happens when he attracts sexy co-worker-chic, ambitious and predatory Susan Lawrence. Josh is torn between the freedom of being an adult (with a 12 year old brain)and the love and security of his homelife. BIG is great entertainment, it is often touching but always BIG on laughs!
Written by coproducers Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg.Tom Hanks' 11th film. BIG was later a broadway musical.
