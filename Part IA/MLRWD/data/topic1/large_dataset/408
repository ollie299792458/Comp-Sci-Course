"Welcome to Mooseport" even bombed in Maine!

I guess I should have been tipped off to how thoroughly bad this movie is when I walked into a theater last fall in Falmouth, Maine, and was one of only three or four people in the audience.  I've never come as close to walking out of a movie as I did with "Mooseport."  What a letdown!

This story could have been a fun premise in the hands of a competent scriptwriter and director.  They certainly had the acting talent from which to draw (i.e., Gene Hackman).  But the result is a lifeless, insipid little trifle that -- as an inflight airline movie now --probably has most travellers reaching for their evacuation procedures flyer to break the tedium and boredom.

There's nothing in the movie that's uniquely Maine, uniquely small town, or uniquely amusing.  This Romano fellow -- is he supposed to be funny?  I guess this is what passes for comedy these days on television.

If you buy "Mooseport" in VHS, make sure you get the cassette with the plastic clip intact, so you can re-record over it and possibly get some further use out of what will prove to be a one-time viewing experience.

(I did enjoy the scene where "Popeye" Doyle chases the heroin smuggler down the Brooklyn elevated, however.)
