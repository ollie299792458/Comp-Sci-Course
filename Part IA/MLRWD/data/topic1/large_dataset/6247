I simply loved this movie, even when I realized the subplot with Fortinbras was effectively eliminated, for I also realized I didn't mind one whit.

With the exception of a scene between Hamlet and Ophelia that contained no dialogue, which was, in my opinion, not well-done at all, Mel Gibson was superb in his portrayal of Hamlet, a far cry from the overblown pomposity of many classical Shakespearean actors whose over-the-top boomings of "to beeeee...or not to beeeee...." completely demolished the introspection required of many of Hamlet's soliloquys.  In contrast, Gibson's performance conveyed much more effectively the internal dialogue that both pacified and plagued Hamlet.

Helena Bonham-Carter's performance as Ophelia was exquisite and ranks up there with her performance as Lucy Honeychurch in "A Room With a View".  I can't imagine anyone else better suited to play this most tragic character of the entire play.

Alan Bates, Glenn Close, and Nathaniel Parker were perfectly cast, as well.  It was his portrayal of Laertes that persuaded me to also seek out Nathaniel Parker's later movie, "Far From the Madding Crowd", which I also strongly recommend.

Beautiful camera work, gorgeous scenery, and acting that didn't seem like the stereotypical Shakespearean overblown pontificating that puts off so many would-be fans of Shakespeare.  Heartily recommend this movie.
