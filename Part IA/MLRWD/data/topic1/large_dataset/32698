It's really difficult to rate these kinds of movies because you either love it or don't. I saw this movie with someone who didn't "get it", on the other hand I loved it. I thought it was the best comedy of that year.

The plot is simple enough, two pals who get a case of the hungries for the munchies at night and decide to go to White Castle and their adventures therein. It's basically a road trip movies with plenty of happenings. I could find nothing wrong with this movie.

When rating a movie like this, you look at a few things:
1) Casting: I thought the casting was just right on. Whoever casted the movie gets high marks as all the characters were just right on the spot. Once you've got the right cast, the movie is half done.
2) Acting: Despite the fact that both protagonists are actually a little too old for their parts they did the characters just right.
3) Writing/direction: I thought this hit the spot too. The over the top script was just right for this kind of movie and the directing was top notch. There wasn't a slow bit in the movie, you just went from laugh to laugh.

Finally, you can tell a movie is a hit when you get a sequel. For me, I just loved it and I loved the type of humor, just can't go wrong for someone like me.
