I watched this movie in the theatre, and I really loved it.  I was even more surprised to see the "uncut" version, which has 1 second (I believe that is what the director says) cut out to make it rated R.  (Although, as some have said, the sexual explicit scenes ARE more soft porn, it depends on whether you are offended by it or not if you will enjoy the movie.)

After watching the movie, I bought the original book and read it.  It was quite different from the movie (as usual), with an extra character that is integral to the story.  The movie, as someone mentioned, AS USUAL, was "Hollywood-esqued" but still has a wonderful surprise ending.

I found the movie to be MORE intriguing than the book (for ONCE) with more twists to the plot.  And of course, Bandaras is nice to look at! hehehe...

If you have the DVD, try out the extra feature where the director talks over the scenes, explaining more about the I movie and its set-up.  I found it kinda interesting.

I loved the movie, loved Bandaras, and loved the plot twists.  I recommend this movie, just be VERY AWARE of the sexual explicit scenes
