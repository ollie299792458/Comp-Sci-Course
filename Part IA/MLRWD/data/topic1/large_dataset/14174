I think, to a certain degree, comparison with Douglas McGrath's 1996 movie featuring Gwyneth Paltrow is inevitable. However, I must alert my reader to the fact that - when I praise this alternate version from Diarmuid Lawrence - I do so with the original novel in mind. This mini-series has not a movie's glamour, nor does Kate Beckinsale match Paltrow in beauty. However, with regards to Jane Austen's beloved work, this is undoubtedly the more faithful adaptation. Beckinsale's portrayal is less flighty and silly then Paltrow's... she carries the character's grace perfectly in every scene. The superb Samantha Morton, despite her slimness, is a perfect Harriet Smith; it is hard to make so stupid a girl endearing, but Morton does it with such apparent ease even her must enthusiastic fans must believe what they see. Lucy Robinson (better known by most as Mrs. Hurst from Simon Langton's 1995 "Pride and Prejudice") is so wonderfully obnoxious she almost undoes Mrs. Elton, who should be unbearable, but is instead wonderfully entertaining in both vanity and snobbery. Olivia Williams (The Jane Austen of Jeremy Lovering's "Miss Austen Regrets") is truly beautiful... more beautiful perhaps then the title character. What is more, she sings like a nightingale! Together with Raymond Coulthard as Frank Churchill (who is almost too charming to garner dislike as he should), the two make an astonishingly handsome couple. Mark Strong is not a very polished Mr. Knightley, but he plays the part admirably, with feeling, and with forethought which is apparent in his actions as well as his expressions. Even Prunella Scales, who must compete with Sophie Thompson for the title of "Best Miss Bates" withstands all independent criticism. Despite being somewhat rough, the production values grow better upon review... those subtleties in the use of music, camera-shot etc will become more evident and thereby easier to appreciate. Truly rewarding, for those who will properly attend to it.
