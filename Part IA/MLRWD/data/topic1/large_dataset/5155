If Paramount is 'in Microsoft's pocket' then there are FAR more companies in Sony's pocket.  If a studio chooses a format based on production costs, higher number of 'movie only' players (PS3s skew the number of blu-ray players out there, the industry has found that people who buy a 'movie only' component to watch movies are more likely to buy movies vs. a console that plays movies, which means there are MORE HD DVD player owners than Blu-Ray owners), and for not getting strong-armed by Sony I say more power to them, quit whining, obviously they're doing just fine.  Sony decided they didn't want my business by making their players more expensive and provide less features (they have done this with Betamax, Mini-Discs, S-DVDs, etc) and keeping antiquated relics from DVDs such as region coding etc.  It isn't reasonable to expect studios to release both formats just the same as it is unreasonable to expect a retailer to carry both and have to commit twice as much (or 3 times as much when counting regular DVD) so until there is a compromise, expect many producers and retailers to side with one or the other, all it means is that when one company goes exclusive with one format, a competitor will go with another.  This is called a 'free market economy'.  QUIT WHINING.
