This was a much better movie than Edge of Darkness as the world weariness that marks the life of Mel Gibson and which is written on his face fits perfectly with the character he's playing in the movie.  Both guys are damaged goods and in many ways he's playing himself in this movie.  The movie itself is really only a four star movie in that it shows us or most of us at least a world we didn't know existed and has an interesting storyline with many different dynamics to it.  Devoid of star power in the main, the movie does benefit from good casting with many character actors that you've seen in myriad other movies doing what they do best namely playing interesting characters.  The little boy and his mum are particularly good and it's nice to see a real woman in a role instead of a sculpted faced B. Hills actress in the role.  The action sequences are well done and the look of the film is interesting.  It looks like they shot some of it on high def video which once again gives some elements a visually harder more real edge to them.  The music is also particularly good and was obviously chosen by someone with a sense of humour.

I gave it one more star than it deserved to counterbalance the poor reviews that were more a critique of the man and his a__hole qualities than it was about the movie.  That seems unfair to me as then all the other people who contribute to a movie both in front of and behind the camera are not getting the recognition they deserve.
