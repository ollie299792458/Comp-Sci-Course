I went into this film, like many of the other reviewers, thinking this was going to be a horror film.  That was a mistake.  Much more along the lines of Ghost In The Darkness, this film is about the convergence of primitive superstitions and real wildlife danger.  The film does not stop there.  It is also a social commentary on the forgotten areas of Africa and the plight of the native population.  With all that mixed together, Primeval is an engaging, dramatic, and thrilling film...but still nothing like it was billed.  With all the serious overtones, the film could have done without the "comedic" lines written for Orlando Jones.  Sometimes it felt like "Chris Tucker Goes On Safari".  Overall, solid performances by the rest of the cast (including Jones in his non-comedic moments).  I found that while it was not what I expected, I still walked away enjoying this film.  The effects were so-so, but once you realize that this movie is not "really about" the giant croc, the effects seem not to matter.  The film delivers enough entertainment to rate four stars (maybe a shaky four stars, but four stars all the same).
