Eddie Izzard is, quite frankly, the funniest man in Britain right now and quite possibly the funniest man in the world. To call him a stand-up comedian is to oversimplify the point, Izzard's routines feature bizarre takes on history and culture all delivered in a free-associative way. There is simply no point of comparison.

"Dress To Kill" is one of his more famous routines and features a number of his more popular stories. Beginning with a description of San Francisco (where this particular performance was filmed), Izzard quickly segues into a romp through European history, a dissection of "The American Dream" and a look at the Church of England. As if that wasn't enough, there's various interesting observations on the Heimlich Manoevre, Englebert Humperdinck and losing one's virginity - before a performance of some of these same stories in French.

In other words, this is a highly surreal performance. He often expects a little more of his audience than most comics do, which is probably a good thing. As he remarks in the middle of the French section of his routine, "If you don't speak French, this is hilarious". Nothing is sacred - particularly not the Spanish Inquisition (the source of the immortal "Cake or Death" routine) and the concept of "putting babies on sticks". Yes, it's disturbing. Yes, the fact that he's an "executive transvestite" might put some people off. But when you get past his crazy accents and fetish for certain old movie stars it is absolutely compulsory viewing.

For any fans of British comedy, "Dress To Kill" is just about as good as it gets. The surrealism is laid on with a trowel and so many of his ideas are almost from another planet. For people who like their comedy to be easily explicable, this is probably something to avoid.
