If not for that I would have missed this one entirely. I Don't usually go in for "Classic" movies, but I'm a dance movie addict Ballet especially, so I had to give The Red Shoes a go. And I must say that this film is absoluely beautiful from top to bottom.

Moira Shearer Glows, as Victoria Page. who wants nothing more in life then to dance, and never even considered love until... I'm telling you it's like you have to watch her. Her performance is hypnotic. She makes the film worth watching all by herself.

Anton Wallbrook as Boris Lermontov is so wonderfully sinister. the guy you love to hate and all. Wallbrook really masterd Lermontov's downward spiral. he was truly unhinged by the end, An amazing talent.

Marius Goring as Julian Craster was missing somthing for me. His performance was tepid at best, He just didn't seem to own the part. I don't know He bothered me.

The Red Shoes Ballet sequence was breath taking, unbelievable. I was gaping at the screen. and when it was performed again at the end of the film. I was speachless. Gut renchiing.

I highly recommend it to any one looking for a memorable viewing experience.
