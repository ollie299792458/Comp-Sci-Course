I didn't have the same problems that almost everybody else had with this movie and I think it's just because I'm more a Jeunet fan than an Alien-series fan.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the first two, turned off the third, and ignored this one for years.  After being enchanted by The City of Lost Children and Delicatessen, I found out that the wildly creative director of those great films also did this one.  Just imagine, if you will, the delight I felt when I learned that my favorite new director had added the last installment to a series I had grown up watching, and it was in English!  I was thrilled and I loved the movie.  It has a campy quality that doesn't always appeal to the American mass audience but which I love when done properly.  Alien: Resurrection has the playful dark fantasy touch that seems so antithetical to the grim reality that defines the first two movies but is what makes the films of Terry Gilliam and Jeunet so tasty.  Perhaps those of you who havent' seen his other films should give Jeunet another chance and then come back to this one.  If you have fallen for his other films like I have, then maybe you see what I see in this one.
