It should be mandatory to include a copy of this film in every time capsule on earth or shot into space. It would disabuse future generations of any nostalgia for trashy, '60s, American cinematic kitsch. Apart from this merely potential boon, the film does serve as a thorough repudiation of those who bemoan the prevalence of nudity and sex in modern film.  Aside from outright suppression, a healthy dollop of nudity and sex is the only thing that might have saved this film. Ok, maybe it is possible to enjoy the sheer BADNESS of the movie. (I will admit I find it far more enjoyable than, say, Mommy Dearest.) But there is no doubt it is trite, shallow, and trashy.  The plot is nonsensical, the dialogue is absurd, and much of the acting is abysmal, although it is really hard to blame the actors given what they had to work with.  But perhaps that is too strong. I really didn't mind Barbara Perkins. She was very pretty and stayed more or less in character throughout, even if her character had the emotional depth of a wading pool.  Patty Duke was thoroughly hateful and WAY over the top, and her final scene is bad acting at its worst, but how else could she play the part?  As to Sharon Tate, she was stunning.  The only real reason to watch this movie other than a perverse interest in kitsch or as a primer on the elements of a bad movie is to gaze upon Sharon Tate.  Of course, it is impossible to tell from this movie if she could act. She certainly didn't here and her performance is dreadfully stiff and awkward. But she was so beautiful, and it is so sad to watch her knowing the fate that was to befall her.  Honestly, unless you really think you will get a kick out of a really bad trashy movie, do yourself a favor and skip it. I am really stunned that there is a special edition of this movie.  Why? Oh yeah, the theme song is pretty good.
