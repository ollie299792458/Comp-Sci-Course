The first arc of Bleach, originally written by 'Tito' Kiba in his manga series, is known as Agent of the Shinigami or The Substitute. The viewer is introduced to our hero, Ichigo Kurasaki, a spiritually aware high school student who lives in a fictional area called Karakura Town. Our story begins with Ichigo coming in contact with a Soul Reaper from the Soul Society and gaining temporary Soul Reaper powers in order to fend off hollows; evil spirits that feed off of souls trapped in the living world, and keep order in his home town. A great adaptation, director Noriyuki Abe really captured the essence of the manga. The Substitute keeps you hooked from the second you pop in the first disc! Great buy!! Amazing Show!!!!
