Who came up with the title "Kamikaze Girls," anyway?  That makes no sense.  It's like calling the "Indiana Jones" films "Guy with a hotdog and bun."  There's no sound reason for renaming "Shimotsuma Monogatari" aka "Shimotsuma Town's Story."  It is in no way related to Japanese nationalism or WWII.  That said, this is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen!

Kyoko Fukada is such a darling, and she plays her character Momoko with a great detachment which really adds to her wonderful day dream fantasies.  When Ichigo, a yanki-gang member becomes best friends with Momoko, a teen sporting the new fashion craze of Lolita style, the pair embark on a journey to seek out a legendary embroiderer who can fix Ichigo's misspelled kanji (chinese characters) on her jacket.  The two go to Tokyo and their unlikely bond grows into a full fledged friendship.  Momoko soon realizes, after spending most of the film avoiding or complaining about Ichigo's company and antics, how vital Ichigo's friendship really is to her.  When Ichigo's gang is miffed at her lack of loyalty to them...well what can I say, girl power all the way!  This film is a laugh a minute!  And the colors are so saturated, making the visuals all have a pink, green, blue, purple, gloss to the various scenes.  The music by Yoko Kano is genius and fits the popular trends and themes of this movie with equally appealing pop beats!

For those who understand Japanese culture, the film is doubly funny with its social commentary and comedic satire.  I highly recommend this to everyone, especially if you're looking for something fun and original!
