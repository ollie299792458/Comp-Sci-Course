Visually, the film isn't much to look at.  It's painfully obvious from the main titles that you're looking at models, plus the sequence goes really slow in my book.
Story wise, I thought the spectacle of people going into the arena to watch those people on LastDay "renew", was something akin to Roman times where lions feasted on those thrown to them.
The "lifeclock" in the hands was a neat idea, too bad the producers had to end life at 30, otherwise we could have seen more interesting combos.
Jenny Agutter's costume, if you could call it that, was a bit racy for a PG rating.  And what is this "circuit" that was mentioned?  Apparently the era's entertainment.
I think more time should have been devoted to background items such as this, along with other aspects of life in 2274.  Another example is HOW do children get to Cathedrel?  Do they 'escape' from Nursery, or are they put there?
I thought that the "New You" shop was put there strictly for the plot.  I mean, if you're only going to live until you're 30, you won't have TIME to get tired of the way you look, as you'll be too immeresed in other things to much notice.
