That is the question to be answered, and I can't come up with a single reason why.  After his first two masterpieces, the City of Lost Children and Delicatessen, he got his chance to come to Hollywood and direct.  But an Alien film?  He must have been a fan, that is the only excuse....
I cannot in good conscious recommend this movie to any Jeunet fans out there.  As this is not the product of him, but more likely inept film-editors and producers.  It is utterly and completely lacking of the fairy tale-esque brightness he usually brings to his films. If you're a fan of his, you will be disappointed.  Stylistically, it is sub-par compared to his other films, especially the magnificent new Amelie.  Storywise, it was written by the exec. producer to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer tv series, need I say more?  Acting wise, Jeunet regulars Pinon and Perlman give decent performances,  as does Weaver to an extent.  Ryder and the rest of the cast are disappointing, but there obviously wasnt much to work with.
I decided to give it 2 stars instead of one because Jeunet took a dead series and gave it cpr for a brief shimmering moment, but that light faded very early on.  Better than the rest of the dismal Alien movies though.... : )
