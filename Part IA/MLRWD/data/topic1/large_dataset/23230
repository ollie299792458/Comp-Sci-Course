The idea of the fighter is a romantic one that is enjoyed by movie lovers and movie directors alike. There have been many beautiful cinematic tales created by interweaving and paralelling the blows that the fighter takes in the ring, and the blows that they take in the outside world.

In 'Million Dollar Baby' Hilary Swank's character, Maggie Fitzgerald, does not have much going for her. She is working a dead end minimum wage job as a waitress and sees boxing as an escape from the banality. Although this setup would appear to be leading towards a cliched Hollywood ending of a working girl making it to the big time and becoming the champion, the reality is far more original. 'Million Dollar Baby' shows how directors these days are moving away from the old fashioned 'happy ending' and are starting to prefer the more gritty real world endings.

Swank stars alongside Clint Eastood and Morgan Freeman who provides a narrative that is by turns poignant and humourous and serves the story well. Freeman and Eastwood also work well as a juxtaposed attitude to Swank's character. They are older men and know the boxing game well and bear the phsical and mental scars that come with it. This contrasts well with the youthful exuberance and naivety of Maggie.

Overall 'Million Dollar Baby' is a well acted and well directed film that is deserving of it's 4 Oscars. In a film ending whose downcast mood is more remeniscent of 'Raging Bull' than 'Rocky', this is one fighter that will not be getting up from the mat any time soon.
