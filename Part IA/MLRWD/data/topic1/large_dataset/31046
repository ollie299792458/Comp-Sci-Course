A great cast.  A decent story.  Fantastic locations.  Great costumes.  Excellent, excellent dialogue.  But I didn't really enjoy this movie because the performances lacked a bit of snap and crackle.  I think it needed some kung-fu.

Without spoiling the story for anyone, the premise of the movie is as follows:  Mrs Erlynne (Helen Hunt) is a (slightly) older New York socialite with a reputation for "preying" on wealthy married men.  Forced to flee New York she sets of for the Amalfi coast with her sights set on the newly married Meg (Scarlett Johansson) and Robert (Mark Umbers).  She quickly strikes up a relationship with Robert which sets tongues wagging and he is suspected of providing her with an allowance and beginning an affair.

Meanwhile: Meg attracts the attention of a playboy Lord who sees an opportunity to make his move, Mrs Erlynne attracts the attention of old Lord Tuppy and the gossip starts to take its toll on any number of relationships.

Things come to a head at Meg's 21st birthday party when the motivations of the various players are revealed and some unexpected truths emerge.

What lets this film down is the fact that not one character has any charisma and as a result there is none of the requisite spark between the characters that a story like this needs.  Meg and Robert seem dull.  I suspect that Scarlett Johansson was cast more for her visual qualities than any else; Mrs Erlynne is just not sexy enough or alluring enough to seem believable in the role of a vamp; the playboy Lord fails to make any real impact - and the whole thing is just a little bit too PG rated.  Or a little bit too proper perhaps.  As I say, what it needs is more kung-fu (if you know what I mean).

The one decent performance is from Lord Tuppy who also seems to get all the best lines while he is trying to woo Mrs Erlynne.

Lacking enough substance to be good enough to recommend.
