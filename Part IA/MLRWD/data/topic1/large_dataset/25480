The first thirty minutes are great.  You get your money's worth from Brian De Palma in the form of a bravura continuous shot of the various backstage movers at an Atlantic City prizefight.  It's the perfect fusion of layered exposition and sheer style.  You also get your money's worth from Nicholas Cage playing to the rafters as a slimeball cop in a bright yellow shirt.  The opening sequence ends with a political assassination, and clues to the killers' identity emerge in multiple flashbacks that cover the same situation from different angles.  It's a great gimmick, but unfortunately De Palma doesn't stick with it.  About midway through the conspiracy is unmasked, the flashbacks are abandoned, and "Snake Eyes" settles into a conventional thriller with Cage racing to save the life of a pretty young woman who Knows Too Much.  Like so many movies based around a great premise, the premise can't stretch to fill the whole running time.  Eventually something has to happen, and in this case you've seen that something a thousand times before.
