Occasionally, I'd seen this film on TV in my younger years and always wished I could watch it whenever I was in the mood for snow-covered Alps, vintage war uniforms, full automatic weaponry chattering away, explosions galore and intriguing dialogue.  Having the DVD is a treat that let's the viewer experience the many, many aspects of this film that makes it worth five stars.  Don't take the movie too seriously, though.  This was never meant to be a "wild thrill rollercoaster ride".  It is a war-time drama/mystery/espionage/action film that will always be entertaining, whether it's the plot twists, Richard Burton's excellent portrayal as a British officer or Clint Eastwood's pre-Dirty Harry dashing image blazing away at Nazis with an MP-40 machine pistol.  This is a classic that achieves its goal - entertaining the viewer.  Don't compare it to the ultra-real blood'n horror war films like Saving Private Ryan.  Simply sit back and enjoy the tale from the scenic opening credits to the vey end.  And rest assured, the good guys win.  Enjoy.
