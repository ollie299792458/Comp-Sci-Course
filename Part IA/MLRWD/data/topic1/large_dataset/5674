Like the Disney films, the creators of Sailor Moon aim elements of their stories at both juvenile and adult audiences. But the extraordinary thing about Sailor Moon is that the characters and their relationships are so  well-drawn that meaningful exchanges can occur completely without words.  This movie (Sailor Moon R) has one of my favorite examples: Mamoru has been  kidnapped by a villain who threatens the world, and the other Sailor  Senshei are trying to persuade a reluctant Usagi (Sailor Moon) to lead them  into battle. Rei (Sailor Mars) simply puts her hand on Usagi's shoulder and  says, "For Mamoru's sake, too." And a little smile passes between  them. Why? Perhaps because, as fans of the series know, both girls have  been romantically involved with Mamoru. Disney was never this subtle.  Still, you don't HAVE to be a fan of the series to appreciate the love that  passes between the characters, or the spectacular finale (beautifully  animated) that are at the heart of Sailor Moon R. Sailor Moon and her  cohorts somehow manage to be both tough AND sensitive- a highly unusual  combination! I sent this video as a Christmas present to a fellow fan.  Personally, I think it would be a wonderful present for even an open-minded  non-fan.
