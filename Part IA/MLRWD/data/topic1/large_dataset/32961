This is a good movie (7/10) included in the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers. It is an old movie, from 1973, shot in Jamaica with a very low budget, so what you see is "the raw real thing" (New Statesman). Jimmy Cliff gives an amazing performance of the song "The Harder They Come", and just for that the movie is worth watching. Then there is a story of drug dealers, this and that, but what I liked about the movie is the Jamaican flavor. The scenes at the church and the ones at the studio are, bu far, the best of the movie. There is also a dialogue between Jimmy Cliff and his girlfriend about being a dreamer that can't be missed! This 30th Anniversary Edition comes with a great documentary "Hard Road to Travel" where we are told about how hard this movie was to do, post production stories, etc. There is also a Dolby Digital 5.1 audio channel (and the mono original one, for the purists), and an interview with Perry Henzell, the pioneer of Jamaican cinema. There alse also very interesting trailers of other Xenon movies.

If you like Reggae music, this is a must. Also recommended for any popular music fan, and to any independent cinema fan. You should get the Soundtrack as well, but if you do, go for the DeLuxe (2 CD's) edition! Again, 4 stars, 7/10.
