I was initially hesitant when I heard about this movie, a follow-up to "Before Sunrise". After hearing such great reviews, I finally watched it. I am so happy that I did. This movie was as touching as the first, as wonderfully acted and as naturally fulfilling. It seems like such a simple idea - two people reunite years after a brief romantic encounter. But, this movie grabs you and pulls you into the emotional realm of all the feelings of "what could have been" and "what ifs" like no movie I've seen before. It puts life and love in a refreshing perspective. It's almost impossible to not be able to relate to this story on some level or another as well as (perhaps) stirring up personal uncertainties and emotions.  Yet, it's so simple and so beautifully played out.

Like "Before Sunrise", this movie follows Celine and Jesse as they walk & talk. I was impressed with the realism of the characters and that the same style was followed as before. Also, it was refreshing to see that the characters had developed and matured since the last movie; each with his or her own set of problems, uncertainties and life issues. It didn't just start where it left off, yet you could feel the connectedness they shared and never really lost.

As for the ending (I won't spoil it), I've seen other comments accusing it of being vague. I thought the ending was perfect and its ambiguity was the best route Linklater could've taken. There was a feeling of "are they or aren't they" throughout the movie (in regards to rekindling their love, ending up together, etc.) and I felt that the ending fit just right for that scenario.

If you enjoyed "Before Sunrise", you will love this movie. It's touching, smart, funny and thought-provoking.
