At first this movie seems like another Bank-Robber/Gangster film.

But it quickly changes course, and becomes a fairly deep character-study and a painful, plausible, romance.

It does these last two things beautifully.  The plot, like the character Ben Affleck plays, moves steadily away from robbing and violence, and steadily toward change and honesty.

The heroine, Claire Keesey (played by Rebecca Hall), becomes both the agent and victim of this process, and herself changes and grows, often painfully, in the process.

I have lived in Boston, and I loved the claustrophobic, almost airless, street-level shots of cramped houses and stuffed-together warehouses.

And I LOVED the acting.  I knew Ben Affleck could act (after seeing him in "Good Will Hunting" and "State of Play") but I also knew he mostly doesn't (after seeing him in much else).  Here he is superb.  He underacts, which is precisely right for this role.

His foil is Jeremy Renner, who is superb.  This guy is the best actor in the world.  Eat your heart out, Kevin Spacey.

And Rebecca Hall, whom I had never seen before, is wonderful.  You can see her transformation happening before your eyes: from insular townie to wide-eyed dupe to shocked victim to sneaky conspirator.

And who knew Affleck could direct?  He does.  The movie works seamlessly.  It is exciting, and painful, and moving, and honest, and involving at every turn.

A great film.
