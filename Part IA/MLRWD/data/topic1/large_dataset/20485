Could any film capture the beauty and eroticism of the geisha? I wondered before I saw the film.  I've spent years studying and writing about the geisha and their tantalizing walk, elegant mannerisms, and striking, ageless beauty.  The geisha exudes an air of mystery that both entices and seduces.

Fashionista or femme fatale?  Who are the geisha really?

Gei-sha literally translates to "art person."  They are trained musicians, conversationalists, and party hostesses all rolled into one.  They are not prostitutes.  In fact, the first geisha were men.  Yes, men.

Around 1730 during Japan's Edo period (1601-1868), only men were allowed to entertain in the pleasure quarters housing the courtesans.  Women soon took over the role of geisha, demonstrating their mastery of arts of conversation, song, dance, and musical instruments.  The geisha were known strictly as entertainers and were prohibited from engaging in sex with customers.  That was the job of the courtesan.  Geisha also "dressed down," wearing simple and elegant kimonos so as not to compete with the courtesan.  Geisha weren't even allowed to sit near the courtesan's customers.  They were true artisans making a living at their craft.

I loved the way Rob Marshall portrayed the geisha training in the film.  I was swept away by the beauty and lushness I saw portrayed on the screen.  As many have criticized, the makeup and costumes may not be authentic and the sets Hollywood-bound, but the story of Sayuri transcends all these factors.  The geisha sisterhood is a tradition that crosses over to all cultures and has an effect on each of us.  We are all sisters.

I believe the film bridges the differences between East and West by telling a dramatic and fascinating story in such a way that every woman can embrace it.  Is it a fairy tale?  Maybe.  But that's what pleases the heart most.

And fairy tales last forever.
