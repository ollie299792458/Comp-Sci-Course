Please note that I am reviewing the film as a film rather than as a representation of the historical events of the battle of Ia Drang and of the Seventh Cavalry.
This film strikes me as the most wildly uneven war film ever made. Scenes of extraordinary power and brilliance alternate with the most hackneyed cliches. At its best, "We Were Soldiers" possesses a lyricism not to be found in other war films, especially those about Vietnam. This lyricism comes about through a sort of re-envisioning of moments more or less borrowed from other directors and films ("Platoon" especially, but also the war films of John Ford and others) within the framework of a band of brothers, the sense of which comes through very strongly despite Gibson's mannered performance as the commander. It comes through most of all in Wallace's use of montage, slow motion, and sound design to create a feeling of mythic eternity, which is counterposed to the gritty realism of the battle. The sequence of the battalion leaving for Vietnam is devastating, as is the montage that depicts the final charge at Ia Drang. (There are one or two montages, however, that don't work so well.)
At its worst, the film telegraphs the tired sentimentalism of the genre: the young lieutenant who the viewer knows in the first five seconds will die in battle, the gruff, homespun commander, the perfunctory cuts to the enemy's command post to make sure the audience doesn't think the film is one-sided, the manipulative use of the home front (with Madeline Stowe in an *appalling* sixties wig).
All the same, I highly recommend this film to lovers of the genre, because its best moments are in fact some of the best of all.
