Here in the UK and all that we had from across the pond was Friends or Will & Grace (plus others, I liked Smallville for instance) the prospect of anything cerebral as a TV show was beginning to fade. Along came "24", good action etc... but what about something for the more politically attuned person. The answer, the superb West Wing.

In this 3rd season the characters have developed very nicely, Toby even smiles ! The political meandering & shenanigans make the House of Commons look like first school. What I find missing are historical references such as Bartlett has his MS but then why no mention of Roosevelt's polio, Kennedy's back injury and the drugs he took for it, Reagan's Alzheimer's ? Perhaps out of respect. What about the shady dealings of numerous presidents regarding arms dealing in the world etc.. A lot of this is absolute fact but Bartlett seems too good to be true, a few skeletons in the closet but nothing too shocking (not shocking probably due to my constant exposure to the UK tabloids and their stories).

In summary, very entertaining and best of the bunch. For political drama, the best of any long running series. Lets hope that the quality continues.
