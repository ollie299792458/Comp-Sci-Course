Go where no bug has gone before! Join Flik, Princess Atta, Princess Dot, Heimlich the caterpillar (the food lover), Slim the
walking-stick, Francis the ladybug and Rosie the spider. (doing
a web of safety in less than 50-- bleh!) Now that "in less than 50--bleh!" is in a outtake starring P.T Flea where he says "Spinning a web of safety in less than 50--bleh!". The other parts of the gang are the "Blueberry" troops, Dr. Flora, Thorny,
Cornelius, Queen, Dim the beetle, Mr. Soil, Tuck &amp; Roll
(the pill bug cannonballs!) and their arch villian Hopper.
Now, in this movie, Flik (Dave Foley) is searching for "oppressed
bugs everywhere" but he can't. So he tries to get help from Princess Dot, P.T Flea's circus lineup ( voiced by Bonnie Hunt,
Brad Garrett, Michael McShane, Madeline Kahn and Denis Leary. ) and the Queen (Phyllis Diller). So that means the sun grows the food, the ants pick the food, the ants keep the food, the ants
eat the food and the people watch the movie.
