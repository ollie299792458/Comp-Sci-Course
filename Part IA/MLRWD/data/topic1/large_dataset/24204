I like this movie. On it's own it's a pretty decent flick but since it's compared to the first which is a masterpiece in horror movie making it gets a bad rap. Now one thing most everyone can agree on out of the 3 stories (what happend to 5 stories???) the raft is the stand out here. It's worth the price of admission alone and worth a 4 star if it wasn't for the other 2. And that's not to say the first and third story are bad. They're really good stories honestly, just not executed well. I mean the actors they had in them were good but they have a sort of a take one, good, now print feeling. Basically just a little sloppy and rushed to make a quick buck off the popularity of the first movie.

This is a really great popcorn flick. Why it gets a hard time I don't know, it's a fun movie to watch now as it was back when I was a kid seeing this for the first time. Just remember this isn't Titanic. Gather around the tube, have a few brews with friends and throw your own MST3K comments at this flick and have fun. This is what this movie is all about. But then again isn't all horror just a dark comedy? This movie just makes it a little more obvious!
