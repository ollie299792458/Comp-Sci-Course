I love this movie; however, as I watched it for the second and third I started to feel something disturbed about it.
  Guy Pierce's character is very one-dimensional stereotype of gay people. Hugo Weaving's character of the gay father abandoned his son is totally cliche. The only believeable character is Terence Stamp's Bernice the transexual. Bernice's character is very graceful and anti-stereotyping of drag queens and transexuals. Finally, as an Asian American, it's devastating to watch a Filipina mail-order bride spitting ping-pong balls...As if Asian American images need more assaults from the movie industry.
  Usually I am not a politically-correct guy. As a matter of fact, I detest bandwagon mentality of political correctness. However, enough is enough, let portrays Asian Americans in other lights than the typical molds of nerdy scientists with broken accents, dragon ladies, and mail-order brides with exotic sexual appetites.
  I gave this movie a three stars for its colorfully fun.
