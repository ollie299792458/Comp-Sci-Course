And to think, I was on the edge of my seat through most of the first half of it. The character development early on, while quite weird, does have you wanting them to survive. The bombardment of the forest and the parachute landings of the Nazi troops was breathtakingly realistic and you could feel the fear of Frol and "The Lily of the Valley." What a great movie this could have been. From then on, it was almost comical, by the time you get to the massacre scenes, you could completely understand how all these people died. Rushing to meet the Germans in town? Wandering through vast open fields in the middle of the day? It was so silly that by the time the epic climax unfolds, you couldn't care less, and you are left wondering how much more bizarre will this get. And it does.

There are no historical records of any Eitzengruppen units being captured wholesale by the partisans, and even if they did, what did this freakish Nazi prisoner scene have to do with anything?

The director of this movie was clearly insane. If for some reason this condition was brought upon him by the horrors of war, I apologize for pointing this out.

What Germany did during the Third Reich was an atrocious crime upon humanity, a blood stain that will forever darken that nations history. This film does not even remotely capture the depth of depravity that was inflicted by the "master race" upon it's totally innocent victims.

The Holocaust was not some drunken frat party, as this movie implies.
