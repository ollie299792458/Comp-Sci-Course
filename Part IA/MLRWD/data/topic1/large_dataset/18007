One of the most under-rated comedies in the last twenty years. Like Kelly's Heroes in the early seventies, this just suffered from bad timing. 
Kelly's Heroes bombed at the box office because it was a war movie at the peak of the anti-war sentiment inspired by Vietnam. It has since been recognized as a classic comedy.
Similarly, Big Trouble just hit at the wrong time, right after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. But give it time, and it will similarly become recognized as a classic.
If you've read the book, you'll be impressed with the casting, which is almost perfect. Only Puggy seemed a little off, and even that wasn't too bad. Tim Allen is perfect as the protagonist, and he also does the narration, which is excellent. The hitmen (Dennis Farina and Jack Kehler) are just right. I have to give Dennis Farina particular note - he was probably the funniest person in the cast. Barry Sonnenfeld is, of course, a great comedic director, and he keeps the whole thing flowing with good comic timing. 
The movie's kind of wacky, but if you read and appreciate Dave Barry's humor columns, then you'll probably love it.  If you haven't read the novel, watch for the toad, the goats, Martha Stewart's hallucinagenic image, and, of course, the "garbage disposal". And if you read and liked the novel, you really ought to get this movie.
