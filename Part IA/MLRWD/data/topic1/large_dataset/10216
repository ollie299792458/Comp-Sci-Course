I first saw this movie back in 1981. I remember my dates face buried in my shoulder through most of it. Ghost story is based on the Peter Straub novel of the same name, most people state that the book is far better than the movie, and I tried reading the book, but it was drawn out and tedious. The movie entails the story of a group of afluent old men in a small New England town who share a terrible secret, and a spirit bent on revenge. Alice Krige absolutely shines in this movie. I had a huge crush on her after seeing this film. She is sexy, seductive, mysterious. She is also the undead spirit of a woman killed some 50 years before by the "chowder society" the a fore mentioned group of old men. The special effects are somewhat dated, but effective. The cinematography is excellent, and the setting of the town is at times very beautiful. There is one very hokey scene of Craig Wasson falling to his death that will probably make you laugh.But, if you like a series of freaky killings instigated by a animated rotting corpse, this is your film. But the flashback scenes are very well done, and the love story is enthralling. There is a sense of sadness that runs through the film its a very somber mood that runs though the entire movie. In my opinion, the ghost was justified in her revenge. But watch it for yourself. This isnt a gorefest, it has some gore, but its more psychological terror. So if you are looking for a slasher movie, look elswhere. If you are looking for a good old fashoned ghost story, this is the place.
