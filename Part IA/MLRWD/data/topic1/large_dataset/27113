The Schumacher Batman movies have been much maligned, especially since "Batman and Robin," but "Batman Forever" isn't that bad. It isn't a Burton film, but it doesn't try to be. Schumacher's new take is that Batman is "whole." His is not the brooding obsessive as freakish as the monsters he fights whom Michael Keaton plays. Schumacher is not a good enough director to fully realize his vision, which is why the resolution is so hollow and anti-climactic, so he expands the supporting cast, brightens the art direction and focuses on techno-wizardry over mood.
It isn't as layered as Burton's efforts, but it's slicker. From Jim Carrey's over-the-top performance to the sexy grooving soundtrack, it feels like an average summer thrill ride, but it is thrilling. What little substance there is comes from the actors, who have little to work with. Nicole Kidman (again) delivers a performance better than the movie deserves and makes Chase Meridian the most complex character in the film. Tommy Lee Jones (and Two-Face, a fascinating member of Batman's rogues gallery) is wasted, but he finds a moment at the end of the film.
Compared to the Burton films, these moments are rare, but "Batman Forever" looks nice. With its cartoonish characters, colorful sets and lack of brutal violence, it will also appeal to young kids more than the first two. The DVD version, no frills though it is, is therefore a better deal -- the format preserves the bright colors of the visuals and stomach-stirring subtleties of the sound.
The DVD chapter review also offers the chance to edit the movie, thus creating any of a number of much better films: a quirky soap opera (Kidman scenes), a screwball comedy (Carrey scenes) or even, yes, homosexual erotica ("You'll need a friend." "Not just a friend, a PARTNER.")
It may not be the Batman movie Burton fans had hoped for, but as junk food for your brain, it's a fun way to put your brain on hold for a couple of hours.
