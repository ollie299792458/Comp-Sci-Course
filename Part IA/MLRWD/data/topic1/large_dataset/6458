This is a controversial and challenging film about the death of the American president, John Fitzgerald Kennedy and its aftermath. Almost since the day he died in 1963, rumours have abounded to the effect that there was  a cover-up in the investigation which then began. Various notables have  interested themselves in this story over the years. Bertrand Russell wrote  a book about it after the publication of the Warren Report in 1967. Neither  he nor anyone since has had their questions taken seriously, least of all  by the American establishment. 
Oliver Stone's film recapitulates all the  main evidence pointing to a conspiracy and does so in some detail. In the  end, we find ourselves asking just what are the limits of our belief (or  disbelief) in this matter. Could the CIA have deliberately murdered the  President on behalf of an industrial consortium who wanted war in Vietnam?  Was the Vice President involved? This is a long, involved film but worth  the time nonetheless. After all, it just may be one of the most important  stories of the twentieth century.
