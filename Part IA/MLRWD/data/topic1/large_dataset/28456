This film shows yet again how much mileage there is in the old stories. Beowulf is a poem from the Anglo-Saxon oral bardic tradition, written down by someone who had read Vergil's Aeneid, and who gives a Christian overlay to a pagan legend - the monster Grendel is called by the scribe a "son of Cain". In the film, the hero (who has inadvertently brought the monster to Earth, along with his load of guilt) is named Kainan.
So how does this film compare with other films that draw on the Beowulf story? Sturla Gunnarsson, in Beowulf & Grendel, makes the monster an almost human troll, so he can dispense with CGI and focus more on the psychological than the physical conflicts. Much of this film's pleasure comes from following the hero's attempts to find out the truth in a confusing situation. John McTiernan's The 13th Warrior, based on Michael Crichton's novel, combines elements of the Beowulf story with other folklore and invention, and hooks the audience by giving it the point of view of the reluctant hero - a sophisticated man banished for his indiscretions from the refined Arab culture of the time. Like Outlander, it shows believable Vikings rather than Hollywood stereotypes. All three films benefit from using live human actors, unlike the recent atrocity where the actors contributed only their voices and their gestures in motion suits to the CGI.
If you want tortured and intricate characterization rather than believable conflict and action, you can always go back to Ingmar Bergman. But for a very entertaining and well done new version of an ancient story, this film would be hard to top.
