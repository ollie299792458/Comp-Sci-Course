I grew up with The Rockford Files and it is a real treat to finally have them re-released on DVD (thank you Universal!). To long-time fans such as myself the episodes are as fresh and exciting as when I first saw them. To newer viewers I would say that The Rockford Files has some of the finest stories and acting that ever were on television. If you like more contemporary shows such as The Sopranos you may really appreciate The Rockford Files, as the show delves deeply into the psychology of a "private eye" and his personal battles as well as telling a great story. To the show's credit I cannot think of a weak episode. The show is also an entertaining window into the Los Angeles of the 1970s -- the cars, the clothes, the restaurants, the lifestyle, and the social mores. Finally, James Garner's Rockford is such an interesting character -- basically a nice guy, funny, sarcastic, smart, gullible, brilliantly played by Garner. I am eagerly awaiting the release of Seasons 4, 5, and 6, as well as the movies.
