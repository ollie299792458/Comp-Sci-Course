Let me start out this review by starting with questions. What is cube?Where is the cube? What is the purpose of the cube? Who made the cube?How big is the cube? Is there a way out? Cube is about a group of six people who wake up in this cube looking for a way out. Each person has theirr strengths and weaknesses. I sum up cube as six lab mice are put in a huge maze (with square rooms some with traps) as part of some scientific experiment is this the answer? Your cast consists of a doctor, an engineer, an escape artist, student, a cop, and an autistic all who just want one thing to escape, but maybe just maybe one of them knows more than they are telling. Who is it and what do they know? Great suspense, the cast seems real,unique traps, a must buy or at least rent( rent at least once you may be surprised how good it is if you give it a chance) because it may not be for everyone.Some thinking is required to see the solutions to the maze. and I am not telling if anyone gets out cause I don't want to spoil this movie and I want to watch it again. Don't let this low budget movie pass you buy, just cause it is a low budget movie doesn't mean it is no good in fact it is even better than some of the big budget movies out there.Cube is one movie that isn't square.
