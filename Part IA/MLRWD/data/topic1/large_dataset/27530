The Wraith is a modern remake of the Clint Eastwood classic, "High Plains Drifter." In "The Wraith," Eastwood is replaced by Sheen, and the horse by a fantasically futuristic car; the Dodge/PPG Industries Pace car, AKA the Turbo Interceptor in the film.

Jamie Hankins is dating Keri Johnson. The leader of a notorious road racing gang has claimed Keri for himself, however, and decides to eliminate the competition. Jamie is brutally murdered and his body set ablaze in a fiery car crash. Now, Jamie was no good guy in life, and upon his arrival in Hell, he makes a pact with the devil to exchange the souls of every gang member responsible for his death, in exchange for his own soul's release.

Jamie returns to Earth as Jake; the driver of the hottest car ever built. One by one, he eggs members of the gang into races, where he emerges victorious and the loser ends up dead; his eyes missing. This is a sure sign they have been sent back to Hell. Each time a gang member is killed, a mysterious brace disappears. Once the last member is dead, the final brace is gone, and Jake/Jamie is free once more.

This is one of my favorite movies, and I was privileged to work with David Sherrill recently, who played Skank in this movie. A lot of these guys were nobodies when it came out, but have since gone on to much bigger and better things.

An awesome movie with a killer 80's soundtrack.
