SPOILER ALERT! A great cast, adult subject matter that really matters, but (and here I know of no way to critique this film without revealing to some extent a major plot point) the final denouement left me shaking my head, thinking "Are you kidding me?" Would you spend years in prison and lose your family when all you had to say under oath was "My source is not, and never was, a government official in any capacity and is not now nor ever has worked for the U.S. government" and you could walk away? Beckinsale's character is imprisoned not for refusing to name her source, but for impeding an investigation. If her source did not commit a crime, there was nothing to charge her with. The special prosecutor had the burden of proving her guilt, but had no proof that she was protecting a government official. And children of 6 or 8 years old can't be charged with treason. Which made me go from thinking the reporter was bravely standing up for her Constitutional rights, to thinking she was a shallow idiot who let pride ruin her life.
