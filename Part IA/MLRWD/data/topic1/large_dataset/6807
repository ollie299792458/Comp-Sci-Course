This was a such a disappointment, and sure to be a minor footnote in the history of the "Apes" movies, so it's hardly worth going into a lengthy review of what's wrong with it.  First, the corny moments-- references to the original movie which just fall flat as humor or tributes (though the scene where Wahlberg's character kisses the female chimp who befriends him is a clever and unexpected turn on the original), then the monumentally stupid scene at the climax of the ape/human battle when the space chimp comes down, and the apes stop the battle to genuflect.  This was supposed to the dramatic climax of the movie, for crying out loud!  Compare that with the climactic scene in the '68 version, and you'll see how this one falls short.  Also, the plot is way to predictable -- I had the end figured out within the first five minutes of the movie -- although, to the movie's credit, it does explain why there would be an alien world with human beings, chimps, orangutans, and gorillas.  There are some good ideas in the movie, and also on the plus side, I've always wanted to the see the final scene in this movie on film since reading the original novel, from whence the scene originates.  But overall, this movie has none of the drama, tension, and memorable dialogue from the original.  Maybe it was the lack of memorable dialogue in the script that prompted them to re-use the most memorable lines from the original in new contexts. I'm a fan, and this is the first time I've been truly let down by Tim Burton.  I've heard that the overall disappointment that greeted this film's release has ensured that there will be no sequels.  Let's hope we can have an end to bad remakes of other classic '70's movies, as well.
