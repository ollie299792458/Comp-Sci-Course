I purchased this dvd as i had previously heard good reviews, and it starred Glen Close and James Marsden, two actors whom i like from there current and previous tv and film choices. The movie starts of at a slow pace introducing all the major characters and their characters flaws in there different relationships, the end reveal of Jonathan(James Marsden) character and Alex (Jesse Bradford)character seemed a little rushed as if the scriptwriter or even the director could not think of a more subtle way of the shocking reveal to Isabel(Elizabeth Banks)and could have maybe gradually throughout the film hinted at to the viewer, instead of a 'ta dah' reveal end of movie  even though throughout the movie it was hinting at that Johnathan's character has something to hid from Isabel in there relationship, that he wanted to be kept hidden,Glenn Close's character (Diana)the theatre lovie actress whose marriage is breaking down, due to her husband's infidelity is touching, whilst wishing that her daughter Isabel's forthcoming marriage is a disappointment in wishing her daughter would find someone else instead of Jonathan who has no aspirations suitable for her daughter. But who in the end  Isabel finds a more suitable partner than Jonathan.
