In "Topper", Grant and Bennett play a couple of ghosts who have remained on earth. They need to perform a good deed to earn their
way into heaven. They zero in on their target, Cosmo Topper, and try to get him to enjoy life a bit more. Topper is a stodgy, boring,
henpecked banker. Topper`s idea of a wild time is reading the morning paper while his wife tells him how to conduct himself as a
proper pillar of the community. So they have their work cut out for them with comic results.

In some ways "Topper Returns" is even funnier than the original, dispite lacking Cary Grant`s starpower.
Joan Blondel is the ghost of a murdered woman who enlists the reluctant Topper to find her killer. This would have been the setting
for an excellent comedy all by itself. But the real comic performance in the movie is by Eddie Anderson. For those not familure with
him, Eddie was better known as Rochester on the Jack Benny show.
Anderson was a fantastic comedian. And he turned in a great performance in this movie. Every funny ghost story needs at least one
character that is scared to death of ghosts, and he does it up right. Eddie most definately wants nothing to do with things that
go bump in the night.
