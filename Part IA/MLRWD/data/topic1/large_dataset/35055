To add to what FlickFlack (NM, USA) said previously:  The most obvious evidence of top and bottom clipping can be seen early in the movie when Dr. Marvin (Hugh Marlowe) is describing, with the use of an animated graphic, how his "birds" (satellites) will be orbited around Earth.  In the original film and the VHS tape, you can see the complete circular orbit paths.  In the "widescreen" DVD, the graphic has been significantly butchered.

The IMDB ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049169/ ) says that "Earth vs" was originally shot at a widescreen 1.85:1 ratio, but they've been wrong before.  E. Lentoni (Long Island) in the preceeding message says that it was filmed at 1.33:1.  I don't know who's correct, but I do know that I've never seen a true widescreen version on either tape or disc.  Although many 1950's films were shot at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (the same shape as a TV picture tube, as a matter of fact), there were a lot of wider formats after about 1953.  With the introduction of the DVD, I've certainly seen the "shortscreen" version.

Here's an irritating fact:  Assume that the original film really was 1.85:1.  Then trim the edges to make a fullscreen 1.33:1 image for the VHS tape.  You have just removed 28 percent of the picture, leaving 72 percent.  Now take that reduced image and trim the top and bottom off to make a "fake" widescreen 1.85:1 DVD image  This is what Columbia did.  You have now reduced the image to 72 percent of it's already shrunken size, and 52 percent of the filmed size.  That's what you get with the DVD- only about 52 percent of the original filmed picture remains.  You've lost essentially HALF of the picture information!
