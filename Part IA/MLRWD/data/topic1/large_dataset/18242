From that night in the winter of 1988, when I was three years old and first watched a recording of "The Nutcracker" starring Gelsey Kirkland and Mikhail Baryshnikov, I was spoiled for almost every other rendition of the ballet.  Never mind that, during the recording, someone must have changed the channel and replaced Harlequin's dance with commercials and a small segment of an episode of The Munsters, but it is still a timeless, ALMOST flawless interpretation.  My main qualms with this version, though I did not perceive of any flaws at the time given my tender age, had to do with content.  In an effort to fit the broadcast into a 90-minute format including commercials, some portions of the score, some minor routines-and, most glaringly, the Arabian dance "Coffee"-had to be omitted.  The reinterpretation of the Pas de Deux between the Sugarplum Fairy and her Cavalier to a Pas de Trois between Clara, Drosselmeyer and the Prince-a fight between fantasy and reality over a girl who dared to dream-was well done and reestablished a plot line where previously there had been a Divertissement of mostly ethnic dances.  "Tea," the Chinese Dance, stands out in my mind as one of my favorites.
I wanted to give this four and a half stars, but unfortunately that is not possible.  But all in all, this is a magical interpretation of a magical ballet, and is an essential purchase for any fan of the Nutcracker.
