I have heard all the negative reviews by the people of this movie and I don't understand it at all because this movie pulls no punches in uncovering the last few disturbing days of Laura Palmer. This movie gives the killer and the imagery is absolutely stunning. I remember looking in the movie store and seeing the cover of this movie and it peaked my interest. This was one hell of a ride to take and I have done it again and again. There is no need to have some of the principal characters of the series in the movie because it's better to wait for the series and meet these characters. The mystique of the man from another place and the red room are right there in this masterpiece of mystery and suspense. You meet Laura Palmer up close and personal. This movie is a brilliant depiction of the prom queen who was looking for true love but wanted to be wild. This movie is Lynch's best work and I will stick by those words because this film is what introduced me to Laura and the Twin Peaks television series. You are horrified, you cry and are deeply touched by the depiction of Laura's self destruction and it leads to what is revealed in the pilot and the other episodes. Don't read the reviews of this film because take my word for it. It is a masterpiece and the way to meet Laura Palmer. Please take this ride and buy the DVD when it comes out.
