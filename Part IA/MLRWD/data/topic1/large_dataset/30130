Like others here, it's hard not to comment about this film's reputation as a "flop," or as the "film that almost ruined Carrey's career."  So many people dislike this film, and my guess it's those who a) pretentiously avoid Jim Carrey at all costs or b) love his other films and were utterly disappointed that this wasn't like Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber.  Well,  too bad for them.  This is a fantastic film, and only gets better with time.  Not only does it have a terrific cast, the theme is surprisingly poignant for a comedy.  After all, who hasn't known someone who was socially dysfunctional--someone who always tried to hard to fit in, yet completely missed the boat on proper social cues?  It makes a terrific subject for comedy, and in the case of the Cable Guy, it's superbly handled.  Still ranks as my favorite film from Stiller, Carrey, and Broderick.  The hilarious dialogue still has me quoting it aloud.  The basketball and Medieval Times scenes will stay with me, possibly forever.
