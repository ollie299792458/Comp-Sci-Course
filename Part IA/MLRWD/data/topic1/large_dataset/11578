Let's consider the average running time of a film... - about 90 minutes for most of them.  Now, let's "round-up" the 17 minutes I've referred to in the title, to about 20 minutes.  Taking the difference of the two, we are left with a 70 minute film - just over an hour.  Wouldn't you feel slightly gyped if you were to pay nine dollars at the theatre to see a one-hour film?  This is how I feel about this movie.  Although I've written the AFI numerous e-mails about the apparent "missing 17 minutes", (the American release of the film is 17 minutes shy of the international release), they refuse to respond.  Initially, imdb.com listed the running-time of this film at 118 minutes - now if you look, it's about 101 minutes.  Apparently, the forces that be deemed the content of that 17 minutes, too politically charged to leave in the American release... hmmm - Makes you wonder what else they're changing for the benefit of our fragile constitutions (Yes, I used this word purposely).  Here's to censorship for all, and 17 more minutes to gorge ourselves on the worlds fading resources!!
