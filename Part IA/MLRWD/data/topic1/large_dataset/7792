It's been a few years since I saw this terrible movie in theater.  I went to see it originally because the commercials and previews looked good. Let me first say I've never played the games the movies are based off of, so I had no expectations about the movie.  I recently had to watch it again at a friends house to my horror.

Ok now onto the movie. First lets start with the story/characters. The story was incoherent mess with no real back story, and no main story what so ever. On a side note did anyone notice the beginning scenes. They were scenes from DARK ANGEL. The back story was a copy of DARK ANGEL. DARK ANGEL came out in 1999, I'm not sure when Hitman first came out, but I'm sure it was after 1999. Ok back to topic, with there being no story it left the characters with nothing, no personality, nothing to draw you into their lives. Next we have the Action/special effects which was the best part of this bad movie. Still it was nothing new, or nothing that separates it from all the other average action movies out there.

Finally the music, or lack of any to add depth to the movie. I don't think I heard any at all.

Overall a below average action movie. I can't believe I wasted $7.00 going to see this movie, and was stuck watching it again at a friends house. Don't waste any money on this movie.  When I first saw it at the theater, the previews were better than the movie. I AM LEGEND, IRON MAN, the new Will Ferral movie, and JUMPER. They were all better than this movie.

Why can't movie studio's make a good movie based off a video game, is it really that hard.  They've managed to do it with TV, comics, books, plays, and real life events, but they can't do it with video games. WHY!
