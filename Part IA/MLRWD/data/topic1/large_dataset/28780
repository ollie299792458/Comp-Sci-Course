Pandorum was a nice surprise.  I hadn't heard of it but really enjoyed it and would watch it again.  The story begins as a man wakes up on a spaceship bound on a hundred year voyage from an overpopulated earth to a distant planet which can support life.  Suspended animation has given the man temporary memory loss which wears off with time.  He knows he is a member of the flight crew, and finds one other crew man.  As his memories come back, the man tries to find other members of the flight crew, and to determine just what is off about the spaceship.  As it turns out, a lot is off.  Strange human-like creatures roam the ship, and they like to eat anything they can find, and the generator at the core of the spaceship seems to be failing as there are intermittent brown outs.  Soon the man encounters other people awake from suspended animation.  Together they try to survive the strange creatures that want to eat them and to determine what has gone wrong with the ship and where they are in their voyage.

The story unfolds really well.  The film was moody and even though I kind of saw plot points coming, I didn't see clearly enough to get bored, and there were unpredictable and well-done tangents into the lives of the few people in the story. Best of all, the movie had a good ending.  That's important.

Overall, if this movie sounds like it might appeal to you, then I recommend watching it and checking it out.  It was a pretty, engaging, and satisfying experience.
