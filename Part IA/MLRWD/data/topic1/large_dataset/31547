What a great film!!!  Truly slaps me into "Greek" reality.  Born in America, but being 100% Greek myself, the movie portrayed a believable (and at times scary) Greek family, with its Greek traditions, with its Greek "quarky" attitudes...  I want my parents to see this film and I predict my father will find nothing unusual about the "yard art" and the home.  He will most likely admire it. (with the majority of Greeks being tacky amd tasteless, in my opinion). It is truly heart-warming film.  Nia Vardalos created a masterpiece.  Kazan and Martin truly did a great job being "Greek"...  only one thing:  Greeks make cakes with "holes" in the middle as well. TOO FUNNY!!!  This is a MUST see movie whether you are Greek, Italian, Jewish, etc.  Americans will enjoy the film but will not absorb the full impact unless you have been raised in a European family.  The cultures are so different. See this movie a second time (as I did).  Its amazing how much I missed the first time.  I can hardly wait for this to come out on DVD.  It is predicatable at times, but who cares!!! You won't stop laughing!
