The first time I did this dvd I hated it!  I have been working out to Jari Love's dvd's for a couple years now and really loved the one before this one...Ripped and Chiseled.  When I first did this one I felt like I could barely  keep up!  While the other dvd's have a little break between each exercise where you have time to change weights, see what is coming up next, and get in position, this one moves from exercise to exercise very quickly.  It is also more of a cardio workout than one to sculpt and chisel muscle.  I did't get sore at all from doing it, though did have that good "after glow" to my some of my muscles.

I usually only have time to do the 30 minute workout and I feel it gives a good overall workout in that amount of time.  It's nice that it is broken down into either of the two workouts or you can do the combined one for an extra intensive work.  It gets my heart rate up quite nicely and once I got over the drastic difference from Jari's past dvd's, I found that I really do like this workout!  With use I'm starting to know what is coming next so the fast pace is not leaving me behind like it did at first.  I still use Ripped and Chiseled on Saturdays when I have an hour to workout, and it is still my favorite, but this dvd definitely has a place in my collection and I feel it's a good one to keep my metabolism up.
