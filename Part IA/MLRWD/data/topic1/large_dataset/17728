A fabulous documentary of a genius cult leader. Move over Branch Davidians! Excelent interviews with defenders and critics, it's all Chomsky all the time!

Production values are okay for a documentary, although I would have preferred more shaky cam action, in keeping with the constant disorienting in order to reorient you that is so common with Chomskyites.

Noam Chomsky is a religious cult, and has skills even a dead Mesmer envies. Master of the rapid-fire counterfactual (if he wore a tinfoil hat and didn't bath, you'd mistake him for a schizophrenic homeless person), one cannot escape the construct of his rhetoric, simply because it is a closed hermeneutic circle of simultaneously no authority and his own node of authority. The Chomsky tautology is the ultimate "ommmm" chant for leftists who have abandoned the search for god, become disgusted with the idol of themselves in God's place, and need that vacuum of prophetic voice filled with someone. Enter clown Chomsky, stage left.

Chomsky isn't a Holocaust denier, and the backwater back and forth arguments of Semitic anti-Semites is such a stew it has expelled a good many well-intended leftists from the cacophony of the kvetching. But he is far worse, he is a Khmer Rouge auto genocide denier, and on a proportional scale the Cambodian genocide was far graver than the Holocaust (spare me your elevation of a Western European post enlightenment horror indignation preference construct over the troubles of the little brown people, you Colonialist revanchist you).

Chomsky, in other words, is an ideologue par excellence: he can deny fact.

For those of you who've gotten this far and are still Chomsky apologists: please read the Anti-Chomsky Reader for actual scholarly rebuttals to his thinking and positions.
