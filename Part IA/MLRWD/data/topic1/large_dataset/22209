I have read a good deal of Robert E. Howard and have to say it is nice to see something much closer to his actual work.  The old Arnold version was okay, but things like "the riddle of steel" was never in the Conan stories.  And Crom was not a Norse god, and Valhalla wasn't part of Conan's people's mythology.  Crom was a dark deity, and one best avoided, and his name generally used as a curse...  very appropriately used in this movie as a swear.

There are a couple cheesy Hollywood moments, most notable the flipping carriage in slow-motion.  That I could have done without.  But otherwise I was quite happy with this version.  Conan looked more like a warrior than a body-builder (two very different body types, as anyone who knows much on the subject can tell you) and his overall attitude was very fitting.  The magical evil the villain harnesses is even a little tentacle-y, which given Howard's long distance friendship with HP Lovecraft is where that influence came from in his stories; Howard's 'gods' tended to be a bit on the cthonic side.  A nice little bit put in there.
