Is there anything I can say that hasn't already been said? March of the Penguins is a delightful movie about the most regal of penguins-the Emperor Penguin. My comment is that I was most impressed by the personalities (and endurance of the weather conditions) of the different penguins. Most notably...

1. A baby penguin who was so attached to its mother, that unlike the other baby penguins, it tried to follow her back to the ocean, when the natural occurence is that the baby penguins were to be left alone until the father returned.

2. During the extremely harsh winters, the transfer of the egg from the mother-to-father or father-to-mother, can result in the "death" of the egg. Likewise a chick that gets lost from the mother or the pack, can freeze to death readily. In one instance, that did occur. A mother penguin lost her chick in the storm, and upon finding it dead she was overcome with "grief." The loss she experienced and her instinct to mother was so great, she tried to steal a baby chick from the pouch of another mother penguin! She stood and waited and tried to bum rush the other mother penguin. To me, viewing that behavior-was simply amazing!

3....and in furtherance of that, other members of the pack of penguins joined the struggle and actually prevented the grief-stricken mother from stealing the baby chick. This was so incredible the human-like behavioral dynamics in penguins-no less.

One word of caution is that although March of the Penguins is rated G, there ia a scene of the penguins mating. The only drawback in the movie for me. Perhaps, I should stick to PG movies?
