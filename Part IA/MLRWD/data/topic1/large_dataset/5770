Like everyone else my expectations were limited on the direct to DVD sequel.  The first one was enjoyable in an action guy movie way.  This one shocked me to have enough story and be just as enjoyable for the action flick that it is.  I saw the first one last year, so its been awhile, but this one at first felt like going to the well on characters.  The main character is so much like Jason Statham that you wonder if its the same character with a different actor (it is a different character).  Aside from that, the other familiarities are forgivable.  The story set up pretty well and makes sense in an action movie way.  The actors are great - enjoyed seeing Danny Trejo and some of the others.  The women's prison ladies are hot and their involvement although not explicitly explained, makes enough sense.  The driving dynamics/expertise are sufficiently set up early in the movie to make sense why they get involved later, but thankfully you're well into the movie and enjoying the action before they evolve to the racing.  Overall a job very well done.
