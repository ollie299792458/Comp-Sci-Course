As has been said, the movie has very little to do with the book that shares it's title. Rather, most of it is from the second two "books" of Night Watch. Understanding that, I still whole-heartedly recommend this movie to any science fiction or vampire fan, and even fans of the original written series. You may be disappointed by the dissimilarities, but if you keep an open mind, and judge the movie on it's own merits, I think you'll enjoy Day Watch.

I saw this in the theatres, and the subtitling was excellent, as always, and continues to be creatively used and made a living part of the movie. I agree that overall, the movie isn't as dark and depressing as Night Watch, and I'm not a fan of the ending, since it closes off any logical continuation of Anton and Svetlana's story in Twilight Watch. But that's really the only big problem I have. The special effects are NOT overdone, in my opinion, they are used to good effect, and although the plot is complicated, a second or third viewing cleared up a lot of questions. So does reading Night Watch in it's entirety.

Bravo to Fox for not totally ruining a great foreign film, and I'm not sure what the differences will be in this unrated version, but hopefully the DVD will also include interviews with either Sergei Lyukanenko and/or Timur Bekmambetov like Night Watch, where they go into how they designed the movie.

My final recommendation is a definite yes to buying or at the very least renting this movie and expanding your cultural horizons. See how other countries do horror.
