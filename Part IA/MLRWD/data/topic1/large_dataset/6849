"Blanc" (White) is part of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy of French films with the names of colors of the French flag.  It is a deep movie that with a lot of symbolism.  From items that are the same color as the title and may have deeper meaning (such as pidgins, bird droppings, and even toilets) to reoccurring themes (such as the main character Karol using his binoculars thought the film), there are more than a few things in here to make film watchers wondering for a long time.

The premise of the story is a bit depressing.  It starts out with a man getting divorced.  Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) doesn't want a divorce, but is pushed into this new life by his mean wife who torments him.

Karol transforms himself from a hairdresser to a business savvy man.  With his newfound skills, he cooks up a plot to get the attention of his ex-wife.  I found his determination to be the most enjoyable part of the film.  It may be debatable whether he was motivated by revenge or love, but regardless of his motivation, the story is compelling.

Although the film has a French title, the language of the film is a mix of French and Polish, with Polish being spoken more than French.  Besides Zamachowski, "White" also stars three other highly talented Polish actors (Jerzy Stuhr, Janusz Gajos, and Cezary Pazura).  Overall, I thought the film was well cast and is sure to entertain, albeit in a black humor type of way.
