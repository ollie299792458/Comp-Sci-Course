This movie showcased Angelina's beauty and mysterious charm, that is by far, her greatest asset.  Johnny did well portraying a simple average Math teacher, who was taken away by Angelina from the very beginning.  This movie had a light, but elegant mix of suspense, star power, intrigue, adventure, comedy and a great ending.  I know it was not meant to blow us away, but that was not a bad thing.  I am a big fan of foreign films which are usually very similar to a film like this.  A good film is not always a measure of how MUCH is put into it, but sometimes about how LITTLE is put into it.  It kind of like a great meal consisting of small portions versus an average meal consisting of large portions.  Which would you prefer?  Americans tend to prefer the latter.  This film was not overdone, yet, is was very good in it's genre, which is not too common in American cinema. It was sad to read the bad reviews because I enjoyed the shoot locations and all of the actors; this movie really was well casted.
