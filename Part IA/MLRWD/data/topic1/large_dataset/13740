I first came across Absolutely Fabulous one night on Comedy Central while channel surfing. I could not believe what unqualified brilliance I was beholding. I sat stunned &amp; completely enthralled at the adventures of Eddy, Patsy and the long-suffering Saffy. This was like nothing I had ever seen. Jennifer Saunders is a comic genius with rivals to none other than perhaps Lucille Ball. Due to the fact that she also wrote the series I would tend to give her the nod. It's too bad that when she was exposed to American television on Friends (as Ross' bride to be Emily's Mother) her part was so small that her talents were not revealed to the broader US television audience. The supporting cast is also magnificent, Joanna Lumley as Patsy is terrific as the drunken nymphomaniac. Julia Sawalha is remarkable in her role as Saffy, who actually acts as more of a Mother to Eddy than daughter. It's this role reversal that allows her to get off the best one liners. June Whitfield as Mother and Jane Horrocks as Buble round out this noteworthy cast. If ever anything was made for DVD, this is it. Absolutely Fabulous is Absolutely Brilliant.
