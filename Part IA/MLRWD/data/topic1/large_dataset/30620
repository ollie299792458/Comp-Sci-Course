David Cronenberg is a remarkable filmmaker.  He started out directing shclock, B-movie material, but those were infused with his own sensibility, which really came out in his later work.  Dead Ringers is one of his best films, and a truly disturbing, powerful film about identity and siblings.  Jeremy Irons's performance is probably the best of his career, even greater than his turn in Reversal of Fortune.  He plays both twins equally well, making each twin distinctive in their own right.  There is a very interesting story behind the casting of Irons.  Cronenberg said in the commentary track on the Criterion DVD that he sent this script to all the A-list talent at the time, and they all turned him down.  But all of the A-list talent were American actors who were "uncomfortable" playing a gynecologist.  When Jeremy Irons received the script, he immediately said yes.  It shows you the vast differences between the American attitude towards sex, and the British (who are known to be prudes, but are far more intelligent than Americans in sexual matters).  Cronenberg's direction is masterful, building incredible tension throughout the film, and his mise en scene and colour schemes are some of the best in his career.  The "instruments for operating on mutan women" segment is one of Cronenberg's most horrifying creations (these instruments were actually displayed in many art galleries after the film was made).  This film was made before the advent of CGI, so all the twin sequences were done on film.  They are seamless.  This film, like many other Cronenberg works, haunts you long after the theater, and is still talked about day, and with good reason...
