I popped this DVD in, hoping, it would not be the typical Hollywood leftwing film. Unfortunatetly, I was wrong. The movie is technically good. The acting is good. I just could not get over the tired leftwing plot and theme. I mean, think about how paranoid and unrealistic this movie is ! All the bad guys are white men (conservatives and neocons). All the good guys (except one) are women and Hispanics. The Hispanic FBI agent, to underline the point that the Left is the power of good in our universe, puts on a Che Guevara T-shirt at one point (mind you, Che personally had 1500 men killed, including teenagers, and hated gays and "artists"). The screenplay is full of typical Hollywood leftist lines about WMDs in Iraq, neocons, etc. To underline that the bad guys in our world are Republicans, in one scene, the bad guys meet in a room full of portraits of people like Bush Sr., Teddy Roosevelt, etc. This movie is just over the top, tired, and cliched. It is a paranoid vision of how our government works. In a post 9-11 world, I personally find it offensive to proclaim that the U.S. government is the enemy. This screenplay could have been written by Ward Churchill or Noam Chomsky. Americans need to start boycotting Hollywood. I am sick of this.

"There are no sides. Only haves and have nots". No one thinks like that. This is a cardboard version of what American conservatives think.

If Hollywood writers, directors, and screenwriters ever met real conservatives, they wouldn't have this ridiculous worldview.
