Three things I'll never be: 1. Colombian. 2. A pregnant teenager. 3. A drug mule. Three things this movie allowed me to experience: see above. I have no idea about the reality of the day-to-day life of teenagers in Colombia, and no knowledge of the inner workings of drug smuggling, but this movie provided a convincing portrait of both.

I was fascinated by the early scenes of Maria just being Maria. The time spent with her boyfriend, at a dance, and with Maria's family made for an interesting film on its own. The movie lets the characters unfold, and there is never the feeling that exposition is happening. By the time we learn Maria is pregnant (I felt I knew before she did), we are deeply committed to the well-being of this character.

The second act of the film has Maria entering the domain of drug smugglers. These scenes show that the reality of the drug trade is far removed from the super-villains of Reagan era drug war propaganda. The movie presents drug smuggling as a brutal and shabby small business that also offers unimaginable opportunities to young people.

For me, the high point of the second act was the tense airplane ride from Colombia to the US. Knowing what Maria carried inside her; that it was both precious and poisonous, and that it could lead to her imprisonment or freedom, I held my breath as the reality of the situation slowly dawned on the characters.

The later scenes, set in the United States, didn't live up to the earlier part of the movie for me. Maria's journey seemed half-fulfilled and I almost wish the movie had ended earlier. However, there are still many powerful moments, such as Maria's confrontation with the sister of another "mule."

Watch this movie.
