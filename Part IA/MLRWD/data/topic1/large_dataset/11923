Wonderful doccumentary. It deals with Aurthur 'Killer' Kane who was the bassest of the New York Dolls. It starts off interviewing him in 2004 and keeps going up until the reformation of the Dolls. He talks about some of the problems he had after the Dolls split up and his diffuculty dealing with former bandmates succeeding when he was not getting anywhere with his music carreer. It also shows his life now. He joined the Mormon Church and finally found what he was meant to do with the rest of his life. He works at thier temple in LA helping out where he can. Some of the best interviews are with church members that he works with. You can tell they really care for him and wish him the best. When he finds out about the reunion he is ecstatic but is nervous about the atmosphere conflicting with his moral beliefs and how his former bandmates accept him. They show the performance and alot of the acts that he influenced are interviewed about the importance of the dolls. The only negative thing I can say about this is that alot of the footage is available on the New York Doll reunion dvd. This is a trully special dvd for a very special person.
