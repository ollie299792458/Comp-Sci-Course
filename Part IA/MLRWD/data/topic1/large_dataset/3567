I love this movie.  I remember back when I was 5 when I first watched it.  The title seems to be misleading to some people, but it isn't really what the title seems to persume.  It's not scary; I was afraid of skellitons when I was little, Jack was the only skelliton I wasn't afraid of.  There's no blood or gore AT ALL in the movie.  It's awsome.  All the characters are awsome and friendly (aside from Oggie Boogie, but that's a givin since he is the villan of the movie).  Awsome music.  Danny Elfman really out-did himself when comming up with the movie.  Awsome storyline.  Tim Burton is a genious.  Original storyline and unforgetable creativity.  There's no violents, but there is action of course.  If you're just cerious about the movie itself, here's a lil' summery.
Okay, you got this skelliton in a tux like outfit named Jack.  Now Jack is the Pumpkin King, able to scare anyone out of their wits.  Now being the best and doing the same things over and over again can get boring, so Jack looks for something new.  He ends up finding out about Christmas and loves it to pieces.  He even goes as far as trying to do Christmas himself.  Some things end up getting Santa Claus (funny thing is that Jack always pronouces it 'Sandy Claws') ending up in Oggie Boogies clutches, and Christmas is going all wrong.  I won't revile the end, cuz that always takes the fun out of movies ;) It's a great movie for the whole family.  I suggest you at least renting it and getting a look at one of Tim's greatest creations.
