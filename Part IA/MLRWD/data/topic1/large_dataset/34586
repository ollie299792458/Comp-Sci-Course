Star Trek movie rank 3rd of 10.  Captain, there be whales!
 Coming off a poorly done movie The Search for Spock, Nimoy also directed Voyage Home.  When I first saw it I was disappointed.  I imaged the producers and writers saying: Lets see, Nimoy has a makeup problem.  He has to direct and get those pointed ears put on.  Lets have our heros go through time to present day earth and Spook can wear a stocking cap over his ears avoiding the need to sit through makeup.  Plus we save money on sets!

This movie was also made shortly after the final disasterous episode of Battlestar Galactica.  After two week of hype that the crew of BG was finally coming home to earth, they arrive and the nazi&#65533;s had won WWII.  Not only did they not have expense of of the cool sci fi sets, the script was so stupid that the showed died.  
Well, all this was in play in my initial reaction to STIV the voyage home.  But over the years it had become my second favorite ST movie, dropping to 3rd with the release of First Contact.  This was a movie of action and humor that has become one of my favorite movie period.  This is also a star trek movie that the whole family likes.  So, even though Mr Nimoy gave us a turkey in ST3, they gave him a second chance and he delivered BIG.  Way to go Leonard, may I call you Leonard?
