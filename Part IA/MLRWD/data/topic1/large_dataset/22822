I've seen other Thomas Kincade Christmas movies before and can appreciate the Christian foundation/references in all of his works, whether it be a painting or a story.  Mr Kincade always gives credit for his talents to his maker.

Some of the reviews have picked the supporting cast apart.  Yes, I will agree that the woman who played the Mom was the wrong choice.  She was much too old in her appearance and there was absolutely no chemistry in her dialog with her daughter (Mary) or with anyone else for that fact.  There was a huge disconnect between several of the supporting cast members.  My guess is that is was due to the screen writers, only wanting to focus on Mary and her relationship with her grandfather.

Besides the writing, the movie's theme "Faith & Love" was carried well throughout the entire movie.  This was a good movie based on it's subject matter.  Would I want to watch it again? Probably not.  The plot was pretty predictable, as it wasn't hard to "figure out" how the movie was going to end up. Especially since it was given away within the first few scenes.  I could see how it was boring for some!  But, I had some time on my hands and wanted to watch something that didn't involve blood, guts, gore or sex and violence.  And that was just on today's news channels!

Final thought:  good heart warming movie
