Let's STOP the comparisons between the Superfriends of the 70's and this well written great cartoon, the JLA. The Superfriends was like watching the Smurfs or Sesame Street because it came at a time when violence was being taken off the T.V. So expecting to see Superman or any of the superheroes using their super strenth as we know it, it just wasn't going to happen. Then they threw in those 2 stupid Wonder Twins characters, a dog and 2 other characters, Wendy and Marvin, and made it even worse! Superman was basically feminized in the Superfriends because there were times when the Wonder Twins would even save him. Even their headquaters was called the Hall of Justice and it was on a city street! If anyone can remember the 60's Superman cartoon, it was much, much better and more in line to the Superman TAS or the JLA. However, I still like the new Superman TAS and JLA better because it is better written and more intense stories. I've watched some of the Justice League episodes thought the ending of the first episode was pretty funny. At the end of the first episode, Superman was thinking of working together with the other superheroes, when Flash says "you mean like Superfriends" to which Superman says "No, more like a Justice League". To me, a well written little snipe to a completely terrible cartoon in the Superfriends. I haven't bought the series one yet, The Justice League of course, but I will happily order it asap. Then I can order volume 2 soon after. Do yourselves a favor, buy these cartoons as they are written like NO OTHER CARTOON OUT THERE TODAY!! TRUST ME! These cartoons are like watching mini movies and it's no wonder that the Superman, TSA won an emmy. AN EMMY?!? TO A CARTOON! This is usually given to sitcoms like "Friends" which I was never really to friendly about. Or Everybody Loves Raymond & even Seinfeld. I'd have given this cartoon 10 stars but 5 is the most you can give. And that's saying something about these cartoons!
