First of all I don't know if i am watching the same movie as all these others that gave the movie 1 or 2 stars. I came on to see all the praise for this fantastic movie, and instead i saw critcs without open minds, and the slashing of the only Hamlet worth watching. So, i figured i better write a review of my own.

  I came in on the middle of this movie when i first saw it, and i was so drawn to it, like a magnet to its attractable surface, that I became enamored and had to watch it. I already liked Ethan Hawke, but after this i became his "fan." It amazes me how much his acting career has matured since Dead Poets Society. I saw his potential there, but here it really shines.

  Anyways after that first viewing of the movie it became glued onto my brain and i never forgot it. This movie made me love Shakespeare more than as just the author of Romeo and Juliet. At this point i realized Shakespeare was amazing.

  The way they also use the book of Hamlet in modern day New York is not only creative, but also inspiring, and original. If you're kicking the tires of Shakespeare go and watch this unnoticed classic. Trust me, you'll get in and enjoy the ride.
