This movie was AWFUL. And not in a bad-Jackie-Chan-movie-is-good way. This movie was actually horrible.  See, there are a few things about bad (good) Jackie Chan movies that the producers apparently forgot.

1) Jackie's character must be named "Jackie."
2) Jackie's character (or "Jackie") must start the movie as a cab driver, or butler, or similarly innocuous occupation, and only get roped into crime-fighting ACCIDENTALLY. This way, he can go half the movie with a confused look on his face.
3) If there are artifacts or other elements of Eastern mythology, they are introduced by a sexy female archaeologist.
4) If there is a sidekick, he must actually be FUNNY (i.e. Owen Wilson).
5) Jackie must appear naked at some point in the movie (actually, they remembered this one).
6) The outtakes ought to show Jackie doing things that would get a regular, non-Jackie-Chan person killed.

I am disappointed to say that this is one of the worst bad movies I've seen in a while. However, in watching the deleted scenes on the DVD, I find that the directors spared us from an even WORSE movie. So thank goodness for that.
