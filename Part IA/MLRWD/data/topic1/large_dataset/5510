(4 stars is generous -- consider this a strong 3.5)
David Mamet has proven his writing worth many times over. For quite some time, he has been one of the finest dramatic authors for the stage, and has recently proven his ability to write for the screen with Glengarry Glen Ross, Wag The Dog, and the excellent script that is The Spanish Prisoner. We have here the definition of a "taut thriller."
The acting is quite good. One weak spot can be found in Rebecca Pidgeon, but her flat and lackluster performance is generally made up for by Campbell Scott and Steve Martin. The acting coupled with the script immediately draws you into this intriguing story of The Process and how it affects its creator, Joe Ross (Scott).
As good as Mamet's script may be, however, his heavy-handed directing tips its hand. There are enough small hints in the dialogue, enough subtle clues in the surrounding, that the plot's twists and turns would be believable. Unfortunately, Mamet felt the need to throw a few blatant foreshadowed bits in our face to dumb down the film to be sure everyone would "get" the ending. It wasn't necessary, and it turned a great script into a good movie.
Is it worth seeing? Sure; it's a great example of how a thriller should be written. Is it worth buying to watch again and again? No. Besides, the DVD features are near nil -- it's got a trailer, and 3-channel dolby surround sound. Save your money, and make this a renter.
