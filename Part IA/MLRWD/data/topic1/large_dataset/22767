From the comedy and the laughter, to the seriousness and the teardrops, this movie will leave a trail of sensation laying at our feet for years to come. The "criminal" John Bender (Judd Nelson), "the athlete" Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), "the princess", Claire (Molly Ringwald), "the brain" Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), and  "the basket case" (Ally Sheedy). The 5 students who spent a day in detention, and changed an entire generation. The Principal, John Hughes, had an important role in this movie as the director. While the 5 were in detention, each of their assignments was to write 5,000 word essay about they thought they were. While nobody but Brian wanted to write his essay, he was provoked into writing one, that combined the movie into the serious events of that 80's Saturday and touched the hearts of millions.

  Dear Mr. Vernon,
  We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was that we did wrong, but we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are, you see us as you want to see us, im the simplest terms, or the most conveinient definition, but what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and a athlete, and a basketcase, a princess, and a criminal. Does that answer your question? 
  Sincerely Yours,
  The Breakfast Club
