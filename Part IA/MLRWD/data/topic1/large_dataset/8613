I would give this 5 stars and 4 boxes of hankies. 
In an age of movies with CG characters, special effects, and explosives....Radio is a breath of fresh air. It shows you do not need all of those things if the story teller is good at their job. This is the case here. All involved are excellent story tellers. This is a simple and powerfullly emotional film about a mentaly challenged man and the football coach who reached out and befriended him. It is a true story and Radio is still coaching 30 years later. It is a movie that teaches us the lessons of tolerance and respect. It is one of those very rare movies that you can sit down with the whole family and watch. Cuba turns in an incrediable performance especially considering that he has very few lines in the movie. If you thought his performance in Men of Honor was incrediable, then you will enjoy this. I saw it right after my husband got through watching the super bowl. When I came in I heard the announcer say those football players showed incredible spirit. Radio is the one who shows that, not over paid football players. This movie is so powerfull I went out and brought it so I can watch it again and again. And when my nephew gets old enough, I will sit him down and watch this movie with him and tech him about tolerance. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this 100.
