Quite a few stars in this movie, Sam Shepard, Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts playing the leading roles, with Julia doing an outstanding performance.  Her relationship with her law professor, played by Sam Shepard, ends up turning her live inside out very quickly.  All through this movie from scene to scene, there is plenty of suspense, you're wondering if she'll come out ok - so many forces are at hand, mainly the guilty trying to suppress "The Pelican Brief" theory that Darby Shaw (Julia) developed from gaining publicity and driving investigation towards those who may be responsible for political assassinations.

Another dimension of the movie I found very interesting is how Denzel Washington slowly earns her trust - very difficult for Darby to do considering all that is going on around her and happening so quickly.  I don't like to go into a lot of detail about plot in movie reviews so as not to ruin the storyline unfolding for others, but I will say towards the end a scene with Denzel and Julia made me cry, although I felt very differently at the very end of the movie.

I don't know why I didn't watch this movie years ago when it first came out - I think it is a gem.
