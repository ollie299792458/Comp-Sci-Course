I almost always enjoy a Tyler Perry movie.  However, there are moments in his movies where the goings-ons seem a bit too far-fetched or too sappy/mushy.  When considering the casting, cinematography, and story line, this is easily one of his best films.  He gives Madea a rest and we are enabled to see him play a serious role, and have a leading role.  My favorite entertainer, Janet Jackson, stars in it, so I can write a very accurate synopsis of this film because I've seen it a number of times (smile).

 We are introduced to four married couples, all with problems, some apparent and some harbored.  Sheila and Mike, Diane and Terry, Angela and Marcus, and Patricia and Gavin.  Mike isn't physically attracted to Sheila anymore, so he decides to date her friend, right before her eyes.  Sheila and Mike are supposed to be traveling to meet their friends at a resort, but he tells her she has to drive at the last minute.  As the film progresses, we feel and see Sheila's pain.  Jill Scott did a marvelous job; she had the folks in the theatre cheering for her.  Diane and Terry are at odds about many things; having children and schedule conflicts being chief among their marital issues.  Marcus and Angela are easily the most entertaining couple of the bunch.  Angela cannot seem to stay sober and her husband despises her behavior as a drunk.  Also, he has children by another woman and, of course, that causes strain on their relationship.  Gavin and Patricia have the best relationship of the bunch, or so it seems.  As the film progresses, they endure their share of hardships that were previously unmentioned.  There is a lot of comedy in this movie, but also many serious issues are addressed.

 This movie is a bit lengthy, but you most likely won't have a problem watching it all the way through, especially those seeing it for the first time.  I enjoy it every time I watch it, and you probably know why (Janet!) 4 stars. Great movie!
