i live in an area where I don't have access to a bellydance class (which would be preferable, but it's not an option for me), so I've been using bellydance dvds to learn. From the reviews that I read before buying it, it seemed like a good DVD to buy to reinforce what I already know and also give me extra practice. What I absolutely love about this DVD is Sadie makes you really understand that you can't BS your way into bellydancing. I've been using DVDs to learn bellydance for a while, but after going through HALF of this DVD, my muscles were shaking from the intense workout that I got (and I ride horses - my leg muscles aren't weak!)

She really knows common errors people make with certain movements, either from teaching students herself or mistakes that she made when she was learning. Her analogies that she uses are really helpful. I really like it that not only does she teach the movements, but she also makes you drill the movement afterwards.

Sadie also really helped me with my undulations. I already pretty much understood the movement, but was having a hard time putting it all together and making it look nice. After watching Sadie's section on this DVD on Undulations a couple of times, I pretty much have it down.

This DVD really is the second best thing to actually having a bellydance instructor. If you are like me and don't have any sort of access to a bellydance class, or you are taking a class and just want to practice at home, this DVD is really a must-have. It is so helpful!
