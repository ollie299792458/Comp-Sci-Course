Resident Evil is quailfied for one of the best movies of the Spring\Summer. Definately the best action\gore movies. . .ever.
Even though Resident Evil isn't based on one of the widly popular games, it's still good: Flesh eating zombies, mad dogs that look as if their skin had been turned inside-out, (just like the games) and don't forget the lickers.
We start with a "crazy computer" that kills everyone in a lab testing with the T-virus. So a team of SWAT-like commandos find two people who have been knocked out by nerve gas or something and take them down to the Umbrella falculity and fight the computer.
Sure, listen to the retarted critics and say, "That sounds like it sucks!" Yes, it IS stupid, just like the games but it is, not quite, but ALMOST as gorey, especially the part where the team gets caught in a hallway with a laser that chops them into bits--
my favorite part!
  Well, here's the ratings:
  Setting 10\10: Secret Umbrella lab
  Horror 10,000\10: Mutants, flesh eating zombies, "crazy" computer
  Characters 8\10: None from the game, but Michille Rodriguz is hot
  Ending 9\10: Keeps you wanting for more.
  Well this is a great action\horror flick. Best of the Summer, with hot actresses, it's definately a must-see. Plus, it's coming out a DVD and VHS this month. Double plus, their making another RE movie.
