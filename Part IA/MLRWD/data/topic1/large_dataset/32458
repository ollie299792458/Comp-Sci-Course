This is a movie about an extraordinary individual Jeremy, whose nickname is Powder, due to being an albino. Just before his birth, his mother was hit by lightening, resulting in an incredibly heightened ability to 'play' with and use electrical fields.
As a teenager Powder's grandfather dies of natural causes, leaving him alone with the legal system. Because he's different he automatically attracts attention of the bad kind, which leads to some amazing and spectacular displays of what you can do with electricity, a Jacob's Ladder, and a dancing spoon.
This isn't your normal sort of movie, with "poor child with a problem turns out to be amazing, the bad guys become his friends and he gets the girl". Instead he was always amazing, he doesn't get really get the girl, the bad guys mainly stay trapped by fear, but Powder shows us the potential of the human heart and mind. It focusses on a theory of Einstein, who believed in life after death simply because energy does not disappear, it simply changes form. Powder can 'see inside' people, hear their thoughts, even those in a coma. 
If you're looking for an action flick or a romance, go somewhere else. This is a thinking person's movie, despite several logical errors. It stirs the senses, opens the mind and spirit, and can give you hope for the future.
