This is the only Asylum movie that I think is a true theft of an idea. The notion of Abe fighting monsters was a cool one, one that makes you kind of smile and go "whaaaTTT"? Unfortunately, it is not theirs. The people who read the book know it is cool, but for those who didn't read it, it appears novel. It is kind of like someone finding out that you wanted a cordless drill for a very long time, but had no idea they might get one. The drill you are getting is a top of the line, very expensive, drill. The person who found out about it goes to e-bay and buys a very cheap Chinese knock off drill and gives it to you first. You take out the drill, surprised and happy, having thought you would never get one. This drill, however, only holds a charge for 5 minutes. It doesn't have enough power to even drill a screw a 1/32 inch screw into a soft piece of wood, and the grip breaks in your hand. Then, a few days later you get your expensive drill. The surprise is ruined by your prior experience. Even though you like the new drill, the memories of the old one sour your enjoyment of the new one. It was a ruined surprise.
That is what Asylum did, they ruined the surprise and experience. They tainted your enjoyment of the real thing.
Bill did a good job of acting, even with his horrible fake beard, but the movie is the worst kind of rip off.
