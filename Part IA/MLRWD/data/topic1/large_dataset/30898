I really enjoyed Razor. It was spectacular in terms of visual and special effects, gives us a lot of fill-in-the-blank details about different characters, but it makes a philosophical and political point as well - faced with survival, the only thing that influences and distinguishes our decisions is our connection to and compassion for others.

As far as the storyline goes, there were two surprises I had not anticipated. I don't watch TV. I knew little of the 'hype' several people have mentioned, and had only the webisodes (or 'minisodes' as they are called on the DVD) to suggest anything of what was to come. So the info we get about Cain and her hatred for Gina, as well as what developed around young rookie Bill Adama's discovery on an icy planet, were tasty treats. I really enjoyed the moments of homage to the original BSG, which were very well done.

Thus far I can only speak to the extended version on the DVD, though I'll get around to the television version just for comparison. The inclusion of the 'minisodes' on the DVD seems pointless when 90% of their content is part of the extended version. I can't quite put my finger on why, but Razor also seemed gratuitously graphic at several points. I know the point was to show us the inhumanity of life on Pegasus, but it felt a bit overdone. Beyond these criticisms, I also felt the constant cutting back and forth across timelines served to confuse more than inform. I'm not sure this story could have been told in a more linear fashion, so take that for what it's worth.

Razor is well worth your money and time, but as others have noted, it's mainly an oasis in the desert for the thirsty faithful who know and revere what BSG has become. It cannot stand alone in the same sense as the 2003 miniseries that launched the modern BSG.
