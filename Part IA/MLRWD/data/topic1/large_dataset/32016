Ok ok ok I know what ur thinkin , Freddy Vs. Jason cool idea and all but it will suck! You are so poorly mistaken my friends I just saw it today first day it came out. Literally one of the best movies EVER it had comedy, horror, and a lil bit of styles from both horror franchises. Now I must addmitt that none of their movies really are SCARY but this one was pretty freakin creepy , and for once I jumped a few times. I do not want to give the plot away like some of those who review do. But let me just say , the movie was basically funny, not funny as in so bad it was funny, funny as in Joke funny. Freddy is just as cocky and histarical as usual. Now, there was nudity that I think we have seen enough of in both series and could have done with out but other wise, this was on of the best movies I have ever seen ( and I have more than likely seen more than most of you ). If the critics have trashed then **** them, because this was great, and I highly recomend seeing it to anyone, even if you didn't like the past movies, or did, either way you are sure to love it.
