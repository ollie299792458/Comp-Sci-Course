friday the 13th part 6 jason lives was one of the better movies in the friday the 13th series along with parts 1,2,4,7,8. they brought back tommy jarvis AGAIN. i mean,come on now, dont you think this is startin to get a little old. you can look at this two ways.1) tommy is the ultimate horror movie hero in defeating jason voorhees twice in parts 4 and 6 and roy in part 5. 2) or you can say now there is NO way he is goin to beat the killer THREE TIMES. give ol' jason  a little more respect then THAT. this movie was fun,funny, and an awesome horror movie till the very end and had an awesome sound track but i think jason should have killed tommy at the end. perfect movie though, and i liked the fact that this was the ONLY one in the whole series that actually has CAMPERS. i mean the others all  have councelsors but no campers. great film. and i love the attitude of the cops in this movie. and i think there would be less crime in the usa if there were more cops like that. anyway in this movie jason refuses to harm any campers. maybe its cuz he knows how it is to have your life taken so young. this is the film that got me thinkin.maybe jason isnt such a bad guy after all. maybe hes only killin off the people so they cant reopen the camp so no other camper would ever suffer the same fate that HE did. think about it. kinda makes sense to me...how bout you?
