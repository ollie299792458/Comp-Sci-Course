I just bought the movie from a former rental for $4.99. What a loving movie! Adrien Brody make a loving act as Steven, a shy wimp with a heart of gold. He lives with his crazed parents and his sour hearted sister Heidi (Ileana Douglas). Steven (Brody) hates his job and his boss reminds me of Meryl Streep in The Devils Wears Prada. So in a impulse, he bought a wooden dummy that becomes his alter ego and his concience. While he learns to talk without moving his lips, Steven is talking to the dummy and the dummy answers him back in a psycologic point of view. It seams that the dummy wants to help Steven using foul language and harsh love. Or is Steven talking to himself? And then the dummy began to talk the words that Steven doesn't dare to say to anybody!! That moves his job couselor, Lorena (Vera Farmiga) that seams to have issues by her own. Milla Jojovich is Steven best friend, did a great job as a real nut case, hard punk rocker who sings lovely in yiddish at the end of the movie. While this is low budget movie, it has a touching but deep simplicity that lacks multi-million motion pictures. Just follow your bliss and buy this movie. I'm glad I did!
