This is one of my favourite sci-fi films of all time. Allison Hayes was a beauty in the 50's-60's on the big screen and TV as well. Too bad she died penniless and quite ill in a nursing home in the 80's. This film is so poorly made and cheap that you get to feel sorry for the producers -- it wasn't released, it ESCAPED! The special effects are hokey -- you can see through the monster and the 50ft woman, plaster of paris created Nancy Archer's enormous hands, and the UFO was a balloon on strings. How did a 50ft alien fit through that standard sized 7ft door? Anyway, this is a cult classic, great to watch to see the styles and the cars of the late 50's, (remember those huge tailfins?) and to see how black and white was the main medium for films like this. It also is one of the numerous films to exploit the UFO sighting phenomena that prevailed at that time. The DVD is fantastically brilliant and digitally remastered for clarity and has an enhanced soundtrack. It features a commentary by none other than Yvette Vickers who played the "other woman" in the film. She stated they filmed this in 8 days on a very limited budget and never dreamed of the success it has amassed as a cult classic. The best scene is when Nancy Archer, aka the 50ft woman, is tearing up the town yelling HARRY! HARRY! who happens to be her husband. Once he is found, she picks him up and squeezes him like a bug to death as she gets tangled in high voltage wires and plummets them both to death. THE END! I have this on VHS as well, but the DVD is enhanced and has a better picture quality. This is a must for any collector of 1950's sci-fi. It ranks up there with  "The Brain That Wouldn't Die" and "Plan 9 From Outer Space."
