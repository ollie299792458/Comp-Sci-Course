Since I first saw the last ten minutes of this movie on AMC, I've always wanted to own it. Now that I have it and have seen the entire thing, I can write a review about Swingtime, the pinnacle of the Astaire/Rogers movies.
 What I absolutely loved about this film is, of course, the dancing and the singing. Ginger's witty remarks and Fred's good-natured boyish charm stands out in this wonderful film.
 Fred Astaire is John 'Lucky' Garnett, a performer about to be married. Through a dilemma with his trousers and a rousing game of dice, he shows up late for his marriage. His future father-in-law cuts him a deal: he will let Lucky marry his daughter for $25,000. Lucky sets off for New York with his pal Pop, a lucky quarter, a toothbrush, and the clothes on his back. On the street he meets Penny (Rogers), who ends up getting in trouble with a policeman and almost fired from her boss at the dancing academy because of Lucky. Lucky comes to the rescue however, and soon they are paired together as a dancing couple. They end up falling in love, but before they can waltz their way up to the altar, a few loose ends need to be taken care of, mainly Lucky's fiance and Penny's fiance. It ends superbly. This movie includes one of my favorite songs, 'Never Gonna Dance', sung by a yearning Lucky to a troubled Penny.
 The dancing is to die for, the singing to be heard over and over again. Fred and Ginger were one of the few magnificent couples to spring out of the Hollywood scene and rarely is that seen now. I guarantee, this movie won't disappoint. Your daily musical intake will be remedied by Swingtime.
