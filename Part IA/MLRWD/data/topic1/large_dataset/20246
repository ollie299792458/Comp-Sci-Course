I got a BD player a year after they came out while the format war was still going on and I read reviews of the discs.  They always said that this one was not too great but acceptable.  Some how, some people rate The Terminator (first 2) discs as poor when they are not.  Total Recall is by far THE worst BD disc ever!

This one gets the same type of review as Robocop from the reviewers.  It is no wonder why these discs are $10 or less!  This is a very poor representation of Blu-Ray or even HD.  I am good at spotting resolutions with my eye and I can tell that this is not an HD master.  It has to be a 480I give or take a few lines!

This is nothing more than an upconverted picture, but upconverted DVD's look much better in most cases.  From the moment the credits roll, there is severe crushing, noise and low resolution.  The picture quality is so bad that it looks like analog cable with a damaged cord - THAT bad!  The noise (it can't be mere film grain alone) is so horrible that the film grain has noise that moves and changes colors!

The colors were bland and there was NOTHING HD about the picture in any way.  There was no 3D effect when looking at the picture.  No facial details.  No stitching in the clothing - nothing.  The sound was weak as well since it was in DTS-HD, not Master Audio.  Hey, it was one of the early BD titles.

Instead of steady re-releasing Terminators, they need to remaster this!  I avoided it out of fear of the reviews, but the reviewers were too soft on this one.  Do not get it if you are looking for HD picture.

On another note, it was weird (I know) to see so many tube TV's 100 years into the future.  Even 2001: A Space Odessy predicted flat screens.
