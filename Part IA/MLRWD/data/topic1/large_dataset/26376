Speaking as a moderately geeky person married to an exceedingly geeky person, this movie both amused and perplexed.

As a thriller it was fun: I liked the insight into a geeky person's life, the everything-online, the fascination with computers that might be allowed to threaten a person's first vacation for years. And I really like Sandra Bullock. It was interesting and moderately refreshing to see someone attractive cast as a die-hard computer programmer.

But I know just enough to be annoyed by the computer special effects: the dumbing-down of shells and email and the silly little graphics. Those were the details which really did bring the movie down to a three star for me: I guess I'm just used to programming using Linux, and without the bells and whistles. It just clashed with the character to the extent where it jolted me out of the story.

Beyond that, it's a fast-paced thriller with fewer groans of derision than usual, a story that might be plausible, and a lovely dramatic denouement which, of course, I will not reveal here.

So, go for it. It's light entertainment, and as such, worth a look.
