This film has got to be the most original, thoughtful, touching and most well acted film I have seen in a long time. Jim Carrey gives a career best performance as Joel Barrish, a man who decided to erase his memory of Clementine, played with amazing energy and life by Kate Winslet, his ex-girlfriend who we find out erased him first. The movie is about relationships, and why they work or don't work, and what they mean to us, even if it is painful. The film, despite its somewhat depressing subject matter, still manages to be quite funny and romantic, which many so-called romantic comedies can not claim to be. Carrey and Winslet should both receive nominations for their brilliant work here, and the upporting cast does well to, especially Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson. Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood both do well too. Michael Gondry does a great job with the directing, and the editing and cinematography are great. Charlie Kaufman delivers another original story with feeling. Thsi movie is one of the better films I can remember seeing in a very long time and  will be remembered for a long time.
