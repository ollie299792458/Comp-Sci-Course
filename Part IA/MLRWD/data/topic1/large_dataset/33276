Dweezil Zappa had each and every core member of the Zappa Plays Zappa ensemble study the actual arrangements that have been chosen for these performances. Sometimes it's a well documented Frank Zappa studio version, sometimes a well documented FZ tour version taken from 30 years of touring and sometimes it's an obscure version few have heard but exists in FZs massive vault that is managed by his family.

Dweezil Zappa, his Zappa Plays Zappa Core Band and Special Guests(Steve Vai, Terry Bozzio & Napoleon Murphy Brock) get the tone colors of each particular composition giving as much respect to the composers intent as possible. In preparation for performance the Zappa Plays Zappa band have isolated specific tracks of multi-track studio master recordings to get the necessary tone colors down in the specific arrangement of a given composition. This approach to rehearsal and performance is the same way a modern conductor such as Pierre Boulez would work with an Orchestra. This represents Frank Zappa the American Composer more so than some cover band charade that is often associated with representing many artists whose work primarily had or continues to get marketed in the rock and roll medium.

Be it if you are a long time listener of Frank Zappa or new to his multifarious body of work it is fair to say that this Zappa Plays Zappa DVD Project is as close as any group of musicians,including any given Frank Zappa touring band have ever achieved with regards to the A) The Composers Intent and B)The wide diversity represented here in the composers canon of works.
