Once again Hollywood thinks it can remake a movie so that the today crowd will enjoy it. Anyone who has seen the original cannot watch this without laying it along side the other and this one comes up short.

I can see the bigs sitting around their table "we have to have a woman, no one wants an all male cast, so what if she does not fit in it for the story, we have to be modern"..."and we need some terrible rock music that does nothing for the story but the people are too stupid to enjoy it without such"..."the original had some bad people living in the sand land so let us just pitch a few more in but meaning nothing"...."oh, and we need to bash big business" (why not just have GWB cause the crash)"......"and make sure we bash a Christian or two (maybe Jerry Fallwell can ride in on a camel)"

Do yourself a favor, if this is a movie you think you might desire to watch but have not seen the original, get the original and watch some real acting.

Quaid is an actual licensed pilot so for that I will give it one star over the one it deserves.

Jimmy Stewart and gang, we miss you!
