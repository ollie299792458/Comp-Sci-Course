The verdict: Christmas is early this year.

Among other cool Nightmare stuff (including a $24K reproduction of Halloween Town that's just a leeetle out of my reach), they had the prototype of this Collector's set on display in a glass case, along with the DVD and Blu-ray (the packaging for both of these was pretty cool.  The DVD had a 3-D relief portrait of Jack).  The pics of this collector's set posted here don't really convey that this is a pretty big Jack!  Maybe 14" high or so and seems pretty well-made (although again, it was labeled as a prototype).  The people at the booth couldn't or wouldn't say much else that isn't already described here, but it does seem as though this thing also has a sound chip and "says" lines from the film.  I'd probably like it just as much without it being noisy..but hey, why not?  Oh, and one other cool thing not shown here:  It comes in a very big coffin with a "window" to Jack's face--how apropos!

Anyway, I fell in love with this movie when it first came out and I caught it at the El Capitan.  There was nothing like it before and nothing since.  It's nice that there is finally a DVD release and gift set that feels worthy of this classic.  I'm particularly excited about some of the new bonus--especially the Haunted Mansion tour.  Since I live in LA, I've been able to experience the Jack-ified Haunted Mansion at Disneyland in person.  It should be interesting to see how it all comes together each year and it'll be fun to see some of the details that you probably miss when you're on the ride.
