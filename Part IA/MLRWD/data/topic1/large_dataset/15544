Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson give superlative performances as the head butler and housekeeper at Darlington Hall in pre-WWII England, where personal and international dramas are enacted.  Set in the present, the film uses flashbacks to tell the stories of servants and Lord Darlington, a misguided gentleman who believed appeasement with Germany was the solution in the years leading to the Second World War.  Hopkins is his very officious butler, a man who places duty and propriety above all things, even his true feelings for housekeeper Thompson.  She is more forthcoming with her emotions, but she cannot bring him to open himself up, including a painfully well-acted scene where Thompson tries to get Hopkins to reveal to her the book he is reading.
If you are looking for loads of action and music-video style editing, this film will not be for you.  It is a character and class study, and it succeeds admirably well on both levels.  Hopkins and Thompson are both able to communicate subtle emotions with a simple pause or a look.  The supporting cast is also fine.  The screenplay allows the characters and drama to unfold slowly, establishing a feeling for the time and for the differences in class that existed in the era.  
Remains of the Day is directed with understated style, allowing the setting and characters to dominate. Although it may be more literary than most films, don't mistake it for something stuffy or inaccessible.  It's great drama about all too real characters that reminds us of the impact of the unspoken word.
