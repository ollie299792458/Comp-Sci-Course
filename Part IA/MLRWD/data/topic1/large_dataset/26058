When Blake Edwards'"The Great Race" was first released, it took its share of critical abuse for being a pale imitation of classic slapstick comedy, but since then, the state of comedy has devolved to such a state that the film looks better than ever.  It's an epic (obviously, with a two-hour, forty-minute running time) comic adventure in the "Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" mode, but it actually holds up better, thanks to a sterling cast, including Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk, Keenan Wynn, Ross Martin, George Macready, and a host of comedy pros, and gorgeous, sweeping photography.  Throughout the course of the film classic movie conventions are parodied--horror films (Professor Fate's domicile), Westerns (including a great barroom brawl), "Orphans of the Storm" melodramas, and finally, "Prizoner of Zenda" adventures.  It's the last that really resonates, with one of the cinema's best swordfights between Ross Martin and Tony Curtis.  The rest of the film, though, belongs to Jack Lemmon, who channels Vincent Price as Professor Fate and then Jerry Lewis as the imbecile prince in the Graustark sequence.  Curtis is good, but he plays it essentially straight, which means he gets a bit swamped by the comic avalance of Lemmon, Falk and Wynn.  The heroine is Natalie Wood, a really terrible actress who somehow developed a cult following.  That said, this is probably her best film.  This DVD contains no new documentaries, but the original "Behind the scenes" featurette is fun, and the widescreen presentation is terrific.  And at $5.49, it's the bargain of the year!
