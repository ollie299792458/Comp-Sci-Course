Definitly, this movie is one of the most original and surprising horror films I've ever seen in my whole life.  Ju On, is a beige, bizarre and  original film, one of a kind. Definiltly, is the most smart and pure terror film from Japan. No other japanese terror movie can even touch it.

Looks like a modern 70ies film, due to the color of the fotage (almost everything is grey).  Takashi took great care on some scenes, making them look like pieces of art. Small histories will make your flesh crawl.  There's no gore in this movie.  Fear, is pure psychological.
 The filmscoring, made with synthesizers, is simple perfect, and the silences from the music, and the sound effects come at the right time.
Some scenes are really creepy and well done, actor performances are superb. They really transmit that horror feeling that makes you identify with their fear. A
The chapters are atemporal, the movie goes forward and backwards,  seems that there's no cronological sequence on the movie, it goes telling the history of the different characters that visited the haunted house.
When you visit this house, you're doomed and your soul get lost in time.  For example, there are two characters, a father and her daugther, that both die, on different years, when they entered the house. But when they go into the house, they met inside, and the father looks at his grown up daugther in the future, when she also visited the house.  Also, when she visited the house, she met her father inside when he died several years ago.  You understand this, only when you watch both chapters.
There are things hidden in this movie, that you must watch very carefully to notice.  This is one of those films that you have to watch several times to fully understand, but leaving a lot of questions in your mind.
