would I have the courage to stand up for my principles if it meant that my career would likely be permanently damaged - if not destroyed?

could I truly risk my personal & professional comfort in order to help another - without having 100% certainity that I was doing the right thing?

these are the personal questions Rendition left me asking?

it's easy to get into the abstract Sunday morning talk show debate about US definition & policy on torture or to revisit the freshman-year philosophy class regarding whether the "means justifies the ends".

but how about you? me? what are we willing to stand up for?  how much risk are we willing to take?  are we willing to help someone... but only as long as its not too uncomfortable?

use Rendition to take a ride to the Washington DC cocktail party circuit and a Morrocan prison to see what answers and questions you find in your gut.

great performances by Jake Gyllenhaal (newly promoted CIA station chief in Morocco), Omar Metwally (the Egyptian-born, American-living, young father & husband who has been "renditioned" to Morocco), Reese Witherspoon (the distraught & confused but determined spouse) and Meryl Streep (the wiley, self-righteous, overly-confident Washington beauracrat).
