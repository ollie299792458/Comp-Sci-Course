I agree with the five-star review written by "Jem". My wife and I rarely agree completely on movies, but we were both captivated by this movie. The acting was excellent, especially by Portman. The sets, costumes, and cinematography were lush. No shortcuts were taken, and the production quality of this movie is superb. If there was a weak link in the acting, it was Bana. On the other hand, he was playing a banal and shallow person, so perhaps that is why he seemed to fade into the background when paired against the strong personalities of the female characters. This is one of the few movies that my wife and I wanted to see over again immediately after finishing our first viewing. Please read the excellent review by "Jem" to get a better understanding of the entertainment value this movie has in store for you. If you haven't rented it yet, you really should. By the way, I read the book several years before I saw the movie, and I thought the book was boring. The movie is so much more fun than the book, which is one reason I appreciate the movie so much.
