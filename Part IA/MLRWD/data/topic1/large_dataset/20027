First, this is a very EASY TO NAVIGATE DVD that lets you CHOOSE which 10 minute Yoga exercise you want. Each mini session is just 10 minutes, a plus when you are short on time! This Yoga is just right, not too hard and not at all boring. In fact, after I did each session, I felt like I really got a good workout and yet I was so relaxed! This has 5 sessions, each at just 10 minutes:
1) Yoga Basics - This is JUST RIGHT for stretching, postures and breathing, a great way to start the day is just 10 minutes!
2) Buns & Thighs - Just the right level for a good leg and buns session. I could feel the difference after just a couple of sessions! Loved this one.
3) ABS - Not a boring ABS like some I have tried. Great that is is Yoga and not the regular ABS exercise. This kept me going and still felt great after the session ended. Just after a few sessions, I can SEE and FEEL a big difference in my ABS.
4) Yoga Burn - This is FASTER and more intense all over session for the total body. I do this every other day.
5) Flexibility & Relaxation - Great STRESS BUSTER after a long day at work. Sometimes I use this for a tonic to refresh and go out for the evening, other times, I save it for right before bed. Either way, it gets my muscles to relax and knock out any kinks in them from the day! *This is my favorite session on this DVD!
***Just so you will know*** This is a SUPERB BEGINNER DVD, and you can choose one of the five to do for just 10 minutes or as many as you want, the menu lets you customize the Yoga session. If I could give this one 10 stars, I would! *And all of the 10 minute line are wonderful!
