I've enjoyed Luke Wilson in other movies and this one looked funny so I gave it a try. And I'm glad I did. It's a real hoot. It gives an interesting perspective on how inconvenient a superhero's life can be; I can't blame Uma for being annoyed that her dinner has to be interrupted so much of the time. Luke brings that pragmatic, likable persona to this role. His real love interest does a good job, as does Uma's nemesis, who turns out to be surprisingly likable. The movie has a great ending that will leave you with a laugh and feeling good. Nice use of music to underscore the various moods.

I took one star off because Uma's anger at Luke was understandable, but some of the things she did for revenge were over the top. I agree with another reviewer that the shark stunt was potentially deadly and wasn't in keeping with her superhero character. The car in orbit was hilarious. I would have liked to see her use her super strength and flight to other imaginative non-deadly forms of revenge.

This romantic comedy is an enjoyable piece of fluff that isn't for kids but will make you laugh out loud.
