It's been cited by various people that this among this movie's weaknesses is the fact that it falls in between a drama, a comedy, a satire, and who knows what else. I agree with those people, this movie has aspects of all those things. I, unlike many others, do not believe this to be a weakness at all. The strange fusion of all the different genres combined in this movies creates a brand of humor and storytelling akin to a that of Terry Pratchet. Unlike many comedies, which recycle the same gag and situational comedy over and over, this movie has fresh plot driven versatile humor, which continues to entertain, rather than getting old once you realize that you are seeing the same joke over and over again in different contexts, as happens with many comedies. The satire is not particularly biting, but it's not mean spirited as much military satire is, so again, I for one, approve of the decisions they made in that area. If this film has a weakness, it is character development, which relies a great deal on the narrator to progress. This movie is entertaining, I came away from the experience feeling I was glad I'd seen it, rather that wishing I could get two hours of my life back. I certainly recommend this movie.
