I began watching this movie with the clear understanding that it was going to be a different take on human circumstances, interactions and responses.  I also know that indie films tend to take quirky to a different level.  I found the actors in each vignette to be fluid in their interpretation of their characters; no one seemed jarring.  The subject matter itself was where the jolt came from.  The situations were thought-provoking, much of the dialogue and situations were patently used to evoke a negative response from the viewer.  The extremes in much of the movie could be used for comedic purposes or tragedy unfortunately some of the devices used when the ultimate goal was laughter left me feeling that the line-crossed was simply too far for me to find any humor.  I am still not clear what I am supposed to take away from the film other than the ability to recognize that some situations made me uncomfortable and to recognize that feeling?  The flow of the movie was also a bit uneven so I left the film on several occasions and came back to complete it several times.
