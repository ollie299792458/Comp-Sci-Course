With this cast - how could it be bad? Oh, what a disappointment. This film could've used a large dose of subtlety in many ways while taking the large effort it spent on unimportant BS and using it to drive home more meaningful points.

This was a wasted opportunity to tell an important story of our time no matter on which side of the aisle your politics reside.

I don't know exactly where to place the blame for this collosal load of crap, but here are a few brief observations:

- As for the characters, Hoffman's was very believable while Hanks and Roberts came across like caricatures - annoying and fake.

- Superfluous innuendo. Public butt-grabbing, nude hot tub parties,  Congressman Wilson staffing his office with a brood of 25 year old hotties in tight skirts and sweaters, a constituent's daughter who can't keep her clothes on around him.... o-v-e-r-k-i-l-l. Distracting and unnecessary.

- The characters are quickly thrown together without enough background as to how and why. It's never clear, for instance, why Robert's excruciatingly wealthy Houston-based philathropist/glamorous b*tch character was so motivated to get deeply involved in equipping the Afghan people w/arms to fight the Soviets.

- Totally irrelevant side-scenes are thrown in, adding nothing at all - some random constituent visits his office to complain about being sued for displaying a nativity scene in front of a firehouse. Whatever - we get that Wilson is an elected representative. Why waste that time on some meaningless, trivial thing when much more important scenes could've been created that added depth and meaning to this film?

- Not nearly enough about the real politics and struggles surrounding this story. Big, gaping holes are left wide open while the viewer is distracted by the ridiculous triviality of Wilson's libido and drinking habits.

I gave 2 stars because Hoffman is really good and Hanks and Roberts do try - not sure how the dynamics got all screwed up but it can't be blamed wholly on their performances. It baffles me that movies like this get so much hype, and so undeservingly.
