This is DVD contains no special features, merely a trailer for the film. This makes buying the video as good an idea as buying the DVD.
The movie isn't bad. A new masked figure, looking somewhat like the reaper in Batman:  Year One, is killing of gangsters in Gotham. At the same time Bruce Waynes  old girlfriend arrives. When the gangsters asks help from the Joker,  everything starts to happen at once. Interesting thing is that the Jokers  origin story seems more based on the Nack Nicholson Batman-story (with  Joker as a gangster before, well, himself) rather than the one in the comic  books, as best told in The Killing Joke.
This film is quite brutal with  some very scary scenes. The Joker is at his worst, like a madly laughing  clown from hell. This is why I wouldn't recommend this movie for small  children, at least not without their parents. People that say Comics are  for children don't know the half of it.
I recommend this movie for every  Batman fan. See it as a way to get deeper into his character than the  ordinary animated series has time for.
