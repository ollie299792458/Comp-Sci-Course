I've seen this film 8 times. The first time I saw it, the movie ended, and I sat there with my eyes wide open and said "...Woah." I then bought this special edition and watched it 7 more times, including the time I watched it in chronological order. Unfortunately, I had my theory about the movie DOWN after 7 viewings, but then the 8th viewing left me thinking too hard, and I lost my theory. I'm so confused. And that's because it's an intricate, complex, mind-numbing film. This movie is utterly amazing. Just AMAZING. We have a guy named Leonard who wants to avenge his wife's rape and death. Sure, that's pretty good, basic but good. But now we throw in something else. Leonard has "short term memory loss" because of a head injury he received during his wife's assault. This causes our man Leonard to forget everything that happened after the injury after about 15 minutes. If he meets a person and has an hour long conversation with them, the next day he will have completely forgotten that person. Genius. Now, add this final twist: make the film backwards. So, the scene you're watching came after the scene that you're watching next, etc. Masterpiece. This is my favorite movie, and it takes multiple viewings and maybe some cheating (watching it in chronolgical order) to straighten it all up in your mind. The features on the DVD are wonderful. It has the short story which the movie was based on, the movie in chronological order, photographs of props used, film posters, documentaries. The single problem is that the special edition DVD itself is insane. The first disc which contains the movie lists a bunch of words and you have to choose through each one to find the single word that starts the movie. The second disc has you searching through loads of images and questions that would belong in a psychological exam to find the special features. If it weren't for this masterpiece movie, the DVD would have dragged it down to 4 stars. But what can I say? It's just way too good.
