The previews for this movie sold it VERY well, but it turned out to be a colossal disappointment because NO ONE could make up their minds in the production. This movie is a mish-mash of themes: horror, suspense, and disaster; NONE of which are properly or successfully vindicated through its execution. Nicholas Cage gets the one star on this review for singularly carrying a mediocre script, while the rest of the cast flounders along behind him. The special effects were impressive, but even good special effects weren't enough to save this horrendous movie OR add another star to this review. The brief touches on theology are ill-formed, poorly executed, and inconsistent; it's like the script writers were having a theology war and nobody won so they just threw it all in the movie. The story progression, while well written at times, was mostly too sporadic and fragmented to follow without intense effort. And the story itself just continues down a path towards absurdity until it becomes completely unbelievable..... until in continues further to the point that will have you yelling things like "You have GOT to be KIDDING ME!" and "Oh, COME ON!" at the screen by the time the movie concludes. And the ending.... well, the ending was the final, grievous insult after sitting through a two hour disappointment. Two words Summit: TRY HARDER.
