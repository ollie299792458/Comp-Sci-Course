First off, my quick review:
If you like non-pc humor, this movie will entertain you immensly; if not, or if you liked previous Kevin Smith movies for their good writing and thoughtful points about life, you will probably hate this flick to no end.

I agree heartily that this was a self-indulgent, stupid romp of a movie (that I happened to love). I am part of the afformentioned "Kevin Smith Fan Base" that has been mentioned in previous reviews of this flick, so it doesn't really come as a surprise that I would love this film and despise anyone who said otherwise, but I have a point to make. The character "Holden" makes probably the only thoughtful line in the entire run of the movie when he makes a reference to "moving on with his work". I think that sums up this movie pretty well. This is the end (or at least near the end, as I've heard rumors of comics and cartoons based on these movies being in the works) of the "Jay and Silent Bob" series of Kevin Smith movies. As such, it's like he took the things people tended to like about those characters, and just went off. Nonstop crude humor. I do love this film and will miss Jay and Bob, but I really do think that Kevin Smith was channeling himself through Holden when he mentioned not wanting to write anymore about charcters who only dealt in "smoking weed and dick and fart jokes".
