I saw "The Shoes of the Fisherman when it first came out in 1968 / 69.  It didn't receive that much acclaim at the time, and there are places in the film where the storyline stalls a little.  What has renewed interest in this movie about the election of a Russian Pope is the fact that it came out just ten years before the election of Pope John-Paul II.  Who could have guessed in 1968 that a bishop from a communist country would be elected the supreme pontiff of the Universal Church?
The cast reads like a who's who of the acting world:  Olivier, Quinn, Werner, McKern.  All gave fine perfomances.  Leo McKern and Vittorio DeSica were especially effective as Cardinals of the Church.  And Oscar Werner's performance as the silenced priest was outstanding.
The set designs were wonderful, and the scenes inside the Sistine Chapel were especially effective.  Although the conclave is done behind locked doors, the process of the papal election in this film is said to be very accurate.  The drama focuses on how Kiril Lakota, a Russian bishop who has been imprisoned in a labor camp for tweny years, reacts to his freedom and the shock of being selected as the successor of St. Peter.  Anthony Quinn carries off this difficult role very well.  You can see the anguish in his face as he tries to cope with everything that is happening to him in such a short time.  This is one of the better movies from that era, and you are a fan of any of these actors, or have an interest in things Catholic, this is a film to have in your collection
