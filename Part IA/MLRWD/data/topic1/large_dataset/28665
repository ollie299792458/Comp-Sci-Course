Remembrance of things past is an important part of history and surely silent movies are among our glorious past. The famed onstage and offstage romance between two colossal characters - Greta Garbo and John Gilbert - is electrifying, all the moreso because the lack of dialogue illuminates their breathtakingly dramatic body language.

Each artistically framed B&W shot illuminates the unquenchable and deadly passion between the duo, who, in real life, are from Stockholm and Utah. While the viewer may be rooting for Virtue to win - or even make a token appearance - the Devil is firmly in charge, in this always suspenseful, unpredictable flick made in 1927 when Garbo was all of 22 and her co-star 27.

The final scenes of icy grandeur are haunting. No wonder Garbo (1905-90) insisted that this same cinematographer film her during much of her career. She was a woman who, during the studio system, controlled much of her own destiny. You'll see why when you see her, even in silence, a woman described by many, including famed poet Wallace Stevens, as the most striking woman to light up a screen.
