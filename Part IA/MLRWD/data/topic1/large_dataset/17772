This is a film for everyone, but especially for the Baby Boomers.  Baby Boomers lived through the career of Johnny Cash and will experience the feeling that they are seeing history in the making.  I know you should be quiet in the theatre, but I kept leaning over to my college-aged son and saying, "I remember this." and "Do you know who THAT person is?" etc.  Part way through the film, I stopped leaning over, because I was secretly wiping tears from my eyes.  This film is extremely powerful.  There are films you rent, and films you watch in the theatre, and films you plop down hard earned money for the privilege of owning.  This film is worth owning.

Now realize, these are the words of a Baby Boomer here.  My son is of a different generation.  As we left the theatre I asked him, "Well, what did you think?"  His response, "It's probably as good as Harry Potter."  Wow!  I guess this may be a film for all ages.

ONE REQUEST . . . To Whom it May Concern:  Johnny Cash had a LOT of life (perhaps the best part) AFTER his marriage to June Carter.  If anyone chooses to make a sequel to this film, I'll be there.  This film is good, but it is only part A of what should be a two-parter.
