A part of our History that should be, needs to be shared.
Graphic, yes, real, yes! IT WAS WAR!
Given the broad war that was waged against both of the enemies, Japan and Germany, we really were guided by the hand of God and some pretty great leaders.
Amazing process of telling the entire war story, but it gets a little difficult to keep up with the story of individuals by jumping back and forth.  But once you get used to it, its not bad.  My wife and I grew up hearing about WWII (we were born in 1944), our parents were involved in various parts and then it was Korea.
All of the color footage was amazing.  We both were ready for the next part as soon as possible.  Took us 5 days to watch the whole thing.
When you serve as a Marine, you learn a lot of Military History of when and where the Marines served...this really was a review of all I learned.
This has been put together as an Historic Document that tells everything that happened forever!
The only thing that would have made it better would have been more survivors stories.
Fantastic!  Very well done!  Well worth the time to watch it.
