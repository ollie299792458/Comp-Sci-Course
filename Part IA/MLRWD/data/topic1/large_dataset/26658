I watched this on a whim, only knowing that Buster Keaton is in it, and I enjoy watching him.  Well what a surprise!  I'm a train fan as well as  Keaton fan and was riveted for the whole movie.

The fact that it's a train movie is shown immediately.  The main interpersonal conflict is set up quickly afterwards...a misunderstanding between Keaton's character and his fiance.  Fiance dumps him and he is shunned by the now ex-fiance, her dad, and her brother.  The action to resolve that conflict then starts and continues practically non-stop 'til the climatic end. The ending is stereotypical but oh well...I liked it.

The train scenes were well done and fun to watch.  The romance was fun to watch and not overly done.  Great cavalry action also towards the end of the movie...horses are also on my list of favorite things.

I don't want to give away much else about the movie...although I guess many reviewers already have...but I don't think any silent movie fans will be disappointed watching "The General" unless they are strict about watching a movie that is as close to the original as possible.  The version I watched had a sound track that was added in 2003.
