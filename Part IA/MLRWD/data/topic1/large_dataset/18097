At first I was amazed at all of the bad reviews for BSG but then I realized there has to be a fan base for Stargate type SciFi and therefore bad taste is rampant. Then after reading I became surprised at the overwhelming amount of good reviews. It's good to see this series getting the recognition it deserves. BSG is one of the smartest, grittiest and engrossing series on TV these days.

I was a fan of the original series when I was a kid too but when I watch it today I can tell it was written for kids. As I remember there were 2 incarnations of the original series; the 1st being pretty good and the 2nd being space disco.

If you go by science alone the new series is great. The sound in space is not completely gone :( but it is muffled simulating the inside of a cockpit. They don't use lasers which would be a poor weapon. The robots can actually move instead of shuffle and they don't have the intelligence of a poodle.

But the most successful rewrite is Baltar. The original series never explains why a person would betray the human race. It would have to be a strong motive. The revamped Baltar is believable, if a bit pathetic, and STARBUCK IS A GIRL!!. Who cares? She's a great character.

This is a great show. Get over your selective childhood memories. The original was endearing but hokey. The new show stands on its own.
