Well,  this evening I watched the film on DVD,  found it excellent,  then turned to the Amazon reader reviews to see what others thought/felt about it.

At first I was surprised by the generally negative tone of many reviews -- but then again,  we are all so much a part of the mass-culture,  mass-media nightmare that is contemporary America,  it may be hard for many of us to get above and beyond the nocive stuff that surrounds us 24/7.

It's definitely an "elitist" work,  and the highly ironical,  alienated tone is not going to be for everyone. Remember,  the Weill-Brecht "Threepenny Opera",  a satire of capitalism,  flopped in America ca. 1930,  and only became an off-Broadway hit 25 years later.....

An irony within the irony of "American Dreamz" is that the putative Arabs and Arab Americans look to me to be mainly Persians and Pakistanis,  as though real Arabs would not be "other" or "different" enough for this kind of satire.

Anyway,  I loved the film and predict that it will become a classic of the early 21st century.
