Eyes Wide Shut is a haunting experience. As to if you like it or not... you certainly wont be forgetting it too soon. Its imagery was perfectly framed, the music bold and appropriate, the colour was very obtuse and the acting impeccable. The sex in the film is never truly erotic, rather always concerned with danger, risk and confrontation. Kubricks visual style has never been so vibrantly alive. His elegant tracking, zooming and lengthy shots all create an atmosphere of complete frustration; everything is slightly off centre. Thankyou Mr. Kubrick for not handing your film to us on a silver platter, as so many directors do today. Thankyou for respecting our intelligence. This is Kubricks true indent on the history of film and it is matched only by David Lynch. The two leave us - the audience- to fill in the gaps, to hem the story ... This is the greatest film-audience relationship a director can create. When Cruise and Kidman were lost, we the audience were lost with them. What an achievement. It is a dissapointment this film wasnt recognised come Oscar time- I guess its a statement in itself of the franchise that appears to be gutting the spirit out of Hollywood. This is Kubricks best since "A Clockwork Orange."
