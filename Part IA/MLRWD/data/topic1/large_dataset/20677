This film, originally released in 1972, ostensibly documents the final performances at the legendary Fillmore West--and great performances they are, with Jefferson Airplane, Hot Tuna, Jerry Garcia with the Grateful Dead [it]and[it] the New Riders of the Purple Sage, Elvin Bishop, Santana and others onstage for the last five days. Memorable music and wonderful full-length performances, but the musicians do not star in this film. This is Bill Graham's showcase, in every way.

Looking and sounding like a cocky Charles Bronson, we see Graham engaged in every aspect of his club, from moving a piano to kicking a cheeky wannabe act out of his office. A tough guy by any standards, Graham's temper erupts time after time, sometimes for effect, sometimes so he doesn't explode from the energy and determination compressed into his thin frame. He attempts to book Santana as his closing act and over a series of phone calls, Graham screams, he pleads, he reasons, then shouts some more, as if his own life would be meaningless if anyone but Santana were the last act at the Fillmore West. Graham got Santana and the filmed performance was brilliant, as Graham undoubtedly knew it would be. He wasn't the best impresario in rock by accident.

Graham commands attention from the opening scene in which he assesses ticket buyers, lined up four deep around the block, to the last scene, where he surveys the debris in his empty club, never to reopen, never to be surpassed.
