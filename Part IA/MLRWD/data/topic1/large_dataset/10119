... that you can play while watching The Commitments.  Buy a few cases of Guinness, and every time a character says the naughty F-word, take a good long gulp.  I guarantee no one will be sober when the movie ends.  I think the director, in his commentary track, says something like over 280 swears had to be overdubbed for the television version.

Apart from the amazingly high cussing quotient, this is a fairly sprightly Dublin take on the old "hey, gang, let's form a band and become famous" trope.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, pokes fun at many music industry sacred cows,  and fairly reeks of 1980s Irish working class sensibilities.  While it may seem less than ambitious to merely aspire to become a famous soul cover band -- as opposed to making *original* music, which never seems to enter anyone's head --  you can't deny these youngsters' sincerity or drive to succeed.  Miraculously, they manage to do so despite the incessant bickering, but things fall apart quickly and predictably once show biz-size egos start to collide.

One thing you can't deny the Irish, they gotta a whole lotta soul, and in this film we see the proof.  Ninety proof, n'yuk-n'yuk!
