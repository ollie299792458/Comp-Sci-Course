I feel compelled to give this 5 stars immediately, and find it odd that Amazon would continue to lower the overall average by including a negative rating by someone who could not view the product when attempting to play it in a devise for which it was never intended. At any rate, anyone who is at all interested in the glory days of old Hollywood (particularly musicals) will thoroughly enjoy this. As with the original theatrical releases, Parts I & III are the real gems (II was rushed into release to capitalize on the success of the first and is the weaker of the three but still has it's moments including the rare paring of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly). The high definition fan may be a little disappointed by some of the footage (it's had to make some old grainy black & white film look great) and by the constant shifting of screen ratios (from 4:3 to 16:9 and even wider) but it is all handled as smoothly as possible. The extras and interviews all add greatly to one's appreciation of a truly American art form and a period that's gone forever.
