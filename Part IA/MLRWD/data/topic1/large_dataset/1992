When the art form of Animation (the HAND DRAWN animation)was still being done,This film exceeded the magic and wonder of most of the family affair we are littered with today. Every character in this film is endearing (Jeremy the crow is my personal favorite). The film is also filled with eye candy, the colors and background paintings and animation is top notch. NIMH boring? Not at all, I found this film to be extremly entertaining and the story kept my interest the whole way through, and this statement is coming from a 38 year old man!

Yes I saw NIMH as a child but the charm still captures my heart to this day.Don Bluth is a master animator in my opinion, and thankfully he is carrying the torch for this little used art form in this time of computer animation. Why on earth can't both mediums exist? Handdrawn versus computer? I'll take hand drawn everytime! The heart in this film comes from ALOT of HARD WORK and from alot of talented people that had a love for the art form of hand drawn animation. Deep down inside, I believe Mr. Bluth will have the last laugh as hand drawn animation will make a comeback.

To the one reviewer who obviosly was not paying attention during this film, NIMH stands for NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH. Do not hesitate to sit the children down in front of the TV to watch this film, better yet&lt; sit down with them and watch it! You'll find you will enjoy it as much as they will.

Enjoy this masterpiece and respect it for what it is.
