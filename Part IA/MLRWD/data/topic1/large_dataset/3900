Perfect Blue is an excellent psychological thriller which depicts the decent into maddness of young pop idol turned actress, Mima Kirigoe. The film slowly turns from Mima's struggle as an actress to a fight for her own identity and sanity. The film takes you inside her paranoid delussions and nightmares, as you start to loose track of what is acctually happening, and what is just a product of Mima's fears. The film will leave you wondering what really did happen during its course and inspires insightful debate. The film also bears striking resemblances to a film named "Audition" by Miike Takashi which also has simmilar mind trips and the sudden switch from normal situations to violent or non sensical ones.

Satoshi Kon's direction is a true marvel, echoing the best works of Kubrick and Hitchcock through the ubundance of suspense and tension in his scenes. The cinematography is excellent promoting the feeling of confusion and paranoia that is vital during the pivitol scenes of the film.

Perfect Blue is really one of those films that breaks the boundaries and conventions that are expected from animation, just through the depiction of the characters and the world.

The films animation rate may not be as high as others, but it puts all its efforts mainly into detailed stills that are used throughout the film.

Perfect Blue is really a hit and miss film depending on the person, the film does explain things at the end, but it doesn't make all that much sense, requiring you to put the pieces together(but the pieces are there), this film will not spell things out for you as most films do. It's quite subjective and you can read it in different ways, this can tend to turn some people off, but that's what I really love about this film, as you can watch it a few times over and read differently each time.
