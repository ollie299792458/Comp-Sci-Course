I'm a fan of vampire movies and I've seen many through the years from the original Dracula from 1931 to vampire movies of the present.  This movie is definitely one of the best, if not THE best vampire movie I've seen.  There isn't one second of this movie wasted on stupidity, triviality, mediocrity, or filler.  This movie just oozes with greatness from beginning to end in all aspects I can possibly think of: storyline, dialog, casting, acting, directing, cinematography, sets and locations, lighting, soundtrack, pacing, sequencing, originality, creativity, imagination, intensity... I'm sure I could go on and on.  I was so engaged in every scene in this movie, by the time the movie was over I was pleasantly exhausted with the feeling of "wow, that that was a great movie!"  I'm not a reader of fiction novels but I find myself very compelled to read the book after seeing this movie.  I can tell the actors in this movie really put a lot of effort into playing their roles.  There are no prima donnas or wannabe heros in this movie.  Every actor was very engaged and worked very hard to get everything just right, and their hard work paid off.  If you're a fan of vampire movies, or horror movies in general, or even action movies (there's a lot of exciting action in this movie), you DEFINITELY have to see this movie!
