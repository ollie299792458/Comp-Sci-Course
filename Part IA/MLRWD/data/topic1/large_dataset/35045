I bet most people have heard of WAR AND PEACE, but few people have read this hefty tome.  It gives many people the connotation of zillions of characters and eons to read.  But guess what, it really is a good story and the best way to find out frankly is with the movie at only 3 and a half hours long.  Why am I telling your about it?  Because it is a Napoleonic movie and there aren't all that many of these.  Yes, the "war" part deals with Napoleon's wars with Russia.  Of course Leo Tolstoy was Russian so you get to see Napoleon's campaigns mostly from the Russian point of view, the battles, strategy, heroes, agony, etc.  The battle scenes aren't epic sized, but still inspiring, sweeping, and worth the wait.  In particular, we get to see the battles of Auschwitz, Borodino, and the long, terrible, cold retreat from Moscow.

No those don't take three and a half hours because the other part of the movie is `and peace'.  The movie focuses on the various love stories swirling around Audrey Hepburn and Henry Fonda.  But what I particularly like is the view of Russian aristocracy during the Napoleonic age, the splendid houses, ornate buildings, conflicting mores, charming gowns (and the women wearing them), and country dachas.  It does particularly well for showing the affects of the war on the families at home including the men marching off to war, the women waiting for them, and the families evacuating Moscow just ahead of Napoleon.
So whatever your perceptions of WAR AND PEACE may be, see the movie and find out for yourself.  I know, even at 3.5 hours, the movie condenses the book and what Tolstoy wants to say to us, but it is still a fine story and movie with legendary actors, beautiful sets, a large cast, and sweeping plots.
