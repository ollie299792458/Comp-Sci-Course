I was so looking forward to this movie and then was slowly and badly disappointed.  For some reason I didn't bother to see who had directed it, but I should have known after finding out it was Tim Burton.  This is just my guess, but here goes.  The original movie tended to make people quite mad at what they were seeing.  To see Apes treat "humans" like we treat animals was both humbling and maddening.  I think many that watch the original think of ways to "get back" at the apes.  This movie came across as just that.  As a way for the human character to "take charge" and "get back" at those dirty apes.  Totally missing the entire point of Taylor having NO POWER to do anything about the situation.  This was their planet and Wahlberg's (probably didn't spell his name right) comment about him being in charge soon was just so utterly arrogant and stupid that as soon as he said that, the movie was over for me.

Then there is the general jumping around like a monkey - what??  No, again, Burton knows nothing and learned nothing from watching the original, if he ever did.  The ending was just so OMG stupid, there was no shock to it, no drama to it, just total nonsense.  Please do not waste your time with this total piece of crap.  Do yourself a huge favor and stay with the original.  Burton needs to retire and stay away from doing any more films.
