The scope and the sheer implications of this material, from a scientific point of view ,should be common knowledge.

The common cliche' "written in the stars" gains a new meaning.

These stellar events are documentable and irrefutable. The coincidence of the evidence is appalling and unchallenged.

The PERSONALITY of a CREATOR is right there shoved in your face. The PRESENCE of God in TIME and SPACE is undeniable.

We are seeing the Truth itself. We cannot deny we have seen it. We all stand for Judgment.

By or choices, by what we choose, we are defined. There is no other Bread and no other Light. And there is no alternative.

A HUMAN baby born of a Human mother....is foretold as documented in New Testament and Old Testament Scripture...as the Son of God.
REALITY can have only one Origin, Direction, and Purpose. God has been born a Man.

ALL of us, all Humans, can stand and speak with God, because He is NOW.... one of us.
