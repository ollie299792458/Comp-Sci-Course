Kevin Smith doesn't need Jay and Silent Bob to make a great comedy. Jersey Girl may be evidence to oppose that, but Zack and Miri Make a Porno is proof positive that Smith hasn't lost his touch since his cult classic breakout hit Clerks. But I can't give smith all the credit, he did borrow Seth Rogen for that extra edge, Elizabeth Banks for a biting sense of humor in a very sexy package, and Justin Long (in what may be the funniest role he's ever played, EVER). Jason Mewes is still in it too, with his hair cropped short, but his vulgar and un-P.C. humor still very much intact. The rest of the cast is perfect too, I could list the positive attributes of each actor, but that would bore you. Instead, let's focus on the film.
I saw this in theaters and remembered loving it, but forgetting most of it due to other films I had seen around the same time (most notably Role Models, another winner featuring the incredible Elizabeth Banks). After purchasing the Blu-Ray and watching it again, I realize how amazing this comedy truly is. It's one of the most rewatchable comedies I own (up there with the aforementioned Role Models, Shaun of the Dead, Office Space, and Dumb & Dumber), as well as the best "date" movie I can watch with a girl (if she shares my vulgar sense of humor).
I'm not going to ruin any scenes, or go on about character development or plot, I'm just going to say one thing. If you aren't laughing yourself to tears and clutching your sides in bliss during the high school reunion (Justin Long steals the scene with a vengeance), then you don't know what's funny. And after the movie, watch the bonus features where Justin Long shows his skills with improv (most of the scene was ad-libbed). You won't be sorry.
All in all, if you like your comedy dirty 'a la The 40 Year Old Virgin and Waiting, you'll love Zack and Miri.
