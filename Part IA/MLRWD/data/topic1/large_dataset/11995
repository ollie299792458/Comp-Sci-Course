You go into a movie like "Take Me Home Tonight" with relatively low expectations.  Even from the previews, it looks about as rehashed and formulamatic as it gets.  Still, on the right night, in the right mood, the 80's soundtrack and familiarity of the plot can make you a believer.

And it IS familiar.  I can't tell if the direct copy of the "love-lorn-high-school-dream-girl-party" theme is an homage, a tongue-in-cheek tribute, or just lack of originality.  The fact an hour and a half movie can feel lengthy says a lot about it.  It has it moments, fer-shure.  The soundtrack is spot on, and there are also a few points in the film where cliche'd dialogue and script are redeemed by Kevin-Smith like verbage, and they are shining moments.  Its what kept me on board the whole movie.

That, and odd cameos, like Michael Bein...where did that guy go?  I wouldn't OWN this movie, but I had a good enough time watching it to feel like I hadnt lost 90 minutes of my life.

Topher Grace plays the role alright (albiet far too whiney to really be too supportive of) and surprisingly, Anna Faris plays the sarcastic sister quite well.  Dan Fogler, for better or worse, copies the "zany-best-friend" role of every 80's movie, and newcomer Teresa Palmer is eye-candy, if you can suspend the disbelief that she would/could work in investment banking.

Final verdict - a solid, 100% rental.
