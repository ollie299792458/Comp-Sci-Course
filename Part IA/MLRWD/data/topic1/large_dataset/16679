I really enjoyed this portrayal about Justine, a woman who's trapped in a dead end job and a lack lustre marriage.  I especially was intrigued by her sudden attraction to a lone wolf outsider type who unfortunately in the end dissolves into a kind of pathetic, whimpering nut case whose love is merely a product of his own delusional uniqueness and self importance. His love and passion for Anitston's character, leads him to suicide.  In the end she is asked if she knew him and she simply replies, "Not really."  It might sound slightly dead pan and flat and I was hoping for more, but then again I realized that this movie is a dark comedy and that Jennifer's main character is in the end doomed to go on living with her pot smoking husband whose shallow existence is a perfect mirror for her own inner conflicts.  
One point that this movie did drive home is that women who go outside of their marriages for sex are not really bad, however, they are trying to fill a void, a void where there is little intrigue or passion or romance and adventure.  In the end, I had to wonder if indeed love is an ephemeral dream and that perhaps we are doomed to chase this elusive butterfly, because that's how we are constructed.  And we must pay somekind of price for whatever happiness we find in this life.
In a sense, this story reminded me of Madame Bovary, but of course it's not a literary masterpiece, but all in all it is a very well acted script that leaves you something to ponder - something that will somehow help you to look into the emptiness of your own existence.  
I expect great things from Jennifer in the future, for certainly she does have great potential and will outgrow her present family of friends by leaps and bounds.
