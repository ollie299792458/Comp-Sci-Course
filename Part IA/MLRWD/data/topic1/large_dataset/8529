I am always cautiously optimistic when it comes to horror film remakes because they're often an attempt to "modernize" the original and throw in some blood and boobies that the original may have lacked. It comes off as a cheap and sleazy attempt to cash in on the success of the original and that's just not okay. Having seen the original Uruguayan film La Casa Mudre when it was released, I was really excited to see what they would make of it in this new version starring the impressive Elizabeth Olsen. My breakdown goes a little something like this:

The Original Film:
-Shot in one take which was its success and its downfall due to lighting and camera issues.
-The film was extraordinarily dark and even though I realize that was meant to add suspense, there could have been a bit more light.
-The darkness of the original film made it very challenging to read the subtitles without missing any big scare moments.
-The plot was painfully vague and although the movie definitely evoked a spooky feeling, it lacked a significant plot line.
-All in all, it was the concept of how the film was produced that made La Casa Mudre memorable, and not much else.

The Remake:
-Still maintained the "dark" element, adding just enough light to make it a little less frustrating for the viewer but still just as creepy. I also loved how it was daytime outside through almost the entire course of the movie. Scary to think that such terrifying things could be happening inside while it was still light outside.
-Obviously, being in English helped to keep me engaged in what I was seeing and thus a lot more tense and frightened in those big moments.
-The plot was much more developed and interesting to follow, with an ending that (while not 100% original) was still fresh enough to be disturbing albeit pretty predictable.

No spoilers here. I'd say its definitely worth a watch.

P.S. Nice to know there's an Olsen out there whose acting roles don't involve pre-teen hijinx and slapstick comedy. I hope she sticks around. She was very believable and did a really incredible job.

P.P.S. This film, unlike the original, was actually broken up into 12 minute takes as confirmed by Olsen and the directors. Still pretty impressive if you ask me, 12 minutes is a pretty long time, especially in a fairly fast-paced movie like this one.
