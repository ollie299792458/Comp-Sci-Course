Well, when I first said I wanted to see this movie my mom looked it up on Deseret News, and it was a bad review. So from that point on my mom was not for it! When I finally did get to see it I was entertained, and not to mention I could see it again in the same day without getting bored! which means it wasn't a film you could memorize when you see it for the first time. You don't know what's going to happen next, and you can never tell either.  If you've read even a little about the story you'd know that the droid goes mustang, and is after them.  What impressed me was the robot...it looked exactly like a mountain lion, or a puma.  It moved like one, and it even acted like one!  So when that robot goes BAZERK it gave me chills, because I've had mountain lions in my back yard before. Another thing was the plot, it was not what you usually expect from  a Mars film.  Usually you'd find aliens on Mars, either they what to totally exterminate the entire human race, or they are some sort of god-like figure, BUT NOT IN THIS MOVIE!!  So find out the REAL secret behind Mars! and watch this movie, I don't think you'll regret it.
