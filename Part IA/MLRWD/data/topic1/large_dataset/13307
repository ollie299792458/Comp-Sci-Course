This season by far, IMO, is one of the best seasons of Desperate Housewives. All of the stories from season one that were left unanswered or stayed hidden all this time comes to light in this wild season. (Hint: Andrew hitting Carlos' mother with a car) All secrets burried come back with serious consequences. As many know Paul Young returned as this season main antagonist, but this also brings out the return of the Martha Huber's creepy sister who had faked her death in the second season finale, Felicia Tilman. Vanessa Williams and Brian Austin Green joined the cast was just icing on the cake. This is a must see season for any Desperate Housewives fan that couldn't see the past episodes of the season on tv (ratings have dropped due to poor scheduling by ABC and many fans have missed new episodes). I don't understand how some people are saying this was a week season?! The finale was one of the best of the series!!! It was so intense! I'm happy the ladies will be back for season 8 and I can't wait to add this season to my Desperate Housewives Collection!!!
