One of my all-time-favorite movies - maybe the best movie ever made. Visually delicious, very entertaining storyline and action packed chases (at the airport, under L.A. multi-level intersections/highways and even a terrorist plot to kill the president) all in the life of secret service agent Richard Chance. Sexually a very liberal view of L.A.: Girls leave guys for other girls, government agents date strip bar workers for sex and information (in exchange for parole). One scene you think the counterfeiter is about to kiss another guy. At another angle it's a woman but I'm still left to wonder because she looks much different than in the first shot.
I had this on VHS, then DVD and now Blu-ray. The blu-ray experience was the best yet, since I was too young to see this in theatre when it was released in 1980's. I'm just waiting to buy a HD projector to view this blu-ray to achieve a movie-theater experience. I was very pleased with the HD resolution and I've read that it's very close to 35mm theatre copy in quality and resolution.
