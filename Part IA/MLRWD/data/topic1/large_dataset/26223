This film's imagery is powerful and sensual...so rich and vivid that it seemed as though I could feel and smell the lush and exotic scenes. Throughout, the film is infused with light-hearted, but nevertheless heated, eroticism informed by female sensibilities. What is most surprising is that it does have a message; one might say that despite being set in 16th century India, it is a modern morality play told more than a little tongue-in-cheek. 
Maya, born into a servant caste, and thereby relegated to a powerless situation in a rigid society, manages with daring, intelligence, and humor to live an authentic life. She acts boldly, at times, to shape her destiny; but she also accepts with equanimity the turns of fate that she cannot control. I think I can say without giving away anything that I love the final scene where, on the metaphorical path of life, she walks  serenely out of the chaos and madness created by powerful men into the peace of her own future. Oh, that one might do as well in the madness of the 21st century.
