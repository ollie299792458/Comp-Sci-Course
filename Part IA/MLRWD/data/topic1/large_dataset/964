Frank Whaley (Swing Kids, Pulp Fiction) plays Guy, an abused assistant to Buddy Ackerman, played by Kevin Spacey (The United States Of Leland, The Life Of David Gale). Guy comes to Buddy's pad and takes him hostage and starts torturing the hell out of him. Why, because Whaley has had enough of Buddy's abusive treatment. The movie flashed back to Guy's first day on the job where he yelled by Buddy because Buddy likes Sweet & Low in his coffee. Threw the movie we see Spacey's character as some what of a dick and Whaley's character as the innocent bystander. This dark comedy takes us into the world of an abusive boss and the buizeness of producing movies. Whaley is on the mark and Spacey is ferociously red hot and excellent. If you like dark humor then this is the ticket. Others might not like it. Violent at times but it goes into the depth of characters. Also starring Michelle Forbes (Tv's Homicide, Escape From LA), Roy Dotrice (Tvs Angel) and Benicio Del Toro (21 Grams, The Way Of The Gun).
