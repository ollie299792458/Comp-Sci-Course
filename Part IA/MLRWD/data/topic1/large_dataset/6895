I find yet another forum for those who have seen some other version of a movie to whine about what should've been.  Deal with this reality, people!  Miramax/Disney has placed this one in the same category of importance as Air Bud!  I purchased my copy of the DVD on eBay from someone in Canada who got it free on a box of Froot Loops.  So Disney sees it as disposable, as far as I am concerned and I don't expect to see it released anytime soon.  We originally saw this in Laser Disc format and we have loved it ever since, and I miss that widescreen version.  Vincent Price's voice as a baddie is perfect, as always. What's not to love about Matthew Broderick as the underdog hero? But, most of all, I wouldn't know what to do without Jonathan Winters as the thief with his witty, albeit anachronistic, comments. So if you haven't seen the original version, you will probably like this one well enough, especially if you like animation in all its varieties.  The nice thing is you can buy this one used on Amazon for a few bucks, so you won't be out much $$$ even if you don't like it.
