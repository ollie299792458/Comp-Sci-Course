At the time I write this review, there are 555 reviews posted for the this Blu-ray version and 555 reviews for the 60th Anniversery DVD version. How is it possible for Amazon to have the same amount of reviews for a Blu-ray that is barely a month old and a DVD that is 3 years old. There is only one way, Amazon takes the DVD reviews and puts them under the Blu-ray product. I'm a huge fan of Amazon, but this practice borderlines false advertising. It's wrong, especially classic movies like this where the movie sells its self.

Amazon has to stop doing this practice. Please start listening to us customers, and please review the exact product we are researching for purchase. We especially want to know the quality of the Blu-ray against the DVD version. There are many Blu-ray versions out there that are not worth the purchase. In fact, the DVD played in a Blu-ray player actually looks and sounds better than the Blu-ray version. We will respect and trust Amazon reviews far more and you will have more loyal customers for it. I want to buy this product. Do I buy the Blu-ray or the 2006 DVD? After 555 reviews - I have no idea!!!
