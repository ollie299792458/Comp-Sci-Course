I first rented the DVD because of the "cult" status it holds. After watching it repeatedly over a single weekend, I had to own it. It's almost 75 years old now, so keep that in mind when watching it- how many of today's Oscar winner movies will be remembered in 75 years? All the more interesting was the hysteria that surrounded it, its banning from Europe for decades, and that it virtually ended the careers of those who produced it.

The story and some of acting are rather mundane, but the movie grips you and you can't turn away. You'll find yourself siding with the "Freaks" as they take on the abuse and prejudices that have changed very little in all this time. The actors with disabilities are so totally engrossing that you wonder why we are all so afraid of the "different." Of special interest for me are Daisy and Harry Earles, also known as part the Doll Family. Born in Germany, they were siblings from a family of 7 children, of which four were Little People who formed the "Doll Family. Daisy was billed the "Midget May West" for her adorable screen persona and looks. Harry was one of the "Lollipop Guild" trio from the Wizard of Oz, and the other three Dolls were in it as well.

The movies has some rough edges, and yes, the accents are sometimes hard to understand. But the DVD has subtitles in English, which you can turn on briefly if you just can't make out a line. The Special Features section has some great background on the production that you should not miss.

Watch this masterpiece and you will never forget it or the magical people that made it what it is.
