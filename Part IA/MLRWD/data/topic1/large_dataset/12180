Maybe the plot has been used, but if it is well played out (as in this  movie) it has permission to be reuesd.  I haven't seen an action mystery  before, so I found it enjoyable.  The camerawork was VERY good, and the  style of presentation was also very good.
  People have been trashing  the ending, and it has been said that it was bad, far-fetched, predictable,  etc.  Well, I did find it predictable, but that did not spoil it for me.  I  didn't even notice the criticism until people brought it up.  This movie  seems to play on your emotion and your eyes.  Anyone can take it apart and  compare the plot or criticize the ending, but great actors like Cage and  Sinise give it emotion.  To really enjoy this movie, don't analyze the  movie making ("oh, I've seen stuff like this before, it's him, the  movie is pointless now"), put yourself in the characters shoes and  really ride with it.  As the back cover says, the movie is really about  "the shocking truth that Santoro doesn't want to believe".
  My point:  If you are a movie analyzer watching the movie from the outside,  seeking to take apart the plot and the directing and whatever.  This won't  produce the satisfaction that you are looking for, and you probably won't  like it.  If you are the type that gets with the characters, feels their  emotion with them, and basically watches the movie from the inside, you  will love it like I did.  I give this movie four stars for a great ride  from the inside, but in all fairness a predictable and perhaps far-fetched  (not by any means bad) ending* cost it a star. 
* action ending, not  ending ending
