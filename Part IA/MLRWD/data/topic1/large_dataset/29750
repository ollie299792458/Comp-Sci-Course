It appears that the subject of this series surrounds what may very well be a study of the inner workings of a servant staff and an aristocratic family around the late 1800's and early 1900's. A story is written around it with many twists and turns.

As the back jacket of Downton Abbey summarizes: "After a tragedy at sea claims the life of the presumed heir, Lord Grantham [Hugh Bonneville] is faced with the possibility that the house he's loved his whole life might someday belong to a distant cousin he's never met."

Early in the series, Lord Grantham shows the type of person he is when faced with a personal difference between staff opinion and his compassion. The Dowager Countess of Grantham, the marvelous actress Dame Maggie Smith, is truly the irrefutable authority on everything. The cast was well chosen as they often act out the bias of the aristocrats. "I would never serve anyone who worked." And then there is that distant cousin who is not a aristocrat at heart and does not like being "dressed like a doll". His butler remarked that "he even puts on his own pants."

The household is often confronted with secret plots. Deception. Planting false evidence.

About half way through the series, an event occurs that is very startling as two family members and a servant try desperately to cover it up. This event follows them to the end of the series echoing the intense conflict between two sisters of the family.

I gave it four stars rather than five as a result of comparison with other British classics. But the comparison is most certainly not on the basis of acting quality which is a solid five stars.

Very entertaining. Well worth the purchase.
