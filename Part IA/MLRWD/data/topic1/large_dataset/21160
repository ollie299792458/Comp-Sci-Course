I thought this movie would be interesting, but instead I was sideswiped by boredom and disappointment.  I can't remember that much about the film, because I've been trying to forget how awful it actually was, so if I'm off about the plot I apologize, but I don't really care that much about the details of this cinematic junk. The cell shading look (I think that's what it is referred as) was really cool, like those financial planner commercials, but the different look of the animation didn't make the movie any better...whatsoever.  From what I remember, the movie is about paranoid druggies (some seemingly unemployed, some not) that hallucinate periodically and one has a double life-jekyll/hyde cop/druggie thing going on. Oh yes, they are also being surveilled, which latently adds to their already crippling paranoia. I'm sure the picture quality is worthy of viewing, but just watch it for a few minutes and then burn the disc in its case. Even if it's a rental, every penny is wasted money that you'll never see again.
