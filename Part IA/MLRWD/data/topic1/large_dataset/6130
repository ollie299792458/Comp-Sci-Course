I've long suspected that most dentists harbor sadomasochistic tendencies, so watching Lord Laurence Olivier throw down some Third Reich dentistry skills, did not drum up that much fright for me.

In fact, director John Schlesinger and actors Olivier, Dustin Hoffman, and Roy Scheider are all above this material. 1976's "Marathon Man" is rather a bad film for all concerned, and surprisingly, the actor who made it watchable was the late, great Roy Scheider. I kept waiting for this cat to be brought up on larceny charges, for he stole every scene he was in...Scheider's Doc Levy is a smart, cool, secret agent sophisticate who shoulda known better than to bitch slap a Nazi near the Lincoln Center. I mean, c'mon, he shoulda taken him to Belmont Park. Who doesn't know that?

Film casting made two critical missteps in my book: Hoffman was already 40 yrs old in 1976, so the idea that his Thomas "Babe" Levy was a history Ph.D candidate was indeed stretching it. I found the restaurant scene in which big brother Doc threatens to order a McDonald's hamburger for his little bro unintentionally funny. Hoffman's character is basically treated like a dim 12 yr old kid wearing a beanie on his head.

The second error was hiring the towering Marthe Keller as Hoffman's love interest. Poor Keller not only has a speech impediment which makes her sound like a German Elmer Fudd (see also "1977's "Bobby Deerfield") but she is also built like an NFL linebacker. The Hoffman character looks like he would prefer to cower in a far corner rather than engage in any midsection activity with Helga. Sorry, I mean Elsa.

I am well aware that "Marathon Man" has its legion of fans, but ultimately, watching this film made me want to do something else...like nothing. Hey, sometimes the tooth hurts.
