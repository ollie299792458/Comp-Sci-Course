This film offers excellent voice acting and music, as well as the artwork which Disney is known for.

While the story is a departure from the books it has been based on [Eve Titus' "Basil of Baker Street" series], it is still quite a delightful find.  The characterizations are excellent, a step more interesting than many of the cliche and dull characters found in children's films today.

Many have said that the film is not one of Disney's best, as it does not follow the "Disney Formula."  This is both a blessing and a curse, and should be taken in accordingly.  If you tire of Disney's increasingly predictable and lifeless stories, then you may very well enjoy this film.

Among the cast is Vincent Price [The villain, of course] and Barrie Ingram as Mr. Basil.  The speeches given by the two seem akin to shakespearean rants when compared to the work done in other Disney cartoons.

This film would be of interest to any fans of either Sherlock Holmes or stories involving mice.
