There was insufficient tension in this series to keep me interested.  It's quite static, talky, and lacking in action and good, suspenseful plots.  Everyone sits around hand-wringing and making speeches, in endless circumlocutions of hot-windedness, with often indecipherable British accents.  Meanwhile, the Germans are inexplicably kind, bending over backwards not to harm anyone, except one of their own, who is falsely accused of raping an English girl and promptly shot.  I didn't find the English characters very sympathetic.  The young one goes around doing adolescent things like taking unplanned boat rides to England, and painting V for Victory on barns, twice getting others killed in the process.  The older man is a quisling, dutifully bowing whenever the Germans raise their voices (with bad German accents).  The Germans are more interesting, especially the police inspector.  But I couldn't keep interest with this series, and sent it back.  Island at War was a far better mini-series on the Channel Islands during WWII.
