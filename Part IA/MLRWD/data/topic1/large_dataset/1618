This Japanese Period drama, set in about 1865, 3 years before the Meiji Restoration, is among the best of its genre to be produced.  Yoji Yamada wanted to make a period piece that was realistic, and not a "super hero" samurai story where 20 swordsmen are killed in 1 minute by a single non-scratched foe (especially the Japanese TV period dramas and Kurosawa to some extent).

It follows the life of a lower level, 50 koku (30 to live on) accountant samurai in what is now Yamagata Prefecture, beginning with the death of his wife from tuberculosis ("consumption").  We learn later that he had to sell his katana (long sword) to pay for the funeral to meet clan standards, so he was a samurai who had sold the basis for his samurai life (the katana is the soul of the warrior).  Heavily in debt, he is carried along by situations of his own and others' making, until he is forced into a conflict he wished to avoid.  In some ways, he is the type of hero that you find in Eastwood's "Unforgiven."

The story is slow but steady, and Sanada makes the character of Seibei one that a modern person can easily relate;  someone caught inescapably in the rat race of his time.

The DVD is OK with two interviews, one with Yamada and one with Sanada and 3 trailers (2 for other movies), but the subtitles are burned into the film.  They are also only in English.  This is unfortunate because the actors deliver Japanese that is understandable (compared with a Toshiro Mifune delivery-"Aba yo"), and you have to try to ignore the subtitles to concentrate on the Japanese.  (I find myself even reading subtitles for an English movie.)  I would be happier if the subtitles could be turned off.

Even with the shortcomings of the DVD, this is a 5-star film.
