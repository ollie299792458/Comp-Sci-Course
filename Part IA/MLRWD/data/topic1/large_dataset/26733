Unlike groundhog-day scenarios, time travel stories do not involve a repetition of a certain day.  Rather, the protagonist goes back in time either accidentally or on purpose.  Star Trek is notable--or infamous--for its time travel plots, some of which are utterly laughable.  The concept is fun, but often breaks down via logic, leading to time travel "rules" such as not changing the past or screwing things up so much that you're never born.

But...what if you could go back in time and deliberately relive the same day, or the same moments, over and over?  What would you do?  What would you change?  Would you attempt to make the world a better place?  Would you go backwards for purely selfish reasons?

Consider, then, The Girl Who Leapt through Time (Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo), a movie that explores both concepts.  Usually, I don't have anything to do with schoolgirl-in-love-for-the-first-time movies--or TV shows, books or music, save for Little House on the Prairie, that is.  (The last has nothing to do with my boyhood crush on Laura Ingalls/Melissa Gilbert.  Nothing at all.)  However, The Girl Who Leapt through Time is a definite exception.  It's a sci-fi/romance that made be love anime all the more.
