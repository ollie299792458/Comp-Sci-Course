The strong cast in this film merits my 5-star evaluation. The actors work very well together and do fine justice to a robustly-dialogued and smart script.

There are numerous symbols that are well-placed in the scenes of the film. These are the "secondary actors" in Elegy, and their buttressing and enhancing of the dialogue will merit a second viewing for filmgoers who concentrate on the acting. The redemptive power of art is also an undercurrent - especially when an ideal, Goya's "Maja" painting so beloved by the Kingsley character, becomes ironically enfleshed in the present to summon and claim his love at the movie's end.

This film is not for the lower middlebrow and the special effects/action crowd. And while thoughtful, it can deliver strong emotional scenes such as when Kingsley's once-worldly academic colleague tearfully reaches to both his wife - and then Kingsley! - and tearfully kisses both of them from his sickbed. This was not expected, and is a key moment in upsetting the cynical academic's worldview, turning him toward the path of committed love.
