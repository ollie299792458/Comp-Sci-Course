OMg the wolf scene where they are reading each others minds is AWE INSPIRING! The transformation at the end was AWESOME! Cant wait to see the final movie.

If you have read the books you know what this movie is about.

SPOILERS!

Basically Bella finally marries Edward, goes on her honeymoon and finds out she is pregnant.
The lore says that the rarity of vampire pregnancy leads to DEATH!

Bella wont give it up. So she is slowly dying as Jacob and the Cullens watch on.
Rosalie and Bella form a bond over the pregnancy as Rosalie's big regret is not having a baby.

Jacob and the wolf clan split over the pregnancy as the wolves fear the baby is a demon and Jacobs love for Bella wont allow anyone to hurt her.

Bella gives birth and "dies". While Edward is desperately trying to save her, Jacob, grief-stricken, decides to kill the baby.

As he approaches the baby, he FINALLY imprints.

The wolves try to kill the Cullens when Jacob comes and lays the news on them about the imprinting.

The wolves can not under ANY circumstances hurt the one imprinted on.

The Cullens are safe for now and Bella "wakes up"

But are they safe? The Volturi want what the Cullens have!

I dont usually do spoiler reviews but people seem to want the details so this time I did.

PS the movie score is the best so far too.
