Toy story is one of Disney's best movies and is the first cg movie that has paved the way for movies such as Shrek and Finding nemo and seems as though all Cg movies are smash hits Every single film from Pixar has been an it all started with this one.  Had Toy Story bombed at the Box office I doubt there would be any Pixar today and Disney would not be scrambling to resign Pixar becuase they know Every movie from Pixar is a hit so Disney is stupid not to resign Pixar.  Disney needs Pixar as much as Pixar needs Disney. Just look back at the Past few Years Disney has not released a Blockbuster Hit since Mulan the only hits they have had has been the ones with Pixar.  Who would have thought it all statrted with a movie about toys. Toy Story is great for all ages 5 stars I never got the chance to own Toy Story on dvd it was back in the vault quicker then they could turn the key.

I own this dvd bought it on Day 1 the picture is crystal clear it looks awesome.  The sound is much improved. They have really made this movie shine.  Hard to believe this movie is already 10 years old.If you are a disney fan this is a must own.  If you own the previous versions to me 16 dollars is worth picking up this edition.  It looks much better then the previous dvd release and has some new features.  I guarantee if you like Disney and pixar movies this is the movie to get.
