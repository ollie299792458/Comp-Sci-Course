First of all,I can't stop listening to this DVD!
I love live shows DVDs and I have quite a few of them in my DVD library.Scorpions Live at Wacken is probably one one the best live DVDs I came across in awhile.The song selection is great ,26 of them with special appearance of Herman Rarebell,Uli Jon Roth and Michael Schenker.

First thing you notice about this DVD is great sound;heavy and hard ,just as it should be.The next thing is that the band is really tight and every song is performed well.
It seems that Scorpions really benefit here from having younger guns James Kottak and Pawel Maciwoda,delivering rhytm section while original  masters Rudolph Schenker ,Mathhias Jabs and Klaus Meine deliver their magic.
The performance of opening 3 tracks Coming Home,Bad boys Running wild and The Zoo are best live recording of these 3 tracks ever and are worth buying this DVD for.
The rest of DVD spreads nicely in their earlier and later work with speacial appearance of the above mentioned musicians.
Every member of Scorpions shines on this DVD and thats a nice break from other live DVDs in my library.

I listen to many different styles of music,and have attended many different music genre concerts but Scorpions concert which I attended two years ago was probably one of the best hard rock concerts I have seen!Do yourself a favour and go see them next time they come to your town,you will be happy you did!
