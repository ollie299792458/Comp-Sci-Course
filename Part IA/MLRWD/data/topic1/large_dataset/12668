This very nicely done film won't win any awards for great acting or anything, but it's terrific movie to watch with your Significant Other. Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds, whom I don't remember having seen in anything before) is about to be divorced and his 11-year-old daughter, Maya (Abigail Breslin, a very good young actress), insists on knowing just how her parents got together anyway. Will is hesitant, but at his daughter's insistence he agrees to tell her "the story" -- but he's changing the names, and she'll just have to figure out for herself which of the three women in his earlier life turns out to be her Mom. The story begins at the University of Wisconsin in the summer of 1992, where Will has a steady girlfriend named Emily (Elizabeth Banks). Then it jumps with him to the presidential campaign in New York City, in which Will is a Clinton volunteer, and where he meets April, the "coffee girl" (Isla Fisher, also new to me). Girl no. 3 is Summer (Rachel Weisz), a slightly strange, possibly bisexual friend of Emily's. There's a lot of funny, ironic dialogue, a number of "smile" moments, and a very romantic final scene, in which (with Maya's determined nudging) Will finds his way to the girl he should have been with all along. A good way to spend a Friday evening.

NOTE: I've seen reviews by apparently ignorant and/or right-wing parents that trashed this film solely because of the "introduction of sex education" scene with which it opens -- and which I thought was both very funny and very true. What is *wrong* with some people?
