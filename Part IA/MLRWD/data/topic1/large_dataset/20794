A WWII escape drama about a German U-boat crew shipwrecked in Hudson Bay, Canada.  The two hour long movie follows the dwindling U-boat crew as they attempt to escape from Canada, either to Japan via ship from Vancouver or by crossing the border into the USA which had not yet declared war on Germany.  It is an interesting exploration of what it means to be a Nazi, and what differentiates Nazis from "ordinary" Germans. Laurence Olivier is unrecognizable in the part of a naive French Canadian trapper who refuses to believe reports of Nazi attrocities until he witnesses them himself, with tragic consequences: "German's are regular men like you and I, no?  You wouldn't shoot children, would you?  I wouldn't shoot children.  So why should the German's do these things."  The characterizations of Nazi ideologues in this movie are not stereotypical, but accurate. This may have been a propaganda film, designed to influence American public opinion about the necessity of America entering the war, but it's message on the nature of National Socialism is spot on truth.
