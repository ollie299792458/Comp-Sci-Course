Departures features several smaller stories telling one larger.  There's by far the most screen time for Daigo, a young man who leaves his profession as cellist in order to be a caretaker of the dead.  Basically, he prepares the dead for their loved ones to view.  Because he knows his wife will dislike his new career, he tries to keep it secret.  He is also troubled by the unresolved bitterness resulting from his being abandoned by his father.  It is a major transition the protagonist is to make, and that is why this movie is very fun to watch.

I was awed.  Although many of the scenes are of moments resulting from death, it isn't a dramatic portrayal but is uplifting, comedic, and respectful.  It is evident that Daigo admires and respects his new employer--the head honcho in this business.  He seems to see him as a father figure.  The scene of the employer enjoying a nice meal is my favorite.  The employer is really my favorite character, and I recommend this movie to anyone.  Its theme is to always follow your heart, and accept others when they do the same, even if it's difficult for you to understand at first.  If it's something that brings joy to other people, it is worthwhile.
