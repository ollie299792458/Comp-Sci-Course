Michael Wood's epic journey in the footsteps of Alexander, was in short, incredible. Wood analyzes the main sources of Alexander: Arrian and Curtius, and gives us their point of view on Alexander. But it is the local  guides, peoples, and legends that Wood passes through that gives us the  tales behind the man who conquered much of the known world, and makes this  video worth seeing. I highly recommend this production for those who are  interested in Alexander the Great's career on a more psychological,  legendary, geographical level. It is not a hard core military analysis, but  dwelves into the mind, the life of the man who commanded the armies that  conquered the east. Though Wood gives us plenty of military insight, this  video is not recommended for those who search the commander rather than the  man in Alexander. Wood's role in this video is just mesmerizing. He is  non-biased, which is why he is able to provide us with accounts on  Alexander, that allows us to judge him for ourselves. If anything, In the  Footsteps of Alexander the Great is worth watching!
