I saw the promos with Brandon Routh, and didn't think he'd make a good Superman. I was wrong.

Brandon Routh made a great Superman and Clark Kent. I loved the way so many people seem to ignore Clark, or push him around. This makes the contrast between Clark and Superman more believable. You actually can see why some people wouldn't see the resemblance..

The story was interesting, to see Superman return after an absence of 5 years.. and see that the world survived without him. Indeed, they don't need him.

Lois has moved on, is engaged, and has a son... Hmm, do you wonder who the father really is? You see a few hints in the movie.

It's interesting to see how three people handle a present and past relationship. I was rather pleased to see Lois apparently sticking with her fiance. It was also good to see Lois & her fiance take an active part in helping to save Superman from near certain death.

That was another good aspect of this movie. We get to see the power of Superman, along with his vulnerability. Indeed, he almost dies at least twice.

I liked the choice of Kevin Spacey for Luthor.. He almost reminds me of when Gene Hackman played the role. Kate Bosworth made a good Lois, in my opinion.

This movie goes well with the first two Christoper Reeves Superman movies. (Let's forget about the rest of them.)
