After losing his beloved wife in a horrible shooting, a former college professor played by Robin Williams, reinvents himself.  After coming out of a catatonic state, he becomes Parry, living in the basement of the apartment building where he and his wife had resided.  He is a friend to the homeless and saves the life of Jack Lucas a disc jockey whose vitriolic diatribe sent one of his listeners over the edge.  The listener is the guy who shoots up the bar where Parry and his wife were.  After this happens Lucas becomes an alcoholic being supported by his long suffering girlfriend played by Mercedes Ruehl (in an Oscar winning role).  His connection with Parry saves them both.  The human mind is an incredible thing.  Every time Parry thinks about his wife or happiness with a woman he has fallen in love with, he hallucinates a "red knight" who chases him on a horse.  He becomes hysterical with fear. He can't "be" anyone but Parry, his mind won't allow it.  Its self-preservation.  Robin Williams is one of those rare actors who can make you laugh and cry at the same time.  I wish I could give this film more than five stars.
