I applaud the writer, director and star of Soldier - great work!
The story brought in some interesting concepts - something to think about.  Soldiers trained from birth - a life of incessant training and combat.  It makes you ask yourself questions.  How far off is this from the athletes from the primarily former Eastern Bloc who's life was geared around Olympic competition?  How far off is making newborns wards of the State and inducting them into this kind of life?  The story also asked the question: What does someone who has known nothing but military training and combat think and feel?  It's really something else.  Another thing that I was pleased to see was the triumph of Man over Technology.  While the new Soldiers are genetically superior to Dodd and his men, they lack the intuition, creativity, and combat experience that the "old ones" have.
The director's influence on the story was obvious in the use of story/plot over special effects (though they did exist).  Use of the camera was expert in such scenes as Dodd's flashback as he is using the large metal can as a punching bag - it comes as no surprise that out of instinct and pure reaction that he attacks the man who suddenly comes into the room.  Excellent setting of mood and building of suspense.
Kurt Russell himself plays an excellent character.  He pulls off alot of combinations that other actors may very well have shyed away from.  For example, he definitely put on some muscle for this film, but at the same time this hulking and scarred Soldier is at times terrified, compassionate, and paternal...all the while not coming out of the hardened state of the character. Bravo.
All in all, the untrained eye may see this as a low-budget sci-fi film (again, few special effects - sometimes the primary judging factor of a sci-fi film, sadly).  I, however, see this film as making a statement and showing off the style and skill of all involved.
