I did not see this movie when it first came out but I've had the VHS copy of it for years.  I wanted a DVD copy!  When I heard about the alternate ending, I knew this was the version I wanted.

The movie itself is just cute.  Yes there are some animation flaws (Rooster's legs bend BOTH ways and Vixen's tail disappears and then reappears - only to disappear again), but the movie itself is obviously not intended to be taken seriously.  Just enjoy it for what it is - one particular version of the legend among the thousands available.  I may not be a kid but who cares?  I liked the movie!  I also like the song "The Phony King of England".  It's such a catchy tune!

I rarely pay much attention to the special features of a movie but this one was different.  Although not animated, the alternate ending filled in a few gaps that were skipped in the movie (when/where did King Richard show up and under what circumstances and how did Prince John and Sir Hiss end up at the "Royal Rock Pile").  I think at least part of it should have been kept.

The animated short (very old Disney cartoon) was a treasure.  It was SO OLD that Goofy was listed as "Dippy Dawg" in the credits!

A must-have for any classic Disney aficionado!
