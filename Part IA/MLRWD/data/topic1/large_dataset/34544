Let me explain
-Spoiler Warning-
The first version of the film was shown in theaters.
The second version was shown on all home video formats. This version includes a couple of additional footage to certain key scenes, and a few new scenes all together.
- Spock has more Dialogue in the top brass meeting.
- A scene taking place in the President's office where Col. West presents his plan to sneak into Klingon territory and rescue Kirk and McCoy.
- Spock and Scotty checking the torpedo inventory before Valeris informs them that the Chancellor's Daughter is now the current klingon chancellor.
- The klingon assassin at the climax of the film turns out to be Col. West.
The Third version of the film is shown on this Special Collector's Edition DVD. This version includes all the material from the second version, and a few minor changes to certain scenes and effects.
- When Martia gets shot, a disruption sound effect is removed to make her scream more apparent.
- Valeris's interrogation scene has been entirely reedited. There are now close up shots of Kirk and McCoy when they speak their lines instead of being in wide shots. When Spock and Valeris name a particular conspirator, the face of that person briefly appears in a flashback like style.
Do I prefer this version of the film? Sure. I personally believe that Valeris's interrogation scene is much more dramatic with the flashback shots. It really helps the viewers who aren't good with names understand who Spock and Valeris are talking about, and adds a little more tension near the end of the film.
I hoped this information helps you out in spotting what has been changed. If there is anything I missed, please feel free to contact me.
