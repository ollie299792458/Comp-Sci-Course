Jennifer Aniston's character in THE GOOD GIRL is likely as much of an opposite of her character on Friends as we'll ever see. Aniston is obviously comfortable within the character's personality, as she is very believable and at times, drolly comical as the girl who can't get a break. Her days are a real drudge as she works the makeup counter at the local discount store in her small town. Not much happens in this town other than going shopping and going to church.
It's an escape from this humdrum life that Aniston's character, Justine, wants so badly. She's married but not very happily and the events that follow are nothing you'd find in her romantic comedies. Saying that the movie is a welcome departure from roles she's taken on in the past, showing her audience she's more than capable of handling dark comedy, as well as the happy-go-lucky stuff she's been doing on Friends all these years.
The other standout performance that provided huge comic relief is from Zooey Deschanel, who plays Justine's co-worker, Cheryl. Deschanel has some of the funniest moments in the film, all delivered with a deadpan style so fitting to her character's outlook on life.
I really liked this film, but didn't feel great or uplifted after seeing it. Rather, I felt sorry for Justine and those family and friends in her life, who seem to attract nothing more to their lives than daily doses of misery.
