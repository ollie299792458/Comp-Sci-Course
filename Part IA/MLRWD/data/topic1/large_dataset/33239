I love this movie a lot because it is really funny and a little bit crazy! This movie is all about Mr. Popper, played by Jim Carrey, whose father passes away and leaves him six penguins. After Mr. Popper's son and daughter come over, they name the six penguins; Stinky, Bitey, Nimrod, Lovey, Captain, and Loudy. Three of the penguins lay one egg each and one of the eggs doesn't make it. Mr. Popper did everything he could to help the egg survive but it didn't work. Later, the penguins get stolen by someone at the zoo. They plan to separate the babies from the older penguins. Mr. Popper goes into the zoo, frees the penguins, and traps the people that stole the penguins. Some of the main characters in the movie are Mr. Popper, the six penguins, Janie and Billy. My favorite character is Mr. Popper because he takes care of the penguins throughout the movie even though sometimes he doesn't want to. He is also a really funny character; sometimes he goes nuts when he gets really mad. My favorite part in the movie is when Mr. Popper opens up his shower door and a whole bunch of water comes rushing out because Captain had filled the whole shower up. Mr. Popper is pushed towards the stairs and had to hang on because the water is pushing him over. Then Captain comes over and poops in his face which caused Mr. Popper to fall. It was hilarious!! I would recommend this movie for all ages because it is super funny and there was no violence or parts that would scare anyone. This movie is a good movie because it helps to show the importance of family. Go out and buy this movie when it comes out on Blu-ray and DVD on December 6th. Anthony Aranda, age 9, KIDS FIRST!
