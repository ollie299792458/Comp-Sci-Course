...then you can be like me and rent this movie. But I have to say I disagree with anyone who calls this a top thriller. Hollywood has definitely had better offerings.

The story sounds interesting enough. Lisa Reisert goes to the airport, meets a suave gentleman who goes by Jackson, and finds herself sitting next to him on her flight.  Much to her dismay and horror, the man turns out to be an operative in a sinister plot to murder the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.  The catch is he needs Lisa to play a part in the plan otherwise a hitman will whack her poor daddy at home.  Lisa finds herself playing a dangerous game of cat and mouse aboard the plane and that's pretty much the gist of the film.  There's not much more to it.  No twists, no turns, just a straightforward flick with no surprises.

The acting was good. As in Batman Begins, Cillian Murphy made an excellent villain.  Rachel McAdams also did a good job in playing the emotional but independent hotel manager.  The script wasn't bad either.  Two thirds of the movie is shot on the plane, so the dialogue really carried the story.  The problem is the entire thing was just so predictable.  I was expecting more and was left wanting.

If you want an airplane thriller I would suggest Flightplan. Mentally it's more stimulating and it keeps you guessing until the end.  Not to mention Jodie Foster is an amazing performer.
