I love the Indian Jones films.  I like some of the James Bond films.  I like Star Trek and Star Wars, all big famous film franchises. (Yeah I could keep going but for God's sake let it go....)

What I cannot, and will never understand is what happened to Rocketeer?

This movie blows me away every time I see it.  I FINALLY got to see it in widescreen because it just came out in Blu-ray, and it looks just FANTASTIC.  This should have been the first of a trilogy, or a long-line of movies.

It is not from a main stream comic book, so when I saw it was not a rehash of what I imagined as a little kid, and if it was, the movie makers took the story and made it fill the big screen with EVERYTHING a movie watcher would want.

What does bother me about the blu-ray disk is that there are no behind the scene extras.  I have a documentary about Rocketeer on VHS that I recorded off broadcast TV.  Would have liked to have seen more!!  The world econony is in a slump- maybe Disney could not afford more.  (That's where the Blu-ray loses a star- the movie lookes great!)

Did we see Rocketeer in the theaters when it came out?  No we did not.  I guess that is mystery number two.  My son was rather small at the time and another was on the way-  at least mystery 2 has a viable theory...

One more thing- the Captain America movie was entertaining, but no way did I believe the events that happened in WW2 in that movie.  It was a nice 21st century version of WW2.  Rocketeer, as far as I am concerned TOOK YOU BACK to the pre-war years just like the Indiana Jones films.  The story was great, unpredictable and entertaining.  The actors were all just great- every one of the hit their mark and more.  And just like Superman, you WILL believe a man can fly!!

What happened to Rocketeer? I will never, ever, understand.  Should have been a blockbuster...
