With the 50th anniversary of JFK's murder on the horizon, we anticipate being samped with a radh of "new" books with "old" information spun just a bit differently. But for the cost of most of these "new" books, one can still buy the blockbuster movie that started it all: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DJ7PMI">JFK: Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

I already have an old print of JFK, but have always wanted to get a copy of the Director's Cut, if only for the Bonus features on the second disk. I missed this on it's initial release, and was gratified that it is still available on Amazon, and it was no disappointment. On recently rewatching the Bonus disc, I was amazed at the amount of information presented in the deleted scenes and "extra" scenes rescued from the "cutting room floor". There is well over an hour of this material and I felt as if were watching the movie for the first time.

I highly recommend this edition as well for the interesting commentary of Oliver Stone as he explains the choices that he had to make concerning which material to include and which was problematic. Be suire to listen to the commentary, especially if you are well versed in the facts surrounding the case.
