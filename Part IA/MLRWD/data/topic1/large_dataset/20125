Never saw the movie in a theatre or read the book. Saw it first on TV, and liked it so much I had to have a copy for myself.
I would have rated it 5 stars had there been more of John Berendt talking about his book, instead of him just introducing the real life people of Savannah. Which was a nice touch. It was a treat to find out that people who actually live in Savannah appear in the movie. Especially the gay hairdresser, Jerry Spence, and The Lady Chablis(more about her later.)
My favorite scene in the film involves Spence, when he is introduced to John Cusacks' character, and replies "I'm charmed now." I laugh every time I see it. He stole the scene.
And as for why I want to go to Savannah for a vacation. This city seems to be the place where the term "Southern Hospitality" was invented. At least that's the way the people are presented. And I'm assuming they were presented that way in the book.
And I have never had any desire to see a drag queen perform in person until I saw The Lady Chablis. I didn't realize he was playing himself until I had the DVD.
The 2 clubs used in the film look like places I'd like to hang out at. Or in the case of the club where The Lady Chablis performs, take in the show, her show.
So in case you haven't figured it out I really love this film. It's become one of my recent favorites. I highly recommend it.
