Like most KISS and PS fans around the world I was looking forward to this dvd for a long time. The fact that this show was recorded 2 years ago and the news leaked out about an up & coming dvd release back then gave fans something really special to look forward to.
The show itself is great as you would expect although it would be pretty hard to mess up filming a band in a small imtimate venue like that. Not sure what all the useless hype about director Louis Antonelli was all about, a six year old could've filmed this show. Sound is awesome, very live & raw as it should be. I went to 4 Australian shows & what you get on this dvd is 100% what you see live.
My only gripe is that they basically advertised for over a year that a "Live To Dream" doco would be included. Instead all we got was a dull prologue intro with information we all already know about Paul anyway. KISS fans have long memories and are the only ones going to buy this, and from reading some of the other reviews others wanted the extra features too. We saw footage/pictures a of Paul interview from his house, soundcheck, meet & greets etc but it all hit the cutting room floor. Look at the new RUSH dvd coming out next month. 3 discs packed with concert footage and extras for the same price as One Live Kiss.
