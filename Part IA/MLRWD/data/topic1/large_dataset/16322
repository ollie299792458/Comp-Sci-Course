Most reviews I've read have failed to even mention that the movie is a retelling of the legend of Beowulf.  Crichton has written a really cool story that postulates that the oldest known written-English language story, BEOWULF, (whose author is anonymous) may have been written by an Arab adventurer (Antonio Banderas' character).  The character names are slightly off (eg. Buliwyf is Beowulf etc.), but this would be a result of the translation from the Norse language to Arabic to English.  The movie does a fantastic job of showing us the Fireworm, Grendel (they call them the Wendol in the movie) and pretty much stays true to the legend.  The big thrill for those who have read Beowulf is how Crichton finds plausible "real-world" ways to explain the more mystical aspects of the Beowulf legend.  eg. The monster (The Grendel), is actually an army of savage warriors.  I won't spoil how they explain the Fireworm.  This is an underrated movie.  I will admit that it really helps if you are able to view it with Beowulf in mind.  I wish they could have shown this to us in high school when we had to read it.
