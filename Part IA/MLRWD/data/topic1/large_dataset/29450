I would say I am at an intermediate workout level and Brazil Butt Lift is a good workout! I am only on week one so I can't say anything as far as big results but I have been sore SINCE I started! So far I have completed bum bum, cardio axe and high and tight; and I thought they were all good workouts. Bum bum is difficult but doable. Cardio axe, well I had my doubts about it the first time I did it because sometimes I feel silly (and useless) doing dance workouts. But seriously, once you get the hang of it and actually put some force into it you break a sweat and your heart rate it UP!!! by the time it is over. I also have a dance background so that could be why I thought it was fun, but I do understand that dance workouts can feel silly at times.

I bought BBL because it received NOTHING but great reviews anywhere I looked. I'm pretty in shape I just want to tone up and lose 5-10 pounds. I have done p90x and insanity. P90x involved too much equipment and time for me (I don't like to do yoga for TWO FREAKIN HOURS!!!) and I thought insanity was too hard. I think this system will work pretty well, I'm just watching what I eat (not sticking to their diet completely, but basically with some cheat days (oops)) I'm looking forward to seeing results!

All around, it was worth the money. I am not one to pay $60 for workouts or gym memberships. I'm a poor college student and I buy the 9.99 Jillian Michaels videos and used to be a religious Jillian fan. However, they get boring fast. BBL is not boring and contains so many different workouts you're always changing up. I think it will be easy to stick to the routine and see results.
