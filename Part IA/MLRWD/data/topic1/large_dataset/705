This movie's protagonist, Andrew Largeman, returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral after consciously avoiding it for years.  His familial relationships have been strained since childhood, and his "friendships" from school ignored.  He's been on multiple types of mood-regulating drugs for years, thereby going through life in an almost robotic stupor, unable to fully react to things or feel much.  When he returns home, he meets a girl who is his opposite--a bit of a neurotic mess, but charming nonetheless, who opens him up to the possibility of letting his guard down and really experiencing life.

This film is funny, serious, romantic (in a non-cute way), clever, artistic (without being too pretentious) all at the same time.  While a few things seemed a bit strained (I don't think that the main character really *needs* to be on drugs to feel alienated from his hometown, father, emotions, etc.--it seems a bit gimmicky in a way, though overmedication is definitely a real problem), in all it flows really well and is believable in its dialogue.

I really related to Large's feelings of disconnect and sense of no direction.... Probably 90% of people just out of college or in their early to mid-twenties can relate to it, as well as people who can still remember what that time in their life felt like.  I would definitely recommend that everyone check out this film.
