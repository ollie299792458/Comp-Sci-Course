One Piece is my favourite anime, and I think this story arc is great.

I give this movie 1 star because it is a cheap cop out. If we're watching the 8th One Piece movie then odds are that we've seen the anime and the Alabasta story arc which happens relatively earlier on.

Alabasta isn't even the longest story arc, so why re edit it into this rushed movie?

In the story arc (Episodes 92 - 130) we are given are much more in depth backgrounds about the characters. We see Vivi as she grows with her kingdom, the people who make the kingdom and so forth. It establishes an importance of the kingdom and actually makes you feel for the characters. The film cuts all of that and just gets to the fighting. It's like an abridged youtube version let alone an actual film.

Many memorable moments are cut short as well, Usopp "trying to get into the mindset of crocodile" is reduced. Zorro learning to cut steal is almost gone. I swear Luffy escaping the sandtrap is also gone. He just randomly shows up on a bird in this version.

In the arc I liked the bit where Nami asks Usopp to manufacture weapons. They realise their weaknesses, it adds depth to the characters.

Well there's my two cents. The story arc is much much better and it has so many tense moments. This film does not.
