A stunning film made from a stunning book--how Le Carre was able to get this book  cleared by MI5 is beyond me. I believe moreover though I cannot yet prove it that it is in part based on facts. Without giving anything away I am fairly sure that the East German judge was asctually based on quite a distinguished woman related either to Brecht or Walter Benjamin. Moreover I have always thought that the Slansky trials may have been the historical source for Le Carre--again no proof. Finally as the film opens we see one of Burton's last agents killed as he tries to get through the Berlin wall. Given what "Control" is planning it now occurs to me that in order to get Leamus (Burton) ready(i.e. depressed and cynical) for his new mission, Control may have let us say acquested to his own agents death--this would have been going on before the book or film begins--I hope I make myself obscure but I think this possibility will be clear to those who have either read Le Carre's book or seen Ritt's fim both of which to misquote  Graham Greene only slightly are  the best Spy novel and film I have ever read  or watched
