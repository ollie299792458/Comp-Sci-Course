Okay, I'm only reviewing the Kino Blu-Ray of this movie here, not any other version.

This is absolute overkill, and I love every moment of it.

What we have here are two almost-alike, yet different version of the same film. Many of the takes are different from each other in both prints, and many of the camera angles are different when there was only one take of a difficult stunt.

Wow.

The bonus featurettes are nice too.

Now for the gripes -

This film has grain of a size that seems to perfectly not-match the resolution of hi-def. This serves to enhance the grainy aspect instead of reduce it. I'm not sure what the solution might be, other than some serious messing around with the sharpness of the transfer, which would cause other problems.

And, if we have two different print, it would have been nice to have a letter-boxed presentation of both films, side by side, complete. I'm sure I'm not the only person that wants this. Or, even better, an angle-selection that lets a person choose a larger and smaller image to put on the screen. This might only appeal to about 40 or 50 silent movie wonks, but BOY would it make those wonks happy!
