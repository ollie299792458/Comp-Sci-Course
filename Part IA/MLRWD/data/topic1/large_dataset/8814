Beyond great! A true tour of the heart and a reminder that the sun rises - always. An absolute "upper'
I was lifted up by this film! There was so much unassuming joy scattered throughout this story. It was so hopeful in the face of the worst kind of loss; a message that there is light at the end of all of our dark tunnels. And a clear reminder that we are not in control. The whole script seemed  a solid comment on the resilience of the spirit  and the strength of the truest kind of love, that of a child.
It was without any offensive content, save one mild curse word and my 9 year old enjoyed it as much as my husband and I. Even where almost uncontrollable passion was represented, it certainly got the message across without going too far.... left something to one's imagination, which is always more fun. Less CAN be more.
Martina Gedeck  (Martha) is a master at conveying her character's deepest thought and emotion through the smallest gesture and her colorful body language, she is a natural actress and natural beauty. Her role was perfectly cast.
Sergio Castellito (Mario)'s performance carries 1/2 the weight of this beautiful film so easily and unassumingly, but it was Mario's soulful eyes and open and uncorrupted manner that pushed me over the edge and made me love him.
It is one of the top 5 best "feel good" movies I have ever seen
Other movies that made me feel  like this were MARTIAN CHILD with John Cusack and AUGUST RUSH.
I cannot finish without mentioning the incredible performance, by  Maxime Foerste, who played the 8 year old girl, Lina, was heart wrenching and at the same time healing and filled with hope. I am a mother of three. This film plucked at those strings I so vehmently protect and made me remember what or who really matters and that it's best to show them - now.
I would recommend it to anyone... as soon as they can read!
