David Chase made this half-season with a story arc that went NOWHERE and an ending that, while brilliant, had nothing to do with what occured in the past six seasons or even with what occured during this season. Also, what was really the point of the Dr. Melfi character if she suffered the fate she did? Lorraine Bracco got second billing for WHAT? With all the great seasons before Season 6 (except for some of Season 4) this show ended as one big proverbial jerk-off.

HBO is ripping you all off again by charging FULL PRICE for a HALF season. HBO is notorious for overpricing these DVDs when you can pretty much watch these episodes at any time w/o the DVDs.

For those who would call people like me with unbiased opinions a "naysayer", I would say that if David Chase stuck out his tongue and licked a North Jersey sidewalk with it on a hot, muggy summer day, then stuck his tongue down your throats, you'd probably still call him a genius as you "enjoy" the taste of his tounge. You'd probably like anything as long as the Sopranos logo is attached to it. The good news is that HBO and D.C. know this and are just waiting to take your money.

Given how badly this show ended, I might have to now state that The Larry Sanders Show was the best HBO show ever and those DVDs are quite affordable. Plus, that show knew how to end.
