I loved the theatrical cut of Troy, and was hugely excited to find an expanded director's cut that promised more depth, character development ... and fighting! I enjoyed it hugely, though I have to say some of my expectations were disappointed: I read many reviews that said this longer version of Troy was really "a whole different film," and I expected a drastic rewrite and expansion of the plot and characters--rather like Ridley Scott did with the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven.

This is not that: it has a few longer scenes, which add some development to characters and situations, and it definitely gets an extra edge and impact from the extended battle scenes (which are great, but, be warned, quite gory--not "Spartacus" level, but there's guts on the sand). Most of the extensions work well, and do add more depth and tension--but, in the end, I feel it's the same film as the theatrical cut, just longer and bloodier. Brad Pitt's Achilles is still a complete psychopath, Orlando Bloom's Paris is still pretty much a lovesick twit, and Eric Bana's Hector is noble to the point of silliness ... Brian Cox's Agamemnon is even more villainous and scenery-chewing in this version (if that's possible) there's more Peter O'Toole, which is fantastic by any measure, and Diane Kruger's Helen even gets a bit more development (and an extended nude scene).

It all worked well for me: I thoroughly enjoyed the original, and this gave me a lot more of the stuff I liked the first time around. Don't expect it to drastically change the movie for you.
