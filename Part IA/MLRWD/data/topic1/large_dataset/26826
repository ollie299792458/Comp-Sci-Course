I saw "The Brood" before I saw "Possession," because I am a huge admirer of David Cronenberg's work. I must say, I was a bit disappointed. Sure, this was trademark Cronenberg grue, with the expected gore, shocks, and bodily terror we have come to expect from his early works. However, I didn't think the movie went deep enough. The true nature of the monstrous, murdering children wasn't even revealed until the last few minutes of the film. I couldn't help wishing there was a sequel. Well, I have found a sequel of sorts in "Possession."  This film, which was perhaps even partially inspired by the concepts presented in "the Brood", is a shocking, horrific, emotionally taxing ride, despite a seemingly pedestrian start. Once the film gets moving, though, it stops for nothing and no one. I wish that the synopsis for this movie didn't give away the surprise about Adjani's "lover," because that would be a part of the plot I would have kept hidden, such as who Keyser Soze was in "The Usual Suspects". However, I knew the plot before I saw the movie and it still packed a wallop. My only complaint: due to the artsy editing techniques, I sometimes I got confused about basic plot points.  This movie has been restored for a reason-it is great. Don't miss it, but avoid it if you don't like movies that make you think. This movie does have gore, but if blood and shocks are all you're after, stick to Hershell G. Lewis's or Lucio Fulci's films.
