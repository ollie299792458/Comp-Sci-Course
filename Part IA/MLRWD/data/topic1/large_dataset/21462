I don't go to many action movies of this type, but I got roped into seeing this one. The thought of having to sit through a 2+ hour movie dismayed me. Well, I hadn't seen the original "Pirates" and that probably turned out to be a hinderance. As the whole thing unraveled I became rather awe struck. So what did I expect, the Disneyland ride? The entire movie was unrelenting action. At no place did the activity level lull. The visuals were spectacular and interesting in a bizarre way. The stunts were amazing. Most of the characters were ugly and repulsive, both in looks and in person. The whole movie reminded me of a wild out-of-control dream, and it made about as much sense. The pure stupidity of the unfolding scenes actually brought out a lot of laughs in me. Both the high activity level and the visuals kept me from ever getting bored and I was surprised when it ended. It seemed much shorter than the indicated running time.

The story line was exceedingly weak. Furthermore, the movie required a strong belief in the supernatural in order to get into it. I lack such belief and most of the plot, if there was one, was exceedingly hard to follow. Oh well, this was not a movie to promote deep thinking. What unfolded for me was an unrelenting stream of unrelated activity, most of it violent in one way or another. In places it was quite funny in a visual sense. I wondered how they could possibly put such a thing together. It must have taken an enormous amount of computer animation. Am I looking forward to "Pirates 3?" No.

In any case, the movie came back to mind as I was browsing through the DVD bins in my local warehouse club. It was an interesting and enjoyable movie to experience and I've enjoyed writing this review. Would I buy the DVD? Not likely.
