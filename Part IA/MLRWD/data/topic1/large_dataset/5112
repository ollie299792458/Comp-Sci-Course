If you've never seen Doomsday, it's great. Extremely violent, gory, post apocalypse movie packed with amazing action sequences that combine elements of other better known films such as Escape from New York, and The Road Warrior. Throw in graphic cannabalism, awesome 80's music, a strong female hero and Malcolm McDowell, and you've got pure mindless entertainment! A quick jab at all the critics of this movie - What did you expect out of a movie called 'Doomsday', anyways?

Aside from my opinion of the movie itself, this is a shining example of what blu-ray should be! The picture is consistently sharp, colors are vivid, and I did not see a SINGLE artifact or bit of digital noise. The audio is perfect - one of the better examples of dynamic surround sound I have experienced. And no matter how loud the background sound is, the speech is perfectly balanced. The only area lacking are the extras - they are ok, but it doesn't really matter when the picture and sound are this great.

This level of quality is what I expect from blu-ray. If you are looking for a disc to show off your tv and system, this is it. Kudos to Universal for setting the standard.
