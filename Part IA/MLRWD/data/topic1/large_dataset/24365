Wow, it seems quite a few of you have some really strong negative opinions about Baby Einstein Language Nursery!  I have to say, I'm shocked!  My 10 month old daughter is just fascinated with this dvd, I've actually replayed it several times in a row for her while she was teething, because it was the ONLY thing that would make her smile!

I think that the imagery is perfect for kids of any age.  It's simple with a stark background, sure to hold a baby's attention.  When you have too much going on visually, it can detract from the learning process.

I will admit, the same as another reviewer that I did, at first, double check my language settings when I heard German with no English translation.  The songs, number counting, and rhymes are soothing, and I find myself anxious to watch the dvd with my little one.  One reviewer commented that we, as parents can't figure out what is being said.  First of all, when WE learned our native lanuages, we didn't always have a ball in front of us when someone said the word.  This is how we learn the language.  And just because us parents may not be able to translate a German nursery rhyme, doesn't mean that hearing it is entirely lost on our kids!  And it's not too difficult to figure out the difference between the German alphabet and 1-20 in Japanese.  (use your fingers, if you need to!) I've learned both from watching this video, and rekindled my love of foreign languages.  I am now studying Japanese and German, and already speak French, English, and Spanish.

This is both mine and my daughters favorite of the Baby Einstein collection, and we love them all!
