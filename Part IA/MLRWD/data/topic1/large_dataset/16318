The Core has joined the list of movies made for the big screen Dante's Peak, Volcano, Deep Impact, and Armaggedon. I like all the movies but my favorite is Deep Impact and I thought The Core would be some what like that. However, The Core was ok it had nice special affects my husband really liked the movie and it did have it's moments sad moments. No movie isn't the same without that. Then there was this big bang disaster kind of thing. But it didn't have enough of it as it should have. I mean there were a few of them but just not enough. For a moment there were scene's that looked like it would be scary and it was but then at the same time it wasn't it was just lacking so much more it seemed to me. I believe that the people who made this movie should have put more thought into it. But it was ok. It wasn't boring it was interesting. Some parts in the movie made me a bit teary eyed but that was it. All I can say is if you like natural disaster movies like I do then by all means watch the movie. If not then don't waste your time or money at the movies just wait until it comes out on pay per view or on video to rent it. As I said before my husband liked the movie so I have a feeling that we might own it to add to our collection when it comes out on video.
