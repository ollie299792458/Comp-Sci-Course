There's no question that "The Lady From Shanghai" boasts the most visually stunning final 10 or 12 minutes in the history of cinema.

The scene in the fun house, culminating in the famous hall of mirrors sequence just can't be topped, either in its imagination or its execution.  There's nothing quite like it anywhere else.

Getting there, however, is where the controversey about this film ignites.

As other reviewers have noted, the plot has more holes than a slab of swiss cheese and requires a rather serious suspension of disbelief for the viewer to go along for the ride.  Once that decision has been made, the journey is chock-full of some of Welles' most subtle touches, as well as some of his most confusing and infuriating.  A good example of the former is O'Hara's (Welles) hike up the mountain outside Rio with Grisby.

Play close attention to the people going up and down the mountain in the background and how they comment on the improbable tale that Grisby is spinning.  It's one of those sly, subtle touches that's so typical of Welles at his finest.  Also, look for Errol Flynn's walk-on in the scene outside the cantina.  Who else would cast Errol Flynn as an extra?

On the other hand, there's Rita Hayworth's song while lying flat on her back on the deck of the Bannister yacht.  The scene is as unnecessary as it is implausible, and was probably there at the studio's insistence.  But, given that the whole film was Hayworth's gift to ex-husband Welles - rather than the other way around, as Orson tells it - you never know exactly whose idea it was.

"The Lady From Shanghai" is, in the final analysis, a good example of the prodigal, rather than the prodigious, nature of Welles' genius.  While the moments of genius are so amazing that I would recommend this film to anyone, its flaws are many and confounding.

Still, you have to see it for those last 12 minutes!
