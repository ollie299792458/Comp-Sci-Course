Socialist Propaganda strikes again
Watch "the College Scam" on you-tube.  The next bubble to burst in our economy is the way over priced way over sold college degree. Government loans have driven the cost of education through the roof. Big Government and Big Colleges are are in bed together to scam you!!! The piece of paper you walk out of school with is no guarantee of a job.  This message of this movie is to sell your home, sell your SUV and put every cent you own to get that degree, no matter what the cost.  In the end you will have Julia Roberts as your honey. Yaa Right. I wonder how much of our tax money went into making this go to College propaganda movie? Well Tom and Julia, not everyone in the USA lives in the warm climate of California.  Come ride your little scooter around when it is 20 below zero and see how practical it is.  Your little scooter won't haul hay you need to feed your livestock.  So stop trying to force everyone to live the way you think they should. College is not a fix all.  Too many Colleges have become big greedy selfish socialist organizations.  Overpaid under worked professors and staff members.  One university here where I live have has an enrollment of just over 30,000 people.  The university  actually employees more than the number of students enrolled!!!!!!  The top salaries are as follows Coach $1,524,900.  Professor $1,068,960.  THAT'S RIGHT, OVER A MILLION DALLAR SALLARIES FOR PROFESSORS!!!!!!  The top 100 salaries are $488,000 up to the $1.5M dollar mark.  Ya - you go ahead and do like Larry Crowe, sell your home and everything you own so you can get a piece of paper and your professors and 30,000 employees at the University can make these kinds of salaries.  The big college scam and lie!!!  Just like all the lies the Socialist tell about what they give.  They don't give, they forcibly take!!!!!
