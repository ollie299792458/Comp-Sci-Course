Being an idolizer of Theodore Roosevelt and a Spanish American war buff, Rough Riders has been on my "Top 5 War Movies Of All Time" list ever since it came out.  That's not to say that it doesn't have some historical inaccuracies, but what movie doesn't?  I'm not a big fan of Ted Turner's politics and personal touch that he likes to throw into his movies, but what saved Rough Riders was Director John Milius (Red Dawn!).  A gun totin', cigar smokin' conservative at heart, he saved the film.  His connections with reenactment and weapons collector groups brought period weapons into the film to give us all a glimpse of what it was like.  The technical effects of war produced by Esparza-Katz (same guys who did Gettysburg) were also superb.

From the day Rough Riders aired on TNT, I was hooked.  I picked up the VHS at my local PX in 1998 and have probably watched the movie three dozen times since.  I was starting to fret when I noticed that production of the VHS had stopped.  I even transferred the movie onto a DVD because I knew a VCR would inevitably eat the tape.

God himself couldn't describe my reaction when I saw that Rough Riders was to be released on DVD; I was ecstatic.  The day it came out, I went and bought it at my local Best Buy (MUCH better retail distribution than I was expecting.  You can pick this movie up at basically any electronics store.)  Though I would've liked to have had some subtitles (as some of the script is hard to understand at times), the crisper picture and sound enhancements over the old VHS clearly make up for its shortcomings.  The director/producer commentary is also very educational.
