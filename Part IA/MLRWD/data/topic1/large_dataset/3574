For what it is this is an absolutely fabulous movie! It's intent is to be a light-hearted, funny, and engaging romantic comedy. Not a deep, brooding movie.

Kate Winslet, as always, plays her role with charm and vivacity, and identifies well with the "every day" woman. Almost equally well in this movie is the somewhat high strung and quirky movie trailer editor, played by Cameron Diaz. Jack Black plays a serious romantic interest...which I can never recall him played before, and sometimes you just burst out laughing because you know so bad he wants to make a funny face and bring some stupid comedy into the film. :) Jude Law is absolutely gorgeous as another love interest, and he does well in making the viewer fall totally in love with him.

But I don't think this movie is just for women, either. I went and saw it with my boyfriend and we were both laughing out loud for  most of the movie. Just a very charming, delightful romantic comedy, that leaves you feeling happy and satisfied at the end! :)
