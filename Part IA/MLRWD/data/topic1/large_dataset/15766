I've been exploring Jeremy Irons' work for about a year now. The Mission is one of his movies that is newest to me as a viewer despite being released when I was 4. I think Irons' is a fine actor, but often don't care for the type of men he plays. The Mission is a *positive* glaring exception. His Father Gabriel is wonderful. A man of peace, faith, and nonviolence yet he was also a just leader that led by example. Gabriel also loves people. Whether they be his brothers in the faith, the Indians he taught, or Rodrigo, the lost one that he attempts to guide.

This movie is very powerful in demonstrating the contrast between the positive aspects of mankind and the negative ones. The locations are beautiful, the story moving. The conclusion of this piece may give some pause. It certainly got me thinking and I appreciate that very much.

Seeing Liam Neeson in a minor supporting part here was a true pleasure. I found it nice to actually see Neeson and Irons working together (especially since they are 2 of my favorite UK actors). Whereas in Kingdom of Heaven, Liam and Jeremy both appear in the film but not together.

Main themes are: working past anger, forgiveness, love, conviction, and justice vs.injustice.
