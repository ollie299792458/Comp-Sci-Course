Man alive, I hate not giving Casablanca five stars. It's among my favourite films. You can't beat dialogue like that! The characters are superp, the sets and costumes are superb, Bogie is wonderful, and Bergman rips my heart out everytime she walks into Rick's Cafe Americain dressed in that gorgeous white travelling suit... And then when she starts crying!!
I can't say enough good about the movie itself, and I won't try. It's already been said, by others more eloquent than myself. But I will dare to critique the DVD, nonetheless. But only the DVD...
Full screen format??? Come on, is it that hard to put it in it's original cinematic widescreen glory??? And what about extras? An entertaining documentary hosted by Laruen Bacall is a step in the right direction, but this is CASABLANCA, MAN! What about commentary? What about photo galleries? What about featurettes, and production jazz? Put some effort into it, for Pete's sake; it's only #2 on the AFI 100, and one of the finest films ever made!! I don't want to see trailers for Key Largo, I want to see another (longer) interview with Bergman's daughter. While you're at it, Warner Brothers, give some thought to Gone With the Wind. That's even worse. All it has is a trailer, and some ridiculous trivia questions. GONE WITH THE WIND!! I hope you're planning some kind of Special Edition Anniversary Collection with hours of extras. 
Casablanca is timeless, it really is. You must buy this DVD, if only to remember the days when movies were acutally beautiful stories, not special effects extravaganzas spiced with plenty of gratuitous sex and violence. But save some pennies, because it can only be a matter of time before WB realizes it's atrocious error, and re-realeases Bogie-Bergman-Henried with the attention they deserve.
