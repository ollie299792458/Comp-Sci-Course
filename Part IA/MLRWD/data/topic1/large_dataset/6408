I thought this film was enjoyable and things played out at a steady pace, not too fast and not too slow.  Early on you develop a curiosity about the child (Dennis), who claims he's from Mars, hence the title "Martian Child".  He is pretty peculiar, choosing to spend most of his time in a cardboard box at first for fear of the sun's damaging rays and possible social interaction, wearing a weight belt made of batteries so he won't float off into space, choosing to eat only Lucky Charms cereal, thinking he has special alien abilities, and "collecting" other people's possessions, but John Cusack's character (David) sees past all of this and sees into the heart of an child unsure about the stability of his world.  David welcomes Dennis into his home and feels that adopting him is appropriate.  They have a few troubles but David handles everything with the utmost patience and understanding at a very rare level, a level not usually present in the stressed out parents common in today's society.  In the end, Dennis trusts the trustworthy David and there is a positive resolution to the movie's final climax.  This is a movie worth seeing if you love John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Amanda Peet, and Oliver Platt, but also if you are not familiar with them you will probably still want to see it if you love children and wish to see them happy.  It is a touching movie.
