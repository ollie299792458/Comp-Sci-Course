Dario Argento creates nail-biting suspense in his latest effort, 'The Card Player', about a killer who taunts cops by challenging them to an online poker game. The stakes? For each hand they lost an "appendage" is amputated and if they lose three out of five the kidnapped young woman is slaughtered on webcam! Yikes! Nice lead performances by Stefania Ross and Liam Cunningham as Italian and Irish cops who join forces (and more!) to find the killer before he strikes again. Riveting...gruesome and horrifying with Argento's signature way of combining the grisly with the glorious and making art...for example, notice the cadaver at the morgue...she is horrifying while simultaeously looking like some incredible marble statue. Fans of the director will enjoy 'The Card Player' which combines many of his signature flourishes -- gorgeous cinematography, haunting surreal sequences, intense suspense (That slow turn of cards on on on-line poker alone got me going!) and a fantastic score by Caludio Simonetti (of Goblin). Why don't more Hollywood horror directors study this guy?!
