rear window is hitchcock's vouryism film (unless you dont remember in psycho with norman bate's peep hole in cabin 1.)where everyone is shown. the people might not know this but over all we can sense that they are being watched. James Stewart over time has made me love his acting (from vertigo, rope, and other films) where he wants to explore more but is trapped by the accident which lays him in the cast. the movie is not all a myserty in the "murder" but the mystery in james stewarts life (with his job and his dating situation with grace kelly). but this is over commmed by suspicon which creates this film. hitchcock wants us to see only what james stewart sees which causes the audience not to be all knowning but curious at the characters and situtations. We tremble as we see james stewart sitting in the dark in his wheelchair looking out the window trying to direct grace kelly out of the "murders" apartment as he re entered since she was snooping. elements like that are everlasting to films and the audience. hitchcocks film rear window is a tribute to the inner selves on how they wanna know everything and will be willing to reach it by anymeans necessary. one of the top 100 films for your collection.
