This is the greatest film to come out of Italy in many years. Originally made as a miniseries for RAI TV, but you'd never know it. Works beautifully on big screen or small. Astonishingly good script, terrific acting by the four leads (Boni, Lo Cascio, Trinca, and Asti), and very nice (but not groundbreaking) directing.

'Best of Youth' is a profound political allegory in the guise of a very absorbing and deeply moving soap opera. Story follows the two Carati brothers, Nicola and Matteo, through the turbulent decades from 1966 to 2003, during which they and their friends and family experience many of the most explosive moments in Italy's recent history--the flooding of Florence, the student riots, the FIAT layoffs, the mafia wars and Red Brigade terrorism of the 80s, the restructuring of the economy, etc.--all without ever seeming too contrived. The characters of the two brothers are individualized, complex, and perfectly credible.

The first time you watch this movie, you get caught up in its very touching story full of people you come to care about very much, as if they were members of your own family. The second and third times you start to notice all sorts of parallels with modern Italian political history supported by lots and lots of subtle symbolism and carefully developed themes. From the song that plays over the opening credits to the last shot of the entire movie, everything fits together like a precision watch that keeps perfect time. The more I see this movie, the more impressed I am with it. Here it is months later and I'm still thinking about it. I don't say this very often about a movie, but...this one is AMAZING.
