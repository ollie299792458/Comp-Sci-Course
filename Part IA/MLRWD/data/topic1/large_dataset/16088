The two films cut together would have been the way to go in my opinion. Heck as one 4 hour epic it may have been noticed by the Academy Awards just for being so incredibly unique. We all know the reason Miramax films released two movies instead of one. YOUR MONEY TIMES TWO! Since I respect Miramax due to hundreds of quaility films, I'll let them stiff me this once. Quentin Tarantino is an amazing filmmaker, I love all his films. The ones he wrote and directed anyway. Some of the screenplays he wrote in the past were directed by others than himself. Which they were mostly cool flicks, but they might have been better had he made them himself. The reason I say this film isn't for everyone is because I have a part time job in a video store and I hear some people say how they just don't get into it. They say they didn't like the first Kill Bill and they aren't interested in bothering with the 2nd. I did get a customer to get both films and have a double feature. He later said it was one of the best film experiences he'd ever had. At first he wasn't interested in the series. Truthfully these two films together are an amazing piece of work and it's ashame to over look them. I'm not saying get the kids rounded up and have family movie night with Kill Bill, that's obvious. I hope people know that this isn't for children. It is great entertainment for grown ups who like deep, dark and dramatic sword swinging action with plenty of Tarantio style humor. So, watch'em together or watch'em seperate.. just watch'em!! One last thing ..Uma Thurman is in a word.. Astonishing!!
