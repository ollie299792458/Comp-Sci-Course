I am a Reese Witherspoon fan.  I enjoy her work and many of the other cast members in this fiasco.  It was fun to see Natasha Little in this version after doing such a wonderful job as Beckie in the BBC production.  I read a review of the new movie a week ago, and thought I would go with an open mind.  IT CAN'T POSSBILY BE THAT BAD!

For those of you who have read William Makepeace Thackeray's masterpiece of human nature, deceptions, schemes, and manipulation be prepared for disapointment. Beckie is generally kind and creates a minimal amount of mischief.  The movie didn't project much of her cold calculation and planning.  It was almost as if Beckie's character was a do-gooder or a happen-chance stair climber.  The couple of things carried out well were Beckie showing her "plucky" nature and George Osborne playing a snobby jerk (in fact, I was eager for his demise!).  But the entire relationship between Amelia and Dobbins is almost an after thought.  You can almost see the writer saying "Oh right, they get together in the end - how am I going to squeeze that in!  Let's do that here."

I am sure most of this sad representation is because directors have to limit a movie to less than 3 hours.  So in turn, the all of the emotions you should feel - the ones where you are rooting for Dobbins, or want to kick Beckie, Rawdon, Pitt, or think, eesh, Ameila get a clue - throughout the movie are lost in this version of this classic.  Go buy the BBC version (available on Amazon and A&E) and have a better evening at home.
