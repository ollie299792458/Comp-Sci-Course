The nice thing about the director's cut is that right away they let you know the movie was made for about $23,000 and the production (film quality) is on the lowside. But, besides that the movie is really good. It shows how someone who has hit the low part of their life can turn themselves around and become a trustworthy person again. Jay Austen is a man who owns a used car lot. All he wants to do is make money to keep his family afloat, but his cheap standards (over pricing vehicles) are hurting everyone. He neglects his son, and fights regularly with his wife, until both son and spouse can't stand him. It does tend to go into faith very strongly at one point, almost to quickly. It seems there could be a slighter buildup to the character (Jay) deciding that faith is what he really needs. Though this scene shouldn't be a deterent because the movie is really good. Once Jay decides to become more truthful to his family, job and customers, the true power of faith is revealed. This company has also made the slightly better movie "Facing the Giants".
