This is a truly inspiring movie, definitely underrated.

1) The acting is first rate.  Kevin Kline was born for this part and shines.  He articulates the drive and determination of Hundert perfectly. The young actors are also phenomenal and this is a breakout film for many of them:  Emile Hirsch is everywhere now; Paul Dano is rising up as is Jesse Eisenberg (who was just in the Squid and the Whale).

2) James Newton Howard's score to the film is very engaging and definitely makes the pivotal scenes that much more powerful.

3) The theme is centered on character.  Shutruk-Nahhunte is not known of today because he gave back nothing.  He just did for himself and contributed nothing to society.  Sedgewick "is" Nahhunte.  Though on the outside, he seems successful, Sedgewick will probably not contribute much to the good of others.  The other historical people in Hundert's curriculum are people who gave back or contributed something to their respective societies.  They are remembered because they left a good legacy on life.  It is hinted that the other students will go on to leave similar legacies, while Sedgewick will not.  (Though in the deleted scenes you see how the director was trying to make this more evident; it just didn't flow well.)

4) As a teacher, this is a favorite of mine and perhaps that biases my review. (In a good way, bad way, who knows)?  I have shown parts of this film in class with very positive reactions from my students.  The film is unique; it shows the main characters young, and then shows how they end up later in life.  Kids are always thinking about how they'll end up and I think they appreciate that aspect of the film especially.  I also think it also shows kids that they can have fun in life, but should also be thinking of what their contribution to the world will be.  We all should.
