This episode was not a highlight of the second season. It was the A team meets themselves the B team and then wins the fistfight. Role credits. It was one would guess about time someone would gang up on main heroes. A mercenary is hired. Hired a million dollars per A Team member to remove them. Someone is getting milked when we get to see how bad a merceneary the hired guy is. The main gun is Ed Lauter,  from a season one show. He is not a believable killer in any way. However, Melinda Culea's replacement Marla Heasley shows her believability in acting by doing a fine job of milking here part that has her taking pictures of some cows. Wonder why they let her go her at the end of the season. Just plain weaker than usual plod (no typo) that opens with Team supposedly in training. This was actually funny. They get picked off one by one by mercernearies which carries the suspense of a milk commerical. Hannibal is tougher and survives the spedative spiked milk, gets back on his horse with medical help to chew up the villains in an exciting fist fight finale. Pretty forgettable. The main characters all seemed somewhat muted. The one highlight was a gorgeous Tricia O'neil making another appearance as Doc Sullivan although they call her Maggie instead of Mo from the season 1 show.  To bad she was in this so little. Too bad the writers  could not have featured her as a more recurrung guest.  Her backstory was vietnam medic and she would have fit in. (But then there was Peppards oft spoken penchant for feeling women had no major place in this kind of show).  Both Lauter and O'neill were in the the Black Rock epsisode. At least there,  Ed Lauter was believable and O'neill who is always great had not much more than seven or eight short lines.

On a trivia note, Barbara Stock from Spenser for Hire, Dallas, pops in as a seductive vixen.)  Not one of this series stellar efforts.
