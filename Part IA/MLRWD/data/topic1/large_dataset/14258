This has to be the best anime and best vampire movie I have ever seen.  PERIOD!!  First off, the animation is just out of this world, it is leaps and bounds ahead of anything I've seen except maybe Ghost in the Shell.  It was just so crisp and clean.  Second, I have never seen a movie where the music just fit so perfectly.  I literally had goose bumps at some parts.  Third, the story is great.  Now like others have said it does have a few parts that you sorta have to quess on what's happened or how it's happening but it's nothing too major.  Fouth, The characters are just great and have real personaltiys and their not just cookie cutter.  Now on some of the other reviews people have said how they prefer the japanese voices and that they were dissapointed that they aren't in the movie.  Well guys I hate to break it to you but there aren't any japanese voices.  The voices for the characters were all done here in the states and the movie was never done in japanese that is why you can't have japanese dubbing.  I personally don't think the voices could have been done better, they just fit every chracter.  So all of you that don't own this movie go out and buy it right now!!!!!
