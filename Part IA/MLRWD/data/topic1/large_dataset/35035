This film is not the best, nor is it even remotely oscar worthy, but it's a fun little film. If you enjoyed the "Sister Act" and "The Preacher's Wife" then you will love this movie.

I have been a fan of Dolly Parton's music since I could remember and was anxious to see what kind of chemistry she would have with Queen Latifah. I must say that the two women really have a good chemistry, and I would love to see them in more movies together.

The film itself has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard before. I knew of Queen Latifah as a rapper, but did not know that she had a beautiful singing voice. She really shines here as does Dolly, who wrote some of the songs for the film.

As I said in my review of the soundtrack, the true stars are Keke Palmer and Jeremy Jordan. I absolutely love their duet on Paul McCartney's "Maybe I'm Amazed". And Ms. Palmer totally sings her heart out on "Man In The Mirror".

Joyful Noise is a movie that will make you feel good. It features good performances, awesome music and won't set you back too much. Enjoy.
