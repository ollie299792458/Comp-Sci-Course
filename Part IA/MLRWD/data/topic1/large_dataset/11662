Charles M. Schulz, creator of the Peanuts strip went through a divorce around 1972 when this film was released and I wonder how much it colored Schulz while making this dark little film.  Snoopy searches for greener pastures and leaves poor Charlie Brown and his gang for a former owner, Lila.  I cried buckets when I saw it in theaters in 1972 and it's not much easier to take now.  Few laughs and constructed more like a mystery, it can be hard to take if you are old enough to understand what is going on.  Even the songs have lyrics like, "Why must we pay for hellos that we say?"  If you are a child and just like to watch Snoopy and the gang, then it's fine but watching someone lose their pet is pretty rough and even the happy ending barely redeems what we went through in the first half.  More tragedy than comedy, this entry into the Peanuts adventures.  It's presented widescreen as it was made for theatrical release.  Even so, Peanuts captured the hearts of Americans and for me, it's a love that will last a lifetime which is why I bought it but if you've never seen it before, be warned that it is anything but lighthearted.
