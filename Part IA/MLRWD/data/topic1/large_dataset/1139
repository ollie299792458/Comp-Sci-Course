We saw "Meet the Robinsons" in the 3-D version at the theater and my kids laughed about it for days.  Too bad they couldn't release the DVD in the 3-D version, but it's still an excellent film for children.  Personally, I also loved hearing the voice of Adam West in the film.

The film is based loosely on William Joyce's, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060890983">A Day with Wilbur Robinson</a>. If you haven't read the book, I highly recommend it. William Joyce ALSO was the artist behind Rolie Polie Olie series. The book is quite different from the film, but there are direct parallels. For instance, there is no orphanage theme in the original book and no Bowler Hat Guy.  However, many of the other characters are present in both.  Stylistically, the book and the movie have a pronounced retro- animation/cartoon feel to them.  It is a very refreshing artistic style to watch and makes for a unique animated film.

The DVD contains a fairly extensive set of features, but nothing out of the ordinary.  For future releases of children's videos, I'd suggest adding a reading of the original book.  In the few DVD's we've purchased with this feature, it's encouraged my children to read the actual book.

I highly recommend this DVD for your child's video library. It's a film enjoyable by both adults and children.  The film is funny and presents a very clear message about the need to celebrate our human differences and stresses the importance of family and friends(adopted or otherwise).
