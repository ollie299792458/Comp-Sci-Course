Forget Matthew Broderick!  This Japanese movie has the REAL Godzilla that those of us who were kids in the 60s grew up with and love, as well as the familiar Godzilla music and themes.  In the spirit, presumably, of "Independence Day" this movie spoofs a number of famous scf-fi classics such as:  Independence Day, War of the Worlds, Superman, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Alien, and especially, Twister.  A disillusioned young Japanese scientist has resigned from his academic career to found the "Godzilla Prediction Network", which he runs with the help of his smart as a whip (approximately) 10 year old daughter.  They are joined by a young, ambitious, Japanese woman journalist who believes that they can help her advance her career with a scoop about Godzilla.  Meanwhile, the Japanese government has discovered a giant meteor at the bottom of the sea and attempts to raise it.  Well, you can well imagine what's gonna happen.  I predict that traditional Godzilla fans will enjoy this movie.
