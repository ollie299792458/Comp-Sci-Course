I recognized "Amadeus" as a masterpiece when I first saw it in its original theatrical release. When the film came to VHS, I bought it immediately. When I recently began building my DVD library, I was at first excited to see a full-featured widescreen version of the film.
The only drawback to this version is that the "restored footage" (a/k/a deleted scenes) adds nothing to the film; in fact, it slows the film's pace significantly, frankly insults the intelligence of the viewer by assuming we didn't "get it" from the originally presented scenes, and includes a (thankfully brief) gratuitous nude scene.
This is not the first time I have been disappointed in the "director's cut" DVD..."The Last of the Mohicans" was the same way. Chingachgook's final monologue in the original film gets extended far too long and loses all of its potency.
If the creators REALLY wanted to provide viewers with an optimal experience (and this goes for ALL DVDs released with the phrase "Director's Cut"), the ORIGINAL widescreen version of the film should be included on the DVD, along with the director's cut. Just as some DVDs include both the full-screen (yecchhh!) and widescreen versions, why not include an original widescreen with the director's cut?
Otherwise, the "director's cut" label ends up being just an homage to directorial ego.
