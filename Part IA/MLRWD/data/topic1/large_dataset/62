This is a Powell and Pressburger classic.  Made in 1944, it is set in Kent and partly in Canterbury.  The effects of the Baedeker Blitz on Canterbury in 1942 are vividly and movingly shown.  The film must have been wonderful propaganda at the time but it is also profound, being a re-working of one of Chaucer's `Canterbury Tales' in modern dress.  The Tale itself is a little quirky, but modern events which surround it provide the makers of the film with the opportunity to comment cinematically on the eternal verities, the continuities in English life, and the similarities (as well as the differences) between England and America.  I presume it was principally intended to boost morale here; but I imagine it would also have worked well in the USA.

What does the film say to us now (2011)?  The Kent countryside has probably changed more in the last 60 years than it did in the previous 600; and much of what we see and hear has now changed; but the Cathedral is still there; and the various `miracles' which occur at the end of the film are relevant to everyone, in all ages.

The film is in black and white but the images are very striking.  I did think it was about half an hour too long.
