This is a two-disc package that includes an extra disc of special features that really gives a fuller picture of what this groundbreaking concert meant to the performers and to the audience at the time, because the special features include straight-to-the-point interviews, and they give you the sense of what an immense undertaking this concert was for George Harrison and how important it was for all involved (and for the world, because he really showed how every person can use their resources to make a positive impact if they have sincere good intentions).  Also, if you have seen the video version of this concert you will be greatly pleased by the quality of the sound and the visuals.  Some of the things that really jump out at you are Billy Preston's enormous talent (which The Beatles and Rolling Stones recognized, having brought him in as a keyboard player on occasion), Leon Russell's natural rock n' roll artistry (he really fills the room and brings a pure shot of rock n' roll joy to the intense proceedings), and most of all, there's George, whose exquisitely structured guitar style provides an understated yet dominant framework to the music.  Also, this is the best live performance I've ever seen by Bob Dylan, who shines while blending in perfectly with the seriousness of the matter at hand (remember, he played at Martin Luther King's "I Had a Dream" speech at the march on Washington, D.C. - he always seems to be there when it counts).
