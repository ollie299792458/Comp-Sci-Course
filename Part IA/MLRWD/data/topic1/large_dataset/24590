I thoroughly enjoyed the 7up series.  I started at 7up and watched about one disc every 1-2 weeks until I recently finished 42up.  I have been increasingly fascinated as I have worked my way through the series.  There is something about watching another person's life, that has been fascinating for me.  Especially at a moment where I myself am constantly thinking about where I want to be and where I want to go.  Very thought provoking.  At the end, you will feel like you have something invested in the future of these people.

I particularly found the changes from 21 to 28 to be the most pivotal and defining.  This seems to be the point where most of them really branched out into adulthood.  For those people that haven't seen the 7-21 series, they are definitely worth watching.  There is a lot of editing as the series progresses.  Watching the earlier shows in their entirety allows the viewer to be more involved in the life of the individuals and understand their background better.

All in all...Great series.  Groundbreaking, interesting, and thought provoking.  Highly recommended.
