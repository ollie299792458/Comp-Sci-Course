A group of scientists are asked by a priest to analyze the contents of a container, filled with a swirling liquid, in the basement of an old church. However once the origin of the liquid is revealed, this group of people (now trapped inside the building) has to stay alive and try to change the course of the future in order to prevent the apocalypse as each member is possessed by the power of the liquid.
Right from the start, Carpenter sets a tense tone for the movie. He introduces the viewer to the scientists as he also shows us how the priest discovers the container. The excitement never lets down for a moment and is kept alive by interesting (but easy to understand) scientific comments, small signs of the apocalypse, some interesting theories about the nature of evil and then traditional scare. 
Like most of Carpenter's films, PoD is filled with fresh and creative ideas and solid directing &amp; cinematography. Several unforgetable scenes stand out in the film: Particularly, the "dreams" that scientists experience during their stay and the usage of mirror as a passage way to the "other side".  Overall, an excellently made, intelligent horror movie. Highly recommended.
