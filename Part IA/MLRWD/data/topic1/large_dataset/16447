I'm not a fan of Steven Spielberg. About L. DiCaprio, well some of his movies are among my most hated (particularly Titanic, of course), yet I can't hate him as an actor because there are some others that I have enjoyed (ex. Marvin's Room).
  About this one, I must say that I ejoyed it from the opening credits (they are so good that a special prize called "Best Opening Credits" should have been created specially for this occasion) until the end.  What I like about this movie is that it shows an interesting story (adaptation of a true story) without being too pretentious (which is one of the main problems I find in Spielberg - ex. Artificial Intelligence) or too sentimental; and mainly, because Spielberg uses no aliens, monsters, dinosours or sharks.  Well, I'm not telling much about the movie, but I'll say that eventhough this movie won't change film history, it made me feel so good about it as to give it five stars (yeah, why less?).  In my opinion it is DiCaprio's and Spielberg's best.
