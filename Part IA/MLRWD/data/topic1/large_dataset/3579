After buying all of the golden collection sets, which were lovingly restored and presented in their original aspect ratio, I was astounded when I popped in this disc and found that the top and bottom of the picture was cropped to make it widescreen! I checked the back of the box and found the verbiage "Standard version presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of their original theatrical exhibition."

I did a little research and apparently, in the mid-50s, the studio began formatting their cartoons so that they could be matted for theaters who wanted to show them in widescreen, which had become popular by then. They were still produced in the 4:3 aspect ratio though, so by showing them in widescreen, we are missing much of the original image.

I just hope that when they restored these, they restored the entire image. It would be a crime if the top and bottom were not touched in the restoration process because I doubt they'll ever go back to them for further restoration.
