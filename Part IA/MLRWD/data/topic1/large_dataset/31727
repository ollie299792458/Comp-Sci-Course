I hurt my knee!  Never have I done a workout video in the past where right in the middle of a section I get a shooting pain through my left knee!  I've done plenty of videos and reviewed a handful on Amazon.  I have mentioned that in the past I had an ankle issue that I was working through and the beginning signs of carpal tunnel from years of working in physical therapy (the sad part is that I'm not that old - at all!), but other than minor things I've never experienced a shooting pain (or much of any pain) in my knee(s) while working out until the cardio section of this video!  There is a lot of jumping and twisting and some lunges, but normally that wouldn't bother me.  I wanted to do a total body workout so I did all the sections alternating between the amp it ups and the toning.  Unfortunately, I went from the warm up right into the cardio portion and that's where I hurt my knee.  I did all of the other sections except the lower body (didn't want to put the strain on my knee) and the slow amp it up section and the rest was alright.  I was pleased that there were no push ups because those always bother my wrists.  The "yoga" section was a little hard on them but manageable.  I'm just bummed about the knee thing.  I'll take a couple of days off and I should be alright, but I can't give this any more than two stars because of the injury.  I do like that you can customize your workout (even though that seems to come standard with many workouts now), but I found the instructor to be fairly boring.  I didn't think she was all that motivating and actually, she was pretty bland.  It gets 1 star for the customizing part and 1 star for not relying on push ups.  It loses a star because of the instructor and 2 because I was injured.
