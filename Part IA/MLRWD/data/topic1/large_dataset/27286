Loved it! When will they release season 2?

Too bad James McAvoy is only on it for 13 episodes which is Season 1 & 2, he is a pretty strong character and of course a hot Scot. Loved him in Rory O'Shea Was Here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNV9">Rory O'Shea Was Here</a>

I discovered this show either via Amazon or Netflix, both great sources to find recommendations of shows and movies you never heard of, and thanks to Netflix, only place to rent British films and shows, etc. to see if you really like them. My favorites I buy to share with others or because I fear they will one day not be available.

This is really not a review, everybody else has said pretty much what needed to be said.

An American version of Shameless, hmm, doesn't sound good without McAvoy and the Brits are better at it.

I don't like the American version of The Office, never heard of American version of Coupling, American version of Fawlty Towers didn't work either, the main character seemed snobby rather than quirky.

Maybe only in the 70's they could do it properly, or maybe it is because those who are doing the remakes aren't big enough fans to care enough to do it properly, they just throw it all together and choose all the wrong actors.
