I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a very long time. I saw it on TNT, recently, and went right out and purchased the DVD and the soundtrack. It was funny, light, and very entertaining. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton were wonderful, as usual. However, I enjoyed the fine performances by Amanda Peet and Keanu Reeves, as well. Frances MacDormand had a small part but added to the fine cast.

Diane Keaton plays,Erica Barry, a divorced mother of an adult child who is a very successful playwright and lives in upscale Hampton.

Jack Nicholson plays,Harry Sanborn, the owner of a hip hop label called "Drive By". He enjoys dating much younger women and was dating Erica Barry's daughter, Marin, previously. He has a hard time committing to any relationship and suffers from multiple "heart attacks".

Amanda Peet plays, Marin, Erica Barry's 30 year old daughter who also suffers from committing in a relationship. She was previously dating Harry and brings him to her mother's Hampton beach house for a little romp when Harry suffers from a near fatal heart attack.

Keanu Reeves plays, Dr. Julian Mercer, who is the emergency doctor who cares for Harry after his heart attack. It is at this time that he meets and falls in love with Erica Barry with whom he has a relationship with before she dumps him for Harry, a more age appropriate companion for her.

Frances MacDormand plays,Zoe, Erica's sister who encourages the relationship between her sister and Julian.

Erica writes a play based on her relationship with Harry which ends with the two of them (along with Julian) in Paris. It was the French music and the scenes of Paris that helped make this romantic movie so endearing.

I enjoyed seeing a movie about two mature adults falling in love. It was a pleasure to see a movie that showed that it is still possible to fall in love at any age.

This movie is well worth seeing and the price is right, too.
