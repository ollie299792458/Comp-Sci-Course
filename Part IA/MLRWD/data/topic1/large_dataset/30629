His name is Jan. Her name is Bess. How and when they met is unexplained. It doesn't matter. She wants to marry him even if her religious community disapproves. It happens and then begins a whirlwind of events which sets her life spiraling out of control. Jan goes away to sea only to return paralyzed. Depressed because he is unable to make love again, he makes a pact with his young bride. Go and have sex with other men. Tell me about and I will live. Who but Satan would make such a pact to an innocent naive woman child?
  Breaking the Waves is a brilliant story detailing the chapters of Bess's life as she tries to live up to the pact of the man that she truly loves. This picture can be interpreted on many levels of good and evil. Our setting is a place that is cold and brutal. Its people follow suit. Forgiveness, love and joy are foreign words in her small religious sect. Repression, being strong and doing one's duty are their gods.
  You will also find a heavy display of sexism and control of women in the movie. These episodes range from the elders of the church, Jan, the doctor and the sailors. All feel the need to contain the voice of women. Bess can't shut up. She is to good. Her determination to please out of a sense of helping the one she loves defies all logic. Her role playing as god's voice is harsh at times and very judgemental but through that playing she is able to bring some sense to her situation. Bess steps into a world of madness in her attempts to please and be that good girl?  
  The cast of characters did a fine job in weaving together a story that is surreal and highly complex. Such a psychological drama challenges women to claim their own voice. It was magnificently done. Enter into the mind of this woman and see if you too can turn out whole.
