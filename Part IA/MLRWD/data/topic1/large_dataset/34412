This is a typically excellent Afred Hitchcock movie. Unfortunately I purchased mine from a 3rd party vendor in the US  through Amazon along with Notorious. These products originate, as they are stamped on the back of the boxes, from a company in Taiwan. They ship with Taiwanese subtitles which you have to turn off. The main menu is in Taiwanese but you cannot turn it back to English so this makes all your DVD settings useless. The US vendor's comment when I complained was to turn off the Taiwanese.....don't quite understand that. When I put in for a refund, the vendor said to ship the two back to them, me to pay the shipping. This is a long standing problem which has been found on products Amazon handles through 3rd parties. The last one I bought was one called Rome Adventure which had the same problem but the quality on that one was so poor, that you could hardly view the movie. I read on Amazon that 3:10 from Yuma originally had the same problem. It had a Chinese train on the front of the box with Chinese flags on it. Amazon's Dispute Resolution appears to have worked for one of them but not both. Stay away from these vendors. This vendor had a selling percentage of 97%.
