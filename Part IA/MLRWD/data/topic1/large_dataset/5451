My husband and I don't see a lot of movies and have no patience for below average ones.  (We are known to walk out of many, last one being the last Star Wars movie - what is it with Lucas, they've been getting cheesier and cheesier).  We both felt that this movie was one of the best devil movies we've seen.  Loved the story, and you know good overcomes evil, yeah... but you never really see the end coming, never have expectations for what happens.  I love that in a movie, it's really hard to achieve.  Having had no experience with the comic led me to have no unrealistic expectations with the movie.  I saw this movie in the theaters and when on a plane and given the option to see it again saw it a second time.  I eventually want to purchase this one too.  Really, as far as acting it was well done, as far as special effects, excellent.  These types of devil movies can be cheesy and stupid, but this one rose above the norm.  If you saw that other devil movie-- Keanu, Charlize Theron

 and Al Pacino (the name escapes me) and liked it, you'll definely like this one.
