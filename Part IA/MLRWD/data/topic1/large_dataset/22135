I fell in love with this show during its original airing, and now that it's on DVD I can watch it as clearly as I did in the early nineties.  I enjoy at least as much, maybe more, now that I'm not gawking single-mindedly at Jonathan Brandis.  Okay, I still am, but for different reasons.  We appreciate things most when we no longer have them, and Jonathan was an amazing talent.  I miss him, as I know all of his fans do.

"SeaQuest DSV" is more than underwater "Star Trek".  It's a vision of what we in the early nineties dreamed the twentieth century might be like, a world of incredible scientific advances, a place where we could speak to dolphins, make contact with extraterrestrials, explore the deepest places of the world.  Like "Star Trek" in its various incarnations, it's a vision of hope for what we might accomplish if we can all just begin to work together.

The writing, though some may find it a bit dated now, holds up incredibly well over time, as do most of the effects.  The characters are well-rounded and fascinating, from the nervous O'Neill (who went on to be the mighty Joxer of "Xena: Warrior Princess") to the devious Krieg to the frustrated genius Lucas, and leading them is the wise father-figure Captain Nathan Bridger, who holds his crew together as a family and contributes his gentle wisdom to every exciting adventure.

This show is intelligent and absorbing, as much now as it ever was.  Beneath the surface, still, lies the future.
