I think I've seen "Flashdance" at least 20 times to date, considering I saw it in the theaters dozens of times when it came out in '83.  I watched it again recently and I never seem to tire of it.  I guess by now it holds a special place in my heart, a sort of sentimental movie that brings me back to my younger years.  I can practically recite the whole movie.  The music is fantastic of course.  My favourite scenes are when Alex and her boss are being romantic and the song "Lady" is playing, and also when Alex is riding her bike home on a rainy night and the boss is following her home.  Talk about romantic.  The dancing in the movie is also fabulous.  I liked all the numbers they did at the bar, Tina Tech rocked the house!!!  I also like the fashion in "Flashdance".  It started alot of trends, sort of that nu-wave grunge thing.  Jennifer Beals did a fantastic job in this film, and so did the rest of the cast.  Flashdance still rocks so get out that old cut off sweater, put on a headband and watch the coolest dance movie of all time.
