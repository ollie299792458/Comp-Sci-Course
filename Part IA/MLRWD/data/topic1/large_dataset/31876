Very few movies go on my list. While I enjoy a myriad of types, I will always go for the movie that focuses on people. Amadeus is just one of those movies that are just awesome! Despite being one that I saw so many decades ago..

I don't know anything about music. I attempted piano for 10 years. Just not in my genes. I don't get music.. and I stink at it! But the storyline that unfolds in this movie concerning the life of Mozart is just engaging. How much truth is in this movie I don't know. They are missing the part where his mother goes with him as he develops (if you read his true life). But this movie delves into one of the human emotion: jealousy. It also tackles an issue that is very relevant to modern society, the good versus the bad. I think for its time it was way ahead! There was a time when good versus bad was black and white. In this movie, it projects that people are shades of grey. Even the best have their dark moments.. and even the person who has always done right can be overcome with negative emotions. This movie has done a fine job at telling us just that.. people are not really good/bad.. they just need the proper environment to display their real selves. The implications of this movie is many.. and what you get out of it can be an interesting conversation :). Enjoy!
