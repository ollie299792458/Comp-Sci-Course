If you're a fan of Rob Zombie's other films *House of 1,000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects, and Halloween*, I honestly can't see any reason why you wouldn't like this movie as well. The weird visions/dreams that Laurie Strode receives are very reminiscent of HO1C, it has the gritty look and feel of Devil's Rejects, and it takes the characters from the previous Halloween and instead of retreading the same story again, Zombie puts them into something entirely new and uncharted that was never attempted in the John Carpenter originals. Yes, it's extremely brutal and violent, but, it IS a horror movie, and a Rob Zombie one to boot, so what did you really expect out of it? Zombie said from the get-go that he set out to take the Halloween story and make it his own vision, which is exactly what he's accomplished with his two entries into this franchise. It's not high art, nor does it set out to be. It's a pure escapist, pop-corn genre flick, much in the vein of the exploitation movies that Mr. Zombie was weened on, and I applaud him for making it in such a fashion.
