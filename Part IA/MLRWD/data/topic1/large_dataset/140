I saw the original release in a theater in 1981, and I am dissapointed in the current "R" release.  It has been censored to make it sellable in family video stores like Blockbuster.  The original love scene was the hottest I have ever witnessed in any film, mainstream or X-rated.  It had a long slow pan showing William Hurt's arm around her thigh and holding her breast, so you could guess exactly where his face was.  Her breathing was so realistic, you could almost feel what she was feeling.  As she comes, all you see is her hand gripping the carpet.  The filming, and Kathleen Turner's acting is pure genius to capture that much passion, and all done with the power of suggestion, no explicit shots.  It's really a shame that original scene has been replace with a fairly conventional, missionary position love scene.  I was hoping there was a separate "director's cut" edition somewhere, but I have not been able to find it.
Other than the toned-down sex scenes, it's a pretty good mystery-thriller, so I'll give it a three.
