Quite possibly the best giallo-thriller I have ever seen, Dario Argento's "Deep Red" (aka "The Hatchet Murders") is an excellent  entry to any horror fan's collection.  The film begins with Helga, a gifted  psychic, who senses the presence of a murderer in the audience of one of  her conventions.  She soon learns the identity of the killer and, before  she can tell anyone, she is brutally murdered.  David Hemmings' character  is witness to her murder and (along with a beautiful reporter) tries to  solve the mystery and identity of the killer.  Along with  "Suspiria", this is Argento's most popular film, even though the  two are very different.  "Deep Red" lacks the supernatural  touches and fairly thin plot of "Suspiria", making it (in my  opinion) better.  Even though I do not find "Deep Red" as  terrifying as "Suspiria", it is still engrossing and  entertaining.  Nonetheless, Dario Argento's superb direction is very  evident in both films; but I think most people would enjoy "Deep  Red" much much more.
