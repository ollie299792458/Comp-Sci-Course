3 x 3 eyes may not have the slick sleek computer anime that has drawn many people to the genre, and they haven't re-released it digitized and re-done, which I think is just as well. While it is all drawn old school hand work, it's amazing the amount of expression that can be conveyed, even in just a simple screen still.

I originally caught the last half of the series on cable many years ago and have searched for it for some time. I'd not even seen the first part until I found a fan sub on the web, and decided the heck with it, I would sink the money to get it.  I'm disabled and don't have much money, so this was actually a considerable investment for me.

There are plot holes and such, and i gather the manga was more complete and cleared all that, but the overall essense of the story can be easily followed, and as I said, it may be old school style animation, but some of the expression drawn into the art is more than worth it.

Very creative, and an intersting weaves of oountries, religions, and belief systems hooked into modern day era.

I will agree it's definitely not a series for younger kids to see, not so much for sex or nudity, but it's pretty gory. Yakumo gets dismembered, maimed, or barfs up enough blood for three people about every episode, but if you aren't particularly squeamish (which I'm not) the storyline, the hand art and series will hook you and draw you in, if you have appreciation for such things.
