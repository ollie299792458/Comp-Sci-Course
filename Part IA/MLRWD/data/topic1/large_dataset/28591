don't listen to maltin. this film is superb. this makes me also think of that great chase scene in Bullitt. This one is much better though. Bullitt's chase scene last a relatively short time compared to the one in gone in sixty seconds. I like this one better. It's got some nice music to compliment the stellar chase sequence good dtunts(especially at the end of the film with the scene entitled "big jump" which i will always cherish) i love that nicely made 1973 souped up Ford Mach 1 Mustang. i really don't like yellow cars but this one oh baby.
  here's the scoop a pro car thief makes a deal to steal 48 nicely made exotic and high performance vehicles. The most dangerous one is of course "Eleanor" the yellow mustang which is nicely made. After him and his car thieving gang get every car except one eleanor there starts the problem. the gang almost gets caught with stealing other cars beforehand leading to police suspicion and careful watch over other cars. In fact the second an el dorado gets into the station and it is discovered to be full of heroin a detective comes knocking at there door! They barely manage to get out of that situation and there comes the chase scene the fanous 93 cars totalled in 40 minutes. man that's good!the film might have faltered right here but instead it works to perfection. how they did it i'll never know. Definitely one of the top action films ever made.
