To judge by the majority of Amazon reviews,  Daniel Deronda was seriously appreciated much more than not, which is certainly as it should be.  On the ImdB, however, there are some opinions, mostly about the ultimate developments of the story, which I find disturbing.  I will give nothing of the plot away, except to say that the DVD ends the way the book ends, and why is this so unacceptable?
Phil Gramm got in trouble for calling the U.S. a nation of whiners.  Since I have no position to lose, political or otherwise, I am deciding not to learn from Phil's gaffe and am now giving my take, which is, actually, we are a nation of ILLITERATE whiners.

George Eliot developed her story for a reason, and I am just gullible enough to think that Eliot knew well what she was doing.

I am wondering if the people who complain about the outcome of Daniel Deronda are the same people who travel to Europe and instead of absorbing what European culture has to offer they complain about the drinks not having any ice.

A final unrelated opinion:  Jodhi May (who plays Mirah) has a wonderful, understated quality in everything I've seen her in.  She's an outstanding performer, and my guess is she's a quite interesting and pleasant individual in real life.

Yes, this is more a soapbox than an actual review, but since I'm the 62nd person to write I'm sure there are enough traditional reviews available here.
