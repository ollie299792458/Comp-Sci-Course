I was personally intrigued to watch this movie, having myself gone through recently having a friend who revealed that he wanted to become a woman. His fears were lived in not knowing how any of his friends would accept him during this process. He was my roommate, and so i lived with him as he went on this journey. It was a challenge for me to personally understand and attempt to lovingly encourage some of the changes he wanted to make.
All of my own fears, hesitations, problems with people's hatred towards the transgender community were addressed in this film. Felicity Hauffman, was convincing in this role, and the young guy who plays her son... powerful, sometimes disturbing yet beautiful acting.
This movie is not for the faint of heart. There is some scenes of graphic nudity, graphic language that depicts sexual abuse, and it holds few bars on being polite about the realistic emotional journey of the family going through life with a transgender person. That said, there is a beauty...a maturity... that resonates thru the film that tells a story, and gives a timeless message. Love, in its truest form, has no conditions. I highly recommend this film for all that would open their hearts and minds, set aside their issue with this subject, and see a very honest point of view they may not share, but at the end of the day maybe come to peace with.
