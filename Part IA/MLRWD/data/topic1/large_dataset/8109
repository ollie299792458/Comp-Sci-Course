Save your money, and avoid this DVD like the plague. It's another snake-oil-salesman attempt at cheating you out of your money. This 1968 version of Night of the Living Dead was NOT shot in 3-D.

This is 2-D to 3-D conversion of this 2-D movie, and probably the WORST conversion I've ever seen. I bought this DVD and watched the 3-D, hoping for fun. But, it is mostly flat 2-D that has just been pushed a couple inches straight back -- there's no 3-D form to anything. It's completely bogus.

This movie is classic black & white horror and well worth watching, without the extra eye strain of fake 3-D. Buy a normal DVD version.

The original version of this movie is a classic, and you can find it on DVD (ASIN: B00005Y6Y2, and many others) in a clean new digital re-mastering, with extras. Or, you can buy it in a double feature DVD, along with Carnival Of Souls, another classic black & white horror movie, for double the enjoyment (ASIN: B00005Y6Y2).

Night Of The Living Dead has also been remade (more than once) ... Most recently in 2006 and actually shot in real 3-D (not the fake '3-D' on this eye straining DVD). This 3-D remake version of Night Of The Living Dead 3D (2006) is available also on DVD (ASIN: B000TXPXC8 ). It was released theatrically in anaglyph 3-D, using red/cyan 3-D glasses. Though, it did have it's premiere showing using nicer polarized projection at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. So, look for a field sequential version of it, if you are a 3-D fan and own LCS shutter glasses already.

Which ever way you want to see this classic movie -- this fake 3-D DVD is the worst!
