Let's get down to basics, the movie is never as good as the book, we all know that.  So let's not compare 'The Company' to its over-sized progenitor, a novel, but to history, which it actually is.  These may appear to be characters on your screen, but the majority of them were real people, and the mini-series does a great job of portraying them, and several decades of the Cold War, all within a few hours.  Having just waded through the 1300-odd pages of the Mitrokhin Archive ('The Sword and the Shield', 'The World Was Going Our Way') a meticulous account of the KGB's Cold War activities, it was easy to see the amount of research that went into 'The Company.'  Codenames like 'Sasha' and 'Parcifal' are not just inventions of the novelist Robert Littell, but matters of historical record.  'The Company' brings a solid set of actors to the screen, and all of the details like combat sequences, uniforms, codenames, Hungarian and Russian grammar, are impeccable.  This is a solid piece of film-making, and a good look at history through the narrow lens of the CIA.
