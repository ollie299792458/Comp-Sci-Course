Stanley Kubrick is often regarded as one the greatest film maker of all time, and his films often share a similar title, as some of the greatest films of all time. Stanley Kubrick is a personal favorite of mine, and I've been waiting for a Blu-Ray collection of his best films for a long while. Here it is: Stanley Kubrick: Limited Edition Collection.

I'm not going to review every movie, but the presentation as a whole. This is a nice box set, and a lot of time was put into the making of it. The Blu-Ray disc are presented in cardboard pages in a huge book, along with a 40 page book with back stories, details, and summaries to all of the films included. This all very nice, and luckily I grabbed this as soon as they dropped it down to 60 dollars for one day only. Best 60 dollars I've spent without thinking yet!

Though my one negative comment is indeed on the packaging. The book is nice, and I like the flip book idea containing each movie on a separate page. However getting the movies out of these cases are a real pain, and an even more pain if you're a huge movie buff, and you take pride in the condition of things like this. They are packed in so tight, that you are bound to get a smudge on there trying to get out, and maybe even a scratch or two (though on Blu-Ray that doesn't really matter regardless).
It's still a pain, but I'm going to go out and buy a separate case for all these Blu-Rays.

This is well worth the money, and highly recommended for film buffs and artists.
