"It's a brutal climb to reach that peak. You stand there, waiting for the rush of exhilaration but it doesn't come. You're alone, and the feeling of loneliness is overpowering."

I love, love, LOVE this movie. I was 7 when it came out, remember my mom playing the Dionne Warwick single over and over. I saw it for the first time when I was 11 on network television, and even taped the soundtrack from the television onto a tape so I could play it back whenever I wanted. That's what you did before VCRs if you were a movie crazy kid like me. Eventually I knew every single line of dialogue by heart.

Years later, watching it on the big screen at the Castro theater revival in San Francisco, I was surprised that I still remembered most of the lines. Also surprised that the movie had aged like a fine wine (or wine in a box maybe) into the quintessential trash classic of our time.

Yes, this movie is terrible ... terrible in the most fantastic way imaginable. When I was a kid, I thought I was the only one that appreciated the trashy greatness of this film. But I wasn't alone at all. People love this movie. It's everything that's great and terrible about Hollywood all rolled into one Technicolor trainwreck. Now it's coming out on DVD and all us crazy Doll-heads can watch Neely, Anne and Jennifer reach the top of Mt. Everest every night!

"Sparkle, Nelly, sparkle!"
