THE DVD WAS MAILED TO ME ON TIME. AND IN A HARD PLASTIC CASE. I AM A HUGE FAN OF AMAZON.COM. I DO MOST, IF NOT ALL OF MY INTERNET SHOPPING AT AMAZON.COM, BECAUSE OF HOW WELL THEY TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS, IF A PROBLEM ARISES.  REGARDING THE MOVIE: "A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS," IT IS AWESOME!  IT DOES REQUIRE AN INTELLIGENT PERSON TO UNDERSTAND ALL THAT GOES ON - IT IS A FIERCE "BATTLE OF WITS" BETWEEN LAWERS/CHANCELLORS/THE VATICAN/CHRISTIANITY AND KING HENRY THE VIII.  THIS IS A TRUE STORY AND, THOUGH I PERSONALLY DO NOT AGREE WITH THOMAS MOORE'S RELIGION, I ADMIRE HIS WISDOM, FORTITUDE AND DEVOTION TO WHAT HE BELIEVED IN, ABOVE ALL ELSE!  IT WAS ALL ABOUT "A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE."  HE IS TRULY ONE OF MY GREATEST "HEROS" IN LIFE.  FEW CAN LIVE UP TO THE DEGREE OF INTEGRITY HE HAD AND WAS LOYAL TO, NO MATTER WHAT!  IN ADDITON TO THAT, THE PHOTOGRAPHY, COSTUMES, BOATS, CASTLES, PROPS OF ALL KINDS, ETC., THAT ARE SHOWN IN THIS MOVIE ARE ALSO AWESOME - I BELIEVE IT WON 7 ACADEMY AWARDS! WHICH, I FEEL WERE WELL DESERVED.  MY ADVICE TO OTHERS IS - IF YOU CAN THINK DEEPLY, ABOUT THINGS LIKE INTEGERITY, LOYALTY,CONSCIENCE AND TRUTH, IN THE FACE OF THE GREATEST HORROR MOST PEOPLE HAVE IN LIFE, THEN THIS IS A "MUST SEE" MOVIE FOR YOU!  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THOSE QUALTIES, DON'T WASTE YOU TIME WATCHING IT, AS YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THOMAS MOORE DID WHAT HE DID.
