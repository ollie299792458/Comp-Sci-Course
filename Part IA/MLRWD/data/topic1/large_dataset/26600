This movie was filmed 3 years before I was born, I first saw it at a drive in theater in the 50's with my parents.
Since then I have watched it probably 50+ times, Every time it came on TV I had to see it, when I got my first VCR I was able to record it, later purchased it on VHS then DVD and will get it on Blu Ray when available. Others here have given you the story line so I won't go into that. I was watching an episode of the TV series Happy Days a few years ago; One of the guys had a pending date to fight another so he went to Fonzie for advise. Fonzie's advice was to do something "Just Like in Shane" His friend's response was Who's Shane? Fonzie said You have never seen Shane? !!!!
Well if you have never seen Shane you have missed a classic.
Update Feb. 2012- My dad told me that Shane came on TV and he sat and watched it again even though he has the DVD. This is one of those movies that if you just happen to come across it while channel surfing, you have to watch it.
