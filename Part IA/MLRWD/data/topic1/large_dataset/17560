I have been a faithful viewer of One Tree Hill since it first aired, and I am completely addicted.  OTH is a teen drama about a group of high school students dealing w/ the everyday drama that is teendom.

Chad Michael Murray and James Lafferty play Lucas and Nathan Scott, brothers w/ different mothers.  Nathan grew up w/ everything, including his pushy, manipulative father, Dan Scott, played to perfection by Paul Johansson, while Lucas was less fortunate.  Lucas did, however, grow up w/ a great mother, Karen Roe, played by Moira Kelly, and a sort-of father figure, his uncle Keith Scott, played by Craig Sheffer.  Both boys love basketball, and both are very talented, and the tension begins to build right away as Lucas joins the Tree Hill Ravens, the high school team.

Season one deals w/ many issues, from dating and breakups, to teen parenthood and family deaths.  Nathan and Lucas, along w/ their friends, Haley James (Bethany Joy Lenz), Peyton Sawyer (Hilarie Burton), and Brooke Davis (Sophia Bush), try to deal w/ old rivalries, new friends, new emotions, and everything else in between.

Overall, this is one of the best shows to come out of the WB in awhile, and its a must-see for anyone who enjoys teen drama w/ characters you can relate to and connect w/, real issues, and an incredible plot!
