It is by far one of the best sequels. While many people found it horrible, I loved it. I think the reason people didn't like it was because in the movie they made fun of not so popular movies such as Hollow Man,The Haunting and others and people did not see them so they can not really laugh at the parts and may get confused. It is a little confusing that Ray is back and him and Cindy are friends but if you watch the deleted scenes you will see a part where he apologoizes and stuff. Many of the characters that where in the first and are in this are just as funny if not more.It is also a surprise that Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall)is in this considering the amount of stabs she took in the Movie theater, but again if you watch the deleted scenes her and Cindy talk and she says she became very spiritual after her near death experience so that kind of ties that in. Theo (Kathleen Robinson) also is very funny in this movie just her reactions to things is funny. Tori Spelling is in this film also but not alot but she has alot of deleted scenes.  Buddy has alot of jokes that are not from any movies which are funny.Shorty also returns and is funnier that in the first. Also new to the cast is Tim Curry (Professor)if they Make a Scary Movie 3 he or David Cross(Dwight) will really have no point to be in a part 3. This one is based while they are in college like scream 2 but don't even mention any of the Screams in this one. May part 3 will also be like Scream 3 (Cindy's life after College)
