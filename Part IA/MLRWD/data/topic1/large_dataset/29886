When Ghost in the Shell was released, it was hailed as "the future of anime."  A fair claim, as more recent works blending drawn artwork and CG have demonstrated.  In this respect, it's an interesting piece of work.  Note that Macross Plus experimented with this visual technique 3 years earlier, but not to the extent of Ghost. 
Unfortunately, Ghost in the Shell borrows heavily from "Blade Runner", "The Terminator", and even "La Femme Nikita" to creative an unoriginal storyline.  American movie fans will undoubtedly see the similarities here.  I don't think Mamoru Oshii was racking his brain to create something absolutely original from a script perspective.  He probably had a "look" in his head of how the film should have appeared, and filled in the narrative gaps to include as many special effects as possible.  Hardcore Ghost fans will undoubtedly disagree with me on this.
The anamorphic format is great, picture quality is great.  The sound quality is good, except it's too bad that there wasn't a DD5.1 Japanese audio track available on the disk.  The English version dub was fair, at best.  Overall, the film is definately worth watching, but isn't quite the classic it's hailed to be.
