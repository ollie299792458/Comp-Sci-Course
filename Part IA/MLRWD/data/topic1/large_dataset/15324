Not only is this a fabulous movie, it's a great DVD. I've watched this film over 30 times and it still makes me laugh every time. It's got some great bits that are destined to becomes classic.
Unlike the first movie, Austin Powers takes a backseat to the Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard characters in this film, he is not the funniest character in the movie. Mike Myers really refined his Dr. Evil for this go around and every time he's on screen it's pure sugar in a bag it's so good. 
Needless to say, everybody probably knows the Austin Powers films and either loves them or hates them, so I'll talk about the disc itself, and it is phenomenal. Get rid of that pan and scan VHS tape because this baby is in Widescreen! The menus are fully animated with Austin himself and the extras are great, particularly Dr. Evil's secret page. It also includes three music videos, the best of which is Madonna's Beautiful Stranger. And don't even get me started on the deleted scenes because they are the best deleted scenes I have ever seen on any DVD bar none, and most are extremely funny and worthy or remaining in the completed film, which is usually not the case with cut scenes. The disc's commentary also hints that there was hours more footage that the filmmakers were unable to include in the finished film due to length. It's too bad they couldn' t have included all of that in this package. And speaking of the commentary, it's quite good. A little dry when discussing technical details, but Mike Myers always livens it back up.
Bottom line: A must-have for fans.
