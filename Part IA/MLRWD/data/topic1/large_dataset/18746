I remember this movie from 1973. I was 10 years old and like all of you was I scared. Well the scariness wore off over the last 38 years.
A neurotic housewife named Sally and her business exec husband move into Sally's family house, a spooky two story Victorian mansion. When Sally starts the redecorating along with her pompous decorator she comes across a locked room in the house. After arguing with the handyman who insists she should leave the room locked, she finally gets the key. But once she opens her father's old study and has the bricks from the fireplace removed, strange things begin to happen. Sally begins to see small creatures everywhere, but no one will believe her. Her husband dismisses her as neurotic and her friend thinks Sally may be losing her mind. But things take a deadly serious turn when the decorator trips at the top of the stairs and falls to his death. Sally sees a rope lying across the place where he tripped, but when she picks it up to take it, a horrifying little creature pulls it from her grasp. Is she crazy? Or has Sally released demons in the house, demons her father summoned?
These little puppets are terrorizing Kim Darby as she moves in to an old house left to her by her grandmother. These puppets have been locked away in a sealed fire place by Uncle Charlie from My Three sons.(William Demerest) Kim lets them out and the terrorizing begins. The puppets aren't scary. A ghost would have been much better. I'm sorry to rain on anyones parade, but this movie is miserable. Now we have a remake coming soon some serious barrel scraping off the bottom to want to remake this movie.. a blank screen would be more entertaining.
