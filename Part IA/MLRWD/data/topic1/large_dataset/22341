"Shock Treatment" is a devastatingly underrated film and its place in celluloid history has Rocky Horror's unknown sequel is a misnomer. It is not a sequel. It is another kind of animal entirely. Where RHPS is dark and vampy, ST is bright and sterile. Where RHPS is guttoral, ST works on a more cerebral level.

It is some time later and Brad and Janet (now played by Cliff De Young and the amazingly talented Jessica Harper) are unhappily married and living in Denton. The town is, it seems, completely encased in a television studio where audience members (including Brad and Janet) clambor to get good seats and are then inundated by show after show. The unhappy couple is surprised to learn they have been chosen to be contestants on the game show "Marriage Maze". The host of the show (Barry Humphreys, better known as Dame Edna) convinces Janet to commit Brad to Dentonvale, a mental institution/hit show starring brother and sister Cosmo and Nation McKinley (Richard O' Brien and Patricia Quinn). This is all, of course, a plan by the studio's new owner (also played by De Young) who lusts after Janet and is planning to make her a big Denton star to serve his own nefarious ending. As you can tell, it soon begins to become difficult to tell what is television and what is scripted.

The new wave soundtrack is brilliant and not as derivitive as that of RHPS. The sterile and artificial looking sets and art direction are brilliant, and O' Brien rightfully earns his place as a brilliant futurist. This was a good two decades before reality television and here he's already commenting on it and our obsession with celebrity.
