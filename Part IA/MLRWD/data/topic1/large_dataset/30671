[Note: The UK DVD version from Hong Kong Legends has (1)The best DVD quality. (2)The best DVD extras. (3)The proper TITLES for Bruce Lee films (The US titles are very muddled around).]
Much of the cast from Fist of Fury (The Chinese Connection US title) are back in this Italian mobster / martial arts flick.  The story is quite simply a case of the Italian mob trying to get the daughter of a recently deceased restaurant owner to sell the property over with little success and so they turn to violently disrupting the restaurant's clients and employees. Bruce Lee arrives from Hong Kong to solve the problem which allows for various set pieces involving lots of fist and foot action.
Way of the Dragon (or Return of the Dragon US title) isn't a patch on Fist of Fury (The Chinese Connection US title) in terms of story or Bruce Lee kicking bad guys around the place but it does bolster some fine moments all the same including a very good final showdown with Chuck Norris in which both martial artists flex their wares before going at one on one.
Although Bruce Lee has improved on his technique since the latter films this may disappoint those who where expecting more action than what was in Fist of Fury. The nunchaku scene is certainly less graphic or intense than the one in the Fist of Fury but at least he has two of them this time! There is also a very good scene involving a test bag kick which sends the bag holder flying and an okay kick-about on some wastelands but the end fight between Lee and Norris is really what this movie is about and this is probably the only reason why you should want to watch this. So get this movie to see one of the great Bruce Lee one on one battles, but choose Fist of Fury if you want to see Bruce Lee scrapping virtually non-stop.
