Everybody has favorite movies from their childhood.  I grew up in the 80s (was born right in 1980 to be exact), and that decade produced some of the best pop culture phenomenons of all time.  The Monster Squad is a rare, often completely overlooked gem from that decade which, to those who have seen it, is just as wonderful as the more "popular" Goonies, Ghostbusters, and Gremlins (to name a few) movies.  Simply stated, I adore this film.

The film holds up remarkably well:  it's funny because it's well-written, not because it's corny and dated.  The kid stars, none of whom are really famous now, were all excellent and deliver their lines with great comic timing.  This is not a "so bad it's good" type of movie: this is the real deal; genuinely funny, scary, and complete with excellent makeup effects by Stan Winston.  I also love this movie because not everyone's seen it, like some of the aforementioned 80s films, and it's great to be able to recommend a film from this time period that a large cult following considers a classic to friends.

I have a VHS tape of THe Monster Squad (a prized possession), purchased probably in 1988 or 89, and the video is extremely faded from countless multiple viewings.  In fact, it may be my single
"most watched" movie, and I can quote it almost line by line.

I don't remember ever seeing any behind the scenes specials on the film, so I'm looking forward to those the most, not to mention a remastered digital version of the greatest "kids vs. monsters" movie of all time!

"It's a spider, with a human head.  It eats dogs, and cats...and rabbits..."

So many quotes, so little time.  Go out, find your "Stephen King Rules" shirt, make sure there's no Mummy in your closet, guard your twinkie from the Creature, and watch The Monster Squad on July 24th.  You will NOT be disappointed.
