OK -- it's not a film for everyone.  First, it's in black-and-white.  Second, it's subtitled.  And third...it's French!  So we've already alienated much of the American audience right off the bat.

However, for those who are willing to explore a bit, they might discover a hidden gem.  In my opinion, this film was Truffaut's masterpiece (easily exceeding the much-touted "Jules et Jim" as well as his other subsequent films) and its story and imagery easily stand up to multiple viewings.

I won't go to into the plot, but I'll just say that, starting with the opening scenes of Paris and the accompanying music, you're drawn into a story that is poignant and thoughtful.  And no, it's not a tear-jerker.  Hey, there's even some humor!

For you film buffs out there, this film is well worth watching!

An additional note...

Regarding the film's title, "The 400 Blows" is a French idiom -- as in "je faisais les quatre cents coups avec mes copains" (I was doing the 400 blows with my buddies) -- and means "getting into mischief" or doing things you're not supposed to.  Typically applied to an energetic youth who's always getting into trouble.
