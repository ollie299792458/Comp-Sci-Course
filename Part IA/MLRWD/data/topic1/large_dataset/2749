This has been my favorite movie since I was a teenager -- Long before the AFI rated it the #1 film of all time, but they are right!  There are so many things to love about this movie I hardly know where to start, but here goes:
First of all, it is a flat out funny movie!  Not only is the premise really funny:  two guys witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre (even that is clever, using a real-life event to start off the movie!) and hide out from the gangsters by joining an all-female band, but the dialogue is some of the best of any movie ever made.  You might even have to watch it a couple of times to catch everything.  But trust me, you certainly won't mind repeated viewings.  This is at the top of my "deserted on a desert island" movie list.  
But it is also a pretty wonderful romantic story.  One that women will love, but guys will enjoy as well.  Joe's (Tony Curtis) underhanded seduction of Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) is sweet and low-down at the same time.  The film's other romance is pure hilarity -- Jerry (Jack Lemmon), in drag, is pursued by a frisky elderly millionaire (Joe E. Brown) and the result has to be seen to be believed.
While knowledge of current events of the 1920's will probably enhance your enjoyment of this film, it is still great no matter how old you are.  If I were allowed to recommend only one movie ever, this would be the one.
If you liked Tootsie, watch this movie and see how one of the originals does it even better.  
Obviously I can't comment on the DVD quality of the film since it hasn't been released yet, but the included interview with Leonard Maltin and Tony Curtis is definitely a plus.  I will most certainly be getting my copy on the day it is released, and if you know what I know, so will you.
