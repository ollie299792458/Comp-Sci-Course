I'm not going to yak about individual scenes, nor give you a detailed synopsis, as so many other reviewers were kind enough to include. I am simply going to give you one man's honest thoughts on this rather remarkable film.

  St. Ralph caught me completely off guard. Like most of you, I've seen thousands of films and the great majority of them have managed to exit through the tiny escape  valve located at the base of my skull, never to occupy a single precious brain cell again.

  To my astonishment, the film captured my attention with the first hilarious scene and began compounding one great moment upon another until the unbearably exciting climax reached a fever pitch that this reviewer has rarely witnessed in the annals of filmdom.

  All in all, this is not only one of the greatest sporting movies ever made, but perhaps the most inspirational story ever conceived.

  I cannot recommend to you a better film in the past year, and that includes some stiff academy award competition.

Wow....... wow........wow!

Enjoy.
