This movie has it all!  Hilarious one-liners, great sight gags, sci-fi inside jokes, heart, and a plot, to boot!  I'm not a Trekkie, but I recognized and enjoyed the Captain Kirk "body language" and chest exposure along with a host of other references to Star Trek.  The movie manages to poke fun without being mean spirited, remembering this BIG part of our national culture as fondly as most of us do.  I have a four year old who loves this movie so I've seen it about a zillion times and it still entertains me (THAT, as every parent knows, is the hallmark of a great movie!).  I still laugh out loud every time Sigourney Weaver freaks out with "Let's get out of here before one of those things kills Guy!" revealing her true feelings after repeated assurances to him that he is not going to be killed just because he's an extra without a last name.  Sam Rockwell is hilarious when he grabs the vox to give the Captain important advice during a desparate battle with a giant rock "I know! ... Look around you.  Can you fashion some sort of rudimentary lathe?"  I could go on and on, but, I'll spare you if you just promise to get the movie, okay?
