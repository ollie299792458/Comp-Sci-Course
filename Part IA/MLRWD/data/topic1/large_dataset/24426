This movie is a strictly by-the-numbers action flick with all the depth of a mud puddle, but it is surprisingly enjoyable nevertheless.  The formulaic plot is as follows:  A group of Texas Longhorn cheerleaders witness the mob execution of a witness wanted by the Texas Rangers, and thus they need protection in order to avoid becoming victims themselves.  Enter Tommy Lee Jones, who is forced to move into the girls' house on campus and babysit them for protection.  Predictable hilarity ensues, with plenty of culture clashes between the college girls and the crusty Jones.

This movie is about as formulaic as you can get.  The plot holds no surprises whatsoever, the identity of the bad guy is obvious from the beginning, and the action scenes are workable but nothing spectacular.  Nevertheless Tommy Lee Jones manages to take an average movie and lift it up to the level of a great popcorn flick that will appeal to pretty much everyone.  Cedric the Entertainer also appears in the film as an ex-con minister who is also a former UT cheerleader, and his scenes are a lot of fun to watch.  Anne Archer appears in the film as a UT professor who becomes Tommy Lee's love interest, but her role is pretty minimal.

All in all, this one is worth watching, if not exactly a blockbuster.  If you like Tommy Lee Jones, you will like this movie.
