if you are a meg ryan fan STOP READING HERE!!!!! i'm not kidding. stop.

this isn't a cutesy hollywood exploitive/derivative blathering of a movie like so many "romances" we know.

it is an entertaining [german] film with themes of desire and love. there is desire for connection and interaction, desire for physical expression, desire of passions. and love. rich boundless love. human and non-human love. love- both complicated and sad at times and easy and generous at others, i need kleenex every time. i feel uplifted every time.

now, maybe i am just a fool for true romance [and a beauty on a trapeeze,] but this is one of my all-time favorite films. (thank goodnesss you're not getting the usual roses popping up spontaneously here folks!) what wenders does is sumblime- one can see themself in the characters easily. they are faulted, genuine and believable in a context of life in "chilly" berlin and the occasional otherworldlyness. the cast is a delight to watch [falk kills me here] and you must check out nick cave and the bad seeds in the club scene.

here is a case where i wish that art was actually imitating life.

sigh.
