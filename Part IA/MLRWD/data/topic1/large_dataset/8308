Superman 4 was conceived by Chris Reeve as a great return to the orignal quality of the first 2 and hopefully to get the sour taste out of everyone's mouth's of Superman 3.  What was delivered is a movie in shambles filled with plot holes galore and literally a fun house of 2nd rate special effects.  The budget for Superman 4 was slashed in half by the now non-existant Golan Globus and the effects in this film are actually worse than what you saw in Superman the movie even though it was released 9 years prior to Superman 4.  The plot is terrible Chris Reeve conceived a story about Superman saving the world from nuclear war by disarming the planet.  Not a bad idea but the screenwriters did an awful job building upon that concept.  The commentary by Mark Rosenthal one of the screenwriters is worth a listen because he is honest about just how awful the film is and tries to defend very little about just how lousy the production of the film was.  Overall lousy movie and a tragic end to Chris Reeve's legendary portrayal of the Man Of Steel.
