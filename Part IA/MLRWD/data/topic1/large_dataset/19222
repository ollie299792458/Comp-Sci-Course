I found this film to be disappointing. Yes, the music and flamenco dancing is wonderful. But as I am enduring this film I can't help but think that the director used every possible moment to "shove" some sort of dancing or singing into the story line which in and of itself needed a lot of work.
I love the culture from Spain and just about all it has to offer. A pattern I seem to notice with the many films Spain produces is that taboo issues are brought to the service. For example in this film, the nephew is mentally disabled. I don't know if in real life this actor is or not but how often do you see this in American films? Another example would be Pedro Almod&oacute;var's film All About My Mother where several characters struggle with HIV, or Noriega's main role in Abre Los Ojos where a good looking man loses it all to being facially disfigured. My point is these films are art reflecting real life situations. A more realistic experience in my opinion make for a more enjoyable experience. Flamenco has some gorgeous cinematography, the acting was quite good, the story and how it flowed  just needed a lot of polishing.
