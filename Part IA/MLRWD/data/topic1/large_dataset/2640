this is the movie adaptation of the novel 'sleepers.'  this book is based on a true story and the film is very true to the book.  robert deniro as the neighborhood priest who would just as soon listen to your confession as bust you in the nose is spot on.  he has the right nuances for the tough guy man of the cloth.  kevin bacon is evil incarnate as the abusive prison guard who beats and molests the 4 friends from the neighborhood.  ron eldard and billy crudup are scary as the grown up boys turned cold blooded killers.  however, in this story you have empathy for what they become based on the horrors they endured as juveniles.  brad pitt and jason patric are wonderful as the two men who didn't completely, well, not obviously, succumb to the horror of what went on in the reform school.  they plot their revenge deliciously.  minnie driver is perfect as the literal, girl next door and dustin hoffman is a fantastic surprise as the washed up lawyer who is defending eldard and crudup.  it's a tough movie to watch, but one realizes this kind of abuse of power has gone on for centuries and ruined lives and families in abundance.  a good movie with interesting twists and turns.  vittorio gassman is also part of the cast as the neighborhood protector.
