To give it a 4 star rating would be a rather dry response to the entertainment provided. The job is very well done i have to say.

First of all, this to me is the most believable depiction of Rome I have seen up to this date - I mean, obviously Ceasar et al did not sound like they are reading a Shakespearean tragedy? Plus, there were other things, more mundane things that were there, sexuality and debouchery that no previous version was brave enough to depict. This one has.

Than, there s also intricacy of the plot - Lucius Vorenus is not at all a happy camper, which I think resonates with the truth about the soldier of that period and that place. He is a pagan, devoted to his superiors more than the gods who he questions on the daily basis. Nevertheless, a few dramatic transformations of character are in store for those who choose to watch this.

As you probably noticed, i have not revealed the actual plot of this series, so I hope you enjoy it as I had, and perhaps even comment whether you agree or disagree with this perspective.
