An excellent story about a 1950s familiy.It's a story about a way  of life, that isn't that much different than the way we live today.  When it comes to marriage and children everything has to look perfect, no matter what lies under the surface. That is just what Cathy Whittaker, (Julianne Moore)is doing. Traying to make everything look perfect.  She is doing everthing she can to save her marriage after having found out about her husband's " accident ". He's a homosexual. Hush!While fighting for her familiy, she finds herself becoming close to her gardner, who is black. Hush! hello, It's the '50s. What I want to say is that everyone has a secret or two, no matter how much we try to convince ourselves otherwise.And, naturally, we hate to be exposed.We fight,'cause that's what life really is about.Haynes did an excellent job by placing the story in the 1950's, becouse much of what the movie is about, was a taboo back then ( it still is...) and it gives the story much more reality!!! Don't miss it.
P.S. Julianne Moore will always be my one and only. She is a godess. Bye and thanks.
