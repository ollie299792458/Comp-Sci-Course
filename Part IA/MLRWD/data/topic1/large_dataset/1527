I bought this DVD set and can't say enough great things about these movies AND their creators, Tom Laughlin & Delores Taylor.  What wonderful people they were then and are now!  They took the chances most people are afraid to take and stood up for what they believed in and I am so greatful to them for that.  And greatful for the lessons they have taught me which are as valuable as any I've ever learned in my life.  When the singer sings "you are my teacher" at the end of 'Trial of B.J.' I surely can relate!

Back in the 70's these movies literally enlightened and changed my life!  And after watching them all over again (including the 'Billy Jack Goes to Washington' which never got released) I have to say I think they are changing things yet again in my life, in ways I never imagined.

I get upset with all the negative comments I read regarding the karate scenes(there are only 2 karate scenes in each, 'Billy Jack' & 'Trial of B.J.') probably less than 5-6 minutes of the total movie, yet people seem to ONLY remember those scenes and not all the PEACE & LOVE demonstrated throughout the movies.

I'd recomend this set to anyone today and feel it's as current now (yes, just listen to the current daily news!) as it was in the 70's.  I think all kids in high school should see this also as a lesson.  Just look at what the government was up to then as it is now and you may agree.
