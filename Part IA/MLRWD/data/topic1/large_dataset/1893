To call Jimi's performance here incredible goes beyond the pale

of understatement. What makes this DVD really worth the price of

purchase for me is the Otis Redding footage.

After a full weekend of psychedelics,ear-splitting guitarwork and

some well choreographed onstage mayhem by The Who & Jimi Hendrix,

the best was saved for last. The final act of the festival, Otis

backed by Booker T. & The MG's and The Mar-Keys horn section just

tore the place up. After the seemingly impossible to follow act

that was Hendrix, all Otis had to do was open his mouth and the

crowd was his. Never have I seen so much charisma and magnetism

come out of one man. I've watched the "Shake - Otis At Monterey"

segment of this DVD 20 times if I have watched it once and it never fails to amaze me.

On top of this you have of course the Hendrix footage as well as

some really great un-released footage of Big Brother&The Holding

Co.(W/Janis) and The Butterfield Blues Band in what arguably can

be called their best line up with Bloomfield & Elvin Bishop just plain getting down, blue and funky. Recommended!
