I really love this film, since I saw it when I was a little kid at 1 in the morning on AMC, in English, and i freaked out when i saw the DVD at Media Play, but I was really upset its all in Italian... there isnt even an english audio track. This film was definitley shot in english, because when somebody says "pronto" on the telephone, you can tell they are really saying HELLO. Anyways, i am just glad to own this wondeful film, despite the fact its all in Italian. (By the way, when it was on T.V, it was the uncut version, because i remebered it all when i saw the DVD, including the lesbionic theme in the Telephone, but it was in ENGLISH!!!!)That really makes me mad, but anways... Mario Bava is truly genius to come up with these REALLY scary tales, and this only adds to his long list of GREAT CLASSIC horror films. His films have something special about them... they arnt gorry, just really SCARRY in an either psycological or visual way. Black Sabbath may be his best work, and inspired many other of his films as well as the telephone horror genre. This film is definitley a kepper, and I think more people would watch it if IT WERENT DUBBED IN ITALIAN WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES!!!
