most of the time, gore alone does not make a movie's atmosphere.  i'd rather re-watch alfred hitchcock's 'psycho' for the zillionth time than endure the latest 'my bloody friday the hostel chainsaw massacre' sequel. or remake. or relaunch.  or re-imagining, or whatever synonym for "same old s***" is in vogue this week.

that being said, some of my favorite films are EXTREMELY graphic and bloody, and manage to do so while adding to the genre as a whole and NOT sacrificing either intelligence or creativity for the sake of another few gallons of red-dyed karo syrup.  the japanese, for some reason, are more likely to 'get horror right' these days than the americans are, and the two movies mentioned in this review's title are prime examples.

miike's 'ichi' and tsukamoto's 'tetsuo' represent evolutionary leaps forward within this rarefied genre, and each launched its director's career (or at least brought them a certain level of fame/notoriety).

'tokyo gore police' is another such film.

comparisons fail me, as watching t.g.p. is such an over-the-top experience: i preferred it to 'machine girl,' 'meatball machine' and all of the other recent japanese gore offerings; i also thought it left the much-hyped 'poultrygeist' (by us-based troma films) in the dust.

there's little else i can add to what others have written about this movie without either repeating them or giving away one "did you see THAT?!" moment or another; let's just say that this dvd holds a place of honor in my collection right next to 'ichi' and 'tetsuo.'

if you appreciate this kind of movie like i do, that should come as the highest praise.  go buy it; go buy it NOW!!
