This one is in my opinion, the best in the trilogy. But this one really tests if you really care enough to see more of the characters and their situations.
Special Effects-Incredible. Better than the first two. The Zion war is really cool, as is the Super Brawl between Agent Smith and Neo. Awesome. 10/10
Acting-The same as the first two, cheesy and sometimes confusing, but less of the latter. It's still good though, for what's there. 8/10
Sound-These movies introduced some interesting sound effects never before heard. This movie continues the tradition.10/10
Story-A lot of people said this entry in the trilogy lacked a good story. I felt that it was a better plot than Reloaded, meaning nothing has been dumbed down. The story is great, but I have a complaint. The ending was so unbelievably infuriating, i almost stood up and yelled so many profanities. You may too. But when you get mad, remember this: the story isn't over. Next year, a massive online multiplayer game is coming out, continuing the story of the humans and their struggle with the machines. It's being developed as we speak.
With that in mind, go to the movie with your expectations down. It will work better that way. You may be pleasantly surprised at how smashing this movie is. Cheers.
