Okay, so is this Oscar-caliber material?  No.  Is this a post-modern look at our society and the role of parental figures?  No.  Is this an indictment of a society which relies on consumerism and marketing to carry out our obligations?  No.  Do I have any idea what the prevous two questions actually mean?  Most definitely no.  This is, however, a movie in which a hockey player, Derek Thompson (Dwayne Johnson, he of the bulging muscles), dresses up in tights and a tutu and sprouts wings from his back.  In other words, it's a cute, inoffensive film, clearly meant to appeal to small children and those adults who can shut off their logical brains for a couple of hours, sit back and enjoy all the pretty colors.  While some of the dialogue is cringe-worthy and some of the moments of hilarity a bit forced, all-in-all it's never better or worse than what it set out to be.

We get the familiar story of a man, Derek, who's bitter and selfish, who's had his dreams taken away and because of it, discourages those around him (read:  kids) from dreaming big, because all they'll get for their troubles is disappointment.  Even worse, Derek tells his girlfriend's kids that there is no such thing as a tooth fairy.  In retaliation, he gets a summons for Tooth Fairy duty.  Once it's beaten into his head that the summons (along with the above tights, tutu, and wings) is, in fact, not a dream, he becomes the worst tooth fairy in history.  It takes a severe dose of humility (provided by the always-lovely Julie Andrews) and a bit of "I'll do it my way" determination to reawaken the hope and magic hidden away in Derek.  The kids are happy, the romance is saved, and the big finale goes off with a bang.  What more could you ask for?
