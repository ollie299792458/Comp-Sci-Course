The "Birth of A Nation" is based on Dixon's "The Clansman", a novel and play that heroically portrays the Ku Klux Klan.  The KKK describes itself, even today, as "the invisible empire" and "the invisible nation" protecting "white womanhood".  The film is a glorified history of the "Birth of (the invisible) Nation"; the fictionalized history of the Ku Klux Klan.  I rate the film highly because of how much it effected film history and American history.

The film was and is effective propaganda.  Even today, White kids who see it a half-dozen times or more all the way through before they become teenagers would likely become racists for the rest of their lives.  Many of the images have become part of America's collective imagination; especially the negative portrayals of Blacks.  For example, without ever seeing the film, many Whites imagine southern legislatures during Reconstruction to have been as shown in "Birth of A Nation".

See the film on the good DVD with the orchestral music and what you'll see most of all is the POWER of film.  When Dixon convinced Griffith to make the film, he hoped to revitalize the Klan.  Dixon succeeded well beyond his wildest dreams; the KKK expanded from fewer than 50,000 to over 6,000,000.  During the 1920's, 15-20% of the White male Protestant population joined the Klan.  Except for New York and Chicago, politicians had to join the Klan to get elected to state and national office; for example, in 1925, nearly every Indiana legislator and nearly every state employee was a member of the Klan.
