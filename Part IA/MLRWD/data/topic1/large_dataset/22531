This is a smokin' hot concert only  Tommy and JY could have pulled off.  Multi triple platinum albums 1977's Grand Illusion and '78 Pieces of Eight  two of the probably the greatest rock albums of all time played live with Styx main core members Tommy Shaw and James 'JY' Young peforming flawlessly.Tommy and JY have been able to hold Styx  leagacy  for over a decade together well, with a very competent line up and despite their well publicised break up with original member Dennis De Young have been able tour and release albums with huge success.Their line up over the years have been consistant with Lawrence Gowan on Vocals and Keys, Ricky Phillip on bass and Tod Sucherman on drums.The concert filmed on November 9th, 2010 at the historic Orpheum Theater in Memphis, TN, culminates the great showmanship,energy and friendship the band has been harnessing over the years.
I lived off these albums in '78-'79 played them 24/07 this was truly a 'Rock Odyssey' they were the 'real' days of hard rock!!!I still have these albums including the limited edition  of pieces of eight.
Orignal founding member Chuck 'chucky' Panazzo as usual makes guest appearences on songs with the heavy base lines like 'fooling yourself' and appears to be very happy with these stints. For years I've been yearning to hear 'Man in the wilderness and tommy nearly brought tears to my eyes so was Lawrence on  Castle Walls, Sing for the day, I'm Ok were executed to perfection, also JY songs Miss America, Lord of the Rings  were performed  to perfection It's  as though you are  listening to them off the original albums.I've always loved the ageless  Tommy's songs in Styx's Crystal Ball, Grand Illusion, Pieces of Eight and Cornerstone he had that 'lulaby voice' and together with JY produced some soaring solos De Young was very Inspirational until in '80 when he tried to'theatrerise' the band and that was the end of Styx...but the  Styx resurgence in  the last era has moved us the harcore fans !!! This concert is an  Amazing, Great, Historic musical experience!!!
Thanks Tommy and JY!!!
