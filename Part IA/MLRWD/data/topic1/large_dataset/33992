Make it better than the original, or offer something new!  Unfortunately, we don't see that here, but the pace was breathtaking, the effects were stunning even if the character development and script were thinner than rice paper.

Several reviewers have said that the characters were two-dimensional, and one reviewer I read even said the movie was racist because of something that occurs right after the action gets tipped on its head.  I found that the show held a bit more than what I had read before going in, and that the critics were unable to do what I did--unbridle their sense of entertainment and let it gallop around the theater for an hour and a half.

While I won't add this movie to my personal collection, I enjoyed seeing it and it begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible.  I tensed up as the action heated up, and breathed a sigh of relief when our intrepid group made it through obstacle after obstacle, and ultimately, I was entertained in spite of the baggage I carried into the film.  The movie came up short of the original by a long mark, but the editors had the good sense to end it before the two-hour mark and **spoiler alert** sink the boat so we can't have a sequel.

Go.  Get popcorn.  Keep the armrests clear for something to hang onto.  Be entertained.
