Forget what anyone else says....this film is without doubt a stunning masterpiece from the eerie tone of the opening credits, to the frantic ending which sees a twist that is anything but predictable.
Harrison Ford delivers what can only be described as a masterful performance, as he somehow manages to achieve credibility both as the doting husband and as the crazed killer......yet this is merely what we have come to expect from his shere brilliance.
Meanwhile, Michelle Pheiffer manages to present herself with an incredible amount of innocence whilst regaining some of that stunning sensualism she had in her role as the Catwoman in "Batman Returns". 
Ok, so it isn't exactly a breakthrough in the horror/suspense genre.....but is this not what film and indeed genre are all about???
Forget any negative feedback...anyone who didn't enjoy this film clearly needs to watch it again more carefully (or book an appointment with their local GP!!!!) 
This movie is shere brilliance from the sophisticated direction  through the magnificent acting..........no movie fan should be without this one........BUY IT NOW!!!!!
