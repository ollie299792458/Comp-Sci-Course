I first saw this movie on TV years ago; they were advertising it, and since I'd never seen or even heard of it before, and I was intrigued by the premise, I decided to give it a go. I missed part of the film when a friend called, but I was hooked on it after we hung up.

It's not a perfect film. There are plot holes, yes. But Reeve and Seymour are so good, and so believable, that they draw you in. I read that Reeve took some criticism after the film was released by being TOO sensitive in his portrayal of Richard Collier! Well, that was 1980 for you, folks.

The DVD has a problem, or maybe it's just my copy, where at times in the film, the image suddenly becomes rather jerky. Fortunately, this doesn't last.

I enjoyed watching the interviews, hard though it was to see the once-vibrant Christopher Reeve in a wheelchair, having to talk around the operation of his respirator. It was hard, too, to see him in the film, walking and running with ease.

There's just something about this film that takes hold of you. As I mentioned before, Reeve and Seymour give perfect performances. I suppose that the magic here is that the relationship between them really works, and this is such a rare thing anywhere, at any time, that we willingly suspend our disbelief. They both fit into their roles as if the parts had been written only for them.

It's not a "chick-flick". It's so much more.
