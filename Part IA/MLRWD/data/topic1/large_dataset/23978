I really looked forward to this. It was the first blu ray I ever owned. I had read the reviews and was looking forward to adding a cult classic in the making to my brand new blu ray collection.

The animation was limited, but decent enough to tell the jokes. the animators were very funny.

It was pretty weak from start to finish. It felt like every joke had been confiscated from some other better cartoon. I feel like it stole from Southpark, family guy, Venture Brothers, Futurama, Invader Zim, Looney Tunes, and Ren and Stimpy. But mostly Ren and Stimpy. For example, there were so many zoom in shots where the simple line drawing became a detailed rendering of something disgusting. Very Kricfalusi.  There was even the fog horn sound effect in these shots. What also felt like john kricfalusi was the female sex kittens in the show, but they weren't drawn as well. I kept waiting to see some special thanks to John K. maybe I missed it. I was anxious to remove it from my player.

Imagine if Rob Zombie got high with Quintin Tarantino in the editing room of Inglorious Basterds, went home watched Ren and Stimpy the Lost Episodes snorted 15 lines of "It's okay to tweak the joke if it's homage" then wrote this in 2 binge drunk days.

maybe rent but don't buy.
