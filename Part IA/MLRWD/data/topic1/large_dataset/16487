Nichols' film version of Kushner's play is faithful to the ethereal effervescence of the original. The performances by ALL of the actors are pitch-perfect (Mary-Louise Parker is particularly forceful, as is the brilliant Jeffrey Wright.) I am not using the word "wonderful" aimlessly: the film is literally full of wonder. My only gripe (aside from the fact that not one of the main actors is gay) is that Nichols decided to cut the line "Very Steven Spielberg" at the end of Millenium Approaches. That may seem like a ridiculously mundane gripe, but that one line encapsulates the entire power and point of Kushner's play (according, too, to Kushner)! The play is a reponse to the overly schmaltzy barrage of AIDS dramas in the 1980s. Society, it seemed, accepted gay men only as subjects of death and sappy sentiment. In the play-text, Kushner takes the most potentially sentimental moment in the play (Prior is at rock-bottom! The Angel crashes through the roof with sublime, spiritual, stunning force!)...and undercuts it with Prior's campy response, exposing the fakery and artificiality of straight society's view of gay men. Alas, this production decides to forsake powerful cultural critique for unabashed sentiment, playing it safe in more ways than one, in what is an otherwise perfect rendition.
