this is a must-see movie for every girl from age 16, 18 to see - if He Is Just Not That Into You, what are you doing wasting the time in your life?

AND probably, really, you aren't that into him either - it's time for people who care about their friends, etc To Start Telling Everyone The Truth - no one wants to hurt anyone's feelings so instead most "friends" are just pumping each other up instead of helping each other to have a Better Real Life.

Girls and women have been wasting years and decades of their lives imagining they mean more to a guy than they do - and end up embittered and scared that they are unappealing.

Better to take a good look at one's self and evaluate one's true appeal: what is attractive and loveable about ourselves and what is NOT. then to assess our "marketability" and wait for that right moment, for a right one to come along - which is rare but DOES happen -

but to waste time making more of something or someone than it or he is? what IS up with that?!

better to be more selective, keep most guys as friends until they have proven they deserve a place in your heart - and become more wonderful every month and every year so that someone WILL come along and fall for you in a big way For Real.

until, then, proceed with caution - and start with The Honest Truth. and watch this movie and read the book [and other good books on love and relationships] - don't waste your youth or precious time making something out of nothing - when we got nothin', we gotta admit It's NoThing - it's not our time, our turn - and he's not The One For You -
