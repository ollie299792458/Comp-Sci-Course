I keep reading how Zombie was suppose to have made this movie from his own thoughts: You know, his version. We all know that this is the case because clearly it is nothing like the original. The first version of Halloween that Zombie did wasn't THAT bad, it was actually pretty nice to see Michael rise up again(for this new generation I mean). What I don't understand is why Zombie didn't just do a REMAKE of the original part II and then for PART III do his own thing. Then there wouldn't be so many expectations for him to follow the original second one; and, in more ways then one, he could have completely wrote the script for it. The Season of the Witch wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't Myers-y. This was probably due to the fact that John wasn't going to do the Halloween series movies like the Friday the 13th series. He had originally planned on killing Myers off in the second one and the Season of the witch was going to begin a completely spin off and so on. The fan of course. --- Either way. This movie wasn't so bad, but it just wasn't the Myers style. The killings were kind of cliche(though good enough to see). However the fact that the Theme wasn't in the movie and that Michael didn't have his mask for half of the movie is what sort of ticked most people off. Sure. The theme in itself was like an important page to completing the "picture perfect" book -- so was the mask(sort of how they completely ruined Freddy's voice in this new remake: which will completely throw people off of the original vibe). I guess you just have to be open for new things. If you're expecting a remake of the ORIGINAL second film, and have done no research on this movie, then you will Probably dislike it.
