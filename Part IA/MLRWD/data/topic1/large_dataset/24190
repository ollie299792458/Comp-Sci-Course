Ok, so I know half of the people (or more) have knocked this just because Lindsey Lohan is in it.  For you that have done that, your opinion doesn't matter and your review should be deleted. This movie isn't as bad as people make it sound.  Yes it bombed in the box office, but that's because Lohan had just got caught drunk.  In all, it's not that bad of a movie.  I was actually expecting more, since it is given an R rating for "grisly violence" which there wasn't all that much of.  Maybe it's a little farfectched, but not as farfetched as some of the other movies out there (Lord of the Rings *cough* *cough*) Lohan puts forth a pretty solid acting job, and is pretty believeable.  I personally think that the alternate ending included on the dvd would have made me enjoy the movie alot more.  So, in closing, put aside her drunk driving for a minute, because how many of you hypocrites out there haven't driven drunk?  If you want a solid movie, and don't mind seeing Lohan half naked, check this movie out. You'll either like it or you won't.
