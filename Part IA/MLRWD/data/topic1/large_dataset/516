I like Morgan.  I like his movies.  But this one, frankly, stank.

The plot was simple - father and son out to camp encounter an escapee hit man and take him prisoner as they try to return to civilization while avoiding the hitman's cronies, who (for the most part) are out to rescue their buddy.  It could've been a good movie. It SHOULD have been a good movie.  Unfortunately, it is poorly done.  There isn't enough plot to justify the length of the movie and something about it makes it seem very outdated - like you're watching a movie made ten or fifteen years ago.  It could've been improved with more exploration of the characters' situations, but that doesn't happen, either.  And the idea of the government agent giving instructions for Morgan's character to be killed, while surrounded by cops - yet nobody overhears her - would be laughable if it weren't so stupid.  I finished watching it, which is why it got two stars, but was sitting there most of the time wondering, "How much longer???" which is ALSO why it got two stars.  Very disappointing.
