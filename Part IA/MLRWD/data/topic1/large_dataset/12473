Very accurate. Better than most disaster movies because it did show how quickly the world can change but it did not immediately have everyone turn into non-thinking,non-feeling animals. It takes more than 4 months to destroy humanity. The characters were real and there were no superheroes or villains,just people. However, the movie did a decent job of portraying the desperation that would naturally accompany this kind of epidemic.  The characters were very real and the situations were very authentic.  It is easy to understand how people would behave given the threat of a disease like this. From leaking information to loved ones but withholding that information from the general public to testing a vaccine on yourself without approval.  Part of the social commentary in the movie was the situation involving treatment and care of the people who were chasing the origin of the disease and who risked their own lives.  In a serious situation like this, they became the true heroes just for doing their jobs.
