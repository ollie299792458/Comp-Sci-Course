A completely incoherent film with no semblance of a logical argument. The filmmaker insists upon regaling the viewer with immaterial anecdotes about his mentally unstable drug-crazed brother, as if that is somehow supposed to support the idea of denouement of the war on drugs. (Drugs destroyed my brother's life and turned him into a raving lunatic. Therefore, drugs should be legalized. Makes perfect sense, I guess?)

Look, I certainly recognize that many elements of the 'war on drugs' are flawed. There is a very credible argument to be made for the legalization of Marijuana and other substances that pose a low threat of addiction and self-harm. However, to suggest, as this documentarian does, that historical overreach in the drug war necessitates relaxation of regulations on dangerous substances like heroin and cocaine that are very adept at turning users into societal leeches is generously absurd.

This could have been a serious documentary that raised some serious and necessary questions about how our government allocates resources to fight the making, trafficking, and consumption of illegal drugs. Instead, as is the norm with leftist propaganda films masquerading as real documentaries, this movie maker started out with a flawed premise (that conservatives and republicans in government want to keep minorities down and will eagerly co-opt their corporate cronies to do so) and then rearranged and distorted various aspects of the war on drugs to bolster his untenable opinion.

If you want a concise and informative examination of the war on drugs as it stands today, save an hour of your life and watch the Frontline special on the subject.
