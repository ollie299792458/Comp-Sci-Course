Obviously, in the minority but I enjoyed The Lather Effect. Twenty years after graduating from high school, a group of former classmates meet for a "come as you were" party. Inevitably, the group comes upon unresolved issues, and unfulfilled dreams. The cast is good enough, particularly Caitlin Keats, who's beautiful and sexy. The Eric Stoltz character does stand out, but not in a good way. I know he's supposed to be the drunk bad boy, but I just found him an annoying loser.

My main problem with the movie is that a secret is revealed in such an anticlimactic way that it's hard to really feel the effects it had on the characters -- even if the actors weep and pout as a consequence. And the resolution between the torn lovers is just ridiculous. Come on, no one decides someone is not his/her soul mate based on such stupidity.

Other than that, it's an OK movie. I'd just delete the "waiting for Cameron Crowe" featurette, which makes the director look like a moron at best and a stalker at worst.
