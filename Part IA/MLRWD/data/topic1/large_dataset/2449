Having read a lot of James Joyce in high school and college, I went to this movie the same year it came out on the arthouse tour.  I had always prided myself on my "poker face" and my ability to hide my emotions.  On the other hand, I had idolized Joyce and plowed through Ulysses like a school boy in heat.  I can honestly say I barely moved a muscle throughout this movie.  I was transfixed by the wonderful characters and the ways in which Huston fleshed them out into real people.  When the final scene upwrapped and played itself out, with that final great shot of the snow falling and covering everything, the marvelous narration barely above a whisper, I found myself unable to hold back the tears, and I sat in my seat with my friends rustling around me preparing to leave, heaving with uncontrollable sobs and at the same time making only a feeble attempt to hide what I was feeling.  This movie tears your heart out and then puts it back in again.  No other movie has done this to me.  I go back to this great film about once a year, and with every viewing my admiration grows for what has to be my favorite film.
