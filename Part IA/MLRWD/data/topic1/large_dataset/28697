I've watched this movie a couple of times now, and I still can't decide if I like it or not. Some complain about Halle Berry's increased role in the film. I don't understand how she couldn't have a bigger part, since Cyclops and Professor X die and Jean is a zombie most of the time. That only leaves Wolverine and Storm as the remaining members of the team!
My question has to do with the script. Which came first, the poor script or folks jumping ship, or did a bad script get even worse when key players bolted?
Marsden and Singer ran off to do Superman. Superman was good, but it wasn't great. Since the story is about Dark Phoenix, it would seem that Marsden would have had a bigger role as Cyclops in X-Men than as Lois Lane's fiance. And Singer had done the two previous very successful X-Men movies. Why would he think doing Superman would be better than XMIII? It sounds like both men knew a bad thing when they saw it and ran away as fast as they could.
And what about Patrick Stewart? Did the original story called for Xavier's death, or did Mr. Stewart want to be written out of the story? His death seemed to serve no purpose in the storyline - other than it was easier to show her evil side by killing him off as opposed to having DP destroy star systems as she did in the comic.
Of course the other possibility is that they were setting up the Wolverine movie by doing away with the X-Men......
