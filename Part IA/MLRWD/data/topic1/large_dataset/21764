There is not a lot to say that hasn't been said about this movie. It rates in my top 5 all time favorites. I have everything from the Die Hard collection to Godzilla, but this is the DVD I'm waiting for. I like art-house, and pretty much anything that is good, and that has style. This movie is great and has a lot of style. The characters have been brought back through time, the acting is superb, the scenery is stunning. The opening scenes portray a dreary England: Dismal weather and almost desperate people. All that changes in the second part of the film. The characters find a new zest for life and leave Italy much happier people. Only a machine could not be warmed, even a little, by this movie.

Please consider letting Amazon know that you are interested in this film being available on DVD. There is a box on the right side of the screen allowing Amazon to notify you when the film's available. This interest on our parts may encourage the studio to release this wonderful movie on DVD in all its widescreen splendor. Thanks. Ciao.
