10 Years ago, i was only five years old, and should of done what most 5 year olds do. But THIS MOVIE CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER!!!!!!  THIS MOVIE CHANGES LIVES!!! I remember the first time i sat down and watched it, and i was HOOKED, it think i watched if 4 or 5 times that day. Now, 1m 15 years old, and yes, i still watch this movie EVERYDAY ( i am not lieing, ask my friends). I haven't changed much. Im pretty sure i know the movie word my word, backwards and forwards, inside and out. So your asking, how did this movie change my life?? Well, i am going to be a marine mammal trainer when i grow up. Right now i am doing everything possible to make my dream come true. I am in the pre-course of marine biology, speech and debate ( for speech skills) and im signing up for scuba diving, PLUS Hundreds of countless hours of orca research. I know all the whales names at all 3 seaworlds, and the orcas at marineland ontario. ALL BECAUSE OF THIS MOVIE. If there is ONE person in this world that this movie effected the most, like emotionally, mentally, and phycologically, its me. You won't find ANYONE else in this world at the age of 15 that watches this movie everyday.
