In case I forget to mention it, Independence Day flat out stinks.

Very briefly, I agree with most of the other one-star reviews.  First, this picture is horribly mis-cast--Bill Pullman as the President and Robert Loggia as a general?  Ptooie!  Next, all trace of story logic is kicked aside so we can quickly move on to another "Awwwww", "Yee-Haw", or "Gobbless Amurrica" moment.  And last, the plot devices are so thin that I started having nightmare flashbacks of Sean Connery in Outland.

Still, Will Smith is an amusing guy and the special effects are as good as advertised.  What's the harm in cranking suspension of disbelief up a few more notches and enjoying the ride?  This attitude carried me up to the point that the valiant US Air Force bravely attacked the scum-sucking aliens in defense of a grateful world.  These bold pilots closed with a target the size of downtown Los Angeles and let 'er have it with a devastating salvo of Sidewinders.  As if a bunch of air-to-air missiles with 20 pound warheads are going to affect a saucer covering the lower half of California!  To say nothing of why get close at all?  Are they afraid of missing?  I fled the room at that point and could only finish the movie after the brick-to-the-forehead feeling went away.

People got paid money to write this dreck.  I recommend you don't give them any more.  If you feel you must experience the special effects or Mr. Smith's comedy firsthand, borrow your friend's copy.

Finally, I'm amazed that there are five or six different "special" DVD editions of Independence Day.  No matter how many times you rub it, you can't polish a cow pie.
