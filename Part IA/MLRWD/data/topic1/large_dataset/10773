I first saw this movie on British TV, and have since seen it in the States. I now have the DVD.  Judi Dench IS Queen Victoria. Billy Connolly becomes John Brown as the movie progresses. You are absorbed into the increasingly interwined lives of these two powerful people. It's as though you are witnessing history through some kind of time machine, while you form opinions about their relationship. The Victorian notion of referring to a person quite separately from the role that person performs, to the extent of each referencing the other in the third person is superbly portrayed. One observation on the ending -- it is rather abrupt, as though the director looked at his watch and realised he was about to run out of time (money). That's a minor quibble. Why this story and the movie that tells it did not receive Oscars for Dame Judi and for Billy is a question that everybody always asks. Buy this movie and learn what the Victorian era was like. Distinguish between the telling of history and the story-telling by all means, but just enjoy it, whatever it is for you.
