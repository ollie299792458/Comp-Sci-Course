I know that anything Megadeth releases turns out to be very good. This DVD was no exception. The music is solid, and includes a lot of awesome songs that are not much likely played live... like Ashes In Your Mouth... damn, quite good ! It also has an extended version of She-Wolf, where Dave and Al Pitrelli alternate awesome solos, just to end in an outstanding drum solo by Jimmy Degrasso.

This DVD features 24 killer songs comprising the finest of Megadeth's classic albums. If you are a hardcore Megadeth fan, this DVD is a MUST. And if you are not quite too much into the band but love speed metal music, you must also pick this one. It's a very low price for an amazing live set that even touches the fibers of non-metal lovers. The sound is just perfect. The solos and overall playing is flawless. It actually includes interviews from band members, in a classic Mustaine style... not too many words, but tons of music.

I definitely recommend this DVD. Have you ever had a Rude Awakening ? Get this piece of art and you will be for sure shaken out of your bed.

Hail Megadeth !!!
