Lost and Delirious is truly one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. When I first rented this movie at the local Blockbuster, I was debating to myself whether or not renting this movie was a great idea or just a waste of money. When I started the movie, I was  thrown into a world of confusion and sadness when I met "Mouse" played by Mischa Barton, who was on her way to the Perkins Girls College. I immediately developed an understanding of Mouse's shy, insecure personality when she was reflecting on the image of her dead mother. I was later greeted with Victoria -played by Jessica Pare, and Pauline - who was brilliantly played by Piper Perabo. Tori and "P", Mouse found out, were lovers who had an incredible bond toward one another. Unfortunately the two lovers were doomed because of the ever present homophobia that existed in Tori's parents, and her disgusting little sister. Watching Pauly pledge her undying love to Tory, and watching Tory reject her over and over again, made me feel like my heart was being ripped from my body. I have never felt such an incredible bond to a movie's characters, and I have never felt so sad and crushed about a movie's ending. This movie will leave you weeping, but it will also leave you with a better understanding of true love, how beautiful it is, and how easily it can be hidden by fear.
