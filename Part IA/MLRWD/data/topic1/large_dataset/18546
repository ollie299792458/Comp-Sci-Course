What a fantastic and inspirational movie this is.  Great acting, music, scenery and messages.  A film that should be shown to all young people.  Ian Charleson and Ben Cross, as Eric Liddle and Harold Abrahams, respectively, both deserved Oscars for the magnificent portrayals.
  One aspect of the film that most people don't recognize is that although Harold Abrahams was born and raised Jewish, and he defended that faith zealously as the movie progresses, he actually converted to Christianity later in his life.  This can be seen by the location of the services at the beginning and end of the film.
  People are bored by this movie??? Since this story (modified from the total truth of what happened) has great appeal to those of faith, morals, dedication and decency, what does that say about those who are bored?
  Yes, the movie MUST be redistributed in wide screen!  And I will buy it again when it is.  When that happens, I'll give it not 5 stars, but 10.
  This is probably my favorite movie.
