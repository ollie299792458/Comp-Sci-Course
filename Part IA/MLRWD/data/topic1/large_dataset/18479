I actually am a stormchaser, and this movie has inspired much laughter. I often joke that the only lines in the movie that make any sense are 'Go to the bathroom now, you may not get a chance on the road." And that is fairly accurate (both about the movie and about one of the greatest challenges in stormchasing). But unlike most Summer action films this one at least tried its best to be realistic. They did use some phrases in hopelessly wrong contexts, and they often made up their own phrases when it moved the dialog along, but then this is Hollywood. What can you expect.

That said, this was a fun film the first time, and we have watched it in the van while chasing many times, mostly for amusement. The effects are very good, and the cast is wonderful. Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of the best actors in a generation and here you get to see an early incarnation of him, and see him seem to actually be having fun. Yeah, get the movie, don't forget the beers. See you in Oklahoma this May.
