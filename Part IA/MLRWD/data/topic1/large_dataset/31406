Why a movie like Jaws needed a sequel at all is something that I will never understand. The first one was simply a masterpiece, a work of art that was brought to audiences due to talent and hard work. The most memorable part of the movie was the section where you see the three guys go out into the ocean to kill the shark. Now how would they outdo that?

Then came Jaws II, which was not really horrible but it was a movie that really didn't need to be made. THEN here comes the kicker... Jaws III. Basically, a killer shark gets into Sea World and, you guessed it, all hell breaks loose. The shark's baby ends up getting killed, which doesn't help matters any.

So what's your point, you ask? Well, there's quite a bit of bad stuff in this. The type of main characters that are used are so cliche. There's the rough and hard-headed "Sea World" architect and there's the smart/attractive biology girlfriend. The movie supposedly uses some "3D effects" but all I saw was some rather crappy stuff that may or may not have been 3D. One example is the shark in some scenes. The shark looked god awful. Watch the part near the end where the shark hits the control room. You'll get my point. Also, the feeling that was in the first one was missing. You know what I'm talking about, that feeling of terror of the water that seemed to have been part of the first movie. Jaws 3 was just not scary at all. A shark attacking Sea World?! Come on! That's just as bad as Jason Vorhees attacking Manhatten!

The only scene that I thought was good, and is why I gave this movie an extra star, is where the dude gets sucked into the shark's mouth. I have to admit, that was pretty funny(it also looked like he wasn't having a good time in there!).

I ask you guys not to bother with this movie. There's nothing in Jaws 3 that will keep you coming back for it.
