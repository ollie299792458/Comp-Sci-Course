I watched this movie knowing nothing about it, the plot, the actors, the name of the killer, anything.  I was not expecting anything like what I saw.  I pride myself on thinking that I have seen most of the horror movies out there, and never had I ever seen anything like this before(Blair witch included).  I think the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I am still terrified to death of this movie, and every time I hear the words "Leatherface" I get chills down my spine.  I was not expecting something this real, like you felt like you were there during the entire thing.  It is still a mystery to me how the people who made this movie managed to get this much hype about this movie without using any bad language, barely any gore, and barely any suspense.  What I mean by no suspense, is everyone just simply dies, there aren't any chases, except for one, and the fact that the killer is so close behind the person the entire time, and the fact that she actually manages to run into the killer's house, makes it that much more scary.  Even thought I didn't give this movie a perfect rating, I still recommend it to anyone who wants a good scare.  Tip:  To get especially freaked out, watch it with all the lights out alone at two o'clock in the morning, like I did.
