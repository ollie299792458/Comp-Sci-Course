I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I had really low expectations because it's a cartoon and the cover of the DVD made me think it's a movie for teens. I took a chance and watched it anyway because I love the scifi genre including time travel. The subtitles were fine. It's the first time I've ever seen an anime movie. As a result of seeing this movie, I'll definitely be more openminded about the possibility of seeing other anime movies in the future.

I did see one strange scene in the movie. There's a scene where Aunt Witch is talking, and then the camera focuses on a picture in the background behind Aunt Witch showing Aunt Witch as a young girl surrounded on either side by apparently her parents. Because of how long the camera focused on this picture, I thought the picture might mean something in the overall context of the movie, but nothing ever happened elsewhere in the movie that related back to the information in this picture. The whole movie was terrific, but I'm still bothered by the missing point of this seemingly wasted scene. Aunt Witch says she has time travelled too in addition to Makoto, but this is never really explained further anywhere. Why does her story appear to somewhat parallel the story of Makoto?

(There was another scene near the end that I didn't understand either, but that mystery was resolved by a comment made by another reviewer responding to yet another review, so now I understand better what happened in that other scene.)
