The "Halloween" films have a very funny and checkered History.  The first 2 Films formed a huge fan base and loyal following however "Halloween 3" departed from the Michael Myers Story.  While many people think "Halloween 3" was a box office bomb the fact is it did make money! If you adjusted its gross to today's average ticket price the film would out gross the most of the sequels that have followed it.

Now in 1988 "Halloween" fans rejoiced when after a 7 years absence Michael Myers returned to the silver screen and to major success!  I for one loved this entry into the series and the film did deliver the scares and a believable story.

In this film Michael once again is out to kill.  He Returns to Haddenfield and is out to kill his niece. Dr Sam Loomis is also once again out to stop Michael.  While not groundbreaking it is a worth while sequel.  It is the best sequel that doesn't have Jamie Lee Curtis.  Daniel Harris was a terrific casting choice.  She would later go on to be cast in the hit tv-show  "Roseanne".

Now I have bought the DVD and it has s a great picture and sound.  When Anchor Bay announced the Blu-Ray was coming out with 30 minutes of alternate and deleted footage fans were very eager to buy the blu-ray.  Now 2 weeks before the blu-ray Anchor Bay Quietly released a statement that those scenes "Are No Longer Included" on the new release.  Well without those extras the blu-ray release has nothing new to offer to fans.  A new picture transfer and new commentary is not worth the price.  What can the director say about this film that he didn't say before on his previous commentary?

Also if you have a blu-ray player it will upload your dvd just fine and the picture will be great.

I suggest if you don't already own "Halloween 4" and you want to buy it then buy the standard DVD.  The Blu-ray isn't worth the upgrade.
