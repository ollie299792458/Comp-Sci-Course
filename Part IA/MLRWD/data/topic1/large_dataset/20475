This film is one I recommend...an interesting character exploration of Charles and Bob develops as they undergo threat after threat to their lives...the interplay between the two brings out the best and the worst of human nature and values.  I appreciated this film's depiction of a truth found in life:  That those who have that which others seek (be it money, fame, success, respect, accomplishments, etc.) must always be cautious and wary of those around them and their motives for befriending or being involved with them.  I appreciated this film because it depicted this predicament very well...who can be trusted?  What are other's motives?  It also illustrated that there are those of principle and honor...no matter what the provocation.

The beautiful videography of the Canadian Rockies...the musical score...and the bear encounters were all superbly done.

I enjoyed watching this very well made film...and must also add that Anthony Hopkins has again given us an excellent performance of a highly intelligent man--the type of character he is perfect in portraying.

I highly recommend The Edge.
