Here's another great example of Pacino and DePalma working together after the infamous "Scarface". It took me a few viewings (as it does with any movie)to grab a hold of the guts of this film and the great directing work and the great acting as well. The film starts out with a bang and really grabs your interest, but it slacks off after that for a while until the first plot point which is about 35 minutes in. Then it grabs hold of you and sucks you in. Leading to a great climax and resolution. The climax is one of the best chase scenes ever done. The choreography of the action, unique and witty uses of the steadicam, and the awesome camera angles with clean, quick, editing, entice me to make a statement like that. You think you know the ending when the film starts but a clever twist leaves you thinking.
  As with all of my reviews, I am a movie maker, not a movie goer. An average individual watching this for the first time might turn it off halfway through. Bad decision. The preformance by Pacino may seem sub-par by most people, but it's my belief, he plays the role well and has a great vision of Carlito's lifetime after prison and how easily one can get caught right back up in things. He progressesw through it well.
This is Brian DePalma, Martin Bregman, and Al Pacino together again, for what would be, one of the last films they would all take part of. Not as intense as Scarface, but if you liked that film this one might prove interesting. The screenplay was adapted from a couple of novels, (which I never like) so at times it's trying to cover to much in a small space of time. It's a rather lengthy film and definitely has it's slow moments. If you've read the books, "Carlito's Way" and "After Hours"" written by Edwin Torres you probably might not care much for this film. But if you're a fan of Al Pacino, and watch it through a few times, I guarentee you'll love it.
