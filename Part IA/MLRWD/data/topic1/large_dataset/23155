Seeing this film with two greats was the only good thing about my Senior English class in high school.  Peter O' Toole had been and is still a favorite based on his performance as Alan Swann in My Favorite Year and over the years I've come to love Burton as an occupational hazard (teaching English).  It boggled the mind that this was not out on DVD.  I imagine a lot has to do with Peter being in that Venus film, and at the same time, the three month wait has me concerned.  I'll believe it when I see it.  And I hope I get to see it on my television soon.

"I HATE MY CHILDREN!"

"And you, Henry III.  Watch me put my royal foot up your royal buttocks!"

P.S.  30 May 2007.  Got it.  It's beautiful.  What improves upon perfection is Peter O' Toole utterly laying waste to the moron interviewing him on the commentary track.  Clearly this doofus is out of his element in dealing with one of the last great actors of the performing arts.
