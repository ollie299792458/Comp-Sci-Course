the only two things i like about this dvd is the location and in one of the extras a crew member is driving around a Royal Enfield motorcycle, which is one of my favorites.  the people involved in this mess have watched rob zombie's "House of a 1000 Corpses" too many times, as it is edited very similarly.  the acting is poor and story is really hard to follow as they keep cutting back and forth from present to past.  the story is not that complex to have to edit it such.  t&a factor is minimal.  with 5 women, you'd expect some nice scenes, but only get one where one of the characters takes a shower in the dirty and filthy locker at waverly!  doesn't make a lot of sense, but neither does this movie.  a previous review states this flick is an ad for victoria's secret lingerie, i'd change that to either WalMart, JC Penny or Target lingerie.  this movie is not worth viewing for any reason other than seeing the waverly sanitorium, which is pretty cool.  but then, there are some good documentaries out there to watch on the subject.
