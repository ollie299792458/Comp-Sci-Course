This review is for the MGM 2-Disc Collector's Edition of "For A Few Dollars More". I previously review the MGM "Man With No Name Trilogy" 3-Disc set which contains this movie plus "A Fistful of Dollars" and "The Good, The Bad & The Ugly". I gave the Trilogy set a low rating, not because of the movies themselves, which are all top notch, but because "For A Few Dollars More" was mastered in wretched, hard and distorted sound that was so bad it ruined the movie.  I assume that that MGM's single disc issue of For A Few Dollars more also sounds terrible, because it is the same version contained in the Trilogy set. Well, I am happy to report that the 2-Disc MGM Collector's set I'm reviewing here has solved the problem. The sound is very good on this set, and the picture quality is equally good. If you love "For A Few Dollars more", this 2-disc Collector's set is the version to buy. Stay away from the headache-inducing version in the Trilogy set and the single disc issue.

And suffice it to say that "For A Few Dollars More" is one of the greatest Westerns ever made. With high quality sound and picture, this 2-Disc Collector's edition easily rates 5 Stars!
