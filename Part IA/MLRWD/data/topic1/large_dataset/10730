In 1986, Clive Barker wrote a novella called "The Hellbound Heart" which was and by all means still is a brilliant example that in a space of roundabout 160 pages a skilled horrormaster like Barker can  convey horror and suspense enough to shock and scare the reader. Barker is  the same one who says that there are no new stories, only new ways to tell.  It is a refreshingly original story rich in gruesome details.  Then, in  1987, Barker himself got the opportunity to adapt his novel to the screen.  This film immortalized the legendary villain called Pinhead, played by Doug  Bradley. The film is just as gruesome as the book if not more. I'd say that  I had no doubt the film would be faithful to the novel because after all it  was the novel's writer who was directing the movie in the first place! I  just rewatched Hellraiser last night and I reread the book today. It's  short enough to be read in one sitting...and compelling enough, too! To me  this film is a contemporary masterpiece of the genre. It's not only an  excuse to show flayed, skinned glistening on screen, no. Unlike what others  say, there is a story here too, and to me at least, it's a very original  one. Andrew Robinson, Claire Higgins and Ashley Laurence give very good  performances to back up this film...but the real heros behind it are  director/writer Clive Barker and the special effects creator, Bob Keene.  The scene with Frank's reanimation has got to be one of the grossest and  most stunning effects I've ever seen. And also, considering this film only  cost one million dollars to do, I think that that price was a bargain.  Congratulations to all!
