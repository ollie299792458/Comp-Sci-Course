This is a relatively plot free movie that is essentially a characters study. In some ways it resembles two other movies of this type: Wilby Wonderful, and The June Bug. In fact Sunshine State and Wilby Wonderful both have a character who wanders through the movie trying to find a way to kill himself. Two threads that run through this story are a town's annual celebration, and the coming of land developers. These are not dominant plot elements, however, rather they seem to flow along under the surface, and break through at odd moments during the film. So we are left mostly to meeting and learning about several of the town's inhabitants. The difficulty in such a movie is to create interesting people who are not just stereotypes.

Edie Falco, as the woman who manages a motel and restaurant for her almost blind father, does extremely well. You catch her frustration in being burdened with a job that she doesn't want. She is an intelligent person who had wanted to be an oceanographer. Her father, who has a small part, is interesting as a man who struggles with his conservative and sometimes racist views in a changing world. Other inhabitants of Sunshine State border on the ordinary. While they provide us with modest interest, scenes often linger too long on them. Other folks who might be interesting are left in the shadows.

All in all I found this movie to be less satisfying than the other two films that I mentioned above: Wilby Wonderful, and The June Bug. The June Bug is an outstanding movie. Could I persuade you to watch those two instead of this one?
