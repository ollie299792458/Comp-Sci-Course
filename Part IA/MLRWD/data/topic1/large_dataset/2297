Satoshi Kon's Millenium Actress demands attention from its viewers -  time and space are plucked apart and rewoven over and over to capture the spirit of Chiyoko Fujiwara, once a famous actress but now retired, living in isolation for the past thirty years.
At last she grants an interview to a documentary filmmaker, Genya Tachibana, who has been devoted to her since his youth as a gofer in her studio.  He returns to her a precious token: a key, given to her in her youth by a mysterious, hunted stranger she has devoted her heart and life to ever since, even though she can't find him.
The key opens her memories, and she, Tachibana, his cameraman, and us start on a journey that weaves between historical eras, places, and the border between reality and the fantasy world of her film career.  Tachibana even finds himself becoming a character in the movie of her memory.
Kon uses muted color and even black-and-white throughout as story elements.  I found myself as devoted to her as Tachibana was. A great movie.
