First and foremost -- AMEN for releasing this great show on DVD! For anyone else entering full adulthood who watched and loved this show as a kid, it is a must-have!  For those who watched the show but were not completely nuts over it, I would recommend it too -- if not merely for the funny episodes but for the fashions most of us wore at one time but are not too cool (embarrased) to admit it!

Next, some complaints -- no bonus features!  Seasons 3 and 4 have some bonus features, but Seasons 1 and 2 are devoid of them.  Third of all, there's a pocket in the DVD box that made me think a pamphlet or booklet of some kind was supposed to go there.  SEason 3 and 4 also had the same thing -- what's up with that?

I hope that SBTB releases its junior high years -- the school was oddly identical and Mr. Belding was their principal, and there were no A.C., Jesse, or Kelly in the beginning -- but the  show was still fantastic!  I'd also love to see the Saved By the Bell -- the New Class on DVD (can't you tell I'm a SBTB-aholic?  Just a lover of corny 80s shows!!!)

Definitely recommended!!
