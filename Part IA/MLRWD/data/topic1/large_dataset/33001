I just watched this show and while I do have some problems with it, I disagree with another reviewer's statement that it was a campaign against manned space exploration.

The characters themselves point out some of the things they do that robots would not have been able to do and it is not true that the robots have no trouble with THEIR missions. Actually, they have a success rate about equal to that of the humans.

While I do think that the writer, in order to make it more exciting, put in too much danger and mistakes, considering that this depicts a great leap in exploration of space and that apparently this is a first attempt at such an ambitious mission, it includes enough success to justify the overall mission.

Were I to write this, I'd perhaps have the characters succeed just a tad more and I'd definitely change a couple things where even I, someone with not a whole lot of science expertise, would know better than to do what the characters did!

For instance, contingency samples are a must. Or they should be!

I'd also do more fact-checking than they seemed to have done because a few things that were said were out and out wrong. For instance, it is said that never before has an astronaut crew intentionally shut off communications with the ground.  Apollo 7, anyone?
