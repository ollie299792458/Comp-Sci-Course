This happens to be one of my favorite John Wayne movies.  Too bad the colorized version released by TNT isn't available.  This movie made you feel like you were actually there.  The footage of the PT Boats, fighting against Japanese ships and aircraft, under attack and on the attack against superior naval forces, was all outstanding!  It doesnt get any better. It captured the spirit of what went on during the early days of World War II.  If you want to get a better feel for this movie, read the book put out by the Naval Institute titled, "The Fleet the Gods forgot".  Read that book, then watch this movie again, and you will understand how acurate this movie is.  American sailors were in a desparate situation, and called upon to sail out and fight against great odds, with no hope of victory.  The Japanese had an entire fleet at the Phillipines, and were in the process of a full Invasion.  All the Americans had were a few PT boats, and they accepted the challenge to the best of their ability.  I read another review on this page placed in 2008 by Greg Norgaad, who said the movie was boring and gave it, very undeservedly, 1 star.  Not liking a movie is one thing, but to actually take time to place such a negative comment on to Amazon's web page, well, I think this person has way too much time on his hands and needs to take up a hobby.  However, his negative review inspired me to place a positive review in total support of this movie.  Buy it.  It is a great flick!  I highly recomend it.
