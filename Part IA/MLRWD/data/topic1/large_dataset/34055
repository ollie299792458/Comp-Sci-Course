Yes, I tried to appreciate it.  I stuck with it, watched it all the way through.  Yes, I paid attention.  And I was still left with a feeling that I had wasted nearly two hours.
The director spends the first 25 minutes showing us an obnoxious, loathsome photographer and the women he treats like objects while working with them.  Then he finally gets around to taking the pictures in the park that will figure into the plot later.
Eventually, there is a scene in a little building where a rock band is playing and the audience members sit there like they're at a funeral, while the guitarist rips off Pete Townshend by smashing his guitar.  Why the photographer went into this stupid concert in the first place is beyond me.
For that matter, why did he visit the antiques shop?  Why are there so many shots of him walking and driving?  All they do is take up screen time that could have been devoted to better pacing and an actual plot.
He finds a body, tells some useless friend of his about it, goes back to look for it, and surprise!  It's gone.  Well, did he think it was just going to stay there out in the open for weeks on end?
The ending is equally irritating, with the photographer watching some stupid bunch of performers/mimes pretending to play tennis.
And again I ask, what was the point of all this?
