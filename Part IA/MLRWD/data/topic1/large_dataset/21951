The first time I watched Tootsie was when I was 12 years old, heard this Stephen Bishop song on the TV, and surprised to see an oldmaid clutching a baby and looking admiringly at the baby's mom. The song seems out of place....  [After I finished that second half of the movie, I rewound the Betamax tape--my brother had already watched it full--and re-play the whole thing just for me.]

But later, how Dustin Hoffman made me believe he was a legitimate old lady in heavy makeup, in love with Jessica Lange but cant express it, was amazing.

This is one of the first movie that demonstrated great acting to me. Even Sydney Pollack's (the director himself) banters with Michael Dorsey and Dorothy Michaels are remarkably funny, something that many other movies has imitated afterwards.

It's a comedy, yes, but it also touched on unemployment, single parenthood, struggling for art and principle, how tv soaps are made,... what more can you ask more of a movie? Strong script, great actors, fantastic direction, good song...

The I Might Be You song has since become one of the quintessential wedding songs ever, but everytime Im hearing it in FM, it always reminds me of a man who cant express his love because he's disguised in drag out of necessity. What a combination, but it worked.

This DVD has no interesting special features whatsoever. But I dont need any thing more to give it 5 stars.
