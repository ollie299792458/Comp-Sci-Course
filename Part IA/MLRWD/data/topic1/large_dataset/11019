After six viewings (ok, so mainly the "good" parts, heh) I have analyzed what I loved about "The Saint".  Many of the bad reviews for this movie come from folks who seem to think it's an action flick.  Er, no.

It's a romance, people.  That may not be what the director/scripters originally intended, but that's the way it ended up.  A wonderful, stirring romantic origin-story that asks and answers the questions, "Why would someone become a professional thief?", and "Why would he change radically to become a "Saint", using his former talents for good?"

The answer, of coure, being love of a good woman.  Snicker if you must, but I still believe this can and does happen -- just with less sexy-looking people than Val Kilmer.

Elizabeth Shue plays the naive physics researcher and does it well.  Some critics felt it was ridiculous that she was presented as a genius but couldn't make a public presentation without having heart palpitations.  Actually that's 100% possible, I've seen enough brilliant engineers totally fall apart at management reviews.

Having disposed of these objections, I will say that Val's acting skills made the movie.  Watching his body language change with his accents and hairstyles was amazing.  There is a scene where he actually "morphs", instant by instant, in voice and expression from his thief persona to "Thomas More," the poet/artist/traveler who will steal Dr. Emma's heart.  Amazing.

His inner conflict was masterfully portrayed for those who notice subtlety.  He knows he can fool Emma - he HAS fooled her, completely - but then, is he "pretending" to fall in love with her or is it real?  What is real?  His self-doubts, his sudden perception of his inner emotional poverty, his impulsive decision to not steal Emma's cold-fusion notes because "Ahhh, I can't DO this... she's so great."  No melodrama, no beating the audience over the head with it, just... Perfection.
