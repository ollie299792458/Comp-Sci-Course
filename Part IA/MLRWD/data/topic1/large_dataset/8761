(This is a review for Kingdom of Heaven - The Director's Cut Four-Disc Special Edition)

I am a fan of Orlando Bloom, Ridley Scott and this type of movie, so when I saw the trailer of Kingdom of Heaven I was really exited about it...it looked very promising. I went the very first day to the movie theater with my girlfriends and we enjoyed the film but at the same time I was disappointed. I didn't understand many things...the movie looked rushed and everything happened so fast that I left the theater wanting more.
I didn't buy the DVD when it came out (I own all Orlando Bloom's movies) because I didn't want to see again what could have been a great movie and wasn't. Then I found out about this set and after reading some of the reviews I decided to buy it even though I couldn't imagine how big a difference a few more scenes would make....well let me tell you one thing...this director cut is a true masterpiece! It was like watching a complete different movie. When you see it you realize how badly mutilated the theatrical version was and I can't imagine Ridley Scott's frustration after seeing his great work destroyed that way.

Give this movie a second chance! Watch the Director's Cut and you will be pleasantly surprised....it is soooo good.....this is a set you will treasure....don't waste your money buying the regular DVD.
