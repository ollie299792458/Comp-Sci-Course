Right up front I'll state that I generally like movies that have well-defined plots, tell a good story, and have a satisfying ending.  So, really, this movie wasn't for me (or my husband, who likes movies with positive endings that exemplify the triumph of the human spirit).

However, having said that, I did recognize some unique things about this film that make it stand out (though I wouldn't watch it a second time).  There was some fairly innovative camera work, unique stylistic touches, grim realism superimposed on black comedy, and clever caricatures of some of the bizarrest of human behaviors. The result was that, even though the movie was unrelentingly depressing, at the end, all I could say about it was "That was just TOO weird!"

I love Neil Young, and, as some people have noted, his soundtrack was perfect for the "Too Weird" character of this movie.  It was grating at times and too loud; but then, that was what was needed.

The "William Blake" theme that ran throughout the movie was another strange touch.  Probably most of the people who watch this film will have as little idea who William Blake was as the protagonist.  The bizarre experience of seeing a Native American quoting William Blake in the grim wilderness is just - again - Too Weird!

In the end, trying to give credit where it was due, even though it was not to my taste, I have to say that it was truly a unique movie, probably worth watching once just to be able to say "That was TOO Weird!"
