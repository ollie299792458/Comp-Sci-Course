"Body of Lies", adapted from the same titled book by David Ignatius, is a superbly plotted, well acted, well filmed "intelligent" thriller.  The film presents numerous examples of covert "tradecraft" and techniques but avoids becoming a Geekfest.

The moral complexities and paradoxes of the "War On Terror" are fully explored here.  Russell Crowe's cynical CIA bureaucrat "remotely controls" Leonardo DiCaprio's field agent.  The tension between the clinical Crowe, who pushes buttons, and the in the flesh DeCaprio, who pulls triggers, captures the dichotomy of the foot-soldier in the field and his office bureaucrat commander.

Refreshingly, the "natives" are depicted sympathetically.  Jordanian Intelligence Chief Hani is a suave, sophisticated operator.  Even some of the terrorist suspects are shown as full human beings rather than Dick Cheney-George W. Bush "evildoers".

The film offers tremendous plot twists.  Its one weakness is the relationship that develops between DeCaprio's character and a Jordanian medical doctor.  Certainly, inter-religious relationships happen everywhere.  Many U.S. service people in Iraq have married Iraqi women, but DeCaprio's CIA character would be detested by all, even pro-U.S. Jordanians.

Still, this film is the Truth!  Can you handle it?
