If you liked the original Wallace and Grommit short movies, you will consider their WereRabbit adventures a crowning glory of claymation.  If you thought that the original three episodes were just OK (like I did), you are not going to swoon over this movie, but will still like it tremendously.  The characters are hilarious and the plot is incredibly clever, entertaining, and evenly paced (unlike the numerous ADHD slapstick animations so prevalent these days).  Aardman Studios have paired with Dreamworks Animations to create an outstanding full-featured movie that deserves a place in everyone's DVD library.  My only advice is to go for the widescreen DVD edition, rather than the fullscreen (I own both version, and the widescreen copy gives you a much better perspective of the panoramic sets utilized in the making of Wallace and Grommit).

As a final notice: if you saw the original three episodes and did not at all care for the two main characters, then this movie will likely leave you unmoved as well.  This is just not your style.
