It is sad that so many great works of art have been lost or butchered for various reasons over the centuries.  And even though it is often impossible to restore them to their original glory, it is a worthy effort to try to do so.  Recut and reworked after its original presentation in 1927, Metropolis will likely never again be seen in its original form due to lost footage; however, the creators of the cut shown on this DVD have given us a good sense of what that film was like.
Though my experience with silent films is minimal, a youth spent as a science fiction buff introduced me to this film.  I had seen bits and pieces of it growing up but had never sat down to watch the entire thing until I obtained this DVD.  What an amazing experience!  I am sorry I waited so long to see it.  This film intertwines a love story, revenge story and social commentary with amazing special effects to create a powerful movie experience.  Few movies today can achieve the kind of success that Lang was able to create over 70 years ago.
It is a bit sad to come across those moments in the film where text has to break in and explain what happens in footage that has been lost.  (The intriguing character of "the thin man" has been almost entirely lost.)  Still, the creators of this cut have done Lang yeoman's service.  You have not seen Metropolis until you have seen this cut.
This DVD also contains an excellent documentary that details not only the making of Metropolis but the trends in the German arts that led to its creation.  We also get information on Lang's career after Metropolis and the work done to restore the film.  I highly recommend this DVD.
