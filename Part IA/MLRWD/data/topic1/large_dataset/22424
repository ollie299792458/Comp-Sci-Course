"The Wolf Man" is my favorite of the Universal BIG 4 (Frankenstein, Dracula, The Mummy, The Wolf Man). Made ten years after the other three, The Wolf Man exhibits a higher production value. Like The Bride of Frankenstein, the Wolf Man has a splendid score. Dracula and Frankenstein suffer, in my opinion, by comparison from a minimalist score. Watch the new DVD release of the 1931 Dracula with the new score by Phillip Glass (played by the Kronos Quartet) and hear the difference.

Mood, Mood, Mood - The Wolf Man has it. Also the acting in The Wolf Man is in general quite good in comparison to other Universal Horror films of the time. Sure, the Wolf Man, isn't particularly scary to viewers in the 21st Century, but taken for what it was in 1941, it's a COOL movie!

This DVD version (and the Legacy Collection) has some cool extras: Documentary (really good), theatrical trailer, theatre posters and original art, and feature commentary.

Solid 4.5 stars, buy it or rent, but watch it over and over!
