After all of the hype surrounding this movie before it even came to the theaters, I was expecting to be wowed. Instead I was sorely disappointed. I just wasn't feeling it the way that I felt movies like The Five Heartbeats, The Temptations, and Lady Sings The Blues. I watch these movies over and over. The acting in Dreamgirls was so-so. Jennifer Hudson did just okay, nothing spectacular. Beyonce did all right. Annika Rose is a very good singer and actress, but everybody seemed to be focused on Jennifer Hudson, because of the American Idol thing, and on Beyonce just because she is Beyonce. Out of all of the songs from Dreamgirls, I think that Beyonce's "Listen" is the best. I could listen to it over and over. I own Jennifer Holliday's CD, and I listen to her version of, "And I am Telling You I'm Not Going," but I doubt if I would listen to Jennifer Hudson's version over and over again. Not that I'm dissing Miss Hudson. She is a good singer, but just that...nothing spectacular. I've never seen the Broadway version of Dreamgirls, but I'm hoping that maybe it has more of an edge to it than the movie.
