Three words, NOTHING BUT FUN! This is one of those sequales that is equally good if not better to the first film. What makes this film better is that there are lots more fighting, the comedies funnier, and the film moves along at a faster pace. The film also dose that entire thing a sequale should do, hafe of it has to give you what the first film did, and the other hafe should be brand new and fresh. Rush Hour 2 dose both, which most sequlle dose neither. Only the two title charecters come back, but the new cast makes up for, that with great supporting charecters. Zang Ziyi was the perfect choice for the films villin [...] who gets what she deservers in the end. The reason shes such a great villin is that the audience can loath her for a few simple reasons, yet in most summer movies these days the villins are pathetic, and are totally unthreatining, Toumb Raider comes to mind (though that film was ok but that not important). I own the DVD and it's filled with lots of goodies, Directer, screen writer Commentery, 3 trailers, 2 Teasers, 1 Theatrical, 9 dealeted scenes with optional directers commentery, they can also be put back in the movie along with infini films option, 5 mineuts and 37 secounds of unshown outtakes, a 2 mineut student film by the dirctor, 7 short featurettes, and a evolution of scene. Rush Hour 2 it definetly the Rush of 2001, and it's one of the shortest and funniest 87 mineuts you will have watching a movie. This is definetly a party film, or the kind of film you watch when you have a lot of your freinds over, get out the popcorn and pop, and other snack. It action like you've never seen it before, gerentued, and that the best recommendation you can get. Highly recommended.
