When I first saw this movie I was skeptical. First things first: the box is pink and the summary on the back is very short and simple. I had heard of the television series in Japan and it didn't seem like something I would ever watch. I even wondered if the fact that Utena and Anthy were lesbians was just a fan courtesy. However, after watching this movie a million times and falling in love with it a new way each time, I have put all doubt aside.
The film starts out by showing off its graceful, colorful animation and imagery. Then it introduces the main characters. As soon as Utena and Anthy meet, the fun begins. Until the movie ends, prepare your senses to be bombarded with catchy, fast-paced music, a distinct and emotional pattern of color and a myriad of complex and often thought-provoking symbolism. No story can duplicate the mental and emotional connections made by the story of Anthy, Utena, Juri, Miki, Touga and all the rest. The subplots are highly complicaated and draw out each character's connection to the real theme of the movie: rebelling against what holds you back, letting go of your "necessary evils", and breaking through to become a new and better person: adolescence. The unusual bond that Anthy and Utena share only strengthens this idea, for rather than be captive to the taboos and social laws of the modern world, they have decided to "break through" and become free.
