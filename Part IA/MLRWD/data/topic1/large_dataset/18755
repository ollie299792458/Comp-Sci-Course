Ok, this movie is awful...but that's why it is so amazing.  I put this movie on with my friends and we didn't stop laughing the entire time.  Nothing makes sense--nothing.  That's why it is amazing.  You never know what is going on.  Is it a drama?  A comedy?  Why are they singing?  Why are they RAPPING?  Who wrote the script?  Were they on crack?  Who cares?!  This movie is the funniest thing I've ever seen.  The opening sequence alone is the most ridiculous four minutes that have been captured on film--the two "romantic" leads doing some "sexy" dream-sequence dance that is a combination of Saturday Night Fever and West Side Story, all in slow motion.  FOR NO REASON.  The soundtrack is out-of-this world.  I particularly enjoyed the catchy "I'm gonna be the most popular girl" and "Top That," during which two middle-class white kids, one of whom is dressed like a 40s gangster, have a "rap-off" that  trumps anything Vanilla Ice could have pulled off in his wildest dreams.  An instant classic.  WATCH THIS MOVIE AND YOUR ABS WILL TIGHTEN FROM LAUGHING SO MUCH.  peace.
