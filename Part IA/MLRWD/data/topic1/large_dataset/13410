As my title says, I bought four yoga for beginners DVD's and I found this to be best overall. What I like about this it gets you right into the workout (there is a Breath Primer and Posture Primer which you can program in or skip). Also, some of the beginning yoga DVD's I tried are way too slow. They talk and talk and you don't really feel like you're doing anything. Ana & Ravi have mastered the art of conveying all the important information with regard to executing the poses properly in as succinct a manner as possible WHILE YOU'RE DOING THE EXERCISE. They also give encouragement and inspirational ideas to conmplete your yoga experience. My thighs really felt it the next day after doing this, but in a good way. Usually when I do stretching the backs of my legs are tight for days. That didn't happen with this workout. My flexibility and strength and improving every time I do this. Bottom line, you really get the feeling that Ana & Ravi care about you when you do their workouts. With some of the other yoga DVD's I bought, I got the feeling that it was more about the instructor than me!
