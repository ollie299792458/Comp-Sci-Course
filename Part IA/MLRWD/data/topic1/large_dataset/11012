A little ironic that this turned out to be the least cartoonish Batman film ever made, isn't it?  On the heels of the overblown and quickly crumbling batman movie franchise, this movie was released to a very small box office return.  Yes, sad but true, but the god awful bad joke that was "Batman and Robin" grossed more money than this baby.  If the people only knew that despite using the animated medium that "serious movie goers" seem to have stigmatized as child's fair, this was as interesting, mysterious, thrilling and well done a Batman flick as one could ask for.  The origins of the Dark Knight are given to us in poignant flashbacks that are relevant to the plot (unlike the similar scenes in "Batman Forevor") and all the characters are deep and add to the beauty of the Batman mythos.  (Unlike...well, any other Batman flick, where the villains are an excuse for big celebrities.)  All comparisons to other Batman films aside, this was just an interesting and well told story.  Certainly worth the rental, if not the purchase.
