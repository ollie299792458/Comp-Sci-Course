This is the fifth and by far the best relation of the tale of the Mutiny on the Bounty.

The characters of William Bligh and Fletcher Christian are portrayed much more accurately than in the 1935 and 1962 versions. Hopkins and Gibson are stunning. The audience can clearly see the tension mounting as the men are recalled from their taste of paradise in Tahiti by an increasingly pedantic and disciplinarian Bligh for the return voyage to England, where many of the peasant sailors lived under virtual slum conditions. Christian is on the receiving end of all of Bligh's complaints about the state of the ship, but is clearly shewn to be of two minds while relieving Bligh of his command and setting him adrift.

Adherence to historical fact throughout the film is better than in earlier versions, which, in particular, tended to portray Bligh as an utterly sadistic bastard (in accordance with their being based on an inaccurate story book about the mutiny). It is apparent from historical records that while Bligh's manner was offensive at times, he was actually lighter on punishment than many of his contemporaries, and was concerned for the wellbeing of his crew.

The soundtrack by the Greek composer Vangelis is excellent.

This is one of my favourite films, and the mutiny on the Bounty is an important event in British and world military history. It demonstrates what can happen when people who have been largely deprived of The Good Life in their home country have their little taste of paradise snatched from them by an authoritarian representative of the King.
