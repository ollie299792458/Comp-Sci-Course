When I first saw this movie, I wasn't enormously impressed, however, the more I watched it the more I liked it. This movie sports some absoulutely GORGEUS artwork.  The music is great and the plot is alright, I just wish it was about a half hour longer! There is so much that could be expanded upon! The DVD edition is wonderful! The widescreen format allows us to see the entire beautiful picture just like in the theatre! The sound and picture quality is excellent! Even if you find that the story lags, the sheer amount of extra features more than compensates for it.  The trailers on the disk are great, especially the one that plays the Creed song "Higher" and the other where you can hear Verticle Horizon's "We Are".  The disk also includes deleted scenes, which help make some scenes make more sense. A featurette, development art, music video,multiple language tracks and a Director's Commentary which explains the Gau, a bird/batlike  alien species shown but not explained in the film. Although the plot is not perfect, it is still an excellent film.
