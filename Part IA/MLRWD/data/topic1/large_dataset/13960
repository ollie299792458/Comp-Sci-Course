While this movie retains many of the OLD style western film trademarks (indian chases, good guy, bad guy relationships), Stagecoach is where J. Wayne begins to develop real character depth.  The worst people (the drunk, the prostitute) are the dependable folks who take charge and get the job done when things get tough, and the respectable folks (army wife, banker) are really all talk, with no stomach for lifes realities.  This type of acting was new at the time, where characters actually worked to hide a part of what they were, which was different from their society-defined role in life.  More complex characters, and thus, more complex acting, sets the tone for both John Wayne's and Hollywoods future.  It was still shot in black and white, though, so don't expect great technological advances in film science or special effects.  You almost need to watch a couple of Wayne's earlier films before watching Stagecoach to really appreciate the difference.  If you watch his later films first, Stagecoach will seem like "just another old movie".
