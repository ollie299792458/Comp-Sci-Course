Jack Black becomes magnetized and stumbles into the VHS video store his friend Mos Def works at owned by Danny Glover which erases all the tapes there. Mia Farrow comes in to rent 'Ghostbusters', she shares she talks to Danny Glover every day.

  They tell her they will have the movie for her tomorrow, then they go about reshooting the movie themselves. Pretty funny, hard to resist the 'Ghostbusters' soundtrack.  The succeed in making a 20 minute version. Other people come into the store so they end up shooting everybodies movies: '2001' 'Driving Miss Daisy', and 'The Lion King' just to name a few. Pretty funny. They even invent a new word: Sweded-to make a Swedish version of a movie.

  Meanwhile, Danny Glover is checking out a Blockbuster-like place to see how a sucessful operation runs as the building they rent is going to be destroyed, even though he claims a famous musican lived there.

  In the end Sigorney Weaver shows up and says they cannot reproduce copywrited material. But everything turns out alright. Worth watching.
