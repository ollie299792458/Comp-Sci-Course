I'll admit it.  I'm a fan of John Waters' late 1980's films (Crybaby, Hairspray), but this can't even be placed in the same category of those films.  I was tricked into thinking that this movie had that same silly, campy, retro-humor like Crybaby and Hairspray.  I had heard that this movie was gross, but I tend to like gross-out films so I decided to give it a chance.

What a mistake that was.

I watched the movie up until the famous "Chicken scene".  After realizing "Oh my God, they are REALLY doing that!", and started to literally gag, I stopped the DVD, hit my eject button, and threw this steaming pile of crap into the garbage - where it belongs.  To think that anyone is this disturbed is a scary thought.  This movie has completely blown my image of John Waters.  To make a long story short, don't buy this movie like I foolishly did.  Avoid it.  But, if you enjoy extremely vile things, then this is the movie for you.

Also, if you're a Catholic, you might feel the need to go to confession ASAP.  Yeah, this movie is truly evil.
