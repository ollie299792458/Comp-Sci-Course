When I first saw this movie, I thought it would be justgood. But it turned out to be more, as it was a thrilling, fun, andpowerful movie. It had an explicit anti-war statement, and in some ways, I liked it better than Saving Private Ryan, which had the same powerful message and theme.  Being only 13 and a war buff and military obsessed, I enjoyed this movie  but learned a huge lesson. And that lesson is the fact that there is no  such things as evil soldiers. I mean, the regular German soldier fought for  his country's glory, while the US soldiers fought for protection, good  moral values, and to end the war, which makes them good soldiers. But then  again, the German soldier is only obligated to fight, and with an  oppressive dictator controlling everything down to the people's moral  values, he has no choice but to go along and fight because he was forced  to, not because he wanted to. It also shows that a crew of a German U-boat  is no different from an American crew. While Germans kill because they have  to, Americans kill not because they believe in the war, but because they  believe in helping their country and friends. But both sides are no  different, when it comes down to survival, which they do because they have  to.  The picture quality for the Director's Cut on both DVD and VHS is  spectacular. This film is much more detailed and realistic than other  submarine thrillers. The extra footage makes everything seem even more  real, as it shows everything happenning. And it's just not transitional  scenes, it also all-new sequences! The sound was awesome. When you put on 8  channel SDDS sound on a loud volume, you can hear every drip, creak, and  rustle. Das Boot is a great movie. See it or buy it.
