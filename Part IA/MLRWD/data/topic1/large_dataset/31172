5 stars for the movie itself; for the different disc versions, read on:
Nobody needs me to tell them that "Opera" is a great and twisted movie and you should definitely see it. I'm here to talk about the discs themselves. I purchased the two-disc limited edition DVD with the bonus CD. When I tried to play it, it skipped to the middle of the movie and then did a crazy jump-around and then stopped cold to the "This disc will not play" screen. I tried reloading it, and nothing worked. I returned it to the store, got another, which didn't even load that well, but went straight from the Anchor Bay logo to "This disc will not play." I have a year-old DVD player with, frustratingly, all the technical specifications actually listed on the DVD package, and no problems with any other discs, including other Anchor Bay discs. Finally, I traded it in for a copy of the single disc DVD which had a sticker on the back, obviously added after the fact, reading "Version 2.0." This one doesn't come with the music CD, but it has all the extras and plays on my DVD player just fine. So if anyone else out there is having problems with the "Opera" DVD for no good or logical reason, I can tell you that "Version 2.0" worked for me.
