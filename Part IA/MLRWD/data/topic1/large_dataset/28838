With the Christmas season approaching, I thought I'd give my review of Christmas Vacation. While some people are watching It's a Wonderful Life, I'm watching the hilarious antics of Clark W. Griswold. 
If you've seen the other Vacation movies, you know that poor old Clark W. Griswold brings disaster with him wherever he goes. Although, with this go-round, he stays home this time, trying to throw a "Good-old-fashioned-family Christmas". But, of course, there's disaster at every corner. Clark staples himself to a storm gutter putting up Christmas lights, which cause brownouts. A squirrel lives in his Christmas tree. His cousin's doberman brings down the house. Literally. His snooty neighbors won't cut him any slack. He puts an experimental kitchen lubricant on his pan sled.  And, on top of that, his hilariously goofy cousin (Randy Quaid) shows up without warning. 
The cast is great. Chevy Chase is, as always, histerical, as is Beverly D'Angelo as his smart-aleck wife. Julia-Louis Dreyfus is great as one of Clark's stuck-up neighbors, but the funniest role has to be Randy Quaid as Clark's redneck cousin, Eddie. Quaid was perfect for that role, as well as the rest of Clark's and Ellen's families. I also like the animated Santa intro to the movie, where Santa visits the Griswold residence. If you think you're having a bad holiday, one viewing of this film will quickly change your mind. If you don't laugh at this movie, I will come over to your house and force you to watch this movie several times over. You have to see Christmas Vacation at least once. How could you not laugh at Clark's antics?
