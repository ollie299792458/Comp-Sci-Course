I have a strange fascination with mega fauna, the normally forgotten category of animals that came after the dinosaurs and before the rise of humans.  Most people would know of the woolly mammoth, but not the giant sloth or the elephant bird.  These animals catch my attention because of their resemblance to present day animals and their uniquely large size.  I also love random facts, such as the speed of ketchup or how the sewer system was made in the US.  This series marries my two loves and succeeds wildly.

This series captures the excitement of these random animals and time periods that aren't hugely popular like the dinosaurs.  The each episode was a mini story, making it more interesting than a straight documentary.  In addition, each episode touched on time periods, animals and facts you might never had thought about.  Like huge carnivorous whales the size of a blue whale, or gigantic birds that looked like ostriches on steroids.  I loved the new ideas that the series brought to my attention.  Random and interesting.  Off the beaten track.  Just the way I like it.
