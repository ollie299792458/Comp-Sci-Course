First...there was Elvis Presley-THE KING OF ROCK AND ROLL.  Then, there was James Brown-THE GODFATHER OF SOUL.  And now, there is Al Pacino-THE ULTIMATE GANGSTER IN MOVIE HISTORY!!!!

I would rate this movie with unlimited stars...but unfortunately...they only go up to five on Amazon.  This movie has everything for the ultimate gangster movie-The script (i.e. "SAY 'HELLO' TO MY LIL' FRIEND!"), the characters (Al Pacino (PERFECT GANGSTER!)), drug money, crooked cops, gore (NOT TO THE EXTENT OF HORROR FILMS, BUT ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THIS REALLY HAPPENED) explosions, guns, guns and most importantly-MORE GUNS!!!!!!!

This is not one of those fake movies where when a guy gets shot in the leg he is still able to run at normal speed. HA! no way...when a guy gets shot in the leg in this movie, you better believe he will stay down! (he might still be alive but he aint gonna do no more runnin' for a long time).

Tony Montana (Al Pacino), comes from being a low-life prisoner of Castro's; a "scumbag" murdering street gangster, and goes "straight to the top."  He has everything anyone can want-money, cars, "the girl," friends, mansion, and his own private security force with no rules, no law, and NOBODY to tell him what to do next...UNTIL...he makes one wrong move against his new partner Alex Sosa (Paul Shenar), wich soon after leads to his downfall.  THE ENDING OF THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS!!!!!!!!

If you want the best movies in your collection, you would be a fool not to add this one to your collection!

TONY MONTANA~ THIS ONE'S FOR YOU BRO!!!!!! (KEEP IT UP AL PACINO! YOU THE MAN!!!)
