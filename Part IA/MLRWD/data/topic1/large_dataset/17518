The choreography in this DVD is both interesting and challenging. That is why I gave it 4 stars, despite my frustration with the poor cuing. I find myself having a great time and wanting to do more of the workout each time I use the DVD.

I am a dancer and have been doing dance, aerobics, pilates and yoga videos for many years. Nevertheless, it took me a while to get comfortable with this DVD. The fast pace of the workout makes good cuing essential. Unfortunately, Jennifer's cues are often late or unclear. As a result, you have to rely more on your memory from the last time you did the workout, on the rhythm, or on your intuition as a dancer, to help you figure out what comes next.

I would not recommend this video for a beginner. I WOULD recommend that intermediate and advanced dancers be prepared to do shorter segments of the video the first few times in order to avoid frustration, or to "fudge it"  a bit in order to keep pace and stay with the rhythm.

Despite this problem, I found myself loving every segment of the DVD-- including the hip hop, which I have never been interested in before. The blend of hip hop, Latin, jazz and ballet means that you are never bored. I also think the ballet segment is a great addition at the end of the DVD because it allows you to elongate your muscles after tightening them up.

If you love to dance and have plenty of experience following an instructor, you will find that your patience with this DVD pays off in the end.
