"Police Squad", which spawned three hilarious movies, was brilliant when it first appeared as a summer replacement on ABC in the 70's.  This is a takeoff on all the cop shows of the day, including some that Leslie Nielsen was actually in.  When the show was cancelled by ABC, the executive gave the lame excuse that the show required too much attention to keep an audience.

I've seen the first three episodes many, many times, and I seem to find something new to laugh at with each viewing.  The second three I've only seen once, about twenty years ago, and I'm looking forward to seeing them again.  Not just the visual gags, like the gunfight taking place with the two participants five feet apart, and of course missing every shot, but the dialog really show the care and intelligence that went into crafting this gem.  (The police scientist doing the "Mr. Wizard" kids science show shtick is uproarious; "Next week, Timmy, we'll learn why cows look forward to being milked.")

The late Leslie Nielsen really seemed to hit his stride when he left drama for comedy, and this was his follow-up to the Abrams/Zucker/Zucker Airplane! series, working again for them on the little screen.  He and everyone else on camera are blithely unaware of the jokes they're speaking, or living, and there are no sly winks to the audience.  It is played straight dead-pan, and completely seriously.

I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes to think a little, and laugh a lot.
