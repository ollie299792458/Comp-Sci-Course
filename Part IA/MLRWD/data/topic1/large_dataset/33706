My sister sent me some money for my birthday...and this...and "Giselle" are what I bought with it.  My sister asked me why I wanted to buy a ballet (TWO, actually), and I said: "Well...there are NO commercials OR dialog...
just attractive people moving around beautifully to tell a story accompanied by magnificent music."  And THAT
my friends is the secret of ballet.  "Sylvia" is particularly delightful, because I have long been familiar
with the music...but had never seen a production.  This production is wonderful.  The dancers are all excellent,
the sets and costumes are beautiful....and I had to look out the window to be certain I had not walked through
Covent Garden to get to the performance!  I hadn't...it was still good old San Diego outside.  I have several
Royal Ballet performances on dvd and/or blu ray....and they always bring quality and and abundance of pleasure
to every production.  I have had blu ray for less than a year, but it brings a great deal of delight...if I
were to go to the ballet....it would cost me $80 and UP...to have a seat where I could see so beautifully...
this way...I can enjoy it numerous times.  I thoroughly recommend this blu ray production....it is delightful.
