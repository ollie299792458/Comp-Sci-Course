BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!! I have watched this movie hundreds of times and i never get sick of it.  Rollerbladers shreding down "Devil's Backbone", crazy pranks and the ocassional jack black thrown in there really makes for a funny movie.  I love the story about a sufer that ends up in Clevland, smack dab in the middle of a snow storm, booya!  Mitchell tries to fit in but the guys dont seem to buy it but the ladies sure do. Snake also has a 1.1 GPA.  Always a good time with the sufer dudes, but dont forget the po dunk ghetto kids and then the preps.  Hockey is the sport, Wylie's dad drives a zambonie.  Wrong goal surfer dude, BAP!, gets creamed and then some.  Sand in the locker, wet tp and some iching powder can't hurt the mahurushi. So Mitchell gets his blades and then tears up the city making friends as he goes along, then aaaawww, there is the love of his life, better show off, oops cracked my skull, lets go look at plants and flowers, you better know your stuff because its a test.  Ladi dodi, its time to depants some preps...hmmm.  Crazy sufer kids!! DEVIL'S BACKBONE,  its a race to the death with only one thing on their minds, who gets the chicas, nope, first team to get three across the line wins.  Sucka!!, sufer dude rules the air and shows off his incredible talents by flying through the air making sure to pose for the camera and eventually throwing king prep into the water.  The end
