I sort of lost track of the Rocky series after the first one--which I loved.  I generally don't go for "franchise" movie sequels, but this movie totally took me by surprise--it was that good.  My family has watched ROCKY BALBOA several times now and we like it better each time.  We especially appreciated the commentary by Sylvester Stallone.  The themes of the first ROCKY film are still there:  don't let what others think or say about you deter you from what you know you are called to do, make the best of who you are and what you have (imperfect though that may be), treasure and support your friends, when you are going through tough times and loss let yourself feel what you are feeling, reach out to others even when you are hurting yourself, never give up, and so on--but there is a sensitivity and sweetness to this movie that I haven't seen in a film in a long, long time.  ROCKY BALBOA is edifying and redemptive while not being preachy.  It's the kind of movie you feel better after having seen it but, at the same time, you are thoroughly entertained.
