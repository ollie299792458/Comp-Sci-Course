There are three theories. George Reeves commited suicide because he believed his acting career was over. He was typecast as superman for life , and the tv series had ended. He was also financially desperate. A good reason to believe he shot himself. But logic will tell you he didn't. With guests just downstairs from his bedroom do you really think he would shoot himself just then and in that moment? Another theory is that a hitman hired by Reeve's former lover's husband (MANNIX) went to the house to shoot him. But this is not logical since a hired gunman could have picked a better time to kill Reeves especially since there were guests in the house. The third theory and what I believe really happened is that he was shot accidentally by Reeve's live-in girlfriend. This explains the two bullets on the floor in the bedroom. This explains why the guests waited 45 minutes to call the police. They needed time to come up with a story.  After viewing Hollywoodland this is the impression I got. The film is beautifully haunting, but hampered by Adrien Brody's relationship to his own family which takes precious screen time away from what we really want to see on the screen. Granted, I understand that this is a story about fathers and sons.  In a way Reeves was a father figure to millions of kids as Brody is to his own son. Afleck as George Reeves just doesn't really work for me.  George was a terrific actor. It's a shame that he never saw it that way playing Superman. The Superman series today is beloved by millions of people all over the world. In the end perhaps Reeves did attain stardom. Sadly it had to be in death that this status was achieved.
