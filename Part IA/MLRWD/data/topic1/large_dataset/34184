Most people fail to realize that there is an unkown trilogy in the Trek series.  (Now at nine movies, and ten is being produced)  In ST2, the theme was Admiral Kirk wanting to get the command of a starship.  Obviously in that movie, Spock dies.  That set up ST3.  Admiral Kirk and his friends steal the USS Enterprise, and thus become criminals and trators to the Federation.  Kirk does this to save spock (which he does), but ends up on Vulcan for a long time.  In ST4, We pick up at Vulcan.  Spock has to learn everything again (logic, and many other stuff), Admiral Kirk polls the crew and decides to go back to Earth and face charges by the Federation, and serve obvious Jail time.
As he is set to come back, a probe enters Earth's orbit and begins to suck up all the water on the planet.  Evidently, they are searching for a species that they have been speaking with for centuries.  The humpback whale.  Yes, apparetnly the sounds of the whales went through space and met up with some alien out there.  Kirk decides that he must save earth, and goes back in time to retreave a whale.  He goes from 2282 to 1986.  Humor abounds when Kirk has to hide Spock's ears, and claim that he is just on "LDS".  Very funny stuff.  Anyway, they return to the 23rd Century, and release the whale, and they talk to the probe, and the probe leaves.  Boom, earth saved by Kirk again.  (As he did in ST1)
He still must face trial though.  At the trial, Kirk is punished, but not as badly(i mean come on, he just saved the earth!)  He gets demoted in rank and becomes Captin of the USS Enterprise-A.  The story ends, Kirk is back in starfleet, is back as a Captin, thus ending the whole story that started in ST2.  This is the best of the little trilogy though, and is a must buy.  Very good film.
