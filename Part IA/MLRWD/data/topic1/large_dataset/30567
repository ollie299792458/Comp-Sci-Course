The Tillman Story is the sad tale of the Tillman family's quest to uncover the truth about the circumstances surrounding the death of Pat Tillman.  The story is told in broad brush strokes and for those who already know something about the Tillman controversy, there is nothing really new in this documentary.  The strength of this film is the interviews conduced with Tillman's family and former army colleagues. Their words humanise the documentary's subject and give him a dimension that the US government, military and media stole from him.

I found the DVD itself a little disappointing.  When it was first announced that The Tillman Story was to be released on DVD, some websites reported that the disc would include extra content such as a featurette on Pat's legacy.  Unfortunately, the disc has only one special feature - a commentary with the director.  As with the film, there is very little new information revealed in the commentary.

For me, the most interesting part of the commentary was hearing why the director didn't disclose the names of the men who shot (and ultimately killed) Pat and an Afghan solider.  He said that it would be "unfair".  I found the comment odd.  Regardless of what punishment they received, their culpability is a matter of public record.  As such, I think it would have been more honest had the men been named.  That said this is a small point.  The purpose of the documentary is to explore the myth making that ensued when Pat died.  In this regard, the documentary succeeds.

All in all, The Tillman Story is worthwhile exercise even though it is frustrating that there isn't a more fulfilling or just ending.  It is a shame that the film wasn't nominated for best documentary at the Oscars.  The added publicity may have lead to a more satisfying conclusion to this whole affair.
