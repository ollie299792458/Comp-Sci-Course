From a cinematic point of view, this movie was a fine work of art.  I was taken by the landscape and by the performances of Wes Studi as Geronimo and Gene Hackman as "Nantan Lupan."  But what this fan appreciated most about this movie was the appearance on an unsung military officer by the name of Charles Gatewood - it was past time for the part he played in the "Apache Wars" to be acknowledged.  Gatewood was apparently an individual of some integrity and appeared to be able to carry out his orders with dignity and compassion.  For readers interested in discovering more about this officer, I would suggest that they read the excellent material on him written by the historian Louis Kraft.  Gatewood was rewarded for his exemplary service to our nation by becoming the victim of the pettiness and selfish self-centeredness of Nelson Miles, the officer commanding the Apache campaign at the time of Gatewood's service.  I wish there was a way to commend Gatewood, and censure Miles.  While this movie fictionalizes some key points in the chain of events and does little to honor the Apache people, it succeeds in bringing to light the labors of good human being attempting to be of service to his fellow man - regardless of skin color, rank or station.
