Ok firstly, i'm not going to verbally abuse this series because i know there are peoply who will thoroughly enjoy it.

I am a huge fan of horror (especially anime horror) but shiki didn't do it for me.

I found it slow moving, boring, tedious and it wasn't scary or gory in my opinion.

Every so often it would show a grotesquely drawn character for a split second and then i'd have to wait 6 episodes for anything remotely interesting like that to happen again.

I didn't like the art style at all. The hair on pretty much every character set me into extreme fits of annoyance it was that bad.
The characters are boring and live in a boring town etc etc.
If your looking for a chilling psychological tale i would go with higurashi no naku koroni or ghost hound.
If its gore your after then i recommend elfen lied or mnemosyne.
I would pass on this one. if you do feel like you would still like to see it then download the first 5 or so episodes and then make up your mind before you decide to buy.

Catch.
