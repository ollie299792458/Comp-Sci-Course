Well, i'm in two minds about whether or not I enjoyed this movie. To say that it's over the top would be an understatment. No other film that i've seen shocked me more then this and Cannibal Holocaust (apart from Salo). The fact that it contains REAL animal cruelty and abuse makes it even more difficult to watch. The usual 'it's just a movie, it's just a movie' reasurance gets flung out of the window and your left wondering what sort of sicko made it.

I'm not saying it wasn't entertaining, because I admit (with guilt) hat it was enjoyable, however for all the wrong reasons. People think A Clockwork Orange and Straw Dogs were violent, they havn't seen this! Some of the rape was far far far worse here then in those movies, the only other movie comming close to the sheer realism is I spit on your Grave, but even that threw in abit of humour to bring down the shock value. Anyone who calls this humourous..... I wouldn't want to meet in person.

So why is it entertaining? Well, the simple answer is...I don't know. It just is. It's so far away from the ordinary movie, and so unreal in the fact that you can't believe what you are seeing.

But don't, under any circumstances view this unless you understand what your letting yourself in for. If extremly graphic scenes of rape and murder, plus real animal cruelty is not your thing......STEER CLEAR! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!
