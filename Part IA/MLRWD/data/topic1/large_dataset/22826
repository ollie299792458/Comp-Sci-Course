demonic forces are automatically scary and kiefer sutherland is a great actor. he was very believable as the fallen cop struggling to get back his family and his life. when he takes a security guard job in a burnt out department store, we know he's in trouble because we know what happened to the guy he replaced.

the idea of a supernatural entity living and traveling by mirrors is creepy but it wasn't enough to take this movie from a little fright to genuinely terrifying.

the ending was a surprise so that was good but getting there was a little tedious. the dialogue wasn't as strong as the actor's performances. there was a lot of repeating where one actor would shout out something and the othe actor would repeat it shouting too. it happened enough that i started to laugh everytime one character echoed the other one. paula patton plays sutherland's wife. she was a little boring but i'm glad the moviemaker's chose to portray an interracial couple with no racial fanfare. the kids in the film were great. i recommend seeing this movie if you've got some time to kill on a lazy afternoon.
