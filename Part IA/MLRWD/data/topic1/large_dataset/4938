The film does what "Last House" tried to do and while "Last  House" failed fairly miserably, "I Spit on Your Grave" takes  on a very realist and humanitarian vantage point.  It places you in a world  of agony and suffering as it explores the inhumane condition of a young,  fair figured woman brutally raped by a gang of vicous savages whom express  no regard for human life.  Its depressing atmosphere provokes the thoughts  of its viewers.  It is not gory but manages to be graphic in its nature all  the same. The let down comes in its slow-pace and 45 minute rape/nude  marathon through acres of woods scene.  Cinematically, the spacious  lanscape is briefly glimsed as the woman crawls from its womb, yearning to  reach her cabin where her perpentrators already await with more eager  sexual anticipation.  One character in the gang can envoke sympathy from  the viewers being that he is a misfit only scourging different branches of  society in search of his place within it.  The critical moment comes when  he rapes this woman, who he had earlier befriended.  The film takes a while  to evolve from its genesis and the viewer feels strung out by its slow  development.  However, those who stick with it will find their patience  does not come without its rewards as what they once mistook for an  exploitave, sleaze film is actually more-or-less an indepth look into human  ideology intertwined with an aspect of revenge and blood lust on the  woman's part.  NO character is left undefined, crucially, in death their  guises of masculanity and overpowerment slip revieling the fear they  carried deep within them all along.
