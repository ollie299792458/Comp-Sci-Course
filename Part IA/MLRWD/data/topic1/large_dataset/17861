I was anxious to own a movie that is basically scripture acted out on screen. Though this is "the book of matthew word for word" don't be surprised by a little interpretation that you may not be expecting. I can appreciate the light heartedness that Bruce Marchiano brings to the role. He does, however, seem to go a bit over-board. There are times when I'm thinking, "why is he smiling when he's saying that?" He also is quite physically affectionate with everyone. I'm NOT saying he is being romantic or anything, but he is constantly "petting" (that's the idea that came to my mind) people. I enjoyed the more serious scenes very much! And I enjoyed Richard Kiley as Matthew. Bruce, is also a bit too American for me. His very american voice and light eyes distracted me sometimes from really connecting him with Jesus.

Dispite some of these difficulties, there was still more than one time that tears rose in my eyes to see the wonderful story and teachings of Jesus. Certainly worth a look!
