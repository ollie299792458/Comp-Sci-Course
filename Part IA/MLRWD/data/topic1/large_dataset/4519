Let me start off by saying I'm not a fan of this type of movie: the one where you know the ending right off the bat, the one that makes love seem so easy, etc. But after my friends kept raving about it, I decided that I had to see THE NOTEBOOK, so I rented it the day it came out on video/DVD. The only regret I have is not seeing it sooner - it's that good.

Nowadays, the only movies that you ever really see are your oversexed teen comedies, horror movies, or romantic comedies that all blend together. THE NOTEBOOK is incredibly refreshing, with a touching story, amazing characters and plots, and, more importantly, a memorable story. I was amazed by every performance in THE NOTEBOOK (usually, I find at least one actor in a movie that I would replace), and all the characters are incredibly likeable (especially Noah...both young and old).

It had annoyed me that they had waited so long to release THE NOTEBOOK on video/DVD, but not only was it worth the wait, but it fits the season perfectly (releasing this six days before Valentine's Day was a great idea). I can't justify this movie with my review...just go see THE NOTEBOOK. It isn't your typical chick flick, seeing as I know a few guys who enjoyed it as well. (Though, you do want to have a box of Kleenex on hand!)

Highly recommended.

Overall grade - A+
