After buying and viewing "Enemy at the Gates" (2001), I was really looking forward to watching this German film, which was originally released in 1993.
However, after inital viewing, I realized that "Stalingrad" is not in the same league as "Enemy..." from a critical perspective.
"Stalingrad" is simply a foreign "B" movie, where "Enemy..." is a top notch Hollywood blockbuster.
Even most of the combat scenes in "Stalingrad" are disappointing.
Like the instance when GG "accidently" shoots his comrade inside the factory? Veteran Wehrmacht Stormtroopers couldn't be that stupid! Ah, but of course the filmakers want to teach us a lesson...
And later in the film, the attacking platoon of Soviet tanks and infantry should have completely routed the German "homeboy" platoon hastily dug in the frozen Russian steppe (with only one 37mm anti-tank gun!).
Instead the ill-equiped Germans destroy every single T-34 tank and enemy soldier. Oh, it probally isn't time for all the German characters in the movie to die miserably just yet...
And thereafter until the movie's end, not another "Ivan" platoon or even soldier is shown. What happened to the 3 Soviet Armies that encircled the city? Disappeared due to a low budget, I guess.
"Stalingrad" is missing the good drama that an essential war film should have.
Instead, I think this movie was produced with the main intent to help erase facist political problems which still plague the German people.
Film's Political Message: NAZI = Bad.
Too Bad the German people didn't realize this 60 years ago.
