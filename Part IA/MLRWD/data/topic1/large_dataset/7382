While this dvd is packed with extras, the concert is the only thing I have a problem with.
The performance is good, but not the best.  His past concert videos display much better energy and rawness...
The problem is with the set list itself.
It's pretty much a "greatest hits" album done live..and didn't we have this in 1991 with his album "Serious hits live"??

I would have liked to have heard some lesser-played album cuts in the set like "thru these walls", "Inside out", "I cannot believe it's true", "Don't let him steal your heart away".
Why does Phil think people just want the obvious, over-played "HITS"?

(the same thing happened with the recent Genesis tour--too many hits--but that's another review..lol)

Ironically, the best thing on the entire DVD is the "wild card", which is a 20-minute SIZZLING performance of AWB's "Pick up the pieces" with 5 stellar sax players--PUTTING IT DOWN! as well as George Duke on piano..who churns out an amazing solo as well.

The dvd is worth it for this performance and the videos, but not so much for the concert.
