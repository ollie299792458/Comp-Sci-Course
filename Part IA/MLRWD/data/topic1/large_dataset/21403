I absolutely love this movie.  It's reassuring to know that love is out there for everyone.  For me, it's just nice to know that there are movies out there that aren't filled up with nasty images and ear piercing language.  
So what if a some people went back a second time and "found" things to be uncharacteristic of "retarded people."  If you love/loved it the first that you see/saw it, that should be all that matters.  If you search for things that are wrong then you will find them.  Not everything needs to be criticized or torn apart.
My bottom line is this, I love this story with out a doubt.  It has quickly become one of my favorite movies.  Even though I may not be mentally disabled, I still know all about having parents who just can't let go and about trying to find that perfect someone.  The Other Sister is truly a divine love story, which also serves as a good reminder of how each and every person on this earth has feelings and how we should treat one another.  If Everyone could be as Forgiving and loving as Carla and Danny, then maybe divorces wouldn't exist! I would suggest this movie to everyone.
