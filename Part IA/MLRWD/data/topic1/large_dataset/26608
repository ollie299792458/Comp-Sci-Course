After watching this movie I am left cheering anxiously...for the expected Screen Actor's and Writer's Guild to strike and to end the political assault upon my senses. Inappropriately coined a "thriller," the movie was a high budget infomercial for the Democratic party, no doubt conceived over drinks in the White House and funded by campaign resources and presidential pardons. While I am often critized by others for my ability to separate my opinions and emotions for the critical enjoyment of an artistic endeavor, "The Contender's" complete lack of subtlety left me expecting an acknowledgement to the ACLU and perhaps a clip of Richard Gere ranting at the Academy Awards of the daily injustices of a world so keenly observed within his impoverished lifestyle. To his credit, Jeff Bridges does a better job acting than he does selecting movie scripts, and Oldman is convincingly jaded. Joan Allen, on the other hand,...well, at least she has the blessing of knowing that she can't be in a film worse that this, her latest.
