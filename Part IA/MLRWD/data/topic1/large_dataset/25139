Marvelous Classic Movie
 The Ten Commandments, with Charles Hesston like Moses, is a wonderful film and story from the Bible. The film describes characters from the town of Israel. Because of their disobedience, they suffer as slaves in the Egyptian empire. God the Eternal Father has mercy on Israel, and sends a savior. Moses is the savior. He was born in Hebrew home very poor. The Egyptian Pharaoh ordered kills all baby of his kingdom. The Moses' mother put in a basket, make the totora, hermetic closed and hurler to baby's Moses in the river. The sister of the Pharaoh, beautiful princess, found to baby's Moses in the river. She cared for Moses. Moses grew in the condition of a Prince, prepared for government. He learned the science and Egyptian culture and Pharaoh preferred him. One day he saw that a giant rock going kill to old Hebrew woman he savored to her. Other day he saw like an Egyptian chief mistreat a Hebrew slaves, so he immediately helped and killed the Egyptian chief. The enemy of Moses telled the son of Pharaoh and he waited where the Pharaoh, so the Pharaoh let in hand of his son, Moses was letted in the desert for that die and he survives. He arrived to home of Jetro, Priest de Median and married with Deborah, daughter of Jetro. He returned to Egyptian and free to Israel.
