Bought this dvd in our base PX on Xmas.  I had watched this while doing night shift in the commo cell, and I couldn't stop cracking up.  The homage to George Romero with Dennis Hopper (who played in Romero's "Land of the Dead") and General Patton fighting ACLU zombies was priceless. The performances of Robert Davi, Serdar Kalsin, and Geoffrey Arend as the terrorists, Aziz, Ahmed, and Mohammed were wonderfully rememnisant of the old World War II-era Three Stooges classics like "They Stooge To Conga" where the Stooges lampooned the Nazis just as Davi, Kalsin, and Arend lampoons the IslamoNazis.  The University scene was all too true, especially with my experience in college dealing with faculty who were still stuck in the '60's.  And finally, Trace Atkins' "Angel of Death" and the scene of Hollywood after the IslamoNazis take over was great.  Aside from the comedy value, the scenes of alternate history that would have resulted if the advice of Micheal Moore and the liberals was followed, such as in the Civil war or World War II, can make one think.

Notable mentions is Kevin Farley's protrayal as Micheal Moore (Malone) as buffonish, arrogant, hardheaded, selfish, and inconsiderate were right on the mark given reports of Moore's arrogance in real life.  Kelsey Grammer was great as General Patton and Jon Voight's protrayal of George Washington was really touching.  Dennis Hopper was one good choice that made the George Romero homage scene work (Ken Forre would have been good too and Duane Jones would have been perfect but he's sadly deceased) and it was a good surprise to see regular tough-guy actor Robert Davi can do comedy as a  modern day Moe.  I don't expect liberals to like it as my dealings with them have shown me that they have no sense of humor whatsoever, but I highly recommend it.  I think it would be best enjoyed with a showing of "Team America."
