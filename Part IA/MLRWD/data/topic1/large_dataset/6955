And definately NOT worth $14.99 - more like $4.99...or maybe $7.99...

The concept was good, though not exactly fresh - other writers/directors/studios have attempted to modernize Shakespeare, with varying degrees of success, but most of the really great productions that I've watched (read: RSC or Judi Dench or Kenneth Branagh or Ian McKellan or Laurence Olivier or Orson Welles or Akira Kurosawa) tend to maintain a pre-technology feel to their story: 10th century Scotland, 15th century England, 16th Century Japan, 18th century Scandinavia - back when people actually tended to talk like that (except of course Scotland, and Japan - and probably Scandinavia, too)...basically before the advent of modern, Industrial English with it's truncated speech patterns and change in syntax...

If we're gonna "modernize" the story, especially post-World War II, then we might as well modernize the text and syntax to match - there's just too much of a disconnect between Queen E's Society (which lasted well into the 20th Century) and our own post-modern world of Industrially-Polluted Cynicism. Modern speech patterns in a modern world would create a much more interesting - and believable - film to watch...

Some of the re-interpretation actually did work - at the creative level...although the quality of acting and the style of editing tended to lessen the impact of creativity. I'll definately watch this version again, to see what can be translated into other contemporary versions - but only because I already bought it - and there's no sense letting 14.99 go to waste...

To those involved, who gave Valiant Efforts
All my best in your Future Endeavors...
