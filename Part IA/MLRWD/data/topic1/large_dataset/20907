This is an essential item in the Star Wars timeline, not because it's a sequel to Clone Wars Volume One but because it's a prequel (of sorts) to Episode III.  Now the rest of us get the answers to important questions raised by Revenge of the Sith.  When did Count Dooku train General Grievous?  How did Chancellor Palpatine wind up in the separatists' hands?  Why is Grievous less formidable in the movie than the cartoon?  It's all explained here.

I have high praise for all of Clone Wars Volume Two's features.  Animation is smooth, apparently computer generated at times.  All of the classic Star Wars sound effects are present.  The show's story and dialogue seem better structured than the movies'.

The best special feature included is the Revenge of the Brick trailer from LEGO.  How would the Star Wars universe exist in the world of LEGO?  This very amusing CGI spoof will show you.

If more of the video games and the movie prequels contained this level of quality, Star Wars would be even more universally renown.  This saga of a galaxy far, far away deserves nothing less.
