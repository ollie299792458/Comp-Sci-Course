When I first began to watch "What Women Want" I thought "Here we go again", another silly comedy with tons of sex jokes, right? Wrong! This film is very sweet and charming and might I add well written and directed. Mel Gibson plays a playboy ad executive who verges on the misogynistic. One day, during a freak electrical storm (is there any other kind?) he is zapped and wakes up with the ability to read women's thoughts. At firs he abuses this newfound power to bed them, but soon figures out how to help women with their problems. His reading of their minds lets him know the insecurities that women have, and helps him connect with his daughter. My favorite section of this film is when Gibson visits the home of one of his employees who's condidering suicide and talks her out of it. The performances are all top-notch, but I must give honorable mention to Marissa Tomei who almost steals the pic form Helen hunt and Gibson. She plays a struggling actress who moonlights as a barrista in the building where Mel works. She has been hurt by many men and is hesitant in going out again. Mel, thanks to his super-powers, manages a date with her. It's on this date that Marissa's emotions run the gamut. Overall this is a feel good movie, that ALL men should see.
