this isn't the light hearted sequels that were put out after this one went threw the roof,this is very serious and was ground breaking in it's day!

  bleeding heart bronson has a change of heart after his wife is killed and daughter is raped and left in a coma bronson is sent to texas to help a project his firm (he's an architect) and finds one of his clients is a gun lover. on the return trip the client gives him a gift(another sign of age as he puts it in his bag and bronson is able to get on the plane with it) and suddenly he has a gun and now a cause,to get rid of the scum who have taken over his city. and get rid of them he does,setting out on night patrols to find and kill these slime. while he goes about his job the police try to stop him.

this is a very serious movie and not an action movie like the others in the series. the violence is excessive for the early 70's but that was the point and the whole vigilante theme wounld soon be made real in the country. this is one of bronson's best and he really pulls this acting job with great style. a must see and one of the best of the 70's
