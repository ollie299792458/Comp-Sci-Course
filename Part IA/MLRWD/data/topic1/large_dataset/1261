Born in the 70s and raised in the 80s, it's a constant struggle to fight against the tendency to view movies as just a source of visceral stimulation - as spectacles. It's a struggle to keep watching movies that don't have fantastic, juvenile Imitation Brand Plot Substitutes because growing up, that was all I knew. 
Movies like Sunset Boulevard are going to help change that, and I wish that they were still part of popular culture. I saw this last night and it was astonishing. For anyone who might equate old or God forbid even black and white with "boring," this movie is the cure. There's none of the easy titillation that's so easy to find today, but in a much more interesting and subtle way, Sunset Boulevard is very depraved and cynical. Even in the 50s, Hollywood was covering a culture of decay and depravity, of spiritual death, with the glossy veneer. Sunset Boulevard, on the strength of its sharp dialogue, expert direction, and dead-on performances, told a compelling story in an original way. It reminded me of Pulp Fiction, of all things, in the way you could feel that you were watching a director's vision unfold perfectly, like a meticulously planned 4 course meal.
Looking back on old movies it's hard to view them in context, as what was original and creative then has usually become co-opted and cliched by now. But this film manages to still feel new, and there were some truly sublime moments, like the shot of Norma Desmond's bedroom doors, with light shining through the ripped-out locks, like two empty eyes keeping watch over her boy toy - and then abruptly extinguish. 
There's not much point getting into the plot, which is described in 50 other reviews here. Suffice to say, even the most sensory-deadened product of the "blockbuster" culture can enjoy Sunset Boulevard, even today - the writing, directing and acting are that rich and exciting. Why is this not out on DVD yet?!
