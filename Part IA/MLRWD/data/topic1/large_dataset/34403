After several viewings of Naked Lunch I have now indulged on this new dvd rerelease from Cronenberg and I must say that he is intent on getting his message out explicitly to whomever views this film. We hardly see any modern science fiction films reaching up to this level of subject matter in such a raw demeanor which easily sets this a timeless classic in its genre. The subtlety of the plot makes each scene more abrasive in its aim to shock the viewer and the special effects really set the bar to the era this film was made. Also the developement of Max Renn's character is convincing as he is becoming more and more desensitized to The Videodrome until the boundaries between the two subjects become blurred and Max inevitably becomes a "monster" as a result of his exposure to it. Cronenbergs' stories seem to deal with the mutation of the human being with the more perilous being that we created with technology and the end result and not a pretty one. Such a criticism on our modern evolution is definitely the point he wants to get out in his films and although I have yet to see "The Fly" I'm sure it will be a proponent of this inherent philosphy. By interpreting it in such a creative and entertaing way do I rate Cronenberg as being of the greatest science fiction storytellers of late, portraying the plight of human existence in the realm of technological overstimulation. A must for any modern science fiction or post-structuralism readers.
