First off let me say that I'm a huge Ridley Scott fan, I have been since I was a kid growing up with the likes of Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise and so on, and I first purchased the normal DVD of this which is of course the theatrical cut, I couldn't even make it through the whole movie, it felt rushed and incomplete, I was left very disappointed, and for the first time I was disappointed with Ridley Scott, but later learning that it wasn't his fault, it was Hollywood taking and pretty much ruining the movie, because they felt it ran too long, and they butchered it, had this been the cut that made the theatres and home video releases first, this film might have won academy awards.

First off, the acting is superb, everybody gives great performances, that wasn't the problem with the theatrical cut anyways, the score is also excellent and perfectly fits the movie, the set design and special effects are outstanding, and if you watch the documentaries, you will see that there was not a lot of CGI in this movie, very little at best, they actually built a lot of those structers and filmed on locations in spain, and last but not least, the story, which is where this directors cut really shines of course, right off you will see scenes that were not in the theatrical cut, and the additional footage just grabs you, unlike the theatrical cut, I got bored about halfway through the theatrical cut, this one, I did not want it to end, it was just so well done, and shame on Hollywood for taking an epic of this scale, and butchering it because of running time, anyone who is interested in this time in history wouldn't mind sitting in a theatre for another hour, especially if the additional scenes really benefit the film, and they so do.

So bottom line, if you saw the theatrical cut of this movie, and felt disappointed like I did, you absolutely NEED to check this version out, they are completely different movies, like apples and oranges, now I just got into the whole blu-ray thing, because I just bought a player this month, and now I see why everybody is so crazy about this format, the picture is just so crisp and clear and detailed, the sound is so much more enhanced, not taking anything away from DVD, they are still a great format, but this is what it's all about, and this movie looks FANTASTIC in blu-ray, the costumes jump right out, especially the lepers mask, the sets and structers look like you're really there, and the sound like I said is just so superior, if you have a blu-ray player, and wanted to like this movie the first time and didn't, do yourself a favor, and buy this version, you'll see a completely different movie.
