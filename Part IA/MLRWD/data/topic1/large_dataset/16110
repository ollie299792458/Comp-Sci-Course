This excellent video narrated by Kevin Costner gives a vivid depiction of history.  The contact of Columbus and his relationship with the Native Tainos in the Caribbean was not a friendly sight to behold.  It shows what people will do for gold and how power is used to enslave others.  The video also shows how approximately 2 million Taino Indians became extinct after having contact with Columbus in 1492.  The second part of the video was about Hernando De Soto's contact with the Native Americans in Florida in 1539.  It shows the travels of De Soto from Tampa Bay to the Mississippi and what actually happened to the Native Americans who had contact with De Soto and his men.  The video shows how the use of weapons and disease destroyed many individuals.  The video is a great historical piece on the various Indian nations living back then, their location, customs, and some of their history. This video will leave you scratching your head and wondering why.  Other relaxing books to read after this video are: "A Trilogy of Poetry, Prose and Thoughts for the Mind, Body and Soul,"  "The Language of Poetry Forms by Tree Good," and "Everyday Miracles by Okuba."
