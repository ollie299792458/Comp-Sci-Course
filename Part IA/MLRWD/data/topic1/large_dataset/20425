Though I don't believe this world as we know it will end in 2012, I do enjoy a good end-of-the-world disaster movie.  It isn't exactly reality TV, but then I don't watch movies for the realism; I watch them to be entertained...to be swept out of my living room and into a scene that makes a great Sci-Fi adventure.  This movie does that.

The story revolves around your average divorced family where the father hasn't had enough time for the kids, and the mother and stepfather are perfect parents.  The tween-age son calls his father by his first name rather than Dad, an effort to show his disconnection and disappointment.  The disaster that ensues gives the real father (John Cusack) the opportunity to be the hero in the story.  So is it just me or is this the exact storyline for War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise?  Couldn't somebody have told the writer that that scenario had already been taken?  Enough said about that.

There's a little bit of a science lesson in the movie, not unlike The Day After Tomorrow, and what scientists thought would someday destroy the earth many years from now suddenly fast forwards to a few hours away.  Volcanoes explode, the earth's faults crack wide open, and the oceans stir up tsunamis...you could say in Biblical proportions.  That said, think a Noah's Ark scenario.  I won't tell all and give it away.

The thought-provoking part of this movie lies in the who-gets-to-be-saved question.  Have you ever wondered if the rich and important would have an edge up on the rest of us if something like this really did happen?  Is somebody out there preparing a way for a select few to survive?  This movie may stir up some thought on that.

I don't think this is a GREAT movie, any more than I thought The Day After Tomorrow or Independence Day were GREAT.  But my husband and I have watched all of these many times because they are action-packed movies with terrific edge-of-your-seat special effects and entertaining actors.
