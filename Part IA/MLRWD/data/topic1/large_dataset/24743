I disagree with viewers who say that this is a story about a man who is forced to choose between infatuation and stable love; it is in fact about a man who is forced to choose between love and society. Actually, I believe  the catchcry was something like: "What if the thing you desire most is  the one thing you cannot have? Which would you betray - your whole world,  or your heart?" This sums it up perfectly. The film perfectly conveys  the emotions and characteristics of each of the main characters - chiefly  Newland's angst, May's subtle cunning, and Ellen's innocence and pain. The  scenes are beautiful, the camera work amazing, and the narrator slightly  irritating, I'm afraid. It was a little too excessive - do we really need  THAT much explanation? It was, however, useful in explaining little things  we would not be able to understand, like how the men had to change gloves  before dancing with different partners at balls (so we're told as Newland  deliberates over a table of pristine white gloves). The only other negative  thing I can think of is that the ballroom scene (where a ball is held to  welcome Countess Olenska) made me feel slightly nauseous (the camera  revolves around the room in swooping circles, seemingly for minutes). I  found that this negative effect was not replicated on the small screen,  however. As for the acting, it's perfect - actually, this was probably  Michelle Pfeifer's best performance - I wouldn't have believed her capable  of such brilliance. Daniel-Day Llewis is suitably English, reserved, and  introspective; Winona Ryder is perfect as "innocent", boring,  bitchy May. And the soundtrack is beautiful. See it.
