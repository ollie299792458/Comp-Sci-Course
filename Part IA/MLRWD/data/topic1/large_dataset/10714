It's no wonder that everyone is praising Iron Man in some way. For me, Iron Man is the best origin movie ever made. It surpasses every original installment of any superhero film to date. It doesn't just manage to deliver a little bit of everything but it does it with style and integrity. Iron Man is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The mega talented cast fit each main character perfectly and the story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner. The dialogue is witty and what humor there is works its way seamlessly in to the natural order of the story. (No forced bachelor party dancing to set up a joke etc.) A couple of comic book style slugfests are included but inserted only as a vehicle for the story. Things aren't blown up just for the sake of seeing them go boom. What makes Iron Man a true rarity is that it's a fine film for kids but it's even greater if you're an intelligent adult. How many movies can you say that about? This is truly moviemaking of the most entertaining order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike.
