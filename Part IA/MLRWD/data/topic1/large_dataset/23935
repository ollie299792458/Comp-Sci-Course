If there is one thing that Asia does better than America, it is intense, violent action.  John Woo, legendary Hong Kong filmmaker, strutted his prowess in this beyond-hollywood masterpiece.  However, Woo wansn't the  only one on his game here.  The duo of Nicholas Cage and John Travolta,  exchanging roles, faces, and mannerisms, really showed off their previously  hidden acting abilities.  The plot was surprisingly interesting, if  repeatedly implausable.  And everything bled of style.  But none of this  got to hold the spotlight for long, especially against some of the most  intense double-fisted gun battles this side of the pacific.  Unlike  traditional hollywood fare which would throw more FX budget at a scene,  these were intense because they were well cheoreographed, stunningly  filmed, and playfully inventive.  Sure, John Woo peppered his action with  very cool, very human points of high drama, but the point of the drama is  getting your heart pumping, and at that Face / Off excelled.
If the  phrase "guns 'a blazing" doesn't appeal to you, you'll definitely  want to pass on this one.  For the rest of us, however, this is everything  an action movie is supposed to be, and oh so beautiful.
