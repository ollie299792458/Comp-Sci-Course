I think everyone born after 1970 knows (and loves) this movie, so i want to talk about the blu-ray release. I'm a firm believer that Success should be discussed as much as Failure. With so many posts about what companys do wrong with what's left out of blu rays/DVDs and the Ultra-violet plague (i'm guilty of this as well), i just want to thank Universal for actually putting the customer first.I was always going to buy E.T. on blu ray because it's one of those movies that just demands HD viewing, but i had pretty muched resigned to double dipping and buying the HD version on iTunes as well. Imagine the pleasant surprise when i downloaded the INCLUDED digital copy and realized it WAS both HD and SD!!. Also included were the iTunes extras that Apple loves to use as bait to get us to buy a movie twice. Then if that wasn't enough, Universal has the foresight to actually give us both iTunes AND the young upstart Ultra-Violet copy (which i have NO love for but sincerely appreciate the inclusion). I think when you pay $20+ for a movie, it's nice to actually feel you got your money's worth.

So far, Universal and HBO are the only studios (that i know of) that are providing HD digital copies when you buy an HD copy of the movie via blu-ray (it actually makes perfect sense). So, to the blu-ray division of Universal Studios...THANK YOU very much for actually going the extra mile and providing a customer valued product. Other studios should take a long hard look at your business model. Nothing favors the bottom line like customer loyalty. And you've got mine.
