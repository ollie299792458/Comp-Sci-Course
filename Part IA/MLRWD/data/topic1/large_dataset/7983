there's a reason they're releasing this genrous 40 episode, 17 music video set as the mike judge collection and not as seasons, as you whiny little cry babies would prefer:

1.  the mike judge thing was simply tacked on to distinguish it from the bare bones vhs/dvds they already have out.

2.  beavis and butthead wasnt a canon show, where something would happen in one episode that would carry over to the next.  these episodes could be aired in any order, and were not always aired in the order they were produced.  that's how things work sometimes.  there are many different ways to call them seasons: seasons in order of production, seasons in order of airing, seasons by year... it's complicated.

3.  even if they were to air them as seasons, some of the episodes in a particular season would have to be edited due to the music video thing, unless they decided to hack up the episode without the music video.  then, when they do get the rights to the video, it would be re-released on dvd so you would have to buy it again.  they're doing YOU A FAVOR HERE.

4.  It's his show, he does what he pleases.  If he'd rather not sully the good name of Beavis and Butthead (or his name, for that matter) by releasing sub-par episodes, he can.

in short, there's no reason to complain about this.  just be glad they're releasing this most awesome show on dvd, despite the order of volume release.
