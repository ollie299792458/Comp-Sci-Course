Remember when Jerry Bruckenheimer produced quality movies? Remember his partner Don Simpson? Remember Eddie Murphy back when he was fresh and funny? Remember the Axel F. theme? Remember when Martin Brest did comedies?
Everything you remember is here on this DVD! Don't bother with the sequels or "trilogy" box. This is the one that got started the formula of "wise-cracking" cops (apart from hysterical one-liners-through-squeeezed-teeth by Dirty Harry, who was well ahead of the times) genre that bolstered Die Hard and Lethal Weapon movies. It's a perfect example of "fish-out-of-water" comedy combined with "buddy movie" genre.
Plot in a sentence or two: resolved to find his best friends murderer, Detroit cop Axel Foley follows the trail to L.A. where his "methods" drive baddies and his Beverly Hills "coleagues" crazy.
Enhanced remastered SOUND is excellent, even better than what you saw at the theater all those years ago.
DVD itself: rather entertaining, although "not-so-special" features have mostly CAST & CREW INTERVIEWS, divided in 3 parts (INTERVIEWS, CASTING and MUSIC). It's fun to see how people  look and remiscent on those days about 15 years later. Also, there's DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY and THEATRICAL TRAILER. Pretty standard stuff, as I said. 
Why they didn't include outttakes (they all talk how they "burned" a lot of film by laughing in the middle of shooting) or alternate scenes (there were a lot of improvisations on set, as they say) is beyond my comprehension. 
Anyway... Buy this and you won't regret it! It's money well spent! You'll laugh yourself to tears, I guarantee it.
Favourite line: "Can you put it in a good spot? All this s**t happened the last time I parked here..."
