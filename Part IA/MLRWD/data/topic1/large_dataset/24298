Bride and prejudice is deffinitely one of my favourite films of all time , I can not tell you how much times I have watched it the funny scenes involving this guy that comes to find a bride in the house of the Bakshi , he eats like a pig laughs like a pig and dresses like a gay nerd but hey it makes it all funny , its so full of culture and music and brilliance that just sends a charm all over. I love it when the 3 Bakshi girls sing to lalita because this dude was gonna get engaged to her , it was very musical and romantic towards the end deffinitely things work out and I reckon that Martin Henderson is so incredibly hot ,hot , hot , You'll be staring at him forever also I gained a lot of respect for Aishwarya Rai the leading charcter who absoulutely shines as lalita shes confident such a great dancer and one of the most gorgeous women I've known plus she's funny and has this beauty about her , mainly I like the fact that lalita didn't need a rich man to complete her life sort of thing, and then she meets the guys of her dreams its all really romantiv and sizzling hot. I gained 2 fav actors : Aishwarya Rai and Mathew Henderson. Both fantastic , the whole crew really shines through , this adaption is way more lively than pride and prejudice the latest version. >&lt;" Oh yeah I forgot to add watch out for the snake dance!
