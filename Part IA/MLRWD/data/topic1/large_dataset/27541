This moview was very well written.. it was excellent at keeping the viewers attention and the plot was just very impressive.. the topic of "hoo doo" is kinda CREEPY to say the least, but nevertheless, it was a great movie and definitely worth owning. I was over-impressed with it, of course when u go to the movies u hope to be entertained, but this one definitely went above and beyond for me! GREAT JOB!! Kate Hudson is an awesome talent, the entire cast was perfect.  I heard some negative reviews about this movie but for the life of me I don't know why!  I think anyone who gave it a negative review is mentally lazy and does not enjoy movies that actually make them THINK! like oooooooOOOOoooH, I get it! Love those! **********and I am a very proud black female, afro and all, but I totally disagree with the so called "racial" issues the film is supposedly trying to throw out. Negative. it's just a movie. HooDoo is an ancient AFRICAN AMERICAN practice.. what other way would they have displayed it??? If they had switched Papa Justify with a "white man" people would complain that they are trying to "steal our history". HooDoo is a small drop in a cup of overflowing  history, The movie should not be disected... I do no think that it was meant to be a racial stab in any way what so ever.. and thats coming straight from a Sister Souljah protoge'.**********
