The currency of life is hope, and this gorgeous little documentary delivers it in spades. With one proviso (below), I highly recommend this film - it will leave you with a tear and a smile. Glorious especially for its ability to tug at the heartstrings.

Of course, documentaries don't pretend to be unbiased. That's not the point of this film. The point is to inspire hope. However, the filmmakers here are very sympathetic to the Palestinian position and, perhaps because they assume that the extent of the terror against Israel is widely known, they don't linger on Israeli suffering in the conflict - which got to the point of multiple suicide bombings per day at the very height of the post-Oslo war.

The result is a film that is less interested in a fair representation of political reality than in emotion, emphasizing Palestinian suffering and edging on caricaturising Israeli suffering (through an unrepresentative sample of Israeli children, particularly the oafish religious settler boy).

Nevertheless - watch the film. It's gold.
