If your a Star Trek Fan, you will enjoy this film. This flim is a blending of the old to the new generation. It seems that at first William Shatner has a Cameo in the film's first half, but becomes a full member of the cast in the last half.
If your a TRUE Star Trek Fan, and want to enjoy this film even more, you MUST get the three books written by William Shatner. The first book is "Ashes of Eden." It takes place just before "Generations" and has Jim Kirk battling between his long Star Fleet Career and the lack of action in any retirement. In it Capt. Kirk find that he is still called to save worlds, even in his retirement. It fills the gap leading up to the first part of the film. It is true Captian Kirk in action. This book could have been made into a Star Trek movie by itself and can stand alone.
The second book, "The Return", takes place right after the death of Jim Kirk with Spock at his best friend's grave. As from the title, we all want Jim Kirk to live and he does "Return."
You can stop after this book too, if you want to have Jim Kirk dead. (Yes, he dies at the end) But, hold the phone, he will live again in the next book, "Avenger" to save the universe again. This time he has new friends. It's Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the Enterprise TNG crew. Yes, Spock is logicly there to help Kirk(RET) save the universe again.
Read this and enjoy the movie even more.
