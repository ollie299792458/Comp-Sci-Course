While Manhunter was Hollywood's idea of a good adaptation, it has to stand alone as a movie separate from Red Dragon.  'Dragon' has the elements of the book that Manhunter did not.  It gives more insight into the Lecter character and how he got to be known as 'Hannibal the Cannibal' and pays more attention to Francis Dolarhyde - as a character.  However, casting Ralph Fiennes as the tall, unattractive-to-geeky Dolarhyde was a huge mistake.  Just not credible and not enough detail was given to the entire Dolarhyde character to explain his nickname "The Tooth Fairy".  
Manhunter was brilliant, it was cunning, it was clever and calculated and the performances were excellent.  But I really had to look at these two movies as totally different movies.  Edward Norton was great, I have no idea what they did to the delicate wilting female character from the book.
And of course, there has to be a Director's Edition which has two discs and contains material not in [other] versions...
Each film should be judged on it's own merits rather than compared to the other.  Much more enjoyable that way.
