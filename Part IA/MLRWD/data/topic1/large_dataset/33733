Alice [Lisa Wilcox] finds out that she's pregnant but things are complicated when Freddy [Robert Englund] targets her unborn child and as Freddy continues his killing spree by systematically killing off everyone in Alice's life, Alice must find a way to save her child from Freddy. Although the setting is somewhat dark for this film, Freddy is sillier here than in any of the previous installments! Definitely not a good example of a Nightmare movie as the story has gotten weak and the acting isn't too good here [except for Lisa and Robert]. Despite the fact that Robert Englund is still appealing as Freddy [even when he's been toned down and reduced to a comedy figure who almost spends more time cracking jokes than killing], Robert is unable to save this sequel from being boring and forgettable. Also, even the murder scenes have gotten corny [check out the cheesy scene where one of the characters becomes a comic book character in an attempt to fend off Freddy in his dream!!] Unless you're somebody who loves all things Freddy you can skip this and the sixth movie. Followed by Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare
