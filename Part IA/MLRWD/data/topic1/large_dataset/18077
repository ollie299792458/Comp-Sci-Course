With such rich talent, it is a shame the movie is so mediocre. I wanted to like the film because of the exceptional cast - Liam Neeson, Antonio Banderas and Laura Linley -- but the writing and plodding pacing kept getting in the way of the actors.

The Banderas (Ralph) character was the most interesting. He is silly, superficial and living in a fantasy world. The more Neeson's (Peter) character discovered about Ralph the easier it became to deal with the adulterous relationship. What began as Peter's rage and obsession to both uncover the details of the illicit affair and kill Ralph gradually changed to mocking ridicule, and ultimately pity and understanding. It was interesting to see Banderas go against his usual casting and play such a loser.

This is not a good suspense story (figured out what was happening pretty quickly) and it isn't a particularly rich character study, but I also didn't think it was the worst movie ever made. Between watching the terrific cast and enjoying the scenery (Milan and Lake Como) I give it three stars.
