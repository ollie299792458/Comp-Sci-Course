Positive:  Cinematography was decent. Negative:  Very unbelievable plot  and dialogue.  I kept thinking what a great movie this COULD be with some  competent directing and writing.  I hate to see good movies wasted and this  is a perfect example. If this movie was so suspensefull, why was I  fforwarding through most of the final 30 minutes?  I started to get annoyed  early at the corny coincedences that you see in bad suspense movies.  Then  it got worse when I was able to easily guess what would always happen next,  until the end, which I will concede would have been great with a half way  decent lead up.  Finally, the movie became unbearable when certain simple  scenes were made excrutiatingly long.  Just add alot of suspense music and  some car chases and you have most of the last 15 minutes.  This movie trys  so hard to anger and unnerve me.  Well I guess it succeeded.  I was angry I  wasted 99 cents renting this thing from the bargain rack.  And guess what?  all copies were in stock.
