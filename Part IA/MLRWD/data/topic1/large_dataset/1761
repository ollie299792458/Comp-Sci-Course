Warning: some key plot point are mentioned
I saw the Searchers all the way through for the first time just recently and it's a pretty typical Hollywood western. Almost no one spoke like a normal person, very stagy  especially the attempts at humour. John Wayne is exactly the same in every  movie I've seen him in and this was no exception. He's either mildly  bemused or angry. I'll never understand what the fuss is about.  We are  taken through one set piece after another until the end when Wayne realizes  in an instant he was wrong all along. The thing is, he never seemed to  learn anything about racism at all. Did anyone really think he would shoot  the girl? It ends with an unbelievable coincidence of arriving home at the  moment of the wedding and a typical fun brawl (We all know how much fun a  good beating at a wedding is), and they all live happily ever after and  don't worry about shooting 3 men in the back.  I was expecting alot and for  the most part it was fairly ordinary. It's not even that interesting. I  think John Ford is good but over-rated.
