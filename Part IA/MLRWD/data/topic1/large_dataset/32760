I like this movie.  It is far better than what some of the reviewers would have you believe -- especially in comparison to the godawful TV series.  If it had been shortened by about 15 minutes, including taking out some memorably bad dialog, it would have been much better.

Others have already comented on the special effects.  I actually bought this just to experience them on a good system, having only seen it on pay channels, and I wasn't disappointed.  The production quality is excellent, and if it wasn't for the Jupiter II having so much wasted space onboard, I would find it very believable.  The quality of the DVD is top notch, although there are occasionally startlingly grainy scenes (thankfully short ones) and the sound is terrific -- especially through good headphones.

The robot is really cool.  Matt LeBlanc is almost cool as Major West.  And am I a pervert for lustng after Lacey Chabert in boots, an adult playing a young teenage?  LOL

I gave it 4 stars because it's a 3 star movie for less than $10.  It certainly was better, IMO, than Star Wars episode I, in every category.
