Double indemnity is a Film Noir classic. Director Billy Wilder gives the film the classic Noir look, with dark shadows and a twisted murder plot.  Whether it's the darkness of a house or a poorly lit street the scenes are given an attitude by the lighting that Wilder chose.
 Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray is pushed in the middle of a femme fatales unscrupulous scheme.  Neff an insurance salesman is coaxed into a murder/fraud scheme by a beautiful woman. Neff gets lured into this plot of deceit because of an anklet that the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson played by Barbara Stanwyck, wears throughout the film.  Stanwyck's performance is superb, she plays a cold-blooded woman with a mindset of taking what she believes belongs to her. Dietrichson is nonchalant, and methodical when it comes to her femme fatale characteristics. Neff and Dietrichson tend to light up the dark scenes with their lustful looks towards each other.  Lola, Phyllis' stepdaughter, on the other hand  is the complete opposite of the femme fatale. Jean Heather playing Lola does an excellent job of selling her character as an innocent and meek teenager wary of her stepmother's actions.  Edward G. Robinson plays Barton Keyes an insurance investigator with a "little man" that gives him clues to the status of a claim. Keyes is like a father figure to Neff and they spend much time together as Keyes throws his ideas of what happened around.
This was a great film going to great lengths to please the viewer.  This Film not only leans towards the serious side but also has some comic relief mainly in the use of the word baby, and the endless search for one mans matches.  A great work of art Double Indemnity should be on everyone's list of movies to see soon. It will not only keep you wrapped up but also will keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next plot twist.
