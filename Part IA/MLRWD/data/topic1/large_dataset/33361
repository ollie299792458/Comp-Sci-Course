GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is a wonderful and entertaining comedy that does not miss a bit in pure enjoyment.Howard Hawk's direction glistens with spirit and finesse. Each song is jubilant and well staged.There are numerous reviews before mine that outline the plot,but it simply is about a golddigger with a heart of gold trying to look out for her own best interest who simultaneously is being pursued by a dorky and wealthy young heir to a fortune for marriage,and a lascivious elderly gentleman owner smitten with the  young beauty(Monroe) who steals his wife's diamond tiara for her pleasure and company.Jane Russell is along for the ride and acts as a conscience and quasi big sister for MM. For the 50's of the Lucy era,the film is quite illuminating in its tones of implied sexuality in the costumes emphasizing ample cleavage and the  voluptuous hips of Monroe and Russell."The Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend number(first performed by Monroe and then parodied by Russell disguised as Monroe in front of a French Judge and his court staff is hilarious and daring for its time).That scene leaves no doubt what the director is up to.Hawks,Wilder, Hitchcock, and many other directors of that period found ways to introduce adult themes thru family fare that was evocative,fun and entertaining for the whole family.This film is a must have for a classic movie viewing evening.
