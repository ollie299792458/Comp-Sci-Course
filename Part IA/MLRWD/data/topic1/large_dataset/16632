"How was your day,dear?"  "Usual,crap."  I love that line.  This is my absolute favorite movie of all time and I am extatic to hear that is finally coming out on DVD.  The reason why I love it so much...couldn't tell ya.  It's just one of those movies that keep you forever.  I loved it.  It's a unique zombie flick.  With the portrayal of younger adolescents, I think it gives the movie a certain edge that no other zombie, or any other horror film for that matter, has ever had. Past, present and I will boldy say future.  With combinations of laughs, scares, and gore, it surpasses every horror movie ever made.  The character of Suicide and Trash are my two favorites.  Unfortuanately for me, they are the first two to be devoured by brain starved zombies.  But I always looked at it this way, Trash got what she wanted..."A bunch of old men to surround me. And start bighting, and eating me alive."  I see.  Trust me, if you are an avid horror fanatic like myself and love zombie films, check this one out! And if you are in to Punk music at all, the soundtrack for the movie rocks.  With bands like The Cramps, The Damned, The Flesheaters, and TSOL, you'll be in pure heaven...Or hell.  Whichever you prefer! I give this movie  2 THUMBS UP...and one half eaten brain!!!
