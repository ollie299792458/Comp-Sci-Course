'The Field" is a story of possession, its Richard Harris who has a manical possession for the land that has been in his family that he wants to pass down to his son, played by Sean Bean. Sean's character is flawed, and he would rather be the lover of a traveler's girl, than stay and do what his dad wants with the land. Its Richard Harris and Sean Bean, and its the choices that each character makes, as well as the character played by Tom Berenger, who wants the land for a project. Its a film that shows Sean Bean at his very best acting ability! Its a film that will stay and haunt you for a while, and its a film that will make you remember Richard Harris, who had too much love for his farm! And yes you do see Richard Harris and Sean Bean again, in another film, "Patriot Games!" I have the Sean Bean Club on Yahoo Groups, come and join us for a discussion of Sean, an actor who dares to be different, an actor who takes parts that you would never expect to see him do. And yes Richard Harris is wonderful as usual as the farmer who cannot trust his own son with the land!
