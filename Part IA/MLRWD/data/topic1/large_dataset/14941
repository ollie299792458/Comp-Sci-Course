...but it will have its fans; those who enjoy watching cheerleading competitions and those who enjoy watching a lot of skinny actresses run around in skimpy, tight outfits for about an hour and a half.  The plot; Dunst takes over as cheerleading captain for `Lily-White High School' only to discover that the departing captain had stolen all of their routines from an inner city squad at `Mostly Black High School'.  What a moral quandary!  Things really take a wacky turn when the Lily-Whites then have to face the Mostly Blacks at nationals!  Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans may will enjoy the presence of not just Faith, but the overlooked Glorificus as well.  All of the stock teen stereotypes are present in Bring It On, and strangely enough so is the perpetuation of  the `myth' that male cheerleaders are generally Nancy boys.  I would have thought that a movie that is trying to portray cheerleading in a positive light would have tried to avoid that.  One of the males has the `hilarious' predilection of digitally raping his female counterparts while they are performing together.  His victims seem to love it!  Nice message for teenage boys from Hollywood, young girls LOVE unwanted digital penetration!.  Another point of contention is why are the inner city kids the Clovers?  If there is some subliminal message there, I really don't get it.  Maybe it was left on the cutting room floor.  So while the story may have had a little promise, its limited appeal and limiting script assured that the movie wouldn't live up to it.  I can't believe Kirsten Dunst hasn't fired her agent yet for continuing to let her star in these weak teen movies.  It's as if she were aging in reverse.  But, all this aside, I did watch the whole thing and would again.  It just isn't very good, even for a teen movie.
