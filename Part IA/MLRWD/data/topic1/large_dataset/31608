The tragedy that was Gallipoli is portrayed in this movie in which Mel Gibson gives a solid acting role during his much younger days. The broader political and social issues walk hand in hand with the individual stories of young Australians going off to war. One learns -vividly - of the British policy and practice of treating its "colonials" as cannon fodder in their war efforts, of the strains among social classes and even the Irish-English tensions. In the end the brave men of the Lighthorse and infantry, all social classes, young and old, officers and privates are sent over the top in order to protect the British landing which had already occurred resulting in the taking of their normal daily tea. It's also a story of deep friendship and sacrifice - a theme which has recurred throughout Gibson's better works. When one looks just underneath the bloody surface of this movie, and of many of Gibson's performances, one can see the solid truth being presented. If you like History, can appreciate the rugged individualism of Australia, and the deeper truths we all confront Gallipoli is very good. A young Mel Gibson gives an excellent performance for his age.
