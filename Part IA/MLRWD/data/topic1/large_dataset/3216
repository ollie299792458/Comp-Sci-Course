Another good movie in the genre of what I would call the thinking person's sci-fi. Generally low to middlin' budget, with substantial dialog and few special effects, their hey day seemed to stretch from 60s-80s.
I won't say this was a great movie, and probably its the type of movie that is an acquired taste. Someone used to short, choppy scenes and constant action may find this movie dull.
The message of this movie is not explicit, if there is one. That leaves it up to the viewer to conjecture a meaning, beyond the obvious. What is the meaning in screwing up the Earth to the point of ending humanity? Is it no more significant than lemmings jumping from a cliff, as far as mother nature is concerned? Or are we special, but defective, and our end would cause a ever-expanding tear in the Universe?
One rather gratuitous scene was of the main actor shooting a Jesus crucifix. Must have had very little impact, but imaging if this was a Koran? This film wouldn't even had been made, much less distributed, even back in 1985. Christianity is more forgiving of such creative disrespect, apparently.
