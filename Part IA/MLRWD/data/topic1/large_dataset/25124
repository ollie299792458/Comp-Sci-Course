It's here, the release we've all been waiting for! In the early years of animation the Fleischer Studios were the best. Their smooth animation, 3D backgrounds and great musical scores were second to none, including Disney. Their crown jewel was Popeye. Now for the first time we can see these the way the movie theater audiences saw them 70 years ago. Restored from the original negatives, they are sharp and clear with great sound quality. On this 4 DVD edition are the 1st 60 Popeye cartoons in order, including 58 black and white shorts and the highlight in my opinion 2 of the 3 Technicolor 2 reelers. I've bought every release available over the years on both VHS and CD, everything from poor quality transfers (Goodtimes) to good (Thunderbean), but the one thing they didn't have was the original masters. Now fully restored in beautifull full color they are a sight to behold. You only think you've seen these before. You ain't seen nothin' yet. And for the first time since they originally aired in the theater in 1936 and 1937, the opening and closing credits are fully restored! Also include are several documentaries (popumentaries), and for the lover of early animation, 16 original early cartoons from 1915 to 1933. These include Mutt and Jeff, Krazy Kat, Bobby Bumps and the early Fleischer "From the Inkwell" shorts featuring Koko the Clown. This is a jewel of a DVD set. Expensive, yes. Worth it? Yes, and more. If you're a lover of Popeye, The Fleischer Studios or just great animation, this is a nmust have DVD!
