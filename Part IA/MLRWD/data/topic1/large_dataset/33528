Latest installment of 007 manages to honor the traditional Bond elements while also keeping stride with modern times. The story centers around Bond's attempt to track down a North Korean Army officer who is illegally receiving diamonds smuggled out of South Africa and using the resulting wealth to build a satellite that will harness the power of the sun. Bond also has his sights on a mystery figure inside the British government who betrayed him, resulting in his being imprisoned and tortured in North Korea for 14 months. The film makes a few weak attempts at humour but overall has a very dark and somber tone. The opening sequence showing 007's torture at the hands of his North Korean captors is quite intense compared to the traditional Bond formula where he's rarely in true peril. The scenes set in the villian's 'house of ice' are really spectacular and to me are the film's best moments. The one truly cheesy scene in this movie is the cartoonish image of Bond riding a makeshift surfboard on the waves from a melting iceberg. The shot is phoney-looking beyond belief and downright silly. Halle Berry does an OK job as an American CIA agent who teams up with Bond. Madonna shows up for a totally lame, wooden cameo that the film would be better without. I'm also not a fan of her monotonous techno-flavored theme song for the film. Overall, not a bad movie and should certainly please Bond diehards if they're not put off by the film's gritty, somber feel. Of the four Bond films Brosnan has made so far I would have to say this is my least favorite but I would still recommend it.
