I was about 4 years old when WWII began.  I remember my parents hooking up the family radio in the car so they could hear the news about Pearl Harbor while driving to my grandma's house in rural Oklahoma.  I remember my brother loving his coloring books with pictures of war machines and planes and ships being destroyed.  I knew it was horrible somewhere in the world and I didn't want to think about it between then and now.  When it was over we were able to buy bubble gum and fluorescent colored shoe laces, and get left-over nylon parachutes to make blouses and underwear.  Painful as it still is, I can see now that it is indeed necessary to remember and think about the awful consequences of believing any culture, race or religion is superior to any other, allowing the rants of despots to influence more than common sense, and making war.  I would like more people all over the world to see this, or read Herman Wouk's book.  Maybe if it were made into a computer game my grandkids would pay attention ....  The series is very well done and profound.  It's long and takes time to see, but it's worth the time and patience.
