I savored every minute of the approximately eight hours of the miniseries.  The characters are not, as is too often the case in movies, animated cardboard cutouts, but real people.  The script is full of wisdom and humor.  Best of all it shows the early West in at least partially realistic terms.  It was a tough place, full of both good and bad people.  The portrayal of indigenous people is especially refreshing.  Instead of being time-travelers from the Green Peace movement as they are normally portrayed in modern movies, they are human beings.  Some are kind.  Some are cruel.  Some are just trying to get by.  Some are trying to defend their land and way of life the best they can.

And then there's the photography.  This film makes even Texas look beautiful!

I live in Thailand and it cost me a pretty penny to get this movie shipped here (Amazon doesn't allow online downloads to this country).  But it was worth every cent.  My own roots in the West go back to 1849 and my grandmother was the first Anglo baby to be born in my part of Wyoming, so I know from accounts of those who were there (albeit as young children) whereof I speak when I say that if you want to know what the real Old West was like, buy this movie.
