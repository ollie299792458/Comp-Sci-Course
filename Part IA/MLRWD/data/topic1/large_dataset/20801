I have NEVER laughed harder than I did, and still do, when I watch(ed) LIAR LIAR.  Yes, it's stupid and syrupy at times, and does get hypocritical in regard to being happy without money (as in Jim Carrey makes mucho millions yet plays a character that ends up saying money won't make you happy), but, SO WHAT-IT'S ONLY A MOVIE!  There are so many hysterical scenes here that I don't even know where to begin.  My dad doesn't care for Jim Carrey, but even he had to admit that this movie made him laugh out loud, repeatedly.  There are so many memorable lines and scenes that I feel this is a modern day classic.  His timing with this material is perfect throughout.  If there is a weakness, its the ending.  The courtroom win is great, as well as the scene where he goes to jail for contempt of court ("Yeah, tell that to them when they're adopted-by the Manson Family!!!).  But the movie runs out of gas too soon, as the airport scenes feel out of place, not blending smoothly like everything else.  The final scene is cute (bringing 'The Claw' back is a nice touch) but there's no chemistry between Maura Tierney and Jim Carrey.  I find it impossible to believe they would have been together in the first place, much less have gotten back together in the end.  But it doesn't matter.  The journey is where this movie earns its 5 stars, and Carrey's performance, along with a solid script and crisp direction, makes LIAR LIAR a comedy classic.
