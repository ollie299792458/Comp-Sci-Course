My goodness, the attacks on this DVD set that I see here!  Folks, in case you don't know

already, understanding evolution isn't just for the elite scientifically trained.  Look at Darwin, he

wasn't even a scientist himself!  I saw this set in the library at a Church.

The most memorable example of irreducible complexity for me was the butterfly.

I did not know that at one time in the cocoon the transfiguring caterpillar is in a liquid state.

I couldn't even imagine, much less articulate, how many kinds and types of trial and error Darwinian

change that little caterpillar would have to go through to become a beautiful

butterfly - while at the same time surviving and passing on its

genetic information.  The whole theory of evolution is seen as what is, laughable.  That's what Darwinism is,

the funniest - and saddest - bunch of pseudo science that has ever been foisted

off on the unsuspecting public.  But if people would prefer to believe they are accidental,

 insignicant, incredibly short- lived by-products of some primal pond, should we burst their

muddy little bubbles and try to convince them that Someone Almighty loves them

dearly and wants to give them a future and a hope?  Hmmmm.  ;-)
