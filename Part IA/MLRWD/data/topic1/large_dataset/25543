First off, I want to start by saying I've been a die-hard WWE fan for over 30 years. From the Hogans and Steamboats, to the Dumpster Droces, and Doinks, to the Austins and Rocks, to Today. I think this documentary was put together well and told a story that needed to be told. Of course WWE is going to put their own spin on it. it's THEIR documentary. With That being said, I read the other reviews saying that its the same interviews, clips and matches. So What? This doc actually covers Wrestlemania. And of course they are going to focus more on the first 4 WMs. The first was historical, the second took a risk with being in 3 cities, the third broke an indoor attendance record(along with having the biggest match in history, as well as the best match in history), and the forth was the first to be back to back in the same venue.(My hometown)
I also enjoyed the backstage footage from WM IX. I own most documentaries, and never saw that before. Also, of course they are going to replay what some people have said in the past. I.E. Hogan. He doesn't work for Vinny any more, and to have a WM documentary without comments from the other man that made it so successful is just foolish.

Could it have been better. Of course! But Vince is only going to allow the curtain to be pulled back so much. There still has to be a little mystery, since the dirt sheets ruined pretty much every surprise in the last 10 years.
