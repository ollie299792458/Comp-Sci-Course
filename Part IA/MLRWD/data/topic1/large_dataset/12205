THE PIANIST is a very fine movie about the survival experiences of a Polish pianist during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw in World War II. The film contains many memorable scenes reflecting both the worst and best of humanity under extremely trying conditions. One such scene shows German soldiers bullying and mocking elderly Jewish refugees and another depicts a Russian tank blasting a building in which the pianist is hiding. In contrast, there is a scene in which a German officer finds the pianist playing the piano in an otherwise vacant building. The German officer seems mesmerized by the music and grateful to be able to experience such a pleasant interlude in the midst of the horrors of war. Immediately a bond is struck between the two men. The role of the pianist is played by Adrien Brody. Also in the cast are Thomas Kretschmann, Frank Finlay, Maureen Lipman, Emilia Fox, Ed Stoppard, Julia Rayner, Jessica Kate Meyer and Michal Zebrowski.

THE PIANIST was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Oscars were won by Adrien Brody for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Roman Polanski for Best Director. Ronald Harwood won an Academy Award as well for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. In addition, Polanski won a Golden Palm for this motion picture at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.
