I couldn't disagree with the first review more.  I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hour theatre release.  My big disappointment?  Only 30 seconds of BB King (in the finale).  The DVD is FOUR hours so I hope to see BB King on the DVD.  I am buying this DVD for two brothers, one a percussionist, one a guitarist.  The biggest query I have is about Citizen Cope.  Has Eric Clpton taken him under his wing, although the performer has been around 14 or more years?  "Cope's" performance showed a lot of Clapton virtuosity. I also hope the DVD has more 'Ronnie' Wood. ZZ Top can do no wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed the artists I was not familar with, especially the young man playing with Buddy Guy "Five Long Years."  I liked the performer and performance "Chicken in the Kitchen"(Robert Cray?).  The first reviewer- pshaw.  $12.50 is a dinner at Chili's, this concert will satisfactorily stay with me in memory longer than my last meal.  The "four" is probably a bit premature because IF the DVD has more Ron Wood and BB King, I will rewrite my review and give it a "five".
