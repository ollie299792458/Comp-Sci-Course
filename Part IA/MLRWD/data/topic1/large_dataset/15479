Finally complete the whole set, here come my complete short summary review of America Lost and Found: The BBS Story Blu-ray Box Set:

Head - You can just skip this silly meaningless film.
Story - 0 Star
PQ - 4 Star & 2 Star (the picture quality is too inconsistent)
AQ - 4 Star

Easy Rider - Tragedy ending, but worth a view, great cinematography. Loving all the songs as well. 3rd best from this BBS collection.
Story: 4 Star
PQ: 4.5 Star
AQ: 4.5 Star

Five Easy Pieces - My 2nd favor film in this box set collection, worth watching. Great acting.

PQ: 5 Star
AQ: 5 Star

Drive, He Said - It was OK, quite a lot frontal (male only) in this film.
Story: 3.5 Star
PQ: 3.5 Star
AQ: 3.5 Star

A Safe Place - 2nd worst film from BBS, another avoidable film.
Story: 2 Star
PQ: 3.5 Star
AQ: 3.5 Star

The Last Picture Show - The greatest film from this BBS collection, this is my 1st and only B&W film in Blu-ray at the moment.
Story: 5 Star
PQ: 5 Star
AQ: 5 Star

The King of Marvin Gardens - It kind of bored storyline, not my taste, I find it storyline nothing worth for a grab.
Story: 3 Star
PQ: 5 Star
AQ: 5 Star

In overall, the whole BBS collection not recommended for child view. Beside that two silly film "Head" & "A Safe Place", all with frontal nudity and some sex scenes.

Is this set worth the value? no with original price, yes during big discount - thanks god I grab it during big promotion. In overall, only 3 out of 7 films for me is masterpiece - "The Last Picture Show", "Five Easy Pieces" & "Easy Rider".

Ranking:
1st - The Last Picture Show - 5 Star
2nd - Five Easy Pieces - 4 Star
3rd - Easy Rider - 4 Star
4th - Drive, He Said - 3.5 Star
5th - The King of Marvin Gardens - 3 Star
6th - A Safe Place - 2 Star
7th - Head - 0 Star
