This light film shows a fairly successful lesbian couple dealing with
the sudden appearance of their children's sperm donor.  This seems to
bring out all of the cracks in their relationship with each other,
their children, and their own sense of identity, and cause lots of bad
behavior.  It's not in the least a dark, deep or political film, but
amusing and hopeful.  The two women are completely individual and
specific, not standing in for lesbian couples in general.  The movie
is entertaining and amusing, but not something you'll be thinking about
days or weeks later.

Visually it feels very light and open, and very California.  I loved
both Annette Bening, who allowed herself to appear older than she
really looks, and Julianne Moore, and they had great chemistry.
Anybody who isn't going to be upset by assorted non-explicit sex
scenes will enjoy it.  I wasn't as crazy about the Mark Ruffalo
character, but he seemed to be mostly a foil for the women.  It was
great to see a Hollywood movie really about women, not men.

The extras included a great interview with the director and co-writer,
Lisa Cholodenko, who also directed a very dark and edgy indie flick,
"High Art", with Ally Sheedy.
