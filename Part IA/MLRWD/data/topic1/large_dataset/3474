Based on a true story may be fine for a "true crime" novel but it is not enough to make a compelling film. The story is told through the eyes of a boy who by simply not doing anything becomes a willing participant is abuse and torture. We are supposed to care or feel some sympathy for him but we are never given any reason to. Perhaps if the story had been told through the eyes of the tortured girl then maybe we could care. The crazy abusive mom's actions are completely unmotivated by anything in the script, she just simply is what she is. Why? In addition to the lack of character developement from the script, the young cast gives nothing more than "child actor" performances while the one adult actress in the film give a largely one-note performance, just a cardboard characature of a crazy lady. Again, why? Who cares? Why doesn't somebody say something? Don't know. Why does the boy continue to go next door only to witness more of what is supposed to be disturbing to him? Don't know. Why doesn't he just stop going? Don't know. This movie does not explain anything, flesh out anything or give us any reason to side with any of it's characters or care. So what if it's based on a true story? A film needs more that just that to give me a reason to watch it. I gave this movie one star because the system wouldn't accept a zero.
