I see posts about this film being racist.  It makes one wonder if they actually watched the film.  I am not surpised by these comments, of course, because the film is unbiased.  The lack of perversion of reality is what makes this film 'racist.'  Of course, the morons who have posted here have no understanding of the term and no understanding of the Klans development (amazing considering they claim to have watched the film).  The Klan and its modern relationship to the _African-American_ is irrelevant as its enemy was the tryannical Union (in fact the founder, Forrest, left the Klan after it turned to violence- something not mentioned to todays ignorant Americans for obvious reasons).  In any event, to those who would shout racism on these reviews and in this world:  you owe this film 5 stars.  Without it, your lives would have no purpose.  You would have nothing to tear apart.  To hate.  You feed off of the blood you suck from such creations.  You are worthless.  You contribute nothing to society.  This film gives you what pathetic value you have stolen.  You are in debt to D.W. Griffith.
