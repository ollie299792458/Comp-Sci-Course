Road House mania has finally hit in 2006!  Not only has this movie, which has been to late night TBS what Whoopi Goldberg is to Hollywood Squares, finally been reissued in a special edition, but now Mike Nelson from MST3K has released a RiffTrax for it!  Road House was long acknowledged as a target that Nelson and the 'bots wished they could skewer on MST3K and he finally got his wish.

Listen, Road House is great.  Tinker, Sam Elliot (voice of the beef council) and the oh so creepy owner of the Double Deuce are some of  the best characters to ever populate small town Missouri.  But watching it with Nelson's RiffTrax playing in the background took the unintentional (i think?) comedy of Road House to an entirely new level.  Nelson is both knowledgable and funny, the kind of guy you wish your friends were as clever as.  If we are ever blessed with a 20th anniversary edition of Road House, I would hope that Nelson's riffing can be included, because I can't imagine watching this movie again without it.
