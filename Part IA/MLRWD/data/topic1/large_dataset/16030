This movie is, quite simply, a classic.  It isn't your typical war movie, but that is a good thing.  Typical war movies glorify war, and any vet will tell you war is hell.  "TO'CH" is gritty realism.  Shot in black and white, it presents the men of the fictional bomber group (based I believe on the 100th BG) as well as the book of the same name.  It is as much a movie about relationships and the demands of leadership as it is about the air war.  The acting is superb.  Of course Gregory Peck is great but also the character of the Ops officer is brilliantly portrayed as well, though I'm not sure of the actor's name.  A few elements of the novel have been removed, either to tighten the plot or keep the movie from being long.  Some of that material isn't necessary to the plot development, some I would have liked to see. I am a historian and teacher currently researching a book on the Eighth in WWII, as well as a novel, and one of the questions I've been asking the men who were there is 'what movie best shows the air war and life on base as it really was?' The answer, almost unanimously, is "TO'CH". For those who would like to see another excellent video of the Mighty Eighth, I highly recommend a documentary called "Pistol Packing Mama: The Story of a B-17" that can also be ordered from Amazon.com.  No video library on the air war over Europe would be complete without these two fine videos on the shelf.
