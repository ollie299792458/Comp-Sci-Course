This is my original review after just 2 workouts:
I was hoping for a video that was a little longer than the 15 min. fast portion of the workout. As others have said, she moves too fast for beginners and doesn't break down the steps long enough to "get" them. I can get up a sweat but don't feel there's a good cardio workout because its too short.

Revision of review after 4-5 weeks:
Can't give it a 5 star but have changed it from the original 2 stars I gave it. After doing this workout for several weeks, I'm onto the steps and enjoying the workout. I didn't think I would say that. I work up a sweat by the time I'm done. Its a fun workout and Madonna is very easy to listen to. I am 55+ and can keep up pretty well with the young dancers. As someone else mentioned you want to be careful of some of the head and arm moves as they may be harmful if you really get into it.

All in all, I'm enjoying the workout now after learning the routine. I've incorporated it into my weekly workouts and added a weight lifting routine afterward. Madonna's awesome biceps have inspired me to try to get mine in shape.
