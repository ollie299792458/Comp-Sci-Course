stallone has now joined the ranks of other action stars with flicks gone straight to video like seagal, van damme, tom berenger (who is in this film as is SNIPER 2---what?), michael dudikoff. EYE SEE YOU aka DETOX aka D-TOX aka THE OUTPOST aka, etc. was supposed to come out in 2000 in the US but never did. only overseas where it did poorly. now finally it is on dvd and i saw it and sly is sort of ok here. he does overplay his FBI agent role as he tracks a killer among a group of burnt out cops holed up in some snowy mountain rehab center. his scenes where he gets a panic attack, the shakes, and nightmares are just laughable. i get panic attacks and i do a better job than sly does. the violence is over the top. it is a so so affair. more sad news for stallone, he has TWO OTHER FILMS IN DELAY: AVENGING ANGELO (on dvd this spring-oh brother!)with the late anthony quinn and DOLAN'S CADILLAC. they may hit the dvd shelves as well and that is a shame. makes me wanna get the 1st ROCKY, and NIGHTHAWKS and even COP LAND and see the REAL stallone there.
