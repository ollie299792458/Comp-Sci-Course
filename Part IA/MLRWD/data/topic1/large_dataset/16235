The movie is based on the book, "Neon Angel" the memoir of Cherie Currie..so its based on her POV.  Apparantly the rights to the other members besides Joan were not cleared.  Incredible soundtrack.  Abbreviated and fast-paced story of the rise and fall of the first female rock group.  I still enjoyed it, the girls did the best with the script and are believable in both singing and acting. It feels a little rushed at times. I would expect people going in to this will expect Sex, Drugs, and Rock-n-Roll, so expect to see all three elements in FULL FORCE. Not for the weak of heart. :P I loved it, but don't expect an exact biopic..you gotta entertain the audience, ya know? If you want to know the truth there are plenty of live performances and specials and, you are on Amazon.. you can always read the book as told by Cherie. Some people have a serious bias about Kristen Stewart--but she can ACT. And I find it interesting that some people think Kristen acts the same in each movie...so you don't enjoy her work but you've seen her in every movie? her every movie besides Twilight? Really?! That gives you no credit in my opinion.  Don't believe me? Roger Ebert has a perfect summarization on his website--he gave it 3/4 Stars, check it out.  So afer seeing it--who wants to form an all-girl rock band?! Enjoy!
