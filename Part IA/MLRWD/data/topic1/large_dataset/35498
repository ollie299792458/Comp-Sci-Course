I bought this movie sight unseen based soley on its concept and reputation. My bad.
This movie takes an interesting concept and sinks it with pedestrian direction and a reluctance to see its story through. It is a shame because they could have made a truly interesting film without maxing out the budget. 
The director, Lieberman, seems reluctant and unwilling to truly deal with the dark/silly idea at the core of his story. 60's college radicals drop some acid called Blue Sunshine. Ten years later it catches up with them-their hair falls out and they become kill crazy lunatics. This is a great jumping off point for either incisive social satire and/or over the top horror thrills. This film provides neither. It is much too timid to deliver on the horror(the kids survive the attack by their babysitter?!) and it does not follow through on the satire either(so yesterday's drug dealers can become tomorrow's politician...And?...). Oh, and its true, Zalman King is godawful in the lead.
Somewhere on the disk they make mention of the fact that a network TV station wanted to buy this film and air it as a TV movie of the week. It makes sense. In fact, if it were a TV movie of the week I would have been more impressed. But no, this is supposed to be a lost gem of an exploitation film and let me tell you it is not. It takes a great concept and renders it impotent by running it through the hack-Hitchcock treadmill. Boring.
Worth a rental maybe but do not buy it unless you are a Fan.
