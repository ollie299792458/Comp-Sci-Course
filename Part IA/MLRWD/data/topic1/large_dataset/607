Let me start off by saying - I LOVED the first one.  And after watching the Grudge 2 AND the special features...I know why this one is bad.  Why was the first one good?  Because all Hollywood did was make it the same version of the Japanese movie with English speaking folks.  The second one - too many HOLLYWOOD heads trying to put in their two cents worth.  The people at Ghost House (the company behind this) should allow the professional Japanese creators to do their thing.  The only -  and I mean ONLY thing Ghost House need to do to make it a success here in USA is to be sure it is in English and foot the money.  That's it.  Personally, I dont mind reading subtitles.  A note to Ghost House - listen to your audience and give us an apology for this horrible sequel to a masterpiece and give us The Grudge 3 - but this time please let the Writers write, and the director direct.  Hollywood needs to just step back and watch and learn on the remakes of all Asian cinema (if remakes are necessary at all in the first place).  Ultimately - more sales and more money..and you can be proud of being a part of a great movie again.  Remember that feeling??

Trust me - if you scratched your head everytime something did not make sense in this movie - we all would be bald by now.  Onto the packaging of the DVD - overall great.  I would suggest that they add Spanish to the languages.  Many DVDs are now coming without a scene selection menu sheet - they used to be on the inside and on the left.  I personally liked using them. Instead we are being attacked by the marketing area of the companies with upcoming DVDs or older DVDs to buy.
