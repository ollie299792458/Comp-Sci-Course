Bogart is a giant of cinema, as everyone knows. What is often overlooked is that he truly was a very fine screen actor, and not only in tough guy roles either. As the barmy Captain Queeg (who on earth dreamed up a name like that?) he loses his marbles with quite brilliant subtlety and one does end up by being genuinely sympathetic towards this man who has become paranoid through his inability to adapt to conditions around him. One must also praise the performance of Fred McMurray as the cowardly writer/officer who, having fomented the mutiny with his smart-alec witticisms and innuendoes among his brother officers, hasn't the guts to tell the truth in the court-martial because of the damage it would do to him personally. Jos&eacute; Ferrer as the defence attorney brings off his shrewd courtroom examination with memorable ruthlessness. As a study in the mental disintegration of a serving officer, and also in the damage that spite can do when manipulated by a scheming underling, this is a riveting film.
