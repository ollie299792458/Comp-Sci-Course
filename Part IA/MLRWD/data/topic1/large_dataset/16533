I have been a fan of Adam Carolla since he sat alongside Dr. Drew on the radio show "Love Line."  I listened to him from the first day he was on Dr. Drew's show until he left to move on to bigger and better things for himself.  I even sat in the audience of his TV show "The Man Show" which I really enjoyed.  However, I have to say much to Adam's chagrin that he is a lousy actor.  He is too much of a stiff in front of the camera and always has been.  His acting in "The Hammer" is "NO" exception.
My guess has to be that the other people who left an overwhelming positive review here on Amazon for "The Hammer" must certainly be his pals in Hollywood.  The idea of Adam portraying a carpenter and a boxer is so ridiculous because if you know Adam you know that he used to work as a carpenter and met Jimmy Kimmel while giving him boxing lessons.  Suffice to say that there was no need to make an effort here where Adam had to research his character for the movie since he is essentially in a role as himself.
Adam, I really like your work in radio and I strongly believe that that is where you need to keep yourself.  You have a very quick wit and your salt of the earth comedy leaves me in stitches.
Sorry Adam, but this is my honest opinion and it pains me because I really wanted to like your movie.
