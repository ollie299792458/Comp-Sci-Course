Thomas Hardy, master of the nineteenth-century rural English gloom and doom novel, penned a sweet, uplifting romance in Under the Greenwood Tree.  Skillfully adapted to the screen, this tale that originally centered around local young man Dick Dewy, is now recast with Fancy Day (Keeley Hawes) as the central figure and with the three men who love her secondary.  It works very well and creates a bit of charm in an otherwise simplistic tale of rustic romance in a small Dorset village (though the film was entirely shot on the Isle of Jersey) amid the changes hinted at by the impending Industrial Revolution.

It is the story of Fancy, a schoolmistress who returns to the village of Mellstock.  She is young, beautiful and educated, and the villagers don't know what to make of her.  Handsome Dick Dewy (James Murray), a workingclass lad, is instantly smitten as are nouveau riche farmer Mr. Shiner (Steve Pemberton) and the local vicar, Parson Maybold (Ben Miles).

Fancy feels a need to honor her father and marry well, but in the course of events she falls in love and must choose between following her father's wish or following her heart.

Beautiful photography and authentic scenes and costuming add to the charm of this lighthearted adventure.

Recommended.
