This movie is so creepy.  I notice the other reviewers have used the same word.  This makes it different from several other horror movies, in that it does not rely on blood and guts to get under your skin.  It does it by using your mind against you.

The movie takes place in a time-period not normally picked for horror movies.  This ups the ante for a 5-star rating, just for being different.

The acting is good, adding a woman and a free black man gives a twist.  Then you have good and bad guys w/in the same group.  Excellent to watch it unfold.

'Hidden easter eggs' abound.  Watch the mirrors in backgrounds and freeze-frames on quickly opening doors.  I missed these until someone told me... and WOW!

Slowly, the viewer comes to the recognition that something else is happening besides the place being haunted and even why, and that 'something' rocks the movie on the creepiness scale.

Buy this if you can.  It is one to watch over and over, because it's a smart one.
