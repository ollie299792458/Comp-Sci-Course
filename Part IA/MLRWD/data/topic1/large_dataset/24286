Cirian Hinds and Samantha Morton are wonderful actors, but why didn't the screenwriters even glance at Charlotte Bronte's book when they wrote this screenplay?  It was a very strange experience to see some of my favorite characters of literature saying and doing things that weren't even remotely connected to the story.  Rochester screaming at Jane to leave Thornfield?  Jane and Rochester shopping downtown for wedding clothes and "bumping into" Blanche Ingram?  I don't think so! Not only did the screenwriters make up entirely new scenes, the dialogue in familiar scenes was often totally unrecognizable.  I watch film adaptations to see my favorite characters and scenes fleshed out, not given a major overhaul.
Two things they got right -- the age difference and chemistry between Rochester and Jane (although Samantha Morton is too pretty.  Come on!  She can't be pretty Harriet Smith in the A&E version of "Emma" and plain-Jane Eyre in this movie!)  If you just like to watch good acting, you might like this.  But if you, like me, are a fan of the book, this is a very jolting and unpleasant ride.
