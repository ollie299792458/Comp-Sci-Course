First of all, this movie was (obviously) made to promote the magazine of the same name.  If I recall correctly, it succeeded.

It says right on the magazine's cover: "The Adult Illustrated Fantasy Magazine" - and has never pretended to be anything else.  (After all, this is a publication owned by National Lampoon!) To appreciate this movie, you have to watch it on its own terms.  The stories are beside the point.  Even the nudity and sex are beside the point. (To refer to it as little more than a masturbation aid is missing the point - after all, erotic art has been around for centuries.) It's about the art.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, comic book (or, in this case, graphic novel) art is a legitimate art form.

On those terms, the movie is... not bad.  Yes, the animation styles clash and are uneven.  The music (besides Elmer Bernstein's score) seems a bit tacked on.  After all, if you're going to call it "Heavy Metal", it makes sense to have heavy metal music in it.  How such obviously non-metal acts as Donald Fagen, Don Felder, Stevie Nicks, Journey and even Devo (!) ended up in the mix is beyond me.  Was Alice Cooper unavailable? How about Styx, or even Ozzy Osbourne, whose solo career was just beginning at that time?

So, leave your Puritanical and Victorian sensibilities behind, and enjoy it for the fantasy it is.
