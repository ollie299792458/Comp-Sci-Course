Don't be fooled by the DVD cover: there will be nothing saccharin about your experience of this film after having viewed it start to finish. I believe I accidently happened upon this picture while wandering aimlessly around the foreign film section of Blockbuster video on a winter evening back in 1998 (when the film was first released).  At the time, the title probably resonated somewhere inside the idealistic part of my psyche...but here I am years later, still affected. Roberto Begnini somehow manages to artfully convey (even as the tone, events and storyline within the movie dramatically change) that we have the ability to mold uncertain (at times fearful) circumstances into bearable opportunities to cope, and ultimately live (there is an irony, here, for any who see the very end of the film). The focus is indirectly placed on the choices we make and attitudes/perspective we have as we go through hardship; simple awareness and determination; and, of course, real love.  The love conveyed here is the sacrifical kind that wants the best for the other person...but touches also on the qualities in love (and in life) that are absolutely fantastical and magical: the things that don't need explaining and the stuff that is known by methods other than the tangible:  happenings, circumstances, people and events that transport us to the places that make sense only in the context of an intimate relationship with a universe of intricacy and uncertainty. It's an artist's film. It will charm and amuse you right before it delves deep and leaves you in tears.
