I am 26 years old and have seen the orginal 1953 version with Vincent Price.  Now that was a horror film! This movie, as I said before, was made for the MTV generation. Kids and adults who have no patience and need things to movie quickly before falling asleep or bored.  This movie has all that the original lacked; a bunch of kids in expensive cars going to the forest and camping out, getting drunk, a talentless heiress doing a strip tease, loud music, bad language, blood galore (and I am a great lover of blood galore. Check out Dead Alive by Peter Jackson! A classic), crazy twin brothers who go around killing people and...I won't tell you what they do with them if you don't already know.  This movie lost the soul the original had, and the true horror.  It's a shame that cheesy remakes of masterpieces are being made (Like the Fog by Carpenter. Sacriledge!) instead of new innovative films.  Patience is a virtue.  Maybe if more moviemakers kept that in mind more than a select few horror movies of my generation will become the classics that "The Fog", "In the Mouth of Madness", "House of Wax" and "The Wickerman", to name a few, have become.  Thus far, it seems that in 30 years I will still be watching the old classics because they are both more terrifying and masterfully made than most horrors of my generation. That is not to say that this movie was not fun. It was. The set design is exquisite and I was in awe of the house for it was actually made of wax. Which made the wonderful ending possible. But it was not great. It will not go down in history.  This movie is alright for the now but it will disappear tomorrow.
