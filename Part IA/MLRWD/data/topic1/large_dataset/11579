Nothing like the Holidays seems on the surface to have a lot of potential. The cast is quite exceptional and the story of rowdy, dysfunctional, but loving family coming together for Christmas is a frequently used vehicle that can make for a good flick. What emerges is a film that tries very hard but falls flat in a number of areas. The characters are almost akwardly two dimensional and several scenes feel forced and cliche. It wasn't until halfway through the movie that I began to really care what happened and had a desire to see the movie through to the end. Alot of the characters actions are incomprehensible, such as when Jessie kisses Marissa at a Christmas party in full view of everyone, with her boyfriend a few feet away. Also, when Anna decides over Christmas eve dinner to announce to everyone, including her husband, she's getting a divorce and then apologizes for ruining the evening. Couple that with a stream of profanity and vulgar humor (which thankfully relents midway through the film) and this doesn't quite make for a feel-good holiday film to remember. The film is only 90 minutes long but felt like it took hours to tell the tale. In a few scenes we see family photographs that look like photoshopped collages of the individual actors. Perhaps this is almost metaphorical for what is happening in the film. We have several disjointed pieces all kind of smooshed together in an attempt to make a holiday classic. The end result has some warm moments, but ultimately is a film I never want to see again.
