The Wall album is probably one of rock and rolls finest masterpieces.  However, The Wall as a film isn't as wonderful.  All of the actors in the film, one of them being the very talented Bob Hoskins, could have done a great job if given actual lines to say.  The film focused more on creating a collection of music videos to all of the wall songs instead of developing characters and a clear plot.  There are times when Bob Geldof's portrayal of Pink is rather haunting and effective, especially when he transforms himself into the leader of the surrogate band.  I am not sure what director Alan Parker intended for this film, but his concept just didn't work.  For example, the film lapses into strange and wonderfully powerful animation sequences, courtesy of the awesome Gerald Scarfe, and then makes an awkward transition back into the real time story.  The animation sequences are entertaining to watch, but they don't serve to solidify the plot or develop the characters.  However, the DVD has some really cool special features including a making of featurette and some music videos as well as easter eggs.  Enjoy!
