Was the title for one of the best reviews I read for Pretty Woman back when I was only fifteen years of age. I was forbidden to see the film, my mother thinking I would instantly be standing on street corners looking for Lotuses, but I saw it anyway. Three times. When it came on video I watched it until the tape died and I needed to buy another, and another. Then, I bought a DVD player JUST for it. I've gotten into many heated discussions about how this movie degrades women and gives young girls the wrong ideas about things. But that is NOT how I look at it at all.
My favorite scene in the movie is when Vivian and Edward are in bed, talking and Vivian goes on about how she ended up in Los Angeles to begin with by following a "bum" that her mother called her a "bum magnet" "If there was a bum within a fifty mile radius I was completly attracted to him." But the line that stuck with me the most was "When people put you down enough you start to believe it" and Edward replies "I think you are a very charming, very beautiful woman" Vivians reply is full of emotion when she replies "The bad stuff is easier to believe...have you ever noticed that?" Which is true.
Maybe it's just me, but I think that this movie is just a fairytale, and fairytales are there to make you believe in something that is totally unbelievable. This movie gives you hope, show's you that even if you're life is misserable, that even if you are a bum magnet; if you don't give up hope a millionare in a Lotus might be just around the corner.
"Welcome to Hollywood, what's your dream? Some dreams come true, some don't, but this is Hollywood, always time for dreams so keep on dreaming" Words that ring so true.
