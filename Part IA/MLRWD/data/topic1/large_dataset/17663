I had originally BETA recorded the TV broadcast, then years later transferred this remarkable odyssey to DVD.  This "NEW DVD" version with all the original deleted TV parts now included in the full story version, makes this a more interesting and detailed story.  The quality of this DVD using an up-conversion Blu-ray player gives the picture image a very close to comparable HD image.
I highly recommend this DVD.  My only negative note regards the part of "Captain Victor (Pug) Henry" played by Robert Mitchum.  As good a professional actor he was, if only he had been 10 years younger I would have given this movie a 5 Star rating.  Mitchum is no longer with us, but the rest of the cast (especially Jane Seymour and the late Sir John Gielgud), and production should be commended for the gripping and horrific reality that they gave to this movie.
As good as "The Winds of War" (part 1) was,  the Producers,  Directors and Actors outdid themselves for "War and Remembrance" (part 2).  There are very good special features on the production of this series,  and the packaging is outstanding.
