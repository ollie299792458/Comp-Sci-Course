The Exorcist is widely known as the scariest movie of all time and I agree. This film is both shocking and very cerebral. It starts out with actress Chris Macniel (Ellen Burstyn, Academy award nom.) hears strange noises in the night. Her daughter Reagen (Linda Blair, academy award nom.) feels her bed shaking. After a few such strange happenings Chris takes Reagan to doctors who say its just nerves. Repeated examinations don't help and they send here to a shrink who recommends an exorcist. Reagan does things to convince Chris that she is inhabited by demons and Chris goes to Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller, academy award nom). he examines her as a Psychiatrist and as a priest; he determines that she is indeed possessed. The church sends experienced exorcist Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). The latter part of the movie shows their attempts at exorcism and eventual success despite their deaths. Lee J. Cobb plays a detective investing a death at the Macneil Home. A 25th Anniversary edition on video and DVD includes an interesting retrospective on the film. In 2001 a new 'writer's cut' included 11 min. of extra footage.
