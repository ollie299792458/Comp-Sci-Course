This is one of the most artistic, stylish, masterful, atmospheric &amp; epic "attention 2 detail" packed movie's ive ever seen honestly...not just for a western, but for any kind of genre! Amazing directing,= in pure Sergio Leone style, smooth flowing in an artistic way &amp; doesnt try to rush anything, but lets u soak up the scenery and atmosphere in an icredible way. But, be warned if u are a type of "Ah, GET ON WITH IT" impatient person this may bore u a bit, but if your reading this u already know SERGIO LEONES "take as much time as u need" attitude. But even if u are that impatient person, give this atleast one viewing, it may even suck u in untill your hooked on this. This is considered by many as "THE GREATEST WESTERN OF ALL TIME" with the runner up as "THE GOOD, THE BAD &amp; THE UGLY" &amp; i gotta tell you.......it aint no lie!!!!
P.S. If u EVER loved a western &amp; u aint got this then u dont exist. Theres really no use for me to say BUY this Special Collectors Edition version.... because all u true WESTERNERS HAVE IT IN YOUR COLLECTION ALREADY! Peace.
