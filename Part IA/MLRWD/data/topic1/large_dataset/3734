Scarface was the first DVD I ever purchased.As always,the movie is a masterpiece and the disc is well worth buying. The documentary and deleted scenes are like manna from heaven for Scarface fans.The documentary is insightful and informative and features terrific interviews with Al Pacino,Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone.The highlight of the documentary is,undoubtably,the hilarious overdubbed clips from the TV version of the movie. Most movie deleted scenes on DVDs are usually  a big waste of time.Not Scarface though,the outtakes are awesome. The photos on the Still File were great but, unfortunately,they took forever to load.A lot of people complain about the picture quality of the DVD but I had no probelm with it.It was fun reading the subtitles to see what the characters were saying in the movie,too.Overall though,it's a great movie on a well stocked disc and it is a must buy for Scarface fans. As Tony Montana never said "In this country,you gotta get the DVDs first.Then when you got the DVDs,you get the power.Then when you get the power,then you get the women."
