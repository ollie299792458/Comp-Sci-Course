What I really love about this movie is the way it revives the lost art of sports storytelling.  Nowadays, major sports events are told in cold, statistical, terms.  Sometimes they'll run biographies on players, telling  how they grew up in a poor community in Georgia, but you never really get  inside their head.
And if there were ever an athelete whose head you  eirther could or would want to get into, it's Muhammed Ali.  As we go  through the movie we begin to see through Ali's bluster and begin to  realize that he's nervous.  Norman Mailer points out how every day, Ali  would have to go into the gym where Foreman had just been working out, and  see the immense dent in Foreman's punching bag.  Ali knows that he's  reaching the age where boxing not just becomes more difficult, but  extremely dangerous, especially when dealing with a juggernaut like  Foreman.
My favorite scene in the film occurs between the first and  second rounds.  Ali has been confusing Foreman with right-hand leads, but  all they've accomplished is making Foreman furious.  Ali now finds himself  pitted against an opponent who is stronger than him, younger than him, and  determined to knock him out, (to paraphrase Maiier's comments.)  We see  Ali, stunned by the first round of boxing, staring blankly at the canvas.  Suddenly, we see his eyes and face focus, and he gives a little nod to  himself.  He cries to the crowd, "BOMA YE!" In the next five  rounds he will use the rope-a-dope and finally emerge victorious.
I can  think of no greater scene in any movie.
