I've been holding off writing a review of this set.  As some have said, their later films leave a lot to be desired when held up against their earlier films.  But give this set a try!

I have VHS copies of Great Guns and The Big Noise but had waited patiently to see Jitterbugs as many had said this was the best of the later crop of L&H movies.  Not so!  It's good, I'll give you that and contains some nice pieces like their Zoot Suit Band and the con game but I prefer The Bullfighters as the best of the later films.  The Big Noise is a great treat if you haven't seen it because it has some great gags and the boys are surrounded by some very funny supporting characters.  Again, don't let the hype or the lack of hype for any of these films sway you.  There's some great moments in each of the films.

The special features include trailers for all of their later films including the 3 in this set plus The Bullfighters, Dancing Masters, and A-Haunting We Will Go.  There's also commentaries on each movie and a very interesting documentary on The Sons of the Desert.

Maybe this set is for completists and maybe it's not.  I think it's for people who love Laurel and Hardy.
