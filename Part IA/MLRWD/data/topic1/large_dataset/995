I love the excitement of seeing a movie the day it opens, there has been some advance buzz about "the descent" but not much, at least not what I've heard. several friends gather together and go "spelunking" [caving] and take a wrong turn into unchartered territory, after a cave-in  their skills are tested often and there is real tension navigating through the series of twists and turns in the cave. but the real trouble begins when the girls meet up with human-hybrid creatures [crawlers] that are blind and move about using sound similar to a bat. the creatures aren't interested in breeding, they're looking for a meal. the girls get seperated after their first encounter with the "crawlers", so the confusion caused by their seperation forces them to fend for themselves and summon resources they thought they didn't have. "the descent" is very gory and gruesome, so if you have a weak stomach this is not for you.

the caving exploration they take is meant to bring them together after one of the girls suffers a horrible tragedy. the cast was all female which was a nice change of pace from the usual all male crew we're used to seeing. of course in the process of battling the creatures, they become warriors and even resort to turning on each other during the savagery they have to endure. the end of the movie is a legacy of the movie "carrie", gotta leave 'em with one more shock, that I thought was completely unnecessary. but "the descent" is one of the better horror offerings I've seen recently after too many lame and predictable horror movies in the last few years. hopefully when "the descent" is released on dvd it will include the ending from the european theatrical version. an alternate ending that is much superior and shocking than the american version.
