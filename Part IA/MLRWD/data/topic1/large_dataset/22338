-How do you know women so well ?
-Well..., I think of a man , and then I  take away reason and accountability.
I loughed so hard, Jack Nicholoson  is superb on this one. He builds his character progressively through the  movie, carefully though, in a role that could very easily be overshoot or  downplayed. His looks and his actions are very convincing.This man really  cant tell what is right and wrong to say. He really strugles hard to make a  compliment. He suffers... And Jack Nickolson offers us a great  performance.
As his neighbour calls him at some point, he is "...a  horror of a human being". His worst nightmare is being touched by  other people, he is so superstitious that he walks in strange patterns in  order not to step on the lines of the street tiles and he brings his own  packaged, sterile silverware to the one and only restaurant that he eats,  always at a certain table, always served by a certain waitress, Helen Hunt.  But besides all that, he progresses, slowly but steadily, and around him  all the characters of the movie. And he does that not in an artificial  transition but in a natural, step by step procedure. Marvelous performance.  Of course the script is on his side, one of the smartest scripts that have  come out of Hollywood for a long time.It's a must see for women and men  alike.
