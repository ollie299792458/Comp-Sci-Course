This film has a tight script (by Abby Mann) and is superbly acted. Maximillian Schell received a well-deserved Oscar for his role as the defense attorney. The cast included more than a half-dozen well known actors and each made a fine contribution.  As director, Stanley Kramer was the driving force behind the production. Outdoor scenes were filmed at Nuremberg, but the courtroom was unavailable and recreated elsewhere. What carries the film from the first scenes to the end is undenially the theme, which can be posed as a question: Can and should civil court judges serving an increasingly violent fascist regime, be held responsible for decisions based on doubtful eveidence that resulted in atrocities against the nation's citizens? Where appropriate, some of the atrocities by actual archive film or photographs are shown. The viewer comes to realize that all these things happened by degrees as the Nazis gained more control. Historically, only the most principled judges escaped this dilemna by resigning their offices and thereby ending otherwise promising careers. Unfortunately, none of the four judges portrayed in the film quite came to that point. Additionally, the prosecutor (Richard Widmark) and the judges (Spencer Tracy for one) that judge the indited judges, wrestle with international law issues that were not yet fully  established. If you can handle these strong subjects, you'll enjoy this film.
