The focus of this review is the technical aspects of my movie rental experience, i.e., as opposed to a review of the movie itself. Given this preamble, you are correct if you think I have reservations. First of all, I was unable to download the movie I selected to view (Iron Lady). I therefore contacted Amazon technical support, who was unable to rectify the problem, and therefore gave me a $5 credit. We then selected a different movie to view, which was suppose to be in High Definition. It was not in high definition, and the sound track was two channel stereo. The quality of the picture was not good; blurry, smeared, pixalated. The sound was similarly disappointing.  Subsequently (following night), we were able to download Iron lady, and were once again treated to poor video and poor quality two channel audio. This, in spite of the fact that it was supposed to be HD. Note that I have good quality equipment, so I cannot think that the fault is at my end. My impression is that Amazon has a lot of work to do before I will download another movie from them.
