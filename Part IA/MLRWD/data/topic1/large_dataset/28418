This DVD is one to treasure for John Denver fans. He had a unique gift of communicating simplicity and earnestness in a way that was penetrating yet comforting at the same time. This concert finds him in beautiful voice and mature artistry. He never tries to oversell the song; it flows effortlessly from him and he always performs from within himself. His love ballads are particularly affecting; he sings with such feeling yet never imposes the emotion on the listener, allowing us to experience the joy, longing or sadness within ourselves. That is true artistry. I found myself unashamedly wiping tears away on several occasions.

His passion for his art and for wildlife preservation, communicated in the short interviews between songs, are infectious. Not hard to see why he inspired so many in his lifetime. Like many others who grew up in the 60's and 70's, some of the first songs I learned on the guitar were John Denver songs, which at the time just seemed like fun tunes to play. It's only been in recent years that I've learned to appreciate more fully the depth of his incredible gifts and legacy. He died not more than 2 years after this performance, and not more than 5 minutes from where I live in Pacific Grove, CA, in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. A huge loss for the world of music.
