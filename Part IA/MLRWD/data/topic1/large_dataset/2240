I can tell that anyone under the age of 62 will have a hard time with the concepts in this movie & won't be "gettin' it"... I am 68 years young and this was a pick-me-up & throw me back to the good ol' days in downtown San Francisco and the "Summer of Love" 1968. Loved this movie!!! Man... everyone needs to "chill out" and enjoy the "scene" and "get down with it". Seeing Alan Alda was a treat...he has never lost the "touch"... he played a pivotal role in the film, and always makes me laugh. Jennifer was slightly out of character but, was great as someone having a complete "change of life" moment. Paul Judd seemed to fit well in the "soup" of the cast, seemed a bit stiff...but mostly was his character. I have seem some of the reviews panning this movie... wow... do we have a bunch of people out there that are so "PC" they can't even enjoy a good romp once in awhile??? This movie represents a moment in time when we should stop and consider life, friendships, relationships, and just being able to have fun!! It seems that most people today have totally forgotten how to do just that.....sad scene folks...So get this film and put aside any expectations; just relax and enjoy.. I highly recommend this movie!!
