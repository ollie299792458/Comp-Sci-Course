I found the 10th season of this series rather disappointing. Perhaps I've come to expect a lot from this series. If so, the creators have set rather high standards so that in a sense says something about the quality of the series.

The season opener was quite funny - dealing death to Chef. The ending was a teaser, and it would have been fun to see a few episodes with "Darth Chef"

But the next few stories were not very engaging. I really don't care much for the towelie character. If the story is funny, great. But as a character, towelie is pretty flat. So to speak.

Smug Alert had its moments, but it seemed like the point was dragged out a little too long. It should have been a minor sub-plot to a main story.

"Manbearpig" was fun to watch because Cartman's greed and selfishness again leads to comic situation that is just insane to watch! Seeing a bloated Cartman and the end result of his greed and selfishness was a joy.

"Tsst" first pits the incorrigible Cartman against the Nanny reality shows until he meets his match in an unlikely nemesis. We learn something about Cartman and his mom. For a while you wonder if Cartman has grown and matured... but only for a little while.

The next story to make an impact is "Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy" which basically reflects all our responses when we hear of a hot teacher banging an underaged student: where the heck were these teachers when I was in school?!

The "Go God Go" two-parter was a great trip back to an old sci-fi TV series and the twist at the end was great.

The season ender "Stanley's Cup" was a bummer. I guess there's a reason why these underdog shows always end predictably. You can't mess with story dynamics.

So I'm giving it three star. Maybe I'm being harsh, but I think the creators can do better.

On reflection (edited Nov 2010), I've up the rating to 4 stars. "Tsst" stood the test of time and because a classic for me. As did "Go God Go!" two-parter, and the "Manbearpig" episode.
