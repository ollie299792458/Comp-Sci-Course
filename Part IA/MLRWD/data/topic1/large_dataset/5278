Jingle All the Way is a highly entertaining movie for the Christmas season. It is very reminiscent of pleasures and pains the holiday season can bring. Howard Langston (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is an ordinary  business/familyman who promises to buy his son Jamie (Jake Lloyd) a  TurboMan, the season's hottest selling toy, for Christmas to make up for  breaking past promises. Little does the big man realize, every other  last-minute shopper in Minneapolis including stressed-out postman Myran  Larabee (Sinbad) is looking for the exact same toy. And the toy is nearly  sold out! So what starts out as the simple pursuit for an action figure  gift turns into a hilarious Christmas shopping nightmare. 
I think that  anyone who has gone through the pains of last-minute Christmas shopping,  especially for young children, will identify with this film. This  action/drama/comedy is sure to get Christmas lovers to feel the warmth of  the spirit of the season. Furthermore, Jingle All the Way sends a very  positive message to parents, that in the end the true parental hero is the  one who has the love, trust, and respect of his/her kids.
