The sight of Audrey Hepburn, dressed immaculately in a black dress, wearing large black goggles, holding a danish pastry in one of her hands and a coffee in the other, looking wishfully, enchantedly into the window of Tiffany, joins forces with the extremely beautiful yet melancholy background score by Henri Mancini to set the tone of the movie. Quirky, witty, modern, fashionable, yet flowing over an undercurrent of unexplainable sadness.

Holly Golightly (I must say I have never seen an actress look more beautiful and apt in her role) plunges a viewer into a strange state of mind. She makes him happy and sad at the same time. Happy for obvious reasons but sad because behind her merry facade lies someone who is progressively falling into a chaos due to her own indiscretion and indecision. And you feel for that other person mainly because of the amazing talent of Hepburn at being able to convey small nuances of her character.

The movie made me sad. Extremely sad, as I fell in love with Hepburn. Her vulnurability has made me a fan of her for life and I am sad that her charisma, her charm is not present anymore. Personally, I feel that such works of art and perfection like Audrey should last for ever :-).
