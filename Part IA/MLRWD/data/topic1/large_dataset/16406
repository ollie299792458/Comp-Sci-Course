Millions of people around the world know their names, some worship the ground they walk on...Pavarotti...Domingo...Carreras. Alone, any of the three is a wonder to behold, but together, they are at the top of their game. In this, the first of several world-reknown concerts, they amaze the audience with their wonderful voices, and entertain by playing off of each other on songs like "O Sole Mio". Opera purists apparently think this was nothing more than a cash cow for the performers, but there is a reason that, to this day, this concert's accompanying album is still listed in the Guiness Book of Records as the best-selling classical album of all time. Other concerts may have had more glitz and glamour, but the first showcases the Three Tenors at their best, both together and individually. Once you hear Nessun Dorma, done by either Pavarotti by himself or by all three, you will understand why it is one of the most-beloved arias of all time, and was made popular as a theme for World Cup soccer (and more recently used by Paul Potts to win Britain's Got Talent). Overall, this is, by far, one of the greatest classical shows you will ever see or hear, and is just as wonderful to enjoy now as it was nearly 2 decades ago.
