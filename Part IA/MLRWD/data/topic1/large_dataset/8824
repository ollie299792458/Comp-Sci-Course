For a film with absolutley no action scenes, "Executive Suite" has a gripping story which holds your attention until the very end.  When the president of Tredway Corporation drops dead, the top men of this company begin to manoeuvre for his job.  M-G-M used some of its top stars in this film and competing for the boss's job we have...Walter Pidgeon, Frederic March, Paul Douglas, Dean Jagger and William Holden.  They are supported by Barbara Stanwyck, Nina Foch, June Allyson and Shelley Winters.  Frederic March gives an outstanding performance as the conniving accountant with sweaty palms who will do anything to get the top job and William Holden captures our attention as the idealistic young designer who wants to build a better company with better products.  When she was first handed the script, actress Nina Foch felt insulted that she was to play an ordinary secretary but once filming began, she realized that she had been given one of the best roles of her career.  We tend to forget how glamorous Shelley Winters was back in the 1950's but she certainly looks fabulous as she portrays the mistress of weak-willed Paul Douglas.  There are numerous intrigues and double-crosses in the movie all of which add to the pressure we see unleashed in the final scenes.  If you've never seen this film, you are in for a treat.
