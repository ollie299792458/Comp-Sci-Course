I have not sen this movie on DVD yet, (I just found out it had been relased and am going to buyu it) but it was in fairly high rotation at out local "Art" theater when I was in High School" and a good rental in subsequent years.
The film has the other worldly qualities of many european sci fi books (and some American speculative fiction).
This is low tech fun.  (Watch "Farenheight 451" for a similar feel.)
Bowie is great as the alien. He plays the part much the way he plays the various stage personas in his music career.  (He is definitely playing a different character here than he does in: "Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence" for example, which suggests that he might be able to act)
"Slow paced, but odd" might be a good description. If you like that kind of thing, then see it.
This is not a traditional "Hollywood" Sci fi movie with lots of lasers and explosions. The hero is not a traditional hero. Howard Hughes is probably the most similar real person the this main character.  If that interests you, then good. If not, then stay away.  
As far as Bowie music tie-ins all you get is the covers of two albums somewhere in the film.  1.) The picture of Bowie on the cover of "Low" is taken from the same era.  2.) The cover of "Station to Station" shows Bowie walking into the space ship he builds in the film (though I've never noticed that exact shot in the movie).
