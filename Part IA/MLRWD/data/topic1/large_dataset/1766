Frazetta is not only an amazing, ground-breaking artist, but an amazing human being as well. I was somewhat familiar w/his artwork, mostly from the Molly Hatchet album covers of the '70's; However, I was totally unaware of this man's rich history, his upbringing, and his tireless dedication to family. This is a man to admire on many levels, and to hear others speak such praise of him on this disc will bring a tear to your eye. Talented, humble(I can't stress this enough!!!), and unrelenting, Frazetta has overcome obstacle after obstacle, never complaining, only adjusting and perfecting what is in many eyes already perfection. I am not an artist, but this documentary had me rivited; The human side to this man's story and the art he has so lovingly created is something that can be enjoyed by all, artist or not. One of the best things I have seen in the last six months. I came away from this with the utmost respect for this man and the legions of artists he has inspired. This documentary is also filled with alot of humor and insight(much more than I ever expected). What a brilliant, compassionate man. Simply remarkable on every level!!!!
