I saw this in the theater twice with different friends and then watched it again last night with my husband. Even on the third viewing, I was laughing out loud. Now admittedly I enjoy almost all comedies (even dumb ones) and I'm a huge fan of both Tina Fey and Steve Carell. If you don't like Frey in 30 Rock or Baby Mama or Carell in 40 Year Old Virgin or Little Miss Sunshine, of course you're not going to enjoy this movie; the actors aren't breaking any new ground here.

I found Date Night not only funny but charming, one of the most enjoyable comedies I've seen recently. While the couple fights at times, ultimately they are genuinely kind and enjoy each other. The humor isn't mean-spirited and snarky, like, for example, Get Him to the Greek or Grown Ups. (I loved Get Him to the Greek, btw, and hated Grown Ups, which was too dumb even for me.) Date Night manages to be warm-hearted but not sentimental or cloying. It's refreshing.

I will say it gets off to a very slow start, showing us how boring the couple's life is, but once Fey and Carell are running around the city, the pace picks up and the movie gets very funny. (Ridiculous but funny.) It's worth watching just for a truly hysterical scene with James Franco and Mila Kunis. Plus, there's the funniest pole dancing scene ever.
