School Ties is about a Jewish boy by name of David Greene (Brendan Frasier). He lives in a small blue-collar Pennsylvania town where he is a standout high school quarterback. David gets recruited to play for St. Matthews, a preporatory school for the wealthy. While at the prep school, David, with encouragement from those who recruited him, hides his Jewish identity. At first he fits in well with the other boys (cast includes Matt Damon, Benn Affleck and Chris O'Donnell), befriends them as well as a girl from a nearby girls prep school. However, all changes when his identity is revealed.

I thought this was a very good movie. However, it was both unrealistic and biased. Firstly, I find it highly unlikely that in a real life situation, some of David's classmates (van Kelt and Connors for instance) would've stood up for him. In reality, the whole group would've probably stayed loyal to Dillon and agreed to expel David.

Also, the movie attempts to portray David as the perfect hero and victim, which he is not. He is at fault in some ways. For example, he betrayed Dillon by pursuing his "girlfriend" Sally Wheeler, although it was obvious that Dillon was interested in her. David should have shown more respect and kept a distance for the time being.

To conclude, the movie is a good entertaining watch but very over-the-top.
