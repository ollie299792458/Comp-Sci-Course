Perhaps the main characteristic of this brilliant script is its overarching cynicism. The above reviews -- fawning in their praise for the script, the director, and the acting -- reveal what the writer knew about his audience.  They -- you -- are gullible.  Some reviewers are less so.  They observed how the entire script involves passages that are beyond believable.  And so it is -- unbelievable.  One is not taken in so much as put to the side, wondering "Who can believe this crap?"

Which is exactly as the writer intended. Too dark, too stereoptyped, too one-dimensional, too good to be true.  It can't be true.  Yet television news has devolved closer to this send-up than anyone else predicted.  The almighty dollar, alarmist political ideology, and sheer egoism have stripped network news of its stature. It is hollow, grasping, easily deflated, ugly.

Even the unedited blogosphere, with all its flaws, surpasses network and cable news in immediacy, depth, and usefulness. The real wonder is that network news thrives at all. Studies in human engineering show this to be due to the declining knowledge and education of the public as schools dumb-down their curricula to match multicultural and multi-language goals, and political correctness supplants tough love as the cornerstone of humanitariansm. The brilliance of the script is in how it shows that unprincipled humanitarianism leads to intellectual cannabalism - the worst self-defeat of all.

A magnificent movie that shows the flaws inherent in the commercialization of the media -- making it a pawn of capitalism while simultaneously denouncing itself.  The self-inflicted wounds are the seeds of its mounting irrelevance.

A wonderful movie, almost evil; but only because of its dark truths.
