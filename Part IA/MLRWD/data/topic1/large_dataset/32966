I first saw this movie in high school French class back in the 70s. Can't say I remembered much of it except the famous song and the image (though not the contents) of the final gas station scene. Course, our French teacher probably didn't let us see subtitles, so I'm guessing I really didn't understand most of it anyway.

Got it on a lark recently to watch again and found it very touching, and beautifully filmed, if a tad melodramatic.  By coincidence, I watched the "Young Girls of Rochefort" a while back, made by the same director and also starring Deneuve. Actually, I think I preferred "Rochefort," but both are worth watching.

The simple story is told in a straight-forward way, a fact that is masked by having all the dialogue sung.  The ending is not what you expect, really, with both characters appearing colder and harder than a typical romance might have them be. Still, the movie is better because of this, more moving and realistic.  And each scene is lovingly and gorgeously put together, so its a feast for the eyes.  The ears---not so much. I found the women's voices harsh at times, hitting high piercing notes that grated.  Still, the score is pleasant and--though it may be overused a bit--the famous song a joy to hear.
