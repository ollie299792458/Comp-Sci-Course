I thought Chicken Little would be a safe bet for my 4 year old son.  Was I wrong!  I read newspaper reviews to get a "feel" for the movie and did not get any indication that this movie would be inappropriate for younger kids.  Plus it's rated G - we have seen other G films from Disney without issue.  It looks like Disney is stretching their concept of what is a G film.  Thanks for the nightmares Disney!  What were you thinking?  Our hero boards an alien ship and a "lab" area with pulsating tubelar "organs" in suspended jars.  The music is appropriately eerie to add to the scary effect.  "What are those mommy?".  "Will they be ok?".  Then Chicken and his friends run into 2 very large spidery mechanical creatures with menancing domed heads.  When the aliens chase the gang away, it's with blade wielding propellers that can mow down a corn field.  Later the aliens attack the town with lasers, zapping characters into apparent nothingness.  "Mommy, where did Foxy go?"  "Why are they shooting everyone?".  And to make matters worse, the scenes are rather drawn out.  I tell my son, "You'll see, hang on...." and it just plays on!  What a terrible movie for kids.  Don't take any child younger than 6 or at least not to a theatre viewing of this movie.  It's just too much to absorb via big screen.  Only jaded, bored kids would not be bothered by the scenes in this movie.
