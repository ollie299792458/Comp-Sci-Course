I don't know what film others saw, but the one I saw four times is at least as good as the previous two in the series, and a very satisfying wrap up to the entire trilogy story line.  No Action?  Hunh?  It has just as much edge-of-your-seat action as you could hope for.  Too many villians?  That's just plain stupid (especially considering how one of the "villians" is redeemed.)  In fact, as best as I can determine, folks who voice disatisfaction in this film do so because it is truly a story of redemption and forgiveness, and apparently people would have preferred murder and mayhem (there's plenty of that out there, so if that's what you want, then I agree that Spidey 3 isn't for thee.)  And with regard to the person who said that this film was all about "revenge" getting "shoved in our faces" -- well, actually it's about the "danger of revenge" and turns the table on that attitude in a great conclusion that brings tears to your eyes (or ought to, anyway.)  I've never bothered to write a review before, but it really has gotten under my skin how many critical pans this film has received that are just plain senseless and, frankly, ignorant.  Let this set the record straight.  Watch all three together and you've got one great story set:  1, 2 AND 3 -- without exception.
