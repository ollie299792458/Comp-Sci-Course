Other reviews tell you the basic story, so I won't go into that here.  My first problem with this episode is that like "Homecoming" and Deer Woman" it just isn't scary.  This is from the Masters of Horror collection, so I was expecting fear, and it just wasn't there.

  We've seen this type story done before, most notably in Cronenberg's the Fly and Walas's The Fly II, so the new angle is the character's are lesbians.  What they are missing is chemistry.  Why is Misty infatuated with Ida?  Is she the only lesbian she's ever met?

  Performances are all amateurish.  Ida (Bettis) seems to be channeling Joan Cusack on a bad day.  McKee's direction must have been to tell her to talk slowly.  Misty (Brown) in contrast talks fast, running sentences together.  Okay, they're opposites, I get it, but I don't believe (in this case) that they attract.

  I did like the artistic dream sequence and some of the humor when Misty begins to change, but I would think that someone's lover would notice when goo starts spurting out of their paramour's ear.

  The other actors aren't given much to do.  We know who is going to die and they're death's are pretty well telegraphed ahead.

  If "The Woods" sees a release soon, we'll be able to tell if Lucky was just lucky with "May."

Here's hoping for the best.
