"BLACULA" has always been one of my favorite horror films so I was glad to see it finally turn up on DVD.
I am generally quite happy with this disc, although I think it would have been nice to have some extra's besides the trailer. Maybe some interviews or an audio commentary would have been nice. Or at the very least, some liner notes with background info on the film and/ or the great Shakespearean actor William Marshall who plays that "strange dude", Mamuwalde, aka Blacula. Marshall (who died last year) is simply great in the part. Investing his African Prince with dignity and class, making his vampire one of the most memorable in the history of horror. 
The anamorphic widescreen picture looks beautiful and the mono sound is very pleasing. I've always liked the music by Gene Page and the songs by The Hues Corporation (fans of this film should check out the cd soundtrack available from Amazon as well) and they sound great on this fine disc. 
Anyone who enjoys vampire films should pick up this disc and its inferior though still quite enjoyable sequel, "SCREAM, BLACULA, SCREAM" today. You will not be disappointed. - George Bauch.
