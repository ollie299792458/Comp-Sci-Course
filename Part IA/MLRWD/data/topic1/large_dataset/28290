Duel in the Sun is an epic production. It is beautifully filmed -- with great music, expert stunt work, well-trained horses and a superb cast of superstars. ... end of story. It doesn't hold up as well most other films from the 1940s (or the 50's, 60's, 70' ,80's and rest of the century for that mattter), and the script (sic) which is corny, campy, unbelievable and painful to watch is an insult to discerning film-goers now, just as it must have been 60 years ago. King Vidor ( the name fits, and he wears it well) has teamed up with David O. Selsnick to foist this multi-million dollar spectacle on overzealous groupies of the film-classic genre who, (as you can read from the surrounding reviews) just adore it!  It has three things which will please film lovers: 1.Jennifer Jones 2.great scenery (redundant) and 3.the best stunt horses this side of - - wait -- I already said that.
Despite a tremendous effort on the part of Gregory Peck, Jones, Lilian Gish and the rest of the talented cast to make this  horrendous script come to some sort of life-form, the movie ultimately sinks to a level of  jabberwocky so low that it makes the script of  Paul Verhoeven/Elizabeth Berkley's "Showgirls" seem like "A Place in the Sun" by comparison.
  This is two and a half hours of my life I can never get back.
I give it 2-stars -- only because of the stars.
