I didn't love everything about this film.  In fact, the first time I saw it, I felt it was lacking in depth.  But the second time I watched it, many little moments shone through and I saw the depth of emotion being prtrayed.

First, Payton's performance as Andrew really hit a few times.  When he first starts warming up to Christian (as Christian grows more confident) by responding to Christian's teasing, I thought this was some complex and genuine emotions.  There's a great "you bitch, okay, let me see that" moment.

Second, I liked Aaron's genuineness when Bisset's character is suffering and he knows he doesn't have anything to make her feel good.  I also like the fact that he put Bisset's character's needs ahead of his own agenda of converting people.

Finally, I thought the best moment was between Aaron and his mom (Mary Kay Place) as Place's character begins to comprehend the suffering of her  son and begins to get past her prejudices.

After my second viewing, I fell in love with the film.  Worth owning.
