This is one of those movies that may put some people off because it is a romantic comedy.  Hopefully people decide to watch it since it's worth it. This movie comes off as charming, especially every time Xander is on the screen.  There's just something about that Southern charm of his...

The movie may be a bit cheesy at times, but viewers can forgive this by continuing to watch.  Without giving too much away, the plot can be frustrating at times since you just want to shake some sense into some of the people on the screen.  Although it has its slow moments, this is not a movie that will drag on forever.  By the end the viewer will feel happy, and it leaves the viewer satisfied with how the story ended.

The acting could be better, since there are a few times when the actors look like they feel awkward playing their roles.  Overall, I'm one of those people that the ending can make or break the movie, and I'm glad to say in this case it left me feeling happy with where I left off.
