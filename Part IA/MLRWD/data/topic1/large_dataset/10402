Marnie is one of Hitchcock's greatest ( and most underrated) films of all time.  Even though it was dismissed by critics and such at the time of of it's release it has since come to be considered one of  Hitchcock's great  films.  It is obvious that this film went over many peoples heads therefore  leading to harsh (and quite unfair) criticisms.  It is the same with the  performance of Tippi Hedren as Marnie.  Even though her performancce is  brilliant many dense people criticize her for it.  I am aware that people  tend to be unfair about the sets of the film as well.  The film often shows  things the way that Marnie herself sees them.  Alfred Hitchcock obviously  wanted the sets to look the way they do though.  Sean Connery (in an  excellent performance)  also stars as Mark Ruttland ,Marnie's obsessed, and  concerned lover.  Another misconception about this film is that of Sean  Connery's character.  I have seen people refer to him as a "jerk"  and such but that is really not the case.  If you intelligently watch this  film it is not hard to see that he truly cares about Marnie and that he  does really want what is best for her.  Even though he does have faults of  his own he is certainly not a hard hearted and cruel person.  Even though  Marnie does not get half the credit that it deserves from some  it is still  an exellent movie well worth watching.  I hope that you enjoy it as much as  I do.
