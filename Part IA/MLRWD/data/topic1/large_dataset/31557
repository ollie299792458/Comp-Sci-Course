Tenacious D. Just the name gives me chills. Brrr. Hear that? That's the chills I get from just reading the name. It's kinda like Jake Steel. Or sassafras. Or...or...or...Penguin figure skating. Yeah. That's cool. Cool like ice. Or Penguin figure skating. Seriously though. I first became hooked on Tenacious D when a friend of mine showed me a music video he had found on the internet (YouTube of course) of Tribute. I heard it (and watched it, obviously) and was instantly in love. Now of course I know that there are better songs out, which makes them even more satisfying. Like warm pajamas on a winter evening. Mmmmm. When I heard that they had a movie too, I was shocked. I had to see it. Had to. Hadtohadtohadtohadtohadtohadtohadtohadtohadtohadto. Had to. Anyways, I didn't want to purchase it until I saw it's glory. So then, one day when I was bored and watching the TV (or telly as the call it in some places. Heehee. Telly) I noticed that it was playing on HBO and had just started like one minute ago. I instantly used my ninja/samurai/pirate powers to switch channels and started watching. When it was over, I was speechless.  And in case you hadn't noticed, that's pretty amazing for someone who talks as much as I do. It was like an action/drama/comedy/parody/musical/jam session/romance/philosophical mix. Like goulash. Or something. Anyone who likes having their brain implode because of intense levels of awesomenessitivity should watch this. Tenacious D roolz the ballage. BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!1!1!!1!!!!11!!1!!!!1!!!
