While I love this movie for the intrinsic romantic value, I must confess myself to be disappointed with the storyline and the portrayal of the characters.  For anyone who has read the legend of Trisan & Isolde, this movie will be a grave disappointment.

The historical inaccuracies run rampant across this movie.  First of all Tristan & Isolde were romantically involved only up until she married Lord Mark, then, because of Tristan's high moral beliefs and his love for Mark, they did everything he could to stay away from each other.  Second, Lord Mark and Isolde hated each other from the beginning.  In fact, it has been suggested that they never consummated the marriage.  thirdly, in this timeframe, Ireland was ruled by a queen who followed the ancient Druidic religion.  She took consorts, never making kings of the men that she loved.  And in actuality, Ireland never really had a high king, merely high ranking chieftains for the multitude of tribes.

Isolde (first of all they don't even pronounce her name correctly in the movie!!) is portrayed as a meek and, at times, pathetic woman.  In the legend, Isolde is a warrior queen of Ireland, a woman who suffers no man to be her better.  This Isolde is willowy, wispy and altogether forgettable.

Tristan is the most irritating figure in this movie.  James Franco, for all of his smoldering good looks and stunning physique, gives a childish quality to this character, one whom you expect to throw a temper tantrum at any moment.  And, like that spoiled child, once he has what he so desperately claims to want, he throws it away the minute he is done with her.

If you're looking for romance, this movie might do it for you.  As for me, I'll stick with the books.
