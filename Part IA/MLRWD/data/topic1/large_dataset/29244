I have seen this film countless times. After my first viewing in January 1995 at the theatre I felt that gary oldman deserved to get an oscar for his performance as Beethoven and the film should have easily received the osacr for best movie.  however, the film was very quietly received by the public at large; on the other hand, it has generated an almost cult following among Beethoven fans. The story is based on the biographical account of Schindler and offers one of sevarl possible versions of beethoven's private life.  Quite apart from any inaccuracies the film is wonderfully shot and one of the final scenes that mixes excerpts of Beethoven's childhood, his father and the first performance of the 9th simphony is amazingf.. Critics complained that the music, performed by Georg Solti - who makes a camei appearnce as the conductor of the 9th, was performed according to 20th centurt standards and instruments, rather than the less evolved varieties of Beethoven's day.  i found that to be completely irrelevant.  The point is that the music written almost 200 years ago played on whatever instrument will osund u equivocally beautiful.  The film is very romantic but never sirupy or oinctuos.  Immortal Beloved is Amadeus ' equal in beauty and effect.  The soundtrack of course speaks for itself.
as a side note those familiar with Tolstoy's short story 'The Kreutzer Sonata' will find some familiar material.  The fact that Bernard Rose directed the film version of Anna Karenina only 2 years later -- with a beautiful soundtrack of Rachmaninov, tchaikovsky and other Greats -- does not surprise me and suggests that Mr. Rose has excellent taste in music, literature and loves beauty in general. I look forward to his next work
