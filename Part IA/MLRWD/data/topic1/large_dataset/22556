We chose to get this movie because of the actors, but our expectations were fairly low, based on many of the reviews here. Imagine our surprise when we discovered that Igor is a charming movie, full of heart and humor from the beginning!

Note, however, that this is not a movie to just "sit" the kids in front of and walk away.  There is enough complexity in the characters and the story that one would want to be present to explain things as needed.

Having said that, I cannot say enough about the story line and the characters. Despite the short time line imposed on the creative team, the script was well written, the musical choices superb and the voice-over work impeccable. Although John Cusak and Molly Shannon were probably never in the same room together, it is not at all apparent in the movie, which isn't always the case. The cast boasts a laundry list of wonderful actors and performances, but Eddie Izzard deserves special kudos for his quite evil, yet not TOO over-the-top, Dr. Schadenfraude.

Is it an old story? Perhaps. Is it predicable? Sure. Does it borrow from tired cliches? Absolutely. But it is also a universal story, with a familiar arc, and characters that the viewer can identify with. And it does all this with respect, and love, which is why it feels fresh and (if you'll pardon the pun) it's alive! I'm sure we will watch this movie again and again.

The one thing that frustrates me about Amazon reviews is that reviewers often don't give readers a reference point from which to compare their (the reviewer's) taste to one's own. To that end, I will say that we are substance-over-flash people: we found Wall-E mostly vapid, condescending and heavy handed, while we watch Hoodwinked over and over for its heart, well developed characters and intelligent humor.
