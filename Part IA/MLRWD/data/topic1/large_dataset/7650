Catch this train and get ready for a two hour trip back to the Old West.  It would be redundant to repeat the many eloquent reviews already written about this movie, even though I do agree with most of them. It seems that just about any movie Russell Crowe stars in will be superb and "3:10" is no exception. This is due in part to the excellent supporting cast provided, where each added their own mark and contributed to the success of this movie. In my opinion, most notable was Ben Foster as Charlie Prince. He dominated the scenes that he was in and you found yourself waiting for his next appearance. (Award worthy performance) For me, everything worked for this film: cinematography, "costume" selection, score, story, - - - everything and the two hours went by like 20 minutes. Hopefully, the DVD will include extra footage and when it finally is in my collection, it will sit alongside "Unforgiven", "Once Upon a Time in The West", "Open Range", "Lonesome Dove", "The Shootist", "The Long Riders", to name a few. To conclude, if in any way you enjoy a good movie, and especially Westerns, don't miss this one.
