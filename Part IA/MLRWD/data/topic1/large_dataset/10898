In what, in my opinion, has been a lull in good movie releases,  I Am Legend pleasantly surprised me.  A friend and I were bored one Friday night and neither one of us particularly cared for the trailer, but we decided to see it after it got some surprisingly good reviews for an action movie.  Also, I found out it was based on a novel by the great Richard Matheson which is one of the major writers of the Twilight Zone, so that sold me.  Neither one of us expected much of this movie, but both of us came out of it rating it 5 stars and already talking about looking forward to buying it when it came out.

That being said, I was TERRIBLY upset when I saw that the "Special Edition" had VERY limited features.  A crappy 4 minute alternate ending that I can find on youtube and NOT EVEN A COMMENTARY?  I am so glad I did not buy the special edition.  Hopefully there will be a REAL special edition soon with some decent special features on it, but I would advise against buying this one.  Great movie, no features!
