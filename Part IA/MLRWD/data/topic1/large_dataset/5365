Witness is a very fine film with only one or two flaws.  Perhaps the only real flaw is the moment when the father (Jan Rubes) gestures to his grandson to get the gun.  This is a betrayal of the whole tenor of the Amish side of things -- it was unnecessary, one of those "Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" moments characteristic of American film where in spite of the rhetoric, a gun is the ultimate solution.  Some things were a bit hamhanded -- for example, we didn't need every one of the hot glimpses between the lovers in the barn raising.  The last scene of all revealed Harrison Ford's limitations: he just looks, and looks -- the laconic American -- and it gets a little boring.

But the film is lovely and spacious -- I had forgotten the first five minutes, all in Pennsylvania Dutch/German (!).  And of course the barn raising is special:  this is what a real community does.  There is something not quite strong enough about the community witnessing at the end as the final weapon -- it should have been ramped up a bit I feel.  The community should have somehow gotten in the way and made the difference more strikingly.

The best things are Weir's cinematography (especially in the erotic lamplit night scenes), and Jarre's great score (I prefer the barn raising passacaglia with an orchestra myself as opposed to the electronic score, but it really does give you a feeling for why a passacaglia and fugue can be driving and emotional -- for those who think Bach is boring).  Oh yes, and then there's Kelly McGillis half naked.  Why someone doesn't rerelease Reuben, Reuben is a mystery to me.
