Das Boot remains likely the best war film ever made.
I suggest purchasing the photo essay UBoat War as a companion, and also reading the novel Iron Coffins before watching the film.
After doing so, you will agree the film is a truthful retelling of the facts.
I still enjoy the very first edition im deutsch mit subtitles, especially as the language isn't bastardised or 'toned down'(for whatever reason I do not know)
Especially the most recent edition, regardless of which way you watch, english alone, deutsch mit subtitles, oder just in german, each one is slightly different with regard to colloquialisms; the english only obviously being the most americanised??
Either way however, the experience through fabulous photography and sound effects transports you into the bowels of the mighty U-96, where you can only celebrate the triumphs of surviving, enjoy some Christmas cakes in Vigo, and curse the aircrafts at the end.
One to watch time and time again.
Also, you can see how Petersons experiences in making DasBoot impacted him in making the Perfect Storm.
Favourite characters:  Captain, and Martin (different speeches about der fuhrer in each edition also??), the Chief, and of course Johann.  However it is all the others that make the above such great characters, especially as we know they are real heroes of history and not made up Bruce Willisers.
