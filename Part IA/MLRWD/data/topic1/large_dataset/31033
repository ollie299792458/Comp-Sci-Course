Don't miss this jem of a movie if you are intelligent and want some food for thought!! You may think that this is a typical ghost-type story as you begin to watch, but think again. Don't expect to be terrorized, and don't expect blood and gore, or even slash and bash..but do expect to be challenged mentally. Nicole Kidman plays the mother of two children who are photo-sensitive and must be perpetually in the dark, and her character is very prone to migraines. They are supposedly waiting for the father to return from the war. You know as the movie progresses that things are not as they seem, but you WILL be surprised at the end of the movie. This movie is not at all predictable. Nicole's character is very committed to her religion, and if you listen carefully, a lot of beliefs are called into question. What is the truth about life and death? And do we really know much of anything? At the end of the movie, Nicole admits to her children that she doesn't know anything and says "I'm no wiser than you are". Each and every character is marvelous, especially the one who plays Ann, a sassy little girl with a mind of her own. The one who plays Mrs.Mills is just about as wonderful a character as you could imagine, such a kindly and honest woman with great strength. Nicholas is a boy in denial about what has happened to him because of his great love for his mother. And Nicole's character is played to perfection. I just have to say I loved this movie and have watched it over and over. It has really made me think.
