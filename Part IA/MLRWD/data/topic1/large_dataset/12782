An excellent adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play of the same name, this film is peppered with memorable one-liners that only Oscar Wilde could have penned. Just a smattering:

Lord Arthur Goring: To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.
___________
Lord Caversham: I don't know how you stand society. A lot of damned nobodies talking about nothing.
Lord Arthur Goring: I love talking about nothing, Father. It's the only thing I know anything about.
___________
Laura: Do you know, Gertrude, I don't mind your talking morality a bit. Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike. You dislike me, I am quite aware of that, and I have always detested you.
___________
Lord Arthur Goring: My dear Mrs. Cheveley, I should make you a very bad husband.
Laura: I don't mind bad husbands. I've had two. They amused me immensely.
___________
Laura: Wonderful woman, Lady Markby, isn't she? Talks more and says less than anybody I ever met.
___________

But what makes this film so compelling is that behind the humor lies a thoughtful story of a man forced to choose between his honor and his reputation. Highly recommended.
