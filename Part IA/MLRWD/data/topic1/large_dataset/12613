Having seen the short preview, I cancelled my order because of the background 'rap' type music, which is entirely inappropriate as theme music for such a desperately traumatic experience for Americans, most especially the bereaved relatives. Something more sombre, reflecting the sadness of the occasion, would have been more appropriate.
However, I now regret my cancellation and will be re-ordering it, as the content is absolutely first class and the music was of shorter duration than the trailer had led me to believe.
The film contains much new material and I have little doubt it will prove to be the most devastating indictment of the official account yet.
The blind patriotism of so many americans, coupled with compliant media enabled the 9/11 plotters to get away with it -- so far. It is particularly gratifying that the film included the case of Smedley Butler, in which some of the most powerful corporate and financial interests conspired to commit treason by unseating Franklin D. Roosevelt. They would have got away with it had General Smedley Butler, whom the plotters had appointed to lead the coup not gone along with it in order to obtain the evidence to accuse them. In the event the case was quietly buried by the authorities.
