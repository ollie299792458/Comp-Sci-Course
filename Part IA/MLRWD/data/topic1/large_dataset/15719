The first Ong Bak rocked, and this movie rocks ever harder. I've seen tons of Awesome Martial Arts flicks in my years and this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The story line has almost no link to the first Ong Bak. Even the feel of this movie is different. We only see the the Statue of Ong Bak in this movie a couple of times, but as a movie set 400 years or so before the time of the first movie, the plot makes sense. From a marketing perspective, the title Ong Bak 2 makes some ense also.
In this century, Tony Jaa has become the most talented and athletic onscreen martial artists of our day. His movies keep getting better film after film. After Ong Bak and Tom Yum Goong, his third film improves 10 times over those first two. The historical setting of ancient Thailand is refreshing. The storyline is very well handled, I wasn't bored waiting for an action scene as many action movies do. When the action starts, the action never really lets up unless you reach a natural plot developement. Even the best of Jackie Chan movies just suddenly switch to fight scenes when you have no idea what the heck happened with the plot.

Jaa uses a wide variety of Martial Arts Styles, techniques and weapons. From various forms of Kung Fu, to various Forms of Thai Martial Arts, as well as his uses of a variety of weapons including Ancient Thai swords, Japanese Katana Swords, and even a 3 section staff.

Yes the movie ends in a Cliff Hanger, but so did Star Wars with the Empire Strikes back. I'm anxious to see how much Ong Bak 3 will improve over this spectacular movie.
