This was with out a doubt the worst remake I have ever seen. Better then the original?! Are you kidding me?! Terrible acting, terrible CG, the movie is just plain terrible. Any ways, any movie that stars Steve Guttenberg now a days is going to spell disaster, and in a bad way! And why on earth did they change it from a tidal wave to a bomb that turns the ship upside-down?!? One of the main themes in the movie that stands out is the wave hitting the boat, and they took it out and replaced it with the most illogical thing they could think of! And how on earth are they supposed to send a rescue e-mail from the ship when all the equipment to transmit that e-mail is completely under water and presumably damaged, they even say in the movie that they lost all contact with the ship! If they could transmit an e-mail, heck, why didn't all the passengers just call for help! I'm sure they all have cell phones! Bottom line, horrible movie, don't waste any form of currency on it! If I could have gave it negative stars, I would have, it doesn't deserve one!

PS: This movie I believe is also one of the reasons that the movie Poseidon didn't do as well as it should have in the theaters. Poseidon was a hundred times better then this movie, even with the mediocre acting.
