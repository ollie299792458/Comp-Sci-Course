I just want to clear up the bonus disc issue for anyone looking to buy this set. If this information has already been posted (and for those already aware), please pardon the repetition.

It appears that the 3rd Bonus Disc (Limited Edition - 1977 Capital Centre - Largo, MD) is a promo item exclusive to certain retailers, namely Wal-Mart. I recently saw this set advertised on television, and Wal-Mart was the only retailer specified at the end of the ad as carrying the item, obviously as a plug for Wal-Mart. Additionally, while shopping this month, I noticed that Wal-Mart carries only the set with the Bonus Disc, while other stores carry only the 2-Disc set. Both items also have different UPC codes.

So, anyone looking for the Bonus Disc set needs to be careful about buying online, as there seems to have been some early confusion about where to get the bonus disc. Be sure to ask your used seller which version they are offering.

As for the Kissology set itself, I did receive the 3-Disc version as a gift, but have not yet watched it in its entirety. While being familiar with most of the content, my general impression of the set is that it is a quality product that is well worth the retail price for even the most marginal of Kiss fans. I say this due to the fact that this material is FINALLY available in a non-perishable format. Anyone who is familiar with the 1985 Live Aid DVD set, and what a laborious task it was for the producers of that set to assemble the few bits of quality footage that actually survived, should appreciate why this Kissology set is so valuable. It is a sad fact that master tapes degrade over time, and with the footage in this set being 30+ years old, it is a blessing that we have this much complete footage to enjoy in a format that will not degrade (at least not in our lifetime). I, for one, am happy for that, and it is for this reason alone that I feel it deserves 5 stars.
