You know you love a flick when you've watched it over fifty-something times over your life. Such is the case of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, (1966) my favorite film of all. This was the third and final installment in Sergio Leone's Man With No Name trilogy which turned Clint Eastwood into an international super star. This film has it all: Action, adventure, humor, plot twists, and the best western showdown ever. Eli Wallach practically steals the film from Clint, but it wouldn't be the top Western at the Internet Movie Database if all three actors didn't give it their very best. Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach are a trio made in heaven. Sergio Leone's genius (which influenced the likes of Quentin Tarantino) only adds to the equation. You owe it to yourself to OWN this masterpiece. But also watch "A Fistful of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More" to truly appreciate Leone's groundbreaking, revolutionary work. Fans of other sagas with similar elements such as the Star Wars Trilogy may prefer watching these films in their proper chronological order for greater effect: First "TGTB&TU" followed by "Fistful" and finished up with "Dollars."

Note: This version contains scenes that never made it in previous cuts. They add to the story in certain ways, but I believe they seriously detract from the characters in others, particularly in Tuco's and Angel Eyes' cases. Leone aficionados who own both the regular and extended versions know what I mean. Wallach and Eastwood's voice overs sadly point out that the men have truly aged and simply sound out of place. The worst part is Tuco singing. It goes against everything the character stands for in the story, turning him into that typical Hollywood cliche: The merry Mexican bandit. Contrast this with Tuco's dramatic reunion with his brother at the monastery and you'll understand why this scene was left in the cutting room. Nonetheless, you should own at least ONE version of this classic. You won't regret it!
