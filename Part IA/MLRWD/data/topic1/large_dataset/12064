One night in the Hard Rock Cafe in Universal City, I was fortunate enough to encounter director M. Night Shyamalan and I went up to him to tell him how much I enjoyed "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable." He was about the thank me when suddenly I asked him why the "Unbreakable" didn't break box office records (yeah, I know, what nerve!) and he told me: "I think it was misunderstood."  I believe this is what happened to this really good film which I found refreshing. It overstepped the boundries of your typical Hollywood hype movie (it came out at the same time as the ultra-crap "Charlie's Angels" and "Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows").  So my question is: Does the movie-going audience prefer your standard "factory-made" crap or something completely different, unusual, and downright smart? Mister Shayamalan, your great film wasn't misunderstood, it's the audience that rather sit through cheap thrills like "Charlie's Angels."  If you want to enjoy something different, well-filmed, smartly written, and wonderfully acted by Sam Jackson and Bruce Willis, then check this film out.  Otherwise, hey, they're playing pre-prepared Hollywood hype in your local theater.
