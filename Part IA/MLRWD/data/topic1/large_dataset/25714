What a let-down this movie was.

I've always been a huge fan and avid reader of the X-Men.  What made them exceptional was the incredible character development, intricate plotlines that involved moral dilemmas and inter- and intrapersonal struggles.  It was never boring -- the human aspect to things kept it real and gave it depth.

The movie has none of this depth.  It does have some exemplary special effects.  But I have to say -- it's really frustrating when they reduce almost all the newer characters to mere cameos... They just tease you with a little bit of special FX to illustrate their powers, but then fail to do *anything* with the character for the entire movie.  Most of the characters are mere 'bit' parts -- even (strangely enough) Professor Xavier and Magneto.

As for what other people have said regarding the acting: I agree full-heartedly that the acting is flat and uninspired.  Neither Patrick Stewart nor Sir Ian McKellen are given the opportunity to showcase their incredible talent. (Nor is Kelsey Grammer.)  Hale Berry is horrible.  Hugh Jackman makes a convincing Wolverine, but you really wish they'd explore his character more.

So what to say?  I saw the movie because I love the X-Men; but the movie did not fulfill its potential in the least.
