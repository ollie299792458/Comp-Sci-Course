I wasn't really sure quite what to expect from Dream House when I sat down to watch it. My wife's description had been a bit vague.

"It has James Bond and his wife and it's about this house."

All sort of true I guess. Anyway, I wasn't sure if I was getting a ghost story, horror story or what. Turns out of course it's a psychological thriller with a maybe supernatural element. The keep that cleverly vague and inconclusive. Which I liked.

I actually love these sorts of movies where it's not quite clear who the villain is or even what exactly is going on. There is a huge twist part way through the movie. One that I sort of guessed. But even knowing it didn't spoil the enjoyment of it playing out. And even then it still wasn't completely clear who was good and who was bad.

The photography really emphasized odd angles and shots through windows or from behind branches. That definitely added to the creep factor which was perfect for this sort of thing.

I don't have a lot to say about the acting. It's a great cast, but really it's all about Daniel Craig and he is great throughout. Showing the entire range of moods of his character. Happy father, angry husband, scared, grieving. It's just an all round great performance.

Really the only criticism I have is that the ending. The last three minutes really. Was weak and unsatisfactory. But despite that I'd definitely say watch it.
