Wanna be punk kids. Small town america. Rich boy with a big mohawk. Angst. Angst. More Angst.  Its Like Greg Araki lite. Great blue hair and super soundtrack but...it lacks something... Hmmmm...This movie could be best  described as 50% My Own Private Idaho (only punk and not gay), 30% Fast  Times At Ridgemont High (only post High School and Punk, not new wave) and  20% "lets hook it up with a punk soundtrack and the kids will love  it". I was kinda depressed by this movie. Maybe it hit too close to  home and I felt like I know 10 people who could have easily been Stevo.  There were some scenes in the flick that I really laughed at...The doctor  visit at the start of the film, the convience store incident, Stevos talk  with his mom and dad about law school. But mostly I just didnt believe  Matthew Lillard as a punk. Maybe that's the point. Im not sure. The ending,  I felt, was contrived and just silly. And the fact that the movie seems to  be trying to say that "all punks have to grow up" just makes me  shiver and laugh. This movie is worth a rental but Im not sure about buying  it. hmmm. I wouldn't buy it but I wouldnt laugh at you if you did... I  would suggest maybe checking Greg Araki out before you slap your money down  for this flick.
