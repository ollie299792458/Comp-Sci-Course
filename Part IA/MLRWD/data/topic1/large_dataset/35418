This is the story of two young Brits who scaled a particularly treacherous mountain, the Siula Grande, in the Peruvian Andes in 1985.  Not anticipating the difficulty of the summit climb, the ordeal of inclement weather, and even greater difficulty of the descent, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, then in their early twenties, undertook to make their ascent in one push, carrying on their backs all the supplies they expected to need.  Wholely dependent upon each other for success and survival, Joe Simpson falls during their descent and suffers a particularly nasty, life-threatening broken leg.  Yates then undertakes to lower Simpson on a hundred meter line through blizzard conditions until there comes that dreaded moment when he can no longer feel Simpson's tug on the line and, to save his own life, must sever it.  Miraculously, Simpson survives the fall.  Then each must make his way down the mountain on his own.  Though it seems to doubtful that this will be possible with such a severe injury, Simpson musters enormous physical and emotional reserves to manage to survive.  It's a haunting tale, and much of it is told by each man facing a camera narrating his story in nearly deadpan style.  Joe Simpson wrote a book about his experience, and has gone on to become a writer.  Simon Yates meanwhile has become an adventurer.  To make the film, each man has to return to Siula Grande, and that turns out to be a difficult emotional journey.  Filmmaker Kevin MacDonald's interweaving of the men's narratives with careful reenactments makes for a sumptuous, beautifully filmed, and riveting viewing experience.  In addition, there are terrific special features telling more details of the return to civilization and what life has been like for each man since.
