To be up front I do not have this dvd. I have seen the movie a million times and own it on laser disc(anyone remeber those). The main reason that I am writing this review is so people will totally skip over the review by Not Important from Gone Fishing. He or she gave it one star. This mystery reviewer said it was a terrible movie, who would run from a god? Did they think they would win. Hello! Its a movie. Just like those of us who like the Star Wars movies do not really think there is a 7 foot walking carpet out there we do not think someone would run from a god.It is a movie. A great movie, with great directing and great acting. It"s more about a young boy finding a family among dwarve thieves becasue his parents are to wrapped up in the televeision and material goods to even think about their son.
  If you have not seen this film and like other Gilliam films, like 12 Monkeys or the Fisher King, go rent it. I dare you not to laugh out loud. Then come back here and get the dvd. I am ordering my copy right now.
