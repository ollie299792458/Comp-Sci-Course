I remember reading my Fangoria's and Gorzone's discussing all these Cannibal Flicks such as Man from Deep River, Cannibal Holocaust, Jungle Holocaust, Slave of the Cannibal God, Eaten Alive and especially AKA Make them die Slowly.  By this time, I was groomed to appreciate the all the aspects of film making, but especially the special effects. By the time I saw all of these films on dvd what really got to me were the animal deaths.  They were real!  This was before they had animal protection in films.  I don't think we should ban these films.  They only show how far we come.  However,  there is more that needs to be done.
However, if you're looking for a film with a lot of cannibalism then I recommend Cannibal Ferox over Cannibal Holocaust.  No matter what you're going to get the usual animal snuff with these films.  But over all Cannibal Ferox has better special effects.  What I really like about both films is that they point out it was people's actions that caused the cannibalism.  Not the other way around.  I like the last line of Cannibal Holocaust, "I wonder who are the real Cannibals?"
