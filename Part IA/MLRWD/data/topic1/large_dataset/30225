...Charlie's Angels ultimately has everything.It may lose it's appeal a bit on video as the spectacle of the cinema has been taken away from it(except for those with widescreen TVs)but this depends on your perspective.The story doesn't make an awful lot of sense ,but the events that conspire around it are as brain restingly fun as they come.Out of the stunning trio of girls,all are stunning,but Cameron Diaz is easily the most alluring of all.Blonde,kinky and apparently able to do more than James Bond,she wins my FHM vote with this one.She is simply amazing.Bill Murray,a talented comic performer,does get a pretty low key performance here ,but though good,his method of comedy may be kind of dated to a younger audience ,so this isn't so bad.Barrymore is the sassiest of the lot,especially in a scene where she breaks free from a chair she is tied to.It's also nice to see Sam Rockwell again after his haunting performance in The Green Mile.The movie is also full of explosive action,which is the main name of the game,and it delivers above the required standard...I look forward to McG's next feature.Make it another action one.Oh,and may I also strongly recommend the CD of the movie,featuring entrancing tracks from Leo Sayer and Aerosmith.
