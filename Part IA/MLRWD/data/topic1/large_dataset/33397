There is not much to add to what has already been said............minor complaints on my end (and its so minor).....They don't mention the she's the one soundtrack at all?!  (Remember kids Howie was going down hill by then.....so I was curious to how that record came about and the sessions etc).......even if it was quickly mentioned.  Also when it comes to Howie they miss a couple of key points that Tom has already made in the interview book released a few years back. Howie was FIRED....understandable so....but that is never stated.....and in the book Tom recounts how Howie is arrested in New Mexico with his girlfriend Carlene Carter, they fly him to a gig that night or next day and he literally shows up with NO SHOES. Now I don't want to put that in to make fun of Howie, who lost his battle with drugs and died....but it just shows what a bad state he was in and WHY the heartbreakers had to move on without him.  Like I said TOTALLY MINOR POINTS. ITS A GREAT MOVIE AND IF YOU LOVE PETTY.....YOU WILL LOVE THIS!
