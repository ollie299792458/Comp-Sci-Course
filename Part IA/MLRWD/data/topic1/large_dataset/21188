Having seen previews, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  Three American Rednecks who are on their way to Iraq but end up in Mexico should have provided plenty of laughs.  It should've been stupid funny, but it was worse than stupid.  There actually are people like this out there, but most of us know to keep them under a rock somewhere, not trot them out on film as if there is anything to laugh about in these guys.  Bill Engvall plays a character who is happy he had a slip n' fall at the Walmart, so he can be out of work for 11 more months.  DJ Qualls could be funny as a trigger happy cop-wanna-be, but first we had to find out that he flashes women at a nearby restaurant.  Maybe that could be funny, but it is not here.  In fact, every joke falls flat.  Even Larry the Cable Guy can't fix this one.  This movie is awkward and is so uncomfortable to watch I can't tell you how it ends.  If you really have to see this movie for yourself, wait until it hits Redbox and get it for $1.  Then you won't feel like somebody done you wrong.
