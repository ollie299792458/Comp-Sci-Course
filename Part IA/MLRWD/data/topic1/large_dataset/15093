with all due respect to the monumental talent on this DVD, the John Petrucci trio stood out from the rest. Only two songs in the set, but what beautiful numbers, flawlessly performed, all three musicians tight and precise.The opening number, Glasgow Kiss, has a celtic feel and Petrucci shines with a focused intensity from the first lyrical riff  to the high-powered finish.  Drummer Mike Portnoy plays perfectly off Petrucci--at the finale, he leaps out of his chair as a release from the intensity of his concentration. A magical musical moment! The second number, Damage Control, starts out with a toneless power-chord riff that repeats a little too long before  unfolding into a beautiful instrumental epic. Lots of wonderful twists and turns with an exotic, middle-eastern groove woven in. I have to say this set from the Tokyo tour is my favorite out of all three of the G3 DVD releases.  As for Vai's and Satriani's sets, those guys are incredible guitarists and I love their playing. But some of Satch's compositions seem redundant and Vai's drummer doesn't appear to get a chance to explore rhythmically or dynamically on Vai's numbers. Even so, this DVD is a great one to own and listen to repeatedly. Don't forget to check out Petrucci's nod to Richie Blackmore"s solo from the great Deep Purple Made in Japan album during the G3 jam. It's all good!
