This is a great DVD for splatter film fans who have a sense of humour. It's no classic, but in a time when most studio horror films are bland teen/twentysomething slasher flicks or bloated, soulless CGI extravaganzas, this one stands out from the crowd. This film unashamedly sets out to scare and gross out its audience with a collection of gory setpieces that are sometimes reminiscent of an Itchy And Scratchy cartoon. The filmmakers obviously had a blast making this film and the fun they had really shines through onscreen. Okay, so it may sound weird to some who are reading this that I'm using the word "fun" in relation to a film that features so much violence and death...but longtime horror fans and gorehounds will appreciate what I'm saying. It still resembles a glossy studio film, but has that old drive-in horror movie sensibility that really appeals to me.
The extras are terrific. The usual behind-the-scenes/deleted scenes stuff, a fun card game, etc. My favourites are the documentary about gore in horror films and test subjects reactions to scenes from FD2. Good to see the twisted fun of the film carries over into the special features!
