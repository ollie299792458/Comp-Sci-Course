I had low expectations for this film, but I must say I enjoyed it in spite of myself. Part Western and part War in the Pacific, there is something for everyone: romance, sweeping landscapes, cattle drives, stampedes, bush fires, a slice of history with Zeros attacking the port-city of Darwin [These war sequences were especially effective.], and a strong dose of magical realism. Hugh Jackman is the perfect handsome brooding hero, and, as the movie progressed, Nicole Kidman became a splendidly intrepid, if predictable, heroine. The young indigenous Australian boy, always under threat of being relocated, was engaging enough to gain one's empathy. I also found the wide range of ethnic "cowboys" to be particularly interesting.

If the film had a weakness, I would say that it fell into two categories, characterisation and moral message: The villain was unrelentingly villainous (to the point of cliche, gnashing his teeth and glaring at the heroine). Furthermore, the respectable citizens of seemed a bit too obviously snooty to be credible.  Finally, the moral was laid on with a rather heavy trowel (The "No Place Like Home" scenes from the Wizard of Oz, and the playing of Elgar's "Nimrod" when the boy regains his heritage as he goes on walkabout at the end of the film seemed engineered to set the tears spilling down one's cheeks).

Nevertheless, with the Blu-Ray technique, which enhances the spectacular cinematography, this Australian "Western"-cum-World War II film presents a worthwhile several hours of viewing. Definitely worth watching!
