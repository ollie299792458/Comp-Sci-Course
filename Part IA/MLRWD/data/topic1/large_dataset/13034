This is NOT the series for you if you want an impartial, objective account of fighter-vs-fighter combat as researched from all points-of-view like we've had for decades. It is neither a documentary nor scientifically researched.

This IS the series for you if you want to be known as promoting the propaganda that only American-Israeli fighter-heroics count throughout world history.

Mis-leadingly advertised in various countries as "all the greatest dogfights in history" and "all the greatest dogfights in the world", this series focuses almost solely on US-Israeli victories and NEVER represents US-Israeli fighter-vs-fighter defeats. That's propaganda, not history nor documentary.

It can't even stick to the definition of dogfights as being "aerial combat between two or more fighter planes."

Typical representation of the rare non-US-Israeli victories are an obsolete Swordfish torpedo hitting Bismark, obsolete Kamikazes and gunless German suicide planes, even Kamikaze mini-subs.

Even when representing a British fighter-plane, those involved in the series are so biased they had to use one of the rare American volunteers shooting down the likes of unarmed liason planes rather than one of the vast majority of Brit/Cdn Mosquito aces shooting down even 30 true fighters like the FW190.

Friend or foe, the series is no less offensive to the heroics and memory of non-American-Israeli fighter-pilots let alone fighter designs.

Typical themes are:
German Me262 jet-fighter downs RAF Mosquito, US P51D downs German Me262 jet-fighter.
US-Israeli fighter-pilots defeat many times their number of the best enemy fighter-planes, opposite for all others.

Recently these so-called History programs appear, instead, to be the kind of propaganda I'd expect from some Communist Regime.

Very disappointed, had to sell my copies for quite a loss.
Even then I received a complaint from the buyer who said he uses them as 'drink coasters' anymore.
