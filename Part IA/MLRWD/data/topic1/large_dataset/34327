An obvious remake of Double Indemnity from the 1940s.This film is important for it seems to be the first in a long line of similar femme fatale Shannon Tweed esque type films that would later populate the made  for cable market(and made for video market!)  The atmoshpere is good  and is definetely reminiscent of the 1940s Double Indemnity, but it stops  there because the frontal nudity and steamy sex scenes would have never cut  any ice in those days, and that is what is so unfortunate here because it  is a worthy remake of Double Indemnity. There is good suspense, acting, and  a sense of style that is unique to this film, but the ending is what is so  unsatisfying. This film does not know when to quit.(example, film could  have ended with the explosion of the boat house, but we are then taken to  the prison where Hurt's character now resides and we are treated to  dialouge between he and policeman friend, then we are taken to some  tropical locale where Turner is seen basking in sun.....ENOUGH ALREADY  KASDAN)
