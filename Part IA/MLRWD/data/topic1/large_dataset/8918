I must have laughed half way through the movie, no kidding, just thinking about it makes me laugh... it was soooo funny!

The cover gives the impression that it is stupid but in reality the movie itself is a work of certifiable genious... I can't describe how good it is.

The fact that the movie itself was good but slightly stupid, and then any scene with Robin Williams in it makes you think that you will die laughing... His irradical hatred for the rhino "Smoochey" is blown ridiculously out of proportion and is just downright hilarious.

There was a scene where Robin Williams, (Raindbow Randolph) is watching TV and is seeing Smoochey on every channel and the dialouge is just hilarious.

"I Despise You..."

"I Loathe You!"

(Picks up a lamp and starts smashing the Tv while yelling:)

"Bastard son of Barnie!"

"Illeginamat Telitubby!"

"Die You Muppet From Hell!"

and then just starts screaming for like 10 seconds,

"Die!!!!!"

"Die!!!!!!!!"

"Die!!" all the while smashing the Tv into tiny pieces with a lamp, and there's just this crazy look in his eyes that makes me laugh for hours.

I simply can't stress how good this movie is, dumb, ya, a little, but still, hilarious and well made.

give this a watch... you'll laugh.
