In fact, the black &amp; white setting suits "It's A Wonderful Life" as perfectly as technocolor would have for this Frank Sinatra-esque cult classic.  James Stewart has this "Rocky &amp;  Bugsy"-era voice and a vigourous demeanor &amp; Donna Reed is just  brung in to play the hard-to-get young girl and the reserved wife.  My  focus refused to stay entact while watching this movie, but the ideas I did  withdraw from this movie is that George Bailey (James Stewart) is caught in  the tangled web of a financial scandal...  and on the brink of suicide.  That is... until a cliched assigned guardian angel appears out of the sky  and falls in the waters of Bedford Falls... to save George (ironically).  Before this happens, George is on a bridge contemplating (supposedly)  suicide (due partially to a busted-lip from a brute in Martini's bar whose  wife George insulted on the phone, heh heh), and when he sees Clarence (the  "quote on quote"... angel), he jumps in after him and retrieves  him.  Henceforth, George rebuffs the idea of an angel and wishes he was  never born, and granted... he was never born.  And boy, does he take the  in-your-face gruff reality of having no identity for a sham, but to his  shagrin... it's as serious as a heart attack.  George is a non-existent  would-have-been making a futile attempt to spark some remembrance in his  lost friends &amp; family.  Predictably, George repents and returns to  existance... with a little (or lot of) monetary help from the whole town  for his business trouble (whose lives apparently were impacted greatly by  him somehow).  Upon the saccharine conclusion (where George, his wife,  &amp; kid are basking in the solace of christmas communion), my eyes almost  started to well-spring... I haven't the faintest idea why (I'm only 17).  A  nice retrospective on the golden age of Christmas classics.  Somebody  please make "It's A Wonderful Life 2000."
