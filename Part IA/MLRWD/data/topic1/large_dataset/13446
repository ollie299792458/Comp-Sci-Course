I thought this was the funniest movie I've seen in the longest time.  Usually I sit through "funny," movies with a straight face and nary a snicker.  I had just drank a large gulp of my diet Coke when the sex scene popped up and I just about choked on my drink I was laughing so hard.  Parker and Stone even topped Mel Brooks flatulent cowboys with a scene of the hero blowing chunks in an alley for so long, that I went from laughing, to being slightly bored, to laughing all over again.  This made the recent conceit that their TV show, "South Park," was a conservative show making fun of liberals, into total nonsense.  No one was safe from a good sharp barb.  Macho Hollywood movies, liberal movie personalities, conservatives who seem to want constant warfare and be thanked for it were all sent up.  The closing theme song sounds like it should be played at football games, with it's vulgar patriotism, although it would probably offend some self-proclaimed patriots.  Toby Keith, are you listening? Maybe karoke bars will fill in instead.  I actually do remember the old TV show "Thunderbird," but was always somehow bored with it as a kid, but I too was reminded of this show while watching this movie

My particular favorite character was the officer in charge of Team America, who never seemed to let go of his martini glass, even when he was being blown apart with explosives, and other dangerous "devices."
