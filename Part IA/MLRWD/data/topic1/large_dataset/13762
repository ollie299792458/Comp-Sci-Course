It's simple to look at _The Jazz Singer_, released in 1927, and think that it's corny and quaint, interesting only for the historical fact of its  being the first film to use synchronous sound--and to use it only slightly,  at that.  But the film still raises compelling and interesting questions  about the pull for minorities towards assimilation.  The film is shameless  in its condemning of the father, the Cantor, whose gallant--if often  heavy-handed--attempt to preserve religious tradition is overtly ridiculed  as outdated and "old world" by the text of the film.  Indeed, the  film reflects a time in the United States when it wasn't appropriate to be  proud to be yourself, to be of a minority faith--as if to suggest that to  be truly American, one had to be Christian as well. (Even the Al Jolson  character's love interest is unfeeling and cold when he struggles with his  consience during the most holy days of the Jewish faith; she refers to him  as "a Jazz Singer. . .singing to _his_ God," as if it were some  God alien to herself and others.) This film still raises important issues  about difference and society's general acceptance of difference.  If  anything, one's view of the Cantor is far more sympathetic now than it  would have been then.
