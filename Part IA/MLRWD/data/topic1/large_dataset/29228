Even though it bombed in theaters in the 80's Streets of Fire is exceptionally good, as is the story filled with atmosphere and flavor. When Ellen Aime, a singer on the rise is kidnapped from a concert by the bombers led by Raven Shaddock Reva Cody sent out a telegram for her brother Tom Cody a soldier of fortune who was in love with Ellen until she chose her music over him. Tom is told by his sister what happened and he recruits an ex-soldier named McCoy for backup, and goes to her manager Billy Fish and works out a deal for him to retreive her. The three go through neighborhoods with a dark foreboding, free Ellen from the bombers hangout and make their way back to the Philemore district. Meeting on the way a prostitute who wants to be of Ellen's onterage and a group of singers the Sorels looking to make it big, when they reach the Philemore Raven has a message for Tom that their not finished and he challenges Tom to a duel. Tom fearing the worst gets Ellen out of the district and meets up and fights Shaddock beating him in front of the bombers with the residents of the neighborhood backing him up. In the end Tom leaves Ellen again, but she knows when she needs him he'll come. Very outstanding acting by Pare and Lane, a good movie for those who like Rock n' Roll with hard boiled fiction.
