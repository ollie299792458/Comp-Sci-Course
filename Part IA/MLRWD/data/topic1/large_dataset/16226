Jeff Bridges is a very musical guy, for an actor. Maybe those bridges he's named for are like the bridges in songs: verse, chorus, bridge. In The Fabulous Baker Boys Jeff Bridges played a jazz pianist and he was fabsolutely abulous. He learned piano well enough to play the tunes, though the actual music was dubbed in by Dave Grusin. As cool and hep as he looked as a jazz cat, in Crazy Heart, he had the perfect look for a country singer. Looks like Kris Kristopherson, sounds even better. Both have co-starred with Barbara Striesand. Maybe The Other Side of the Mirror and the third remake of A Star is Born is an unfair comparison, but Jeff Bridges, most would agree, is a better actor than Kris. Kris Kristopherson was a country singer and he wrote Sunday Morning Coming Down for Johnny Cash, and Me and Bobby McGee was a big hit for Janis--but as authentic as he would have been as Bad Blake, once you've seen Crazy Heart you know that no one could've done it better than Jeff Bridges.

The Dude Abides

It's time for an Oscar for Bridges. You know that if he wins, there will be a huge standing ovation. No one else could be more certain to get a huge standing ovation if, or should I say when, he wins (I actually wrote this review before the Oscars, but I waited until the DVD was released to post it. OF COURSE the dude won the Oscar as predicted). He is long overdue for an Oscar.

Bad Blake is a total mess, but music means a lot to him, and his music means a lot to many others: Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal), one of the pick up bands, his buddy Wayne (Robert Duvall), many of the fans, Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrel)--but don't mention Tommy Sweet.

Bad doesn't like it when people ask him about Tommy, because Tommy is at his peak while Blake is a has-been(I mean, 'a living legend'). Tommy helps him out though, and turns his fortunes around. Colin Farrel was very sweet as Tommy Sweet. He also sang pretty good. Didn't steal the show, but was believable as a Country Music star.

Robert Duvall was his friend Wayne, a bar owner, who gave him a ration of booze but could also see that when it was time for him to quit drinking, it was time for him to quit drinking. His support system. In Tender Mercies Duvall played the troubled troubador. Here, he is careful not to upstage Bridges, and gives a very supportive understated performance. There's a scene where he sings one of Bad's songs on a fishing trip they take together. He doesn't sound that great A Cappella, but he sounds sincere, and you can tell that Bad's song means a lot to him.

The story of Crazy Heart is not a typical one of love conquers all, or even the typical musician bio about the long struggle to reach the top. It's a down hill ride, where the exalted peak is vaguely remembered, and the struggle is more about accepting that your best years are over. It is way past the time to start aging gracefully. Maggie Gyllenhaal was great as the journalist who temporarily falls for him, but then realizes that her son isn't safe with him if Bad starts drinking. Her name was Jean Craddock, reminding me of my sister Joanie Craddock, who is a George Strait fan, though there the resemblance ends.

T-Bone Burnett did the music for O, Brother, Where Art Thou? and also The Big Lebowski (Bridges was The Dude). As usual, T-Bone handled the music superbly. Stephen Bruton was kind of the model for Bad Blake. He lived the Bad Blake life of a musician on the road. He also wrote music for the film but passed away just before it was finished, and the film is dedicated to his memory. He was kind of a consultant. The Sparkletts jug was his idea.

The Bottom Line is Crazy Heart rates 5 stars for Bridges' Oscar winning performance, and for the great supporting cast of Maggie Gyllenhaal, Robert Duvall, Colin Farrell, and the rest. With T-Bone Burnett handling the music it was as real and right as it gets. The story was kind of low key and lacking in a Hollywood ending, much to its credit. Scott Cooper, the director and writer, brought out the 'Crazy Heart' of the Thomas Cobb novel. And as always, the dude abides. Jeff Bridges was like the rug that pulled the whole room together.
