Simple, but yet capturing the raw energetic feelings we all had in high school comes to light in this envious film. To really appreciate this film is to eliminate Daryl Hannah as a well known actress ,but to see her as a young upcoming actress in this fresh spin to many 80's movies with the usual comic influence and boy meets girl staple of the era. Aidan Quinn plays brillantly, Johnny Roarke who only has himself after realizing his father, Kenneth McMillan only lives for himself. The best part of the film is the mesmerizing dance scene with Romeo Void playing, Never Say Never, which was a very popular dance song at clubs. The release of energy through out the song and spinning visual add to the capture of the moment. Plus Kim Wilde's, Kid's in a America, with the unrelenting seduction by both charactors at the pool comes off excellent. The INXS song, To Look at You, leads the pressure building attraction and feelings both charactors have for each other when their relationship seems to be done then drawing you in again.
I remember this film for the excellent timing of the music and wanting to be like Aidan Quinn's charactor getting the girl at the end. This film has glimpses of Tom Cruises charactor in All the Right Moves, but sharply separates itself with more of an edge on charactors and the unquelled emotion they portray.

Watch this movie on a big screen and low lights and the sound turned up.
