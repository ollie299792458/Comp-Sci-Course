This a sad movie and will make you cry, which is wonderful. Very good and sad songs which  are a good kind of sad. A very realistic portrayal of probably the state of every orphange in the world right now. Children will love this movie and give them an escape from the pressures of the normal happy go lucky life. Everyone roots for the kid in this movie all the way to the end, Meddusa and her sidekicks get whats coming to them at the end too, and the Devils eye diamond, bigger than the hope diamond, is put in the Smithsonian institue where it rightfully belongs. I first saw this movie when I was 8, with my bother(7) and my sister(11). We loved it and have changed so much since then. The 70's were really a magical time for kids then, as Walt Disney was really tearing up the scene, this movie also reminds me of Escape from Witch Mountain and the sequel with Kim Richards! Kim is trying to make a comeback which is good and she has kids too, Penny reminds me of Cinderella as a kid, and I really recomend this film to the poor children of the world, and children in foster homes and orphanages, and anyone who has a cat named Rufus!-God bless the kids in this world!-Love PENNY(Garry Hixon)
