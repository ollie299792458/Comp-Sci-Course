There was time, back when PCU was first released, that I thought replacing a major academic area with a "Bisexual Asian Studies" department (one among many witty 'PC-isms' presented in the movie) was a very funny, if slightly over-the-top joke at the expense of the liberal juggernaught that is political correctness. Then, during my own occasionally bizarre collegiate experience, I found one such *real* department at a (to remain unnamed) school in California. I @#$% you not, folks. PCU is a very, very funny movie, and in the years since its release it is proving to have been movie that was, astonishingly, well ahead of its time. If you went to college in or after the late '90s, you will recognize every caricature the movie presents, and even if you didn't you can see them all, increasingly, at large in society today. Don't get carried away, it's not an especially deep or insightful comedy, but it presents the obvious in a way impossible to not find hilarious and it may even surprise you occasionally when you look around and see how little they really had to exaggerate to make it happen. Plus, it has George Clinton in it...how much more does a movie really need before you can call it a latter-day classic?
