I used to listen to Rod Lurie on KABC talk radio each Saturday.  He had a show on movies and he was very entertaining.  His views were strong and very unlike the political correctness that started to sweep this country.  I remember when he got his first screenplay together and had to leave the show to direct his first movie.  He is the rare movie critic that actually switched careers to make movie.  For that, he deserves respect by all.
Now...this film was weak.  I agree, the core antagonist/ protagonist relationship was weak...in fact, very weak.  The warden was insulted because he has never really done a tour of duty, so collecting war memorabilia is for the weak.  This is his soul motivation to prove himself.  Yes, man is that fragile, but it needed to be developed thoroughly to base an entire movie on.  
The rest of the flic makes one wonder if these guys are really in a prison.  There is almost no conflict among the prisoners...they seem so united and too respectful of Redford's character. The movie lacked energy and intensity.  The scene with the rocks that Redford dragged went on and on with no climax that moved me.  
In short, this was a good looking Hollywood movie that was boring...you keep wondering why this movie was made.  Maybe on repeat viewings it will be insightful...however not by me.  I'm glad I borrowed it from the library!
Keep trying Rod!
