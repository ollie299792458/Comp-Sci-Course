Because I always seem to be a couple years behind, I just saw this movie. Oh my god, I thought I would split a gut from laughing. It even made me cry a few times. It is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. How wonderful that someone set out to tell a story, and ended up entertaining us all to the extent that this film did. There are almost too many standout scenes to mention, but let me try a few. The scene on the street where Gaz is trying to get Nathan back in the car, and says "I love ya, ya bugger". The look on Lomper's face when the other band members start playing the stripper theme music. Gaz's first attempt at stripping in the headlights of the car, with change flying out of his coat pockets, trying to get his t-shirt off with his cigarette still in his mouth. It's such a great movie on so many levels. You never forget that these men are living through a real-life nightmare that many of us have experienced ourselves. You feel their desperation, their emasculation, their insecurities, their panic, as if it were happening to you. But because these people seem so real to you, you'll also feel their triumphs. I didn't have as much trouble as I expected to with the accents, but the second time around was definitely clearer. The actual strip show scene is priceless, pay close attention to the looks on the guys faces. They had a great time making this movie, I bet. One final thought, watch for the scene on the hill with Gaz, Dave, and Lomper. It's too sweet to be real.
