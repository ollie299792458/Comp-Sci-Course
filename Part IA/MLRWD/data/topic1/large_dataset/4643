DIRECTOR JOEL SCHUMACHER IS DEFINITELY AT HIS BEST IN THIS COURT ROOM DRAMA. BASED ON JOHN GRISHAM'S NOVEL, THIS FILM, WHICH TAKES PLACE IN A SMALL SOUTHERN TOWN, IS A REAL EDGE OF YOUR SEAT MOVIE.  TO BE HONEST, MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WITH FILM ADAPTATIONS ON NOVELS WEREN'T AMONG THE TOP  10 LIST.  USUALLY, I FIND THAT THE BOOKS ARE ALOT BETTER THEN THE MOVIES  THAT FOLLOW (OR TRY TO FOLLOW) THEM.  "A TIME TO KILL" WAS THE  FIRST GRISHAM NOVEL THAT I READ AND, ADMITTINGLY, THOUGH I WAS NEVER INTO  COURTROOM BOOKS, THIS ONE GOT MY ATTENTION.  FROM BEGINNING TO END, THIS  BOOK HAS ALL THE INGREDIENTS FOR A BEST-SELLER.  THE CHARACTERS-  (ESPECIALLY, JAKE BRIGANCE-THE YOUNG ATTORNEY) ARE PHENOMENAL, THE  PLOT-SUSPENSEFUL, AND THE ACTION KEEPS YOUR ADRENALIN PUMPING!  THOUGH I AM  A GRISHAM FAN, THERE WERE OTHER BOOKS WHICH I DIDN'T THINK HIGHLY OF; BUT I  THINK THAT THIS BOOK IS THE BEST I'VE READ THUS FAR.  AFTER I READ A.T.T.K,  I READ "THE CLIENT", WHICH WAS ALSO VERY WELL WRITTEN.  I ALSO  SAW THE MOVIE BASED ON THAT BOOK.  THE FIRST TIME I SAW "THE  CLIENT", I HAD JUST FINISHED READING THE NOVEL, AND THAT MAY BE A  REASON I DIDN'T CARE MUCH FOR THE MOVIE.  WHEN "A TIME TO KILL"  WAS FIRST BEING MADE, I HAD READ UP ON IT, AND FOLLOWED UP ON IT EVERY STEP  OF THE WAY. WHEN THE PREVIEWS CAME OUT, IT LOOKED FASCINATING AND FOR ONCE  I WASN'T DISSAPPOINTED WHEN I SAW THE FILM. NOT ONLY THAT, I ABSOLUTELY  LOVED IT. MATTHEW MCCAUGHNEY (FORGIVE IF I MISSPELLED THE NAME) PLAYED THE  LAWYER PERFECTLY.  IT WAS LIKE THE PART WAS MADE FOR HIM. HE HAD THE  PASSION, THE ENERGY AND THAT FINNESSE THAT ONLY HE POSSESSES.  THIS IS ONE  MOVIE THAT, IN MY OPINION TOPPED THE CHARTS- AND THERE WASN'T MUCH FICTION  IN IT EITHER.  I MEAN THE PLOT WASN'T FAR FETCHED AT ALL.  BUT, MOST  IMPORTANT, THE MOVIE WAS JUST AS GOOD AS THE BOOK, IF NOT BETTER.  THE BOTTOM LINE-  DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT-TAKE IT OUT, SEE IT FOR  YOURSELF &amp; GET BACK TO ME.
