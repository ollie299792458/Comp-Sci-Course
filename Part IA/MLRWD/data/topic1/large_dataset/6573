I did rate the original 5 stars.  I don't know how I rated Final Destination II 5 stars; I should have rated it 3.  Final Destination II is not as good as the original.  This version isn't pure twisted slasher fun as was Final Destination.  They dulled this version with a human interest angle.

However:

Final Destinations are unique among slasher films.  There is no scary monster going to jump out and get you.  It's Death that sets off chains of events that lead to death.  (I wondered how Death could be the means and the end (death) in The Seventh Seal.  How odd that a lark of a slasher film would answer that question.)  Sometimes Death gets no one; and sometimes it gets someone else instead.

As each domino in an incident falls, you're led to believe that whoever is the current focus will die in a particular way.  For example:  A man shoots at a bird on the wing (Please miss!).  The bullet misses and hits a tree branch instead (Thank Heaven!).  The branch falls and breaks a power line that whips back and hits the man, who fries (That was weird!).  That is only a couple of sets of cause and effect.  Insert several sets of cause and effect between a first and last and you have each incident in Final Destinations.

The fun is in being misled by the clever twists that run through the chains of events that lead to death.  Final Destinations are not serious treatments about cheating death--they're not meant to be.

I'd like to see more Final Destinations, but without schmaltz.
