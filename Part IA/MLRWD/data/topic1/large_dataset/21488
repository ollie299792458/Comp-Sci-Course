One of the themes that Christopher Guest likes is both making fun of people who are obsessive about certain things that the rest of us don't care too much about , together with looking deeper at how the obsession can cloud their outlook .

Imagine we are talking about nerds or geeks , but the people doing this stuff don't see it like that . They wouldn't care anyway .

I like this film more than some of Mr Guest's other films due to the fact that the actors get to show they are musicians too , which adds so much more to the experience .

Do listen carefully to the lyrics of the songs - put the subtitles if you need to ...it's worth it.

Having said that , there are a couple of songs on there that are actually growing on me , both sung by Mitch and Mickey . These are "Kiss at the end of the rainbow" and "When i'm next to you" - the melodies are catchy .

Leave the real world behind for a while and watch this .

You may well lighten up as a result !

A wonderfully entertaining film .
