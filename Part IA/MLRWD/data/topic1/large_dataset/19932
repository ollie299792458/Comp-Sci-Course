I'm fortunate enough to have studied the struggles of the Irish, and to call many Irish people my friends, and to have visited their country many times, and on account of that, and as a follower of Irish history it's hard for me to view this movie through naive eyes. It is one of my top 5 favorite films. It is harsh and brutal. It is the only movie to ever make me want to tear at my hair and sob (and I am not the sort of person to feel this way about much of anything). What I see in this film is a beautiful and tragic tale of a people so determined to have their freedom, unwilling to give in, to accept defeat in order to alleviate suffering. The film shows what the Irish people are still in some ways torn between; Catholics vs. Protestants, The North vs. the Republic. Loyalists vs. Nationalists. It's all one in the same in most regards, but I would think that for anyone who doesn't know the history that the movie would still be great because it's a FASCINATING tale and might only make you want to type a few questions into google in order to educate oneself further and there is nothing at all wrong with a movie which leaves you with a feeling such as that. The Wind That Shakes the Barley is worthy of watching for any adult... It's different, it's engrossing, it's impassioned, it's everything you could ask for from a movie, except much laughter... I recommend it to every person I know. It is a brilliant film, not the usual Hollywood junk food.
