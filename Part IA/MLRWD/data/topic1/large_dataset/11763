I found this unassuming little film, depicting one long Thanksgiving weekend in New York City, to be absolutely delightful.  Oscar, a precocious fifteen year old prep school student who quotes Voltaire and speaks French, is far, far too sophisticated to be bothered by the girls his age. Rather, his heart is focused on his step-mother, played by Sigourney Weaver.  He is a charmer, but completely unable to see the naivete of his youth.  His efforts to be adult -- gluing on fake sideburns and spouting philosophy to any willing audience are right on.  He seems to think that there is no reason he cannot be a serious contender for his step-mother's affections, and he courts her (his true intentions unbeknownst to her) by bringing her lunch at work, calling the terminology of her work (cardiological research) poetry, and playing tennis with her.  John Ritter plays the clueless history-professor-Dad to a tee.  I really liked this film -- from the title screen (where letters flitter across the screen in the shape of a tadpole) to the end, where Oscar is finally able to see the attractiveness of a girl his own age.  Surprisingly good!
