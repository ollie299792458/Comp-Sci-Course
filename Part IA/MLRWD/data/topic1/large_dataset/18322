Light symphonic oratorio that makes the best use of "Life of Brian." Resonates between Python formal (Michael Palin) in a formal dress speaking in articulate  and serious words, the audience waiving LED light sticks, and a large chorus - all in the Royal Albert Hall in London. It helps to have seen all the Python movies to get and appreciate all that is going on. Great use of choral voices, symphony orchestra, lighting, sound and costuming. Four singers in front sing key parts throughout the performance. Carol Cleveland makes a great appearance with three unusual singing sheep. Good use of the chorus - both males and females. Music by Eric Idle and John Perez.

This captures a mature Python at its best. John Cleese is missing (by choice), but you don't notice. Eric Idle has greatly matured as an artist and is able to make the best use of all Python creativity. This is similar to Spamalot, only different and very good. All Python fans can recite, mimic and sing most of the words, but here the Pythons knock everything up a notch, keep you entertained and your brain working and wondering after the performance. Well done!
