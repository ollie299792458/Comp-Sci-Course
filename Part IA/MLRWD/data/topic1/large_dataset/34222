Ok first off I could see where this wouldn't necesarily be appropriate for the below 8 yars of age crowd perhaps but for the most part this movie is not scary.  Funny yes scary nope.
If you are tired of all the blah, blah, same, same, videos out there here is something you could certainly call different...
The premise of the movie is basically this.  The tradition of clowns goes back pretty far in time to the last time the klowns dropped by.  It is the fascination with the deadly visitors from ages past that has led to the modern circus clown.
Now they are back and look out they have the full bag of tricks and you will see where the human clowns got the inspiration for their stuff.  I'm not going to detail all the bits of the movie but make no mistake the klowns are evil evil beings.....
This is actually a movie that you will be able to watch with your friends more than once and still enjoy because it is so goofy.  It's all a real conversation piece to borrow out at work and school.
