Perhaps the most na√Øve Sissy ever - her character, Holly, is a blank slate with no past and no future. Like a pubescent Bonnie Parker waiting for her Clyde, Holly is swept away by the expansive charms of Kit Carruthers - but she could have just as easily been swept away by a toy or a new dress. Like a talking parrot regurgitating the Tao of Kit, Holly is deeply impressed by the attention her new boyfriend is giving her. Sissy adds a plaintiveness to Holly that creates sympathy for her - and she needs all the sympathy she can get. She is a disassociated and disturbed young woman who virtually stands around while Kit murders her father in front of her, and then burns the house down. The fire sequence is a masterpiece of filmmaking, and it is evident that the house is not the only thing being destroyed. And the pair is off on a spree of senseless killings. Kit is the triggerman, but Holly's guilt in the crimes is not only by association, it is by omission - it is what she does *not* do that makes the crimes so horrific. The cinematography is breathtaking. As lusciously beautiful as Malik's *The Thin Red Line*, but without the pretense, we are awed by visions of purple mountains' majesty, and close ups so tight you can almost see the leaves changing color. The forest that shelters their primitive hideaway comes alive when they are invaded, seeming to whisper its urgent warnings. Winning many European awards, including British Academy Award for Best Newcomer for Sissy, *Badlands* continues to cast a strong spell.
