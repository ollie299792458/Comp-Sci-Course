What a great spoof of Beatlemania! This dvd is a must for any serious Beatles fan. Done in the style of monty Python, Eric Idle ,(who incidently plays Rutle Dirk McQuickly and the narrator), brilliantly captures the Beatle's story with a twist. The personalities of McCartney,(Dirk McQuickly), Lennon,(Ron Nasty), Harrison,(Stig O'Hara), and Starr, (Barrymore Womble...who changes his name to just Barry Wom...to save time), are perfectly mached. The music is first rate as well. They sound as if the pre-Fab Four could've written them. My favorite, Piggy In The Middle,is a spoof on I Am The Walrus, and is awesome. The film goes over every aspect of the Beatle's history including their infamous legal battles and the down spiral of their company Apple Corps. Beatle George makes a cameo appearance in the film as a reporter asking Python's Michael Palin about the thefts that happen daily  at "Rutle Corps". They even cover the 5th Rutle, Lepo and their manager Leggy Mountbatten (Epstein) and his antics concerning his associations with bull fighters. Interviews with Mick Jagger and Paul Simon about the Rutles is a nice touch giving the idea that the Rutles were an actual band.
All You Need Is Cash is hallarious. A well made spoof of the greatest band in music history.
