i am a huge fan of tiffany shepis, and it is movies like this, are the reason why, in the movie, it is about college kids the girls want to join the sorority, and the guys the big fraterity, to do this they must get a certain ammount of points, and are set out on a scavenger hunt, and they must spend the night in a hunted house, well as tiffany shepis, and her partner find some items and they find a book, it belongs to a old man, who does demon spells with it, they kill him and take the book and go back to the house, when they get there, their friends are there, and so are the head of the sorority, and the fraterity, they play games on the kids, locking them inside the house, but one of the kids does a spell and it brings back to life the old man, who wants revenge and wants his book back. and he can possess bodies, and take over them and kill the other person just to get his staff and his book back, and he will stop at nothing to get it.
  ok, what i love about this movie is, it is funny and campy, and it is scary, some of the scares are really good, and the laughs are better then the hollywood comedies they put out, and the effects are goofy but good for a small budget movie, the director really made the best out of what he had to use, and he put in some decent effects, and scares, oh and look for a small role for brook burke, at the beginning, it is good to see her again.
  but, the real star is tiffany shepis, she is cute and sassy in the movie, and gives it some of it's biggest laughs, she has a real screen presense, and is so sweet, and when she wants be really sassy, and has great comedic timing also, she is very under appreciated. she deserves more respect, i know this is a campy movie, but that is the point, they are not trying to out do citizen kane, they are making a cute, goofy, and a little scary movie, so please do not knock it for being campy for pete sake. just sit back and enjoy, if it was a movie like transformers that is different, this is low budget, and the people who make movies like this are just trying to have some fun, so enjoy this wonderful fun movie, that will make you feel good and actually give you a few good scares, and a lot of good laughs, give it a chance, you might be surprised, it is a huge cult favorite and i see why... this is what good campy fun is all about, so for those of you tired of what hollywood is doing, well independent movies are the answer, go ahead you might like what you see
