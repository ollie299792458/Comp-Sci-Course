My roommate describes this film as Stanley Kubrick-esque. I agree. There are long stretches with no dialogue--no sound.  The action, when it comes, takes the viewer by surprize because the film so lanquidly tells the story of these people.  I found the juxtaposition of the men and women in the film with the lobsters, so important to the small Maine coastal town, brilliant.  You realize quite quickly that the scene on the lobster boat, where the Dr. says that two male lobsters can't be in a trap, in the bedroom, at the same time and that the older female lobster can kill the males, too, is important because of the link with the title.  Immediately, the volatile relationships of lobsters are juxtaposed with that of the triangle of Natalie, Matt, and Natalie's ex.  Later, and more subtly, the metaphor is further drawn out to include the Dr., his wife, and Natalie's ex.  Both women, in their own way, become the older female lobster that kills the males.  I never thought lobsters could be so profound!  This movie was slow, but beautifully so.  I highly recommend.  Sissy Spacek gets better with age; Tom Wilkinson is great.  Marisa Tomei's accent is a bit out of place in Maine, but she's wonderful, as well.
