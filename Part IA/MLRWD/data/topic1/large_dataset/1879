To those of you who think your teens aren't having sex... well.. then you are living in sitcom fantasy land. To those of you who kick your kids out when they come to you pregnant, then you don't know about life's mistakes and tolerance.

  Its hard being a teenager now a days.. Its harder being a single mom trying to make the best of things. This show is about a mother who does both and teaches about God's tolerance too.

  There are divorces, there are teen pregnancies.. and yes.. they do mention adoption by the way. :p I have seen things like this in real life and often it all works out if parents support their children the way Reba does in this show. PLEASE watch the whole show before you judge the writers, the producers and the actors. Because... you will learn that this show is wonderful and is more of a REALITY show than most REALITY shows out there.

  ALSO just for those of you.. I don't condone teen sex.. but.. I will support my child the same way in that position.. Notice that the teen parents work.. and go to school. They pitch in and help out whenever they can. Its a solid household.

  If only real life could copy that.. OH wait.. it does...
