Okay here is the deal, like it was previously stated, if you're looking at this then you obviously know what this series is all about and have your mind made up about it. However I wanted to point out that if you expect for the subtitles to be on par with the fansubs, they're not. They feel rather incomplete. The english dub is horrible. It destroys the charachter's personalities in addition to making alot of the jokes bland. Odds are that you will probably go back to watching the well done fansubs and this will sit on your shelf as a collectors item and nothing more. If you're okay with that, then it is a nice purchase with tons of goodies. Although I doubt anyone will listen to the CDs more than once or wear the shirt outside of perhaps an anime convention. The screenwipe on the other hand is awesome. It's kind of hard to tell what it really is from online pictures but it's a little stuffed plushy pastry. Within the pastry is what looks like nylon chocolate attatched to a string, however upon pulling on the chocolate you discover that it is actually an unfoldable flag with a big lucky star logo on it. Possibly the best extra in the bunch.

I rated this 5 stars because the show itself (no matter how butchered the translation) is one of the most creative and fun to watch anime titles ever made.

bad translation
not for everyone
the box alone (and the opening doesn't help) will probably get you some strange looks from those not in the "know".

I'd say the good outweighs the bad.
