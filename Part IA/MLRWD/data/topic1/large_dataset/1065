As a huge fan of the first BloodRayne video game, I was somewhat interested to see that Uwe Boll had finally decided to place the character BloodRayne into the historical setting of WWII. I wish I had not been interested. I think I would actually prefer a frontal lobotomy to having even the slightest interest in seeing this film. I cannot un-see BloodRayne: The Third Reich. I will gladly try and save you from this trauma.

First, the only similarities between BloodRayne the video game and BloodRayne: The Third Reich are the historical setting of WWII. That's it. Do not fool yourselves.

Secondly, without boring you with a complete synopsis, let me simply give you some quick comparisons: Your cousin's dance recital that your Mom forced you to attend? It had better production values than BR:TTR. The Drama Class you took in college for the easy "A"? It had better acting than BR:TTR. The porn you found in your Dad's closet when you were 13? It had better directing than BR:TTR. The Battlestar Galactica fan fiction your little brother wrote, that starred himself? It had a more coherent and story driven plot than BR:TTR.

This is NOT a film that is "so good it's bad". It's just bad. It's just horrible. It's the cinematic equivalent of "being chased by a pack of wolves while your dentist tries to perform an emergency root canal without pain killers" type of bad. A single star is a thousand times more merciful than this film deserves.

Do not EVER purchase this film. Not as a joke. Not because you're a cinematic masochist. Not because you think it's "cult classic" type of material. Because if you do, you're encouraging Uwe Boll to continue producing and directing, and then you are part of the problem. May whatever god you worship have mercy on your soul. You have been warned.
