I've had this movie for two weeks and have already watched it seven times, and cooked the legendary dish Puerco Pibil, that Agent Sands kills for.
  The color of this film is awesome to say the least, rich in the orange tones of Mexico, shot with genius, fantastic music, lots of humor just under the surface, the characters - especially Depp's captivating. Depp's Agent Sands is such a manipulating cad and yet you want this guy to win at the end of the film. Anyone looking for a "real" film, that is reality
based should not waste their time on this one.In the first gun battle at La Parroquia, thousands of rounds fly within the cathedral, twenty or more of Barillo's men along with seventy pews are shredded, yet our hero, El, walks away unscathed. That should be your first indication that this is not reality as we know it.
  But for sheer entertainment and those who appreciate the "study" of film making, this film has all the markings of becoming a classic. Rodriguez is well on his way to joining the ranks of the film making greats.
  My only complaint would be the dialog between Cucuy and Barillo when they talk of a "trade". Cucuy has the wrong idea as to who is to be traded and dies at the hands of Billy, the audience has no idea of what or who is up for trade and has to live with it after the film is over. Not that Cucuy is any great loss, you're just left with this curiosity as to why Barillo snuffs him.
  This is a great film, I see something new every time I see it - and the DVD extras are exceptional. The Puerco Pibil is worth killing for. If you watch this movie and fail to make Puerco Pibil you are missing out on some of the life of this master work of art. Agent Sands was really on to something.
