This show caused me to write my first review ever on Amazon...

I quickly became a fan of the series in the first episode (and not just because they showed my grandfather - which was an amazing surprise).  I then felt a little betrayed by the middle, when the producers REPEATED entire sequences to fill an episode (it was #7, I think).  I don't know what happened, but it violated my trust in the accuracy of the show.  For example, did the night fliers barely make it back during the battle of Midway, or when they repeated the sequence during another battle?  Did "Flash Gordon" finally become an ace pilot in 1943, or when they repeated the sequence during 1944?  Somebody seriously messed up here, and I felt betrayed.

However... by the final two episodes, which include all fresh content, I was a fan of the series again.  Great to see naval battles documented in such an exciting way.  4/5 stars.

PS.  On a technical front, it was very good and really moved.  It probably didn't need SO much frenetic editing, nor graphics over the archival footage, but I guess they were trying to appeal to those of us with ADD.  Also, the archival film was absolute gold to me, yet they only show .6 seconds of it at a time, and also mar it with more graphics.  Producers, that's not needed!  If anything more time on the archival, and less on the CG.  ...Great work nonetheless.
