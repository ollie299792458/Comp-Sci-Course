Fritz Lang's Metropolis turned out to be overall very entertaining and successful. I started watching the movie without very high expectations because of the fact that there were no speaking roles. Despite this, Alfred Abel did an incredible job acting as Johhan Fredersen and Gustav Fr&ouml;hlich as Freder Fredersen. I learned that you don't need words in a movie to make it a good movie.

Metropolis starts off with a bunch of men working in an organized, "mechanical" form. We are soon introduced to Freder who's hanging around beautiful women. Soon he meets Maria, who is bringing children to the garden to work. Freder is attracted to Maria and soon descends to where the workers are. He witnesses an explosion when a worker collapses and takes his place. He then realizes that Maria is a lead worker. She tells him that there will be someone who will come and save them from the machines. Freder's father has other plans. With the help of the scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) they plan to replace the workers with robots and decide to start with Maria.

Like every movie this one had its ups and downs. Overall in this film, I feel the "ups" outweighed the "downs". I thought the acting was superb even though there were no words. The quote "actions speak louder than words" could definitely describe Metropolis. The actors did a great job in their dramatic gestures and making their movements big so people could clearly grasp the concept and emotions they were trying to convey.

A weaker side of the movie was the scenes that seemed to drag on forever. I lost interest in some scenes and found it hard to focus/follow at times. That is basically the only down point I found in the film.

I absolutely recommend this film. I would recommend it more for the learning purposes rather than the entertaining purposes. Watching this film today will show how much technology has grown and increased over the years and help us appreciate film for what it is today.
