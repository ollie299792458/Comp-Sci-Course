Spider marks the triumphant return to form for director David Cronenberg after the lightweight and screwball eXistenZ. Like much of his most heartfelt work - The Dead Zone, The Fly &amp; Dead Ringers to name a few -, Spider is a tragic tale of an afflicted and alienated man. We first meet Spider - beautifully played by Ralph Fiennes - as he takes up residence in a halfway house, a dismal limbo between institution and the real world. One look at him and we know in our bones he will never take that next step. This is a man without a future and whos present is overwhelmed by his past. What unfolds is a tale of memory and madness as seen subjectively through the eyes of a shattered personality. Cronenberg's direction is brilliantly assured and deceptively economical. And as good as Ralph Fiennes is - and he is good -, it is Miranda Richardson who delivers the most impressive performance in the film. She will no doubt be overlooked but certainly does deserve a Best Supporting Actress nomination. David Cronenberg's Spider is a small, sad and beautiful film and one of the best of 2003.
