This movie is absolutely good. Generally, this movie tells about a pre-med college girl, Paige Morgan(Julia Stiles) who has  serious planning for her future and really intend to go for it. She wishes to avoid all distractions in her study life. Then, she meets with an easy-lfe-going and spoiled Eddie(Luke Mably)which happens to be the young Crown Prince Evard of Denmark in a student exchange in her college. Evard is seeking a chance in his lifetime to get out from his ironclading royal life as a prince. At first, Paige hates Eddie very much and thinks that he's a troublemaker that will ruin her semester. Well, those two have nothing in common and are from a totally different calibre. The interesting thing is their feeling of love towards each other are born through literature(poem) which happen to be so miraculous. Then, dilemma breaks out between them when Paige finds out that Eddie is actually the crown prince of Denmark. The love between them is so strong that Paige can't forget thinking about Eddie and decided to go to Denmark to find him. Though at first she leaves him after realizing that she's not ready to be the Queen of Denmark, but Evard still wants to be with her and go to find Paige after she ends her medical course. Evard tells Paige that he's willing to wait to be with her in the end. It is so touching and I like it a lot. This movie is well-acted(great performence by Stiles and Mably) and it has very beautiful story line that consists of romance and hilarity. A love that has been lighted up through poem. It is so BEAUTIFUL! It is quite educational at some part of the story too(good lessons taught to Evard by Paige about life-we must be interdependent). Indeed a real life fantasy. No doubt!
