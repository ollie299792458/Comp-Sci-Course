I can't believe all of the naive folks out there rating this movie low due to the unlikelihood of the main character going from comic book sales to mass murderer.  This movie is outstanding and depicts a situation where true love gets Clarence in trouble with a low-life drug dealing pimp.  The pimp and his bros try to kill Clarence for wanting his new wife out of prostitution so Clarence defends himself (shoots them).  After taking her suitcase (he doesn't know it's the wrong case full of cocaine - Mob owned), he's now in trouble with the mob (hint - they are out for his blood too now).  The mob wants their cocaine back, the FBI wants to get the mob, Clarence just wants to go about his new life with his bride, and there's a great ending.  As a nearly 50 year old retired Air Force fighter pilot, I found "True Romance" to be one of my top 2 movies ever.  If you believe you can still sleep with your doors unlocked today, then this movie is not for you.

There's love, GREED, and CORRUPTION (what's so different from the powerful in Washington DC today)?  (Dec 2009)
