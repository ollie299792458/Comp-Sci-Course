Medium is an extremely well done show. It is the story of a woman that gradually becomes aware of her psychic abilities as she works as a paralegal at the DAs office. Eventually she becomes a consultant for the DA, which uses her insight to track murderers, serial killer, etc, helping with investigations that would otherwise go unsolved. The series is loosely based on the real life psychic and medium Allison Dubois, although many of the stories have been embellished and changed for the sake of good storytelling. However, the conflicts and issues of a real life "sensitive" are done extremely well and are very realistic. Allison is portaid as a very unglamorous figure, down to earth, with a normal husband and kids (well almost normal kids), trying to live a normal life while also staying true to the inner promptings and messages she is receiving that are obviously working through her to achieve some form of higher good. And Patricia Arquette is marvelous in playing this part, as is her very attractive actor that plays her loving husband. Excellent show, great entertainment that makes one think.
