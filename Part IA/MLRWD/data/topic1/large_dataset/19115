I'm not exactly someone who loves blood and guts, but my friend a few years ago told me about this movie and I finally got around to seeing all three.This movie is good, but not great. This movie was basically to show human emotions under these kind of circumstances, since the first movies were basically setting up the plot.The zombies are particullary disgusting in this movie,like when the zombie is being dissected and he suddenly turns over andhis insides fall out. Most of the movie is talk about the situation, and then the army guys going nuts on the scientists, and an army guy gets "revenge' on his army buddies with a pretty cool twist.The zombie that was "domesticated", Bob,was a cool idea, and him using a gun was pretty comical as he staggered after the army guy, but I felt sorry for bob, as he seemed to get some of his humanity back, but then losing the people that were helping him. All in all, I would say rent it first. I was going to buy it, but the deaths the soldiers went through weren't exactly appealing. If your going to see one out of the series, watch Dawn of the Dead, or watch the "spoofs" like "Return of the Living Dead" series, or at least the first two. It's pretty funny watching the characters talk about killing the zombies like they did in night of the living deadd, but then finding out it doesn't work, and the zombies "ordering" food.
