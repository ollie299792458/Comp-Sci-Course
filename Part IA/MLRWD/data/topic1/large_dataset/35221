I was very happy when I brought this 6 DVD set in one single beautiful packing. Each and every movie, Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Samson & Delilah or David -all was superb and brought me more closer to the Old Testament. I have never heard about Joseph (son of Jacob)before but after seeing the movie, I saw it again for a second time. Jacob also is very good and so was David. But Abraham was repetitive for me as HE is the most discussed person in our Bible and I have heard a lot about him. Same was with Moses. But I prefer the "Ten Commandments" more to this version of "Moses".

Ten Commandments does not show us the very important scene where Moses doubts God and gets angry with HIM because when he first hits his staff on the stone for water, God does not bring forth  water. So Moses hits the staff once again for the second time and water flows out. This one scene is an important one in the life of Moses. Because Moses doubted God, God said that he will never enter the promised land but see it from afar. This important scene is shown in the movie "Moses" which is included in this collection.

If you are in faith with God and read the bible, especially the Old Testament, this is one worth for your collection.
