1.HBK vs. Edge: A very good match the pace was kind of slow for me but still one of the better PPV openers you will see with Edge prevailing over HBK by getting support on the ropes. He does have an impressive performance in the rumble as well. 7/10

2.Undertaker vs. Heidenreich, casket match: An interesting matchup although Heidenreich is not a great performer. Entertaining anyway with run-ins from Snitsky and Kane. Taker wins. 7/10

3.JBl9(c) vs. Angle vs. Big Show, Triple threat match for wwe title: I was very entertained by this match even despite the run-ins. Jbl wins continuing his very respectable title reign that eventually ended at Wrestlemania. 8/10

4.HHH(c) vs. Randy Orton for World Heavyweight title: Really good match with HHH getting a clean pin over Orton with no interference as Evolution was banned from ringside. This was icing on the cake for Orton's failed push for main event status. Hopefully he will find new light as he has recently been drafted to smackdown via the very groundbreaking draft lottery. 8/10

5.Royal Rumble match: All Royal Rumble matches are pretty much great and this one was no different. A very exciting match with a highly dramatic ending with Batista and Cena being simultaneously eliminated and then Vinnie Mac coming out and restarting the match while blowing out his quadriceps entering the ring. Batista wins and caps it off by defeating HHH at Wrestlemania to become World Champ. I question both him and Cena as the future of the wwe. I think Shelton Benjamin and Randy Orton are the future of the wwe because they are better in ring perfomers. As of now, June, 25, 05, I predict that either Orton or Benjamin will win the '06 rumble. 10/10

Overall I would grade this PPV as an A with no real momentum killers and a spectacular Rumble match. The dvd extras also include a great look at some classic rumble matches.
