I must correct a mistake by one of my fellow reviewers. Tom Baker was NOT the Doctor that was being shown on PBS at the time, it was Peter Davidson. I remember it quite distinctly because they showed 'The Five Doctors' around the same time it was being shown in Britain. This caused a small hiccup in the viewing order. The last episode that had aired was 'Time Flight'. Anyone who has  watched that episode knows that Tegan was left behind at the end and the Doctor had taken off with Nyssa. Then the next episode shown was 'The Five Doctors'. Now Nyssa is gone, Tegan is back, and there is a strange new guy named Turlough with the Doctor. My older brother explained that Britain was ahead of the USA in the airing of Doctor Who episodes.
  Okay now for the story! I loved this story and like a lot of fans I was disappointed that Tom Baker had decided not to come back to Dr Who. I was also a little freaked out by the strong resemblance between William Hartnell and Richard Hurndall. I loved seeing a lot of the old companions even if it was briefly like Zoe and Jamie. I also loved how the Brigadier knocked out the Master in the end. Strange that Rassilon has never reappeared in any current Doctor Who stories. After all, War or no war I doubt that he could be killed. I was a little disappointed by Sarah Jane's alleged "danger". The hill she fell down was not very high. In fact an eight year old could have made their way back up it without the help of anyone. A rope and a car winch were most definitely NOT needed! Talk about overkill.
