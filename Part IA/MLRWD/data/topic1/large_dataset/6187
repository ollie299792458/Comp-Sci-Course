This is a great adaptation of "(the) Seven Samurai", an "ancient" (1954, I believe) Japanese movie which "is described as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, and is one of a select few Japanese films to become widely known in the West for an extended period of time. (quoted from wikipedia article found at [...])"

It is retold in, what I call, a semi- futuristic Japan, where there are giant robots and floating milatry bases along side rural, old fashioned, poor, rice growing villages.

Colors in this retelling are rich and beautiful, very pleasing to the eye. Artwork is great and animation is also well done. Story line is simple and not confusing. Lots of action. Lots of story.

But...

Its the kind of epic you'll not want to watch too many times, too close to each other. It is very long.

But...

Its the kind of movie you WILL want to watch every so often. You most probably will wish you owned your own copy to watch whenever the inevitable urge to see it strikes you again. Definately worth owning!

Oh, I can't forget to mention...

This box set is actually quite nicely designed. The artwork on the DVDs is also beautiful. Worthy of being displayed. This set is worth the $$$.
