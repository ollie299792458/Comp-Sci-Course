Another big-time boat trip with my favorite existential trapped rat, Klaus Kinski as Herr Kapitan with a crew of fellow odd-balls and dreamers going upstream against the grain on the Amazon, then higher up a tributary and finally, going overland in his boat, dragging the thing up a steep jungle incline via a system of pulleys powered by cannibals-needing-help and the apparently uncooled engine of the huge vessel.  Then down the other side into some other water and back home in triumph after drifting and smashing, mostly unpowered, through a previously-thought-to-be-impassable rapid, thus opening for future exploitation some inaccessible rubber trees growing in the wilds above the rapid.
The reason behind the boat trip?  The protagonist, Herr Kapitan Kinski, has an obsession with Grand Opera that could vie for prominence with the greatest obsession any man ever had for any woman, anytime, anyplace.  If he can get this land with these rubber trees and make enough dough to pay back his constantly amazed and amused girlfriend for footing the bill for his boat,
he can build an opera house and bring Grand Opera to this riverbank jungle town (which he does, finally, along with the longest cigar I've ever seen, at the conclusion of this epic of film-making madness at its finest).
In a "Hey, this guy's all right!" scene early on displaying Kinski at the height of his infantile-ego-driven craziness, he's shown up in the town's church belfry in the middle of the day, hammering the clapper violently against the bell, roaring through clenched teeth, "I WANT MY OPERA HOUSE!!"
Unless the cannibals got him later on, I'd say he's got his opera house by now.  
But what next?
