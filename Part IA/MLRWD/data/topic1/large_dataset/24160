Only Tom Stoppard is capable of creating this degree of intoxication with dialogue that, although not Shakespeare's, rings with the music of his mighty iambic pentameter line.  
And the players speak the speech as he  and his colleague pronounce it to them, trippingly off the tongue.  This  film seems to bubble, as if it were filmed through a lens of champagne.  Although it has its moments of sorrow, embarrassment, ribaldry, and  cynicism -- all of which are quite in character -- most of it is pure,  golden joy, presided over by an ironic Judi Dench at the height of her --  and Her Majesty's -- power.
Paltrow and Fiennes are extraordinary as the  two lovers, as much in love with words and the theatre as with their  exceedingly attractive selves.  John Madden is hilarious.
And the idiot  faith that "it's a mystery" but that the show not only must go on  but somehow does, transmits itself to everyone that it touches.
This is  an adult comedy in all senses:  it demands careful listening and joyous  laughter -- and gives you more than you give it.
