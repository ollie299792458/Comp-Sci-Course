I remember watching the original "Around the World in 80 Days" on television with my father in the 1970's. Dad and I both agreed the movie was a "yawner" and we were both asleep before it finished. While doing a library search for the Jules Verne book to tie in with the "Galloping the Globe" theme for school I was delighted when I discovered the Walden Media/Walt Disney version of the film.
The movie is based on the Jules Verne classic but with engaging twists and turns in the stories plot to keep you interested in the story. For this version Fogg's valet is none other than Passport 2 aka Jackie Chan. Chan brings his signature martial arts, stunt man antics and wacky humor to the storyline. Steve Coogan, a British actor widely known for his BBC comedy series "I'm Alan Partridge" replaces David Niven in the role of Phileas Fogg, brillant mechanical engineer, inventor and scientist.
The movie includes a cast of brillant character and comic actors, Robb Schneider of SNL fame, John Cleese of Fawlty Towers fame, and veteran actors Ian McNeice and Jim Brodbent. This movie is a world wind adventure for the entire family!
