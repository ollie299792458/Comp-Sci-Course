If you need the plot look at other reviews. Actually there is very little in the way of plot however that is not really a criticism there are lots of films just about mood or tension between characters that are fascinating and fulfilling. Francis Bacon was never my cup of tea as an artist I found his paintings one note and void of structure and composition but that should not and was not important when viewing this film. I agree with some of the reviews posted here that there are a lot of cliches depicting mental illness, the spiraling staircase et al but the need of the director not let the actors convey this was a big mistake.  The film is all about visuals and the lack of any actual depiction of Bacon's paintings doesn't really make a difference. He is portrayed as one of the most unsympathetic characters in film making Hannibal Lector look like a better candidate to hang out with. Okay I get it all homosexuals were totally miserable in the 60's before the word Gay was stuck on.  I doubt that was true and Francis Bacon may have been the miserable jerk this film makes him out to be but I doubt that. Having said all that I would rather watch this movie than a white wash job Hollywood bio like "Ray" or "I walk the line" any day.
