The theme of this movie is the Fraternization between enemy soldiers documented during WWI. It is a rich and powerful subject as are the pitiful efforts on the part of the military, governments, and some of the religious leaders...to terminate the Fraternization. It started with music (the Fraternizations). A simple song was more powerful than war. That alone is a very powerful truth.

Be sure to listen to the Interview with Christian Carion, (make sure you set it to English subtitles! if you do not speak French). He explains how most of the main facts of the movie are based on true events. His position is a powerful one, especially regarding the horrifying Bishop's speech, how children were being militarized by Germany, France, and England, and what these countries did in an effort to stop or suppress the Fraternization.

I found this movie quite moving. It managed to cross boundaries on every level and, I believe, showed a simple and profound truth. Given a chance, most people just want to live their lives and are fundamentally good. It would be a fabulous movie to share with young people as it dares to show something positive, warm, loving, and the best of human nature.

To let this simple but powerful evidence of human decency be remembered is food for our soul and gives wing to my heart!  Organized religion of any sort, and of course different governments, do not have the best track record when it comes to tolerance. If you know history, this should not be a surprise.

My advice...watch with an open heart, and finish the experience with the Director's Interview.  The music at the end is absolutely gorgeous.
