Who knew watching two people on a plan for 20 minutes could be this gripping? Red Eye has delivered us not only the best Thriller of the summer, but also one of the best films of the summer. Rachel McAdams, who is most known for Mean Girls and The Notebook, proves to us that she's one of the rare actresses with not only beauty, but the smarts and raw untained talent to back it up. Julia Roberts better watch her back, because this girl is coming and will rip that Hollywood crown straight from her head. The other amazing actor Cillian Murphy is both crudely evil and disturbingly sexy as the villian Jack Rippner. This is a class A seat clencher that will have you sweating with suspense until the films end. The story of the film isn't anything new, but the way the film is executed is unique and satisfying. I must again say that the reason this film works so well is because of the wonderfully tense performances by the two leads, Rachel and Cillian. They are fine actors who should have long lasting careers. Wes Craven has once again proven why he's the leading man in creating worlds of horror and panic, this movie is excellent.
