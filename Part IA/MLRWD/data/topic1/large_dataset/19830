What a great movie.  First of all, it's somewhat astonishing that this is a Billy Wilder film.  The only thing it has in common with his other classics like "The Apartment," "Sunset Boulevard," or "Some Like it Hot" is its intelligence and sophistication.  Otherwise, it is an entirely different kind of experience--a courtroom drama, a twisty mystery, an excursion into what is most British, and a vehicle for great performances by Charles Laughton, Elsa Lanchester and Marlene Dietrich. Laughton is especially wonderful as a barrister with a bad heart, who duels throughout with his scornful, but ultimately devoted, nurse who tries vainly to keep him away from cigars and bad food.  Laughton survives this bodily assault, because in the end, he is shown to be essentially a servant of truth.  The cynicism of American jurisprudence is absent here--Laughton's character does not give into easy rationalizations about his role(and to say more would be unfair to those who haven't seen it.) Laughton strives for nobility.  And yet, despite the wig and the courtliness, he is very alive in this role.  I just loved this film.
