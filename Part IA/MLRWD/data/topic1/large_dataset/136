This is a review for season one a great DVD set.  It has trivia for each episode which I found interesting and entertaining.  It has some commentaries on some of the episodes by each Monkee. Episode 48 has commentaries by Mike and Peter.  It was interesting to see the same show and hear 2 different points of view.  Bob Rafelson commented on the episode that he directed and it is about time we heard from the man who really created the Monkees. It also includes the Monkees special 33 and 1/3  Revolutions per Monkee commented on by Micky and Brian Auger who was the villian on the show.  There is also an interview with the editor Gerry Sheppard and a photo gallery.  The box is rather original as it is designed to look like an old portable record player from the 60's.  The sleeves of the disc look like the Monkees 45's.  A book is included on teh behind the scenes of the Monkees 2nd season written by Andrew Sandoval.  If you just want to hear and see the music videos without the episodes there is a feature that that will allow you to just play the videos.  After all they were the original MTV.  If you are a Monkees fan or a fan of good music or sitcoms from the 60's.  Buy this DVD set.
