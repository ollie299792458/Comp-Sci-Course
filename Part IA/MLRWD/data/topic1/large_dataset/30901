Clearly TGMBC is a story telling masterpiece.... With the bonus of great slapstick comedy.  !Xi is a modern-day Questing Hero,  Luke Skywalker, Odysseus, on a journey of heart.  The erzatz anthropology of the first 15 minutes is, in fact, accurate... if the film-maker were talking about 75 years ago.

The use of Journey to Nyae Nyae as balance gives the viewer a rounded picture of both the myth and the reality of native peoples of the southern part of Africa at the end of the 20th Century.  This is a  film I use in my college sociology classes to introduce 'culture' and the universality of humankind's need for collective living, and its interdependence.

In contrast to other reviewers, I find no racism in the film.  In fact, the equality and dignity with which people of color are presented is astonishing, given that it was produced during the end of the Aparthied regieme in SA.  There are goofy blacks (Frank) and goofy whites (Andrew).  There are kindly whites and kindly blacks.  There are ignorant, ethnocentric blacks and equally ignorant and ethnocentric whites.  They are, all in all, just people... People whom our hero encounters on his Quest.  And the upshot of the entire film is about People: personified in the little son who runs out to greet and embrace his father in the last 30 seconds of the film.
