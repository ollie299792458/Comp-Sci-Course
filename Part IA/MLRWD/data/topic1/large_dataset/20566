"I Am Sam" is one of those films that resemble Frankenstein. Not the movie "Frankenstein", but instead a movie made with parts of other movies. I will grant, that in this case, "Sam" acknowledges that it is inspired by a couple Hoffman films (take a wild guess what they are). 
This is a movie where everyone has a heart of gold; some just don't realize it yet. If only real-life was this convenient! 
By now, you should be familiar with the plot, so I won't break that down. The highlights in "Sam" are few. One is newcomer Dakota Fanning (Critic's Choice Award winner for Best Child Actor). She lends strong support as Lucy, Sam's 7 year old daughter who is surpassing him intellectually. Another highlight involves, simply, the soundtrack. Beatles songs (although covered by various artists, such as Eddie Vedder) pop up from time to time, because Sam is at least smart enough to realize the Beatles were a great band. The movie's hook line, of course, is "All You Need Is Love".
A lot of people want to see Sean Penn recognized for his role as Sam. I say he needs to be recognized for a far-superior film in 2001: The Pledge. The Academy needs to nominate him for Best Director for that extrodinary film. After all, Penn's role of a lifetime came in 1995 for Dead Man Walking.
