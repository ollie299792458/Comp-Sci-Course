The "My Baby Can Talk" series is amazing.  My 2 1/2 yr old daughter has speech apraxia and is severely delayed in her speech.  She loves these videos.  She watches one every day.  She knows almost all of the signs and is trying to say the words that go with them.  Adding these videos to her speech therapy has really helped to boost her speech.  She just started using 2 word phrase this month and just the past two days started simple three word phrases.  We have only had the videos since Christmas.  My son just turned one in December and his vocabulary has taken off.  He now has over 25 words and is attempting many of the signs.  Every day I hear new sounds and words from him.  I like the videos because they are simple and not over produced like some of the more popular signing videos.  They compare to Baby Einstein in style but are more language based.  The words they have chosen are words both my kids use every day and are of things they are interested in.  I would highly recommend these videos especially to if your child has a language delay.
