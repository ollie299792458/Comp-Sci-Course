First- watch the extended version even though the added scenes werent remastered and are poor picture quality. Here it goes- the Wicker Man is a well-thought out and finely cast picture that falls between horror and psychological mystery. Christopher Lee is great as is the actor portraying Howie, the policeman who's curiosity eventually leads him to a horror he couldnt have imagined even though i saw it coming. A big plus must be given to the soundtrack which is one of the best youll ever hear(a mix of celtic folk and eerie instrumentals) costumes and the plot but where the film falls short in my eye is the lack of background on the islands pagan rituals- it briefly explained but not enough to back the story.  Sensuality and simplicity transforms into lunacy and murder without any realistic reasoning. Its very vague and also the prochristian counter message of the lead is a bit annoying. Wicker Man is a good Sunday movie - slow but keeps you interested and though i feel its worth seeing , it is by no means the classic its been made out to be. Rent it or get it cheap( i found mine at a garage sale for 4$ ). As a bonus theres some great camera shots- some shapely nude women and nice scenery. On a grading scale id give this a B- and it is a step above the recent remake starring Nicholas Cage.
