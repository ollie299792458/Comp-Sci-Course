Stellar Performances

At the outset I wasn't sure where Bruce Willis's role as Jack Mosley was heading. Jack is a depressed, disillusioned alcoholic NYPD detective dictating his last and will and testament from a seat on a bus surrounded by law enforcement personnel. Flashing back to circumstances propelling him into dire straits, Jack after working an all-nighter is issued the task of delivering a jailed witness to the courthouse whose plea bargain grants him parole for testifying against a crooked cop. A setup to be sure. From the time they leave the police station, Jack and his ward, fast-talking Eddie Bunker, spectacularly played by falsetto voiced Mos Def, find themselves pursued with malice to keep Eddie from arriving at his destination and testifying.

Fast paced, packed with adrenaline rush action, the movie wends its way from the streets to the courthouse via a detour on a hijacked bus. Bruce Willis renders one of his best performances yet. And Mos Def is electrifying.
