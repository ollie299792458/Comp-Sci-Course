In 2002, the UK and other regions (excluding Region 1: US &amp; Canada) were treated to the 'Predator: Special Edition', a 2 disc box set which featured extra commentaries, footage, interviews etc.
The reason why Predator: Special Edition has not YET been released for Region-1 is that Fox Home Entertainment has released `Predator' R-1 twice already within the last 3-4 years. March 1999 was the first release, and then August 2001; the latter release having an improvement in picture and sound quality (i.e. anamorphic/DTS enhanced).
Currently (February 2003), Fox has again released another plain old version of `Predator' R-1 (without extra goodies i.e.), but this time in full screen.  
Recently, Peter Staddon - Senior Vice President of marketing at Fox Studios - hinted that the highly anticipated `Predator: Special Edition' for Region 1 will be released, PERHAPS for summer 2003.
Those who are satisfied with just the movie alone, this R-1 edition is good enough. Highly unlikely there'll be any improvements in terms of picture/audio on this already great anamorphic/DTS enhanced version. And it's for a lower price in comparison to what a special edition would cost.
