I found the first season of SONS well-done but I kept my distance. The closest I've been to this culture has been working in a prison (they all watch the show and love it). I had a hard time empathizing and worrying whether the Sons should do a gun deal, drug deal or increase their commitment to porn. Like the SOPRANOS we are asked to identify with lawbreakers, albeit ones who are supposed to watch over the town in some obscure way. At first I found Tara's relationship with Jax incomprehensible as well. I mean we know about the whole "women who love bad boys" thing but this woman was a damn doctor--how did she become one with so little sense? The Second Season helped me overcome all my quibbles with show. Seeing Tara bully the hospital administrator has got to be one of the all-time empowering scenes for women. Drop your wimpy stance and punch somebody. Yeah! Gemma is amazing, too. "God wants me to be a fierce mother." Whoa, now that is one heck of a fresh take on empowerment. While at times it reminds me a bit too much of that 70s movie The Warriors (each sub-sub gang clearly defined by ethnicity and stance) I have accepted that the Sons are "good outlaws" who just happen to make a living doing things that, well, in California may not be illegal that much longer. The finale for Season Two was masterful. If I was a bass, I'd say I swallowed this hook. After a bit of a wobbly ride getting starting, this show has a clear shot for a long straight ride until the gas runs out. (I gave it a four as I reserve fives for proven masterpieces).
