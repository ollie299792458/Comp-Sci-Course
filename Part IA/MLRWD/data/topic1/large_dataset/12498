Fantastic Four is yet another reason why Hollywood should stay the hell away from comic books. This movie really does suck. Part of the fun of seeing a comic book made into a movie is seeing how close the filmmakers can get to the original material. But when they get arrogant and think they can do better than the creators ( STAN "THE MAN" LEE & JACK "KING" KIRBY), that's when comic book movies fall flat on their over-produced asses. Seriously, all the prints of this movie should be tracked down and destroyed. The only things saving it are the very hot, Jessica Alba as Sue Storm and Michael Chiklis (as the THING). The real weak points here are: the story and the acting.

First, there's Doctor Doom. Since when did Doom go into space with the others and get super powers? His power is a combination of science & sorcery. Not cosmic rays. And since when does he have an American accent? Or have a big corporation? He's the tyrannical leader of Latveria. Duh! Most of the acting here is also really bad. As I said, Michael Chiklis is pretty much the only good thing this movie has going for it. This piece of junk "adaptation" is just a bunch FX and not much else. They should have learned from Sam Raimi and his two (and counting) SPIDER-MAN films. That's how you do it. Jack Kirby must be rolling in his grave. If you want to see the REAL F.F. then pick up a copy of the old Lee/Kirby comic. Ain't nothin' like the real Thing.
