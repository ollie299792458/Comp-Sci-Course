I am 30 and I did not know how to skate at all, and I had looked at many other instructions. This was the only video that showed me how to start out from the beginning and progressed me up to flip tricks, slides, and grinds in a clear and easy to follow way. If you want to learn and pay attention and actually go out and work on it in the order like I did, you will be skating well.

It shows you everything you need to know. It starts out showing you the parts of the board, each trick shows you where to put your feet, tells how to have your legs and upper body positioned, where to look, how to swing your upper body and arms, where to lean, where to slide and kick your feet, and the 8 principle part tells about visualizing your tricks and other techniques that all helped me more than any other video. Everything, I mean, everything is covered on how to do the tricks. Any age can understand it too. The slow motion with the instructions makes it easy to mimic. I recommend this video to any age skater.
