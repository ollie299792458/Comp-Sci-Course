What a great concert.  I was lucky enough to see them 3 times on the Black Ice tour.  This concert DVD has really good sound and the pictures are crystal clear.  But, my goodness, it's almost painful to watch.  While they had 32 cameras I don't think they used them well at all in the final product.  No scene holds for more than a couple of seconds.  It bounces around all the time.  Oh, sure, you get Angus for a good amount of time but how many times do I need to see the crowd?  Come on guys.  I was really hoping, with that many cameras, that we'd be able to choose, at least sometimes, which camera angle to watch.  But, they didn't include that.  Instead, it's a very jumpy production.  And, way way way too much of the crowd shots.  I bought the DVD to see the band, not the crowd.  Spend a little time with the different angles.  I loved the one from behind Phil.  But, no, it's 1 second of that angle and then a cut to the crowd, and then then 1 second on Malcolm and back to the crowd.  This could have been soooo good.  Still 4 stars cuz the show was great and it sounds good.
