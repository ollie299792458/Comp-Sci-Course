Before Full Metal Jacket was released on HD DVD, I refused to watch it because for some reason Stanley Kubrick's intentions were to distribute it in Full Screen rather than the way it was filmed in Widescreen on DVD. Now that the HD DVD version is released and in Widescreen I finally got a chance to see the film, and I'll tell you my thoughts.

This is one of the most realistic war movies I've ever seen. It's about 2 hours long in length but it feels like an hour. It shows how kids were broken down and built back up into killing machines. Some of the things they say can be disturbing when describing their rifle. The movie will often shock you, make you laugh, and depress you. Lee Ermey will blow you away with his role as Gunny Hartman the drill sargent.

Visually, this is a so-so picture. While most of the film has a decent clarity, there is also an undeniable amount of grain during parts of the film. This isn't because it's an HD DVD, it's also the same case with the Blu-Ray version.  HD DVD's have an incredible reputation with visual clarity, Blu-Ray on the other hand... well, I suppose this title fits in perfectly with other Blu-Ray movies when it comes to visual clarity. Warner Brothers could have done more than they did, perhaps in the distant future it'll be revisited. However, since the film is so good and absorbing and finally seeing it in Widescreen with some high definition at all makes it an incredible experience.

Overall, if you're just getting an HD DVD player all I can say is that there's many other titles that have a groundbreaking showcase of high definition BUT if you want a movie that's truly a classic and will blow you away with the lack of real visual clarity at times, this movie is it.
