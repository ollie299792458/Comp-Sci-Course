Rope, you can call that it is a great Hitchcock's experiment, or you may call that it is a nice play-like-movie inspired by Leopold & Loeb case.
The most interesting and important character in the movie is a professor Rupert played by James Stewart. His position is like on a borderline. At the first appearance he seems not to believe anything in the world. He doubts and laughs everything, especially common sense. Then he tends to make ordinary people uncomfortable. That makes Brandon believe Rupert is his side, supper human's, as Brandon describes, side.

A theme of this play is a moral. It is very unusual and also effective to show this kind theme through a character like Rupert. Let's say Mr. Skepiticism speaks moral.
I wonder how many people are attracted by such moral story nowadays. People, including myself, are more likely attracted by unhealthy, king and slave relationship between two wealthy, smart and good-looking young men and how they plan and commit the crime, and the shocking end of their relationship (one of them, Loeb, Brandon in the movie, was killed in a prison).

The other thing in the movie fascinates me is music by Poulenc, a French composer. Actually that is the most fascinates me. And I tried to find out what title of the music, that is Perpetual Movement No. 1. I love it. That scene, While Phillip plays the music, he is so afraid of the crime but trys to hide, and Ruppert asks questions and closes to him, lighting on and off, you can see the brilliant tension between the two characters with sensitive music.
