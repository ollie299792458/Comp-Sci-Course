I wasn't born yet when this show originally aired and I do recall it vaguely being in syndicated reruns when I was a young child. Since I am a fan of the old black and white TV shows and I heard that this program was truly a classic, I decided to rent it.  I wasn't dissapointed and neither will you.  The program follows the adventures of Tod Stiles (played by veteran actor Martin Milner) and Buzz Murdock (played by George Maharis)as they wander aimlessly across the USA along route 66 in their sporty Corvette.  Each episode tells a new story regarding who they come across in a new State (Nevada, Ohio etc..) and how their lives become intertwined for 60 minutes. The stories range from boring to very interesting to classic.  My favorite so far is the one when Tod has his drink accidentally spiked at a party and he starts to take on a wierd personality.  Another memorable one is when both Tod and Buzz volunteer to teach at a rural school.  I like the the fact this show is not filmed on a lot and you get to see the real locales of the places that Tod and Buzz visit.  i wish there were a few other locales like my homestate NJ.  You can't tell me Atlantic City would not be a great place to have a Route 66 story.  Overall, the DVDs are worth checking out if you never seen the show before and you like 50's and 60's TV.
