I have a confession to make. I've always been a trekker at heart. It's true. I've always been a Sci-Fi fan as well. But this movie has really taken me beyond that point. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for  action/adventure film. But once in a while, I get the hankering for  something thought provoking. When was the last Die Hard with a Vegance did  that to you? This movie has expressed what I feel to be a accurate of a lot  of people's feelings about the (then) current events in Russia in the early  90's. This movie really helps kids, teenagers, and people a like that peace  is sometimes neccasarry to fight and that it is worth fighting for. Without  a doubt, one of, if not the best Star Trek films. Director Nicholas Myers  (Time After Time, Star Trek II) produces a fablous thriller air that will  draw you into the experiance. It promotes all the mood and atmosphere of  The Hunt For Red October, will still manageing to send several messages  across that provide points to ponder for hours. The humor and action is  blended nicely and the Star Trek cast are at there best acting yet! The  symbolism works well and expresses realistic feelings and fears.
