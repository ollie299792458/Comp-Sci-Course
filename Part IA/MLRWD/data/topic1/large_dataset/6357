I gave this cd only 4 stars, despite the incredible nature of the pilot (far superior to the movie), and the interesting character of the fist true episode.

The reason is the last episode (the emancipation). It was quite disappointing. It reverted to an unthinking, formula plot that was totally predictable.

The flaws in this show are incredibly numerous. They include a primitive warlord advocating women's rights in a society that wouldn't even let them speak in public, a totally predictable boy meets girl, boy kidnaps carter to trade for girl, Carter fights girls father for girl's freedom plot. the writers making a joke, referencing another planet, even though this was supposed to be the first planet they visited after abbadon, and by never showing the transition (which according to the overall series plot, would have been significant to the people on this planet), of explaining that they were not, as they had claimed from accross the sea, but had come through the gate. By the end of the show, the primitive people they were dealing with, just knew and understood ???

I hope the rest of the first season fills the promise of the first two episodes. They, at least, were superb.
