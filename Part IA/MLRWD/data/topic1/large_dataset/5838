I am really new to the tae bo world, for years I sat and watched the commercials and back in highschool we even did tae bo once! I am ex military and this work out is amazing compared to the vigorous workouts that we had to do in basic training. I enjoy that I can sit at home for 45mins out of my day a couple of times a week and see results and watch my body develop as I do the work out. I stand in front of a mirror and that really helps with the coordination. I feel great afterwards, and am satisfied with the 600-700 calories that I burn. With typical gym cardio work outs I never really was sweating, but with Tae bo...I feel sweaty and gross after. ITS GREAT! I recommend that you change your diet with doing this workout, otherwise you wont see results, and it helps to do it with a good friend to keep eachother motivated. As for the cheesy music in the background, and the annoying girls yelling...watch it a few times, get the workout memorized, and just mute it and play your own music in the background! :)
