Cinemascope is one of those long lost great film ideas. Started in the early 1950s it allowed people to see a wider part of the screen as it would virtually wrap around the audience giving them an almost 3d effect.

With the advent of multiplexes in the 70s and 80s and smaller screen sizes made Cinemasope obsolete. Many of these films were never released in their widescreen versions because VHS did not fully support widescreen showings of films.

DVD obviosly changed all that and it's nice to see this film back in its full widescreen mormat.

Because this was only the second or third film to use Cinemascope it is fairly short on plot and focuses more on showing the beautiful images of the Florida reef - so that people would get the full effect of the process (the closest thing we have today are IMAX features.)

The plot that exists is fine however - even if it is a traditional boy meets girl from the wrong social circle and spends the rest of the movie trying to win her heart and overcome the social obstacles that have been put in place.

The highlight of the movie is the beautiful underwater footage of the reef and the fish - in some ways this is close to a Discovery Channel feature.

The director manages to edit the film in a way that it never seems to be boring and the restoration process has left the colars sharp and crisp.

This is a great example of a long lost cinema style.
