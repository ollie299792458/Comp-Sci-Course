This film over-cooks all of the usual vegetables of the genre: Evil cattle/sheep/aardvark barons; Salt-of-the-earth (but somewhat slow) farmers; Miscast, post menopausal wandering-eyed farmer's wife; Idol-worshiping little brat; Hired gunfighter wearing black; Spineless community of dirt-scratchers; Saloon show-down; Fast draws; Noble knight(elevator-boots and fringed buckskins) with a mysterious past; Figuratively 'Gathering at the River' for a hapless resister; Faithful mongrel.

No meat in this mulligan. This is a vegetarian stew with too many ingredients from the nightshade family. All of the principal adults appear to have seasoned this provender with an additional handful of belladonna alkaloids. The kid, in stark contrast, has obviously been gnawing on dad's stash of dried Brigham tea. Dad was using it to treat those pesky spirochetes, which explains everything.

Gorgeous cinematography helps, but is it the sole criterion of what makes a film great? This is not a bad work, it is simply never convincing in its portrayal of the age and the people who populated it.

The redeeming grace of the film is the closing image of Shane (gratefully out of ear-shot of that galling kid), riding into the high country, gut-shot, semi-conscious, and facing a protracted and agonizing death. That's worth two stars.
Any solitary and painful denouement is preferable to that kid's incessant yakkkkkking.
