I have been golfing for 50 years. On a very good day I can break 80. I am a 100% arms hitter. I have had numerous lessons, some from well known teachers. None of them taught the passive arms approach which to me makes swinging the golf club a lot easier.

Most of the golf instruction I have read or seen describes the golf swing in a large number of complex coordindinated movements of hands, arms and body. Mike McTeigue does a great job of describing the passive arms method which instantly had me hitting the ball with better timing and less effort than my active arms approach. It seems counter intuitive that passive arms could work so well. The advantages of this method is you will learn a correct and well coordinated golf swing by mastering just a couple of movements.

I purchased the digital downloads of the book and the video. I strongly recommend the video, which although made in 1986, does a great job of describing in detail how to master the passive arms swing. I now realize I spent 50 years trying to master the wrong way to hit a golf ball.
