Colin Firth is irresistable as dashing Jack Worthing, the playboy who occasionally pretends to be his brother, Earnest, in order to lead a double life and temporarily escape from his responsibilities of raising a proper teenage ward, Cecily (Reese Witherspoon).  When Jack/Earnest finally falls in love with a rich city girl (Frances O'Connor), he decides he can best end his convoluted philanderings by "killing off" his non-existent brother; little does he know that his best friend Algy (Rupert Everett) is intrigued by the idea of meeting eighteen-year-old Cecily, so Algy has shown up at Jack's country estate claiming that HE is Earnest.  The plot thickens as Jack tries to trace his true parentage; as a baby, he was abandoned in a suitcase that was left at Victoria Station, and his would-be Mother-in-Law (Judi Dench) is refusing to allow him to marry her daughter until he can prove that he is of noble origin.  This video is a faithful adaptation of Wilde's Victorian play, and it is suitable for classroom use.  The hilarious plot twists and clever dialogue make it a classic; without unduly changing Wilde's script, the directors have used innovative scene adaptations that make this film even funnier than the original play, which pokes fun at arranged marriages, shallow religion, the upper class, and the importance of family lineage.  This video is smart, outrageous, and totally captivating!
