Ther are alot of great, unforgettable horror films out there that still burn in the back of our minds to this day.  But THE EXORCIST stands out among all the rest.  It's the first horror film that really focused itself on the Catholic faith rather than focusing on scaring the audience.  What I really liked about it was that it didn't just jump to the possession of Regan McNiel; it actually took lots of time before that to develop a plot and give the audience a background history on Father Merin and Father Karras. I get annoyed at the fact that younger kids who are looking for "a really scary movie" always turn to THE EXORCIST and when they start the movie, they can't sit through this kind of plot development. (i.e. my pre-teen cousins)  They just want to get to the possession and don't care about anything else.  Don't get me wrong, I found myself at times waiting to be scared.  But when the horror begins, IT HITS YOU HARD AND NEVER LETS UP!!!!!!!!!  It really never lets you go!  I usually can take any horror film on Earth, but with this one, especially towards the end, it really started to freak me out and I almost didn't want to watch it anymore.  But, if you want to be freaked, definately see it.  You can even buy before renting it if you want, trust me.
