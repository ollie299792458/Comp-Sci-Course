This is a very interesting portrayal of some aspects of the D/s BDSM lifestyle. Although in fact that almost appears to be on the periphery of the story. The reality is more about these two conflicted characters neither of whom fit well into the real world.
I did not find this to be a comedy even though it has some good comic elements.
Also I suspect many people who have reveiwed this here did not understand some parts of it.
Lee, the main character does cut herself, but it seems to be the way she has learned to escape the pain of her life. The release of endorphans from the cutting pain, helps her feel better.
Mr. Grey, the lawyer is truly a lost soul. I would have to even conclude that he suffers from Aspergers syndrome based on his behavior: He is bright, shy and has a difficult time relating to other people in a normal way. He is really a gentle person, even releasing mice caught in his office back outside. Growing orchids. He has trouble reconciling his quiet nature with his need for dominance in his relationships.
Therein lies the crux of the story.
Well done, sensual and fun. However without being familiar with or having read up on the BDSM lifestyle mny viewers may not really understand the story. There are many books on this on Amazon, including Consensual Spanking and others.
Many folks may find this film disturbing however, so choose carefully who you show it to.
