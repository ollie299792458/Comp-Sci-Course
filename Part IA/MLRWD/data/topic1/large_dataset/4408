I will not attempt to justify the non-worthiness of this movie, for any cinematic observer probably has heard enough negative commentary or poor reviews.  Instead, I must profess that my desire to own this film is not based on plot integrity, production value or Oscar-worthy acting.  Far from, actually.

It's simple - just eye candy.  There.  I admitted it.  Just blatant, regressive male hormones that took over my most primeval urges of the most Freudian nature.  I never had a real, tangible interest in the film's primary star - Elizabeth Berkley, until I saw this movie.  "Saved By The Bell" never did it for me, and was too teeny-bopper for me by that time, anyways.  But Lord and behold - I see Miss Berkley on this big screen movie, and I was instantly mesmerized by her vivaciousness.  I was hooked along with line & sinker.

Yes, it's all physical and superficial, and I must be going through a mid-life crisis.  Other than that, I truly enjoyed this film for what I understood it to be, and for what it's worth to the pleasure centers of my cerebral cortex.

Does it help that I truly enjoyed Paul Verhoeven's other masterpiece: "Total Recall??" ;)
