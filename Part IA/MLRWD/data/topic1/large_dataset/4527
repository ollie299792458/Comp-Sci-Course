I've seen this film countless times. It's a true cinematic masterpiece. Flawlessly directed. Superbly acted. A must buy for repeated viewing.

You probably knew this already. But did you know that the Bonnie & Clyde 'death car' (the real one) is on display, along with (among other items) the blue shirt, riddled with bullet holes, that Clyde wore at the time of the ambush? The car is at Primm Valley Resort & Casino, located on I-15 in Primm, Nevada at the California border.

There is no charge to see the exhibit. A televised documentary tells the true story of Bonnie & Clyde, and includes a number of interviews with witnesses and relatives.

Speaking of the historic Bonnie & Clyde, I'm sure there are any number of good books on their true life. I happen to have read a French book that is available through alapage.com entitled "Bonnie Parker et Clyde Barrow: Les Amants Terribles," by Frederic Perroud, published in 1999 by Acropole. The French have a thing for ill-fated lovers!
