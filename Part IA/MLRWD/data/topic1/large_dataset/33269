With this film, Alfred Hitchcock set out to top himself and get back on  top after the failure of VERTIGO; he did just that. NORTH BY NORTHWEST is  automatically a classic with the acting by Cary Grant (his fourth and final  film with Hitchcock), Eva Maria Saint, James Mason, Leo G. Carroll (another  one of Hithcock's favorites), and young Martin Landau (in his film debut),  the amazing set pieces (the UN murder, the cropduster sequence, and the  climax atop Mt. Rushmore), Bernard Hermann's music score, and the classic  work of the camera by the Master of Suspense.  But this DVD's extras really  add to the film.  It includes a documentary hosted by Saint  ("Destination Hitchcock," not "The Man in Lincoln's  Nose" as listed on this site), an audio commentary by screenwriter  Ernest Lehman, two theatrical trailers (a standard trailer and one  featuring Hitchcock), a TV Spot, an isolated music audio track and the film  itself remastered in Dolby 5.1 Audio and 1.66:1 widescreen anamorphic  format.  The only problem is it comes in a snap case like all Warners DVDs,  not allowing a booklet with production notes.  But this DVD is a must buy,  especially if you're a fan of Hitch.  It's also a note of interest for 007  fans (like myself).  This film brought about spy thrillers and you should  compare the cropduster sequence in this film to the helicopter sequence in  FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.
