(The comedy angels screwed him over really badly 2 1/2 years later, but that's a story for another timeline.)  But anyway, back to "Community", the best audio-visual anti-depressant out there.  It's like Seinfeld, but with better writing, better acting, and a better looking cast.  It has a slow start in Season 1, but after a few episodes in, you'll be feeling the vibe and it only gets better.  Even after you have watched the shows once, when you go back a second time, you see more.  For the comedy angels had friends, sneaky and intelligent little devils, who leave all sorts of clues, jokes, hints, and visual gags that you never see unless you aren't watching the main action going on; Pause on a school poster, and try to read the 'message'. Watch Annie and Britta oil wrestle as Abed experiences a secret miracle. Find yourself wondering which timeline you yourself are actually in... The more you watch this, the more you see.  I've never had comedy in so many 'layers' like the way Community does it. I'm 48, and I've watched a lot of TV, seen a lot of movies, and read a lot of books in my life, and I am at the point where plots don't surprise me much anymore, and the formulaic way sitcoms are run are things I've seen over and over again to where I can guess it in the first five minutes.  This show is so creative that I find myself surprised many times per season.  What a joy, to find something actually fresh and new.

This is Season Three, I am writing this review for the person who might have stumbled upon this.  If you're not sure, buy Season 3 and watch, and I'll hear your scream of joy as you quickly go back to order Season 2 and 1.  And the commentaries are fun too, it seems like they are friends, and they tell great stories.  They still don't beat Futurama commentaries, but they are close. In closing, if you like comedy, you have found a "Community". #sixseasonsandamovie!
