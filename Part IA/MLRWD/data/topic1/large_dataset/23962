I was so glad to see how many poor fools expected this to be some hollywood-styled, retardo-superhero movie a la spiderman for the masses and WERE DISAPPOINTED.

Anyone with a brain can appreciate this masterpiece regardless of the length, which really is beside the point. Do you people want to pay to be amused? or to have your brains shot out of your skull in a nightmare only to pleasantly return to a moon-ladden dream utopia?

Yes, it is based on the magnificent novel/comic by Alan Moore.
Yes, they did a magnificent job translating it on film, especially for the time constraints.

This one is most definitely NOT for the kiddies, unless you want them to have a mind of their own and appreciate substance over "WOW! special effects!" Can't completely ignore the demographics.

There is much more than meets even the novel in this magnificent story about our present age that purposely takes place in the future.

I challenge you to focus through this, if you couldn't, then it wasn't made for you. Simple as that.
