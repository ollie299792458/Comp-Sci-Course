I went into The Siege with high hopes for a thinking person's aaction thriller, and what I got contained too little in either thought or thrills, leaving a film which straddles the line too uncomfortably for its own  equilibrium.  The unidimensional quality of Bruce Willis's governmental  presebts completely sabotaged the human rights aspect of the film, while  Denzel Washington's cerebral FBI agent never really captured the soul of an  action hero.
What did impress me were the set pieces -- the bus scene,  the actual stadium sequence -- and two performances.  Annette Bening did a  credible job as someone who has begun to believe their own cover story, but  best of all was Tony Shalhoub as the Arab-American FBI agent, who brought  dignity, anger and humor to an underwritten part.
Two more comments.  The  reviewers who feel that the film is racist because of its portrayals of  Arabs/Muslims are missing the point.  The film shows quite clearly that  those who lump all members of an ethnic group together because of the  actions of a few individuals are terribly wrong-headed.  It is unfortunate  that Arab terrorists have become a common foil for heroic Americans in  action films, but with the demise of the Communist menace, Hollywood has to  take what it caan get.  And face it -- there are Arab terrorists, Russian  thugs, Hispanic gang members and Italians involved in organized crime.  Showing them does not necessarily imply that all members of that ethnic  group have those qualities, any more than Psycho was meant to imply that  all momma's boys were psychopaths.  Arab Americans should rejoice at this  film, in my opinion, because it contains sympathetic characters on thaat  group, which is all too rare.  A film where the only Arab characters are  terrorists or thieves or foul and corrupt wardens would be objectionable,  but this one does not suffer from that fault.
And second, Wesley Snips  was not in this movie.
