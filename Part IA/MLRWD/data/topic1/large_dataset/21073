This extraordinary b&w (as in "black" & "white") film is called Pi because it represents geometric value. The term "geometry" was first known in the ancient world as "geomancy." I noticed other reviewers felt "gypped" because the film was not in color. I can't imagine it any other way--it deals in numerals & figures--the b&w concept is totally appropriate and masterfully done.

I have been interested in the metaphysical/alchemical concept of "The Great Work" for a long time. Recently I've re-focused on the subject after reviewing certain books & films (see links list below.) There are various interpretations of The Work, and there's no easy way to explain it, but I'll try: The Great Work is known as Jivanmukti in Hindu philosophy & refers to a complex system of Yoga ("yoke" or uniting) the devotee with Divinity; microcosm to Macrocosm; subject to the object; Cosmic Consciousness. In alchemical terms it is the search for the fabled Philosopher's Stone that can turn base metal into gold. Historically The Great Work has also played a role in magick ritual--both "white" & "black"--and has been described as a "dangerous path"--one that has reportedly driven Adepts mad.

In modern terms The Great Woek can be seen as the quest for finding The Theory Of Everything (TOE) in astro-physics and advanced mathematical terms.

Such is the background of "The Work" in a very capsulated overview.

In Pi the dramatic focus is on the hero's obsession to figure out the perfect number to play the stock market. This is obviously a  materialistic interpretation of The Work. However, as the hero becomes increasingly strung out, deeper ramifications take hold of his mind.

The film is remarkable in its stark, often grainy blend of black & white images, brought together in a surrealist/existentialist cauldron that borders on madness itself. There are very few actors in the movie, but their performances are deftly displayed by expert direction. Reportedly the movie was produced on a $60,000 budget.

This is an extremely visceral film & brutal in its examination of the political & religious exploitation of The Work. Some people are bound to be offended by certain aspects of this movie. For example, the protagonist is a secular Jew who meets a wise cracking, supposedly religious Jew who gets him involved with a rabbinical group of Jews who are working with Kabbalah, The Zohar & a computerized "Old Testament Code." Their goal is to enter the mind of god, to control the elemental power of creation.

These are the antagonists who, along the anti-hero's deteriorating mental state, degenerate into downright sinister characters. This aspect of PI might be a problem for some people, because the scenario comes dangerously close to reinforcing the International Jewish Conspiracy garbage promoted in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (i.e. that an evil "Cabal" of Jews run the world.) Maybe I'm reading too much into the script; I tend to see everything as a Political Conspiracy these days. I'll have to assume director Aranofsky knew what he was doing in regards to this aspect or possible interpretation of his absolutely brilliant film.

Throughout the movie the hero keeps gulping down handfuls of what I presume are amphetamine & he obviously has been up for a very, very long time.

This reminded me of the strange, unsolved case of Philip Taylor Kramer who disappeared along with his van on 12. February 1996. Kramer was a bassist in the 60's band Iron Butterfly. He was also a brilliant mathematician, computer programmer & technological visionary who apparently had top level government clearance. Reportedly he had been working on a faster-than-light communications system.

Before vanishing off the planet, Kramer called 911 from his van, claiming that he was going to commit suicide. His disappearance was almost immediately reported & extensive searches made; but neither Kramer nor his vehicle was ever found, not a single trace.

The following quotes are from: [deleted because external hyperlinks aren't permitted on Amazon reviews--readers can go to a search of Kramer. This one is posted under "skeptictank"]:

"I observed the growing rumors and the widening conspiracy yet I didn't think much of it -- until KTLA News here in Los Angeles ran a short five minute report on his disappearance and confirmed that Kramer had indeed been working on a faster-than-light communications system. KTLA reported that Representative James A. Traficant Jr. of Ohio was concerned about Kramer's disappearance due to the fact that Kramer held nuclear-oriented security clearances tied to the MX Missile project and due to the type of mathematical research Kramer was working on."

"What is in agreement is that Kramer's mental stability was slipping. Just days before he disappeared, he stated that the Earth was going to end due to a supernova; that his father, a Professor of engineering at Youngstown University in Ohio, was really a god; that Jennifer, his wife, was really Mother Earth. As they were looking for a new home several days before his disappearance, he told his wife that he was frightened that people were going to come for him. "Honey, we're going to have to live behind walls. Honey, people are going to want to get at me."

"Perhaps Kramer actually believed that he had stumbled upon an astounding breakthrough. The paranoia expressed tends to make me think that perhaps Philip Kramer disappeared to try to protect his wife and family from what he believed were dangerous government agencies who would eventually come after him after news of his breakthrough became known to them. That leads me to think that, if he is still alive and simply in hiding, he will eventually resurface and perhaps try to either start a laboratory of his own to developed his breakthrough else find a laboratory he feels he can trust and sign on with them."

12 years later Philip Taylor Kramer is still missing & presumed dead.

In a cryptic phone message to his wife, Kramer sounded like a person suffering from a manic psychotic overload--much like our friend in Pi. Perhaps he found the Key to The Work in music & advanced technology. We may never know the real story. I will say this: It's harder to dispose of a body than one might imagine (or so Agatha Christie once wrote.) Were he & his van Beamed Up? Was he the victim of dabbling in the Occult and The Work? Did he commit the perfect suicide?

There are core elements in the Kramer mystery that run parallel in Pi.

We may never know the real story.

It's interesting how when you start to focus on a subject...suddenly,
