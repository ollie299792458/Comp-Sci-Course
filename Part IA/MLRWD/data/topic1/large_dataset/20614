First of all, the battle scene is one of the best supernatural battle scenes from a movie I've seen.  The plasma and the attacks look very real.  I thought that this was much better than The Craft, which is quite silly and cheesy.  The cast is handsome and that always makes for a nice to watch movie.  The mood created throughout is fantastic with the dark scenes, brooding buildings, quaint yet creepy town.  Yeah, there's rain at night and not during the day, but who gives a freak?  That's a silly thing to complain about.  Movies are redundant, deal with it.  Everyone expects something completely different in every single movie, but that's not the reality of the matter, so enjoy a movie for what it is, and this one is SUPERB.  I thought the acting was believable and the special effects were really great and look completely realistic, which is a good thing except for the scene with the spiders. :)  The soundtrack is on point, due to the fact that they got it perfectly.  I recommend this movie to everyone.
