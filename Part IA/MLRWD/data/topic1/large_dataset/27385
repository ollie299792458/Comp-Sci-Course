If  Universal knew what their classics fans wanted they would have listed "The Egg and I " as a Colbert or McMurray movie and charged DOUBLE for it. While the real "Maw and Paw Kettle" movies are formulaic and low comedy ."The Egg and I " is an "A" movie not a "B" like the "Kettles". This is a true Colbert comedy, sophisticated, witty, sarcastic, and delightfully fun, even in a chicken farm. The feel is much like "The Palm Beach Story", but a world away! If you like classic "screw-ball" comedies, you absolutely cannot do without this in your library. I have it in VHS and can't get the DVD without buying the "Maw and Paw Kettle" series ( which I remember well and don't want) . What a shame Universal, you are loosing money!!!! While "it Happened one Night" gets all the attetion with Colbert, she made some amazing, funny and truly urbane movies. The studios seem to have this problem with alot of classic stars (like Barbara Stanwick ). They print some of there most popular  (or lurid) movies and forget the rest and the best. Maybe they should remaster and attach their percieved most popular movies with the better and less known in a set and see what happens.
