Geoffrey Rush of course does a splendid job as the mysterious town drunk. Jang Dong Gun, a handsome newcomer, and Kate Bosworth did great in their roles and Danny Huston was just creepy. The martial arts fits in nicely with the artistic and stylistic overall feel of the movie that's somehow set in the old west with friendly circus folk and your standard gang of bad guys. It's colorful and full of action. Now, and don't let this turn you off, but as a serious opera fan, I loved this movie. Opera you say? Without giving too much away, let's just say that the pieces they chose of Verdi were brilliant, with one of the pieces in my opinion, tying directly to the plot of the movie. I love when actors in movies react to opera as they're listening to it or when opera is playing in the background as part of the soundtrack and they indirectly react to it. Both examples occur. Someone involved in the making of this movie loves not only opera, but Verdi specifically, and knew exactly what they were doing. Proof of that is the singers they chose. No, they weren't generic unknown artists, but operatic stars and icons whose voices are instantly recognizable. I'm really not trying to give it away!!! You'll just have to watch it to see what I'm talking about. Whether you enjoy colorful action filled movies or those kinds of movies plus operatic benefits you'll be thoroughly pleased. One final thought, I greatly admire the people involved in this movie who included the opera. It's very important for opera in its original and intended form to be presented to mainstream audiences. Thank you to those involved in that important aspect of this movie!
