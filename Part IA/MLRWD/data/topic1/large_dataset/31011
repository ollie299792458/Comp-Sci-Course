i'ts about a group of wemon and me trying to earna spot in the best Art performence school ever so they seperate into  two diffrent goups and try to put on the best play /ballet anyone has ever seen.
 On opening night the judges will be waching and chose a small amount of peopel. so , both groups perform and a 1/2 after show they call 1 person at a  time back and  the last girl they pick  jody  decieds to go to a diffrent company and becomes a teacher ,then the group  of peopel thet pratice togather and stuff they became friends and they were sad when they had to leave eachother.
my oppion on the movie is well it is a 4 star.
 It has really good dancing and The preformance at the end was great. The plot of the movie was really romantic and,best part of movie ws  most of the dancers in the movie were real dancers such as Ethan Stiefelwho played {Cooper}and Amanda Schull who played (Jody).my advise is if you havent seen it go see it. bmaby they will make part 2,well find out.
