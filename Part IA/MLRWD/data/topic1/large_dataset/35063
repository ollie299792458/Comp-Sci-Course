Since this is one of my favorite movies and I like everything about it, I don't really know where to begin... 
It's *very* leisurely based upon the novel by Fenimore Cooper, but don't look for the same plot or the same character build, because it's different. And please look for the plot in another review, I'm not going to describe it again :).
Three things make this film great:
1. The acting; I loved each and every one of the actors, they created their characters beautifully. I especially loved Madeleine Stowe, she was perfect for the role with her apparent fragility concealing inner strength and delicate beauty. Daniel Day-Lewis was also great, very masculine and strong without being handsome in the classic way.
2. The landscapes. Except for Seven Years In Tibet I don't think I have ever seen such magnificent scenery in a movie, grandiose, breathtaking: mountains, rivers, waterfalls, forests. Sadly this is best seen in cinema (and I did watch the movie on the big screen no less than 4 times)
3. The music. I don't have enough praise words for the soundtrack, it is the most beautiful one I have ever listened to, and fit together absolutely perfectly with the images and with what was happening. I wouldn't change any single note on it. At least 30% of the movie is the soundtrack.
All these are wonderfully put together in a heart-warming drama about sacrifice, love, adventure.
Note: This review is for the movie itself, not the VHS edition nor the DVD edition.
