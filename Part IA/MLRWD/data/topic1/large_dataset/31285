Eliza Dushku( Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Tru Calling) is starring in this sure to be occult classic movie. This is not your typical teen horror flick. There is some drug content, and some emplyed sexual tention, but nontheless, not your average movie.It starts off just like any other low-budget movie, but the outcome take you on a ride, screaming for more. Thus far, I have told you how this 'isn't your average movie'  and is not. You may even know Eliza from "True Lies" with Californias govener. The whole time, you find your self wanting these two people to atleast kiss. But no don't know. Being a hororr movie and knowing the gist of the regualr scenes that follow being chased, and being voulnerable, you think you know that they are going to do, what it is that these characters usually do at this point in the game. That is whatmakes this movie so great, you think you know what is going to happen. There is that whole "Gottchya" thing going on. I even though that they were, go ahead and do their thing,then they'd die the end. Was I right? Watch and find out....
