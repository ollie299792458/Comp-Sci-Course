Here is my biggest complaint about the film.  Most of the college students suffer "Friday the 13th Syndrome" where they wander off by themselves in places they KNOW they shouldn't be, but hang around just so they can meet their grisly end.  Ask yourselves, when you walk into a room only to find green Satan goop dripping upwards and pooling on the ceiling, wouldn't you go to your friends for help?  I thought so.  Such a great premise and genuine forbodeing builds up to Camp Crystal Lake in an inner city church.

Having said that, I still give it three stars and maybe it should be four.  Excellent premise.  Donald Pleasence delivers the doom and gloom forecast like no other.  The transmissions from the future are great.  The ending left me COMPLETELY rattled.  If this film were a little shorter, eliminating the necessity of killing off so many college kids while leaving the substance of the story intact, this would've been perfect.  (Either that or give me more plausible ways to kill off the herd.)  Not Carpenter's best, but it sure could've been.
