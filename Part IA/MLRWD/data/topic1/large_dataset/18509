Captain Corelli's mandolin is within a 2 hour period one of most wretched turds i have seen in quite some time. This world war two love story set in an idealic Greek island attempts to place a shallow love interest between Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz, both tragically caught in a conflict outside of their control. Captain Corelli (Cage) is commander of a group of Italian lovers (not soldiers) who are occupiers of the island on behalf of the fascist axis powers. Penelope Cruz plays a local who is wooed by Corelli after struming a mandolin, playing with semi naked women on a nearby beach and delivering a flower to her door step drunk. I've had wet dreams with more romance than this contrived masterpeice. Along with cookie cutter brutish Germans, wise old Greek men and dedicated uncoruptable partisans and you have a recipe for a dream movie for sentimentalists and valium addicted housewives or divorcees. Naturally everyone speaks English and their is no translation problems between anyone. Now how can i smuggle this dvd back onto the shelf at walmart where it belongs.
