While this movie was made some 10 years before I was born, It really connected with me on a level that not many other movies have.  Even though it is clearly a vehicle for the filmmakers' political views, this movie stands on its own on the merit of the performances by all. As many others have said, Spencer Tracy gives an awesome performance as a man who has stood behind a printed page his whole life and must come to terms with what he has been saying.  Being a SF Bay Area native, this movie was highly entertaining simply because of the fact that the movie was shot in SF and contains scenes at some great local spots, such as  a much shorter skyline view from 101N and the Mel's on Lombard. Yet more striking for me was their portrayal of a mixed race couple, and the fact that I am a product of a mixed race marriage. This movie allowed me to gain a little bit of insight into what my parents must have gone through. And even though the movie ends fairly soon in their relationship, I can create my own conclusion to this story. In my version it's a very happy ending, a real life fulfillment Tracy's final speech. I wish more movies were made like this. Bringing current social issues to the forefront and dealing with them head on. Although the severity of the mayhem this happy couple caused may be slightly outdated, all the themes presented in this movie are very much alive, 34 years later. I see it around me every day.
