Somebody give Bonnie Hunt a leading role quick! She is such a vibrant actress that she shouldn't be the supporting role in every film she does (The American President, Jerry Maguire, The Green Mile). And now she surprises us even more by directing, writing, and starring in Return to Me, a warm, appealing movie filled with laughter.
David Duchovny (The X-Files) plays Bob, an architect whose zoologist wife (Joely Richardson) is killed in a car accident. Minnie Driver (Oscar-nominee for Good Will Hunting) plays Grace, who is desperately in need of a heart transplant. She benefits from Bob's tragedy when she is given his late wife's heart. Eventually Bob winds up in Grace's diner and her grandpa (the late, brilliant Carroll O'Connor, All in the Family) and his friends line the two up. Of course nobody knows that Grace has Bob's dead wife's heart (say that ten times fast!).
Hunt plays Grace's best friend and steals virtually every scene she's in. She has five rambunctious children and a beer-drinking husband (James Belushi) who seems less mature than his kids do. While the scenes between Duchovny and Driver feel like an ode to Moonstruck, the scenes between Hunt and Belushi play more like a zany television sitcom. The can't get along, but we know they love each other a lot.
My one complaint about the film is that Hunt should have taken the role of Grace. She nearly overshadows everybody in the film and although Minnie Driver is fine as Grace, she just isn't as charming as Bonnie Hunt. Any smart Hollywood director would pass on the Demi Moore's and Sharon Stone's and give Bonnie Hunt a chance to be a leading lady.
The end of the film is a huge cliche, but the rest of the movie is so good it's forgivable. Original, witty, and charming, Return to Me sports great supporting performances by James Belushi, and Carroll O'Connor (among others). It's a fantastic movie that should please anyone with a taste for romance straight from the heart. Rated PG for light profanity.
