Two stars for the version. I was heartened to see that this was a two-disc edition, as I figured it meant both the original version and the less-effective director's cut would be available. Alas, there is just a completely different movie on the second disc, and the headlining film is the lesser version. If you want to see this movie properly, with Delphine Seyrig's sung theme song, and tighter, more effective editing (why do we always suppose that meddling is an improvement?), you're going to have to get on EBay and find the original VHS, with the big, oversized box (not to be confused with the VHS of the original release of the director's cut). [NOTE: according to the comment below, the longer version came first, not second, as I had thought, so make of that what you will, although that hardly changes my opinion of the two versions.] It won't be DVD, and it won't be widescreen, but it will be worth it. When I first saw the director's cut, I was surprised by how saggy it made the film (and the dropping of that theme song is criminal). What a disappointment that the second DVD release of this film has not remedied the error, or at least given us both versions.

  By the way--what is with giving an "unhelpful" review to reviews that don't recommend something, regardless of whether they have been helpful or not? It's kind of weird. I don't care if my review is tagged as unhelpful, esp if you actually think it is, but if you read a review and it doesn't say what you wanted it to say, that is not "unhelpful," it is "something you disagree with," and there is no rating system for that.
