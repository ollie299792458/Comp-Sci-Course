I am fed up with people saying that nothing happens in this film.  To say this is to miss the point entirely. This is a film made in documentary style, a style which gives maximum credibility to the wide and varied  selection of characters.  We are seeing them in their natural environment,  be it the pool hall, the beer bust, or indeed within the confines of the  school walls.  
I defy anybody to watch this film and not be reminded  along the way of one or two, if not several, of the people from their  year-group in school.  They are all there: the sporty ones, the ones who  did drugs, the ones who were good at sport and did drugs, and of course the  nerds.  What I love is that none of these groups is portrayed by way of  charicature; they all have complexities which are evident in every  scene.
The result of these complexities is that some of my favourite  characters are the ones who might be considered minor.  Melvin (the black  guy) and Hirschfelder (Mitch's chubby friend) are two perfect examples.  And there is of course Wooderson, the epitome of Texas cool!
I disagree  that nothing happens in this film; however, the fact that plot for once  takes a back seat means that these wonderful characters are given the  freedom they deserve to show their worth. Anyone who calls this film boring  is boring themselves, and never enjoyed their teenage years!
