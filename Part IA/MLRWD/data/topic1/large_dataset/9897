"The Road to El Dorado" is a very funny story, a fast-paced adventure, and contains some truly beautiful, innovative animation (much of it with a Mesoamerican palette & motifs). ... This movie has only two weaknesses: it's sort of a "boys" movie, with a world view, humor, and vocabulary that works well for boys above age 7 or 8 (or boys of 50); and the purist like myself might argue that the two hilarious, harmless heroes in this movie are NOT typical of the average Spanish invaders who craved the New World's gold. One of the reasons why this is a boys' movie is the voluptuous "Chel" character voiced by always-sexy Rosie Perez; the animators who sculpted the luscious Chel have guaranteed that excitable male viewers (esp. adolescents) will not sleep well after seeing this movie. Final notes... The superb song lyrics are a bit wordy for younger viewers, but the lush score is wonderful for all ages. Also, the voice-cast for this romantic adventure comedy includes some of the finest actors in the business, and the script is a clever, uninhibited update of the "two-dudes&babe-discover-gold" classics. A winner!
