I've seen that movie on a regulard DVD when it came out.  I was touched and moved by this story of a little girl from Australia sending letters to an old jewish man in New York.  Well, it made me cry and I like movies that have that effect on me.  A lot a people who have seen this movie found it very depressing.  It is true that some of the subjects that are treated can be heavy... however, there is some true beauty that emanes from this story.

So I finally got a blu-ray unit and bought this title in that format.  When I fist put the movie in the tray, the first thing that I saw were those ugly previews that looked pixelized as some videos you can see on YouTube.  I was kind of afraid that the main movie would have been treated that way.  Then I got to the menu, presed play and I saw again that magnificent movie in a way that it's supposed to be showned.  I like claymation animation a lot so for a fan like me, being able to see every details on the caracters, the set... wow!  What an amount of work!  It's so beautifull!  Then I sat and looked at those supplemental features... they are not like those lame documentaries that tell always the same thing!  There was nice humor to them... they present the producer like a tyrant!  So funny.  For stop-motion animation lovers, Mary & Max on Blu-Ray is definately a good title to own!
