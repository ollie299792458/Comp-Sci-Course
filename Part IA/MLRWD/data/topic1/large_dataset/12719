I've just seen the film today, and I wanted to share some thoughts in response to those often annoying and simply wrong movie critics in "The New York Times", "USA Today"...and well my local paper "The Columbus Dispatch". Essentially, the critics have given the film thumbs down, but don't be fooled. The film is quite good and enjoyable and mostly hits all the right notes and deserves credit for mixing various genres into a unique hybrid. Is it a horror film? A period piece? A biography? A thriller? A mystery? Noir? A romance? Yep, all of the above.

Just off the top of my head, I'd like to address some of the points the aforementioned critics mentioned in their negative reviews:

* One critic actually had to point out that the movie isn't a version of the poem "The Raven". It's as if the critic wasn't aware the Poe himself became known as The Raven, thus the title of the film.

* The film was criticized for turning Poe into an action-hero-detective. I'd just like to point out the Poe was considered a great athlete and did serve in the Army. The Poe that aides in the investigation of serial killings would not have been too inconsistent with the real Poe's physical prowess, though certainly at that stage in his life he was in poor physical condition, mostly due to poverty and depression over the death of his wife. Which leads me to the next point...

* It seems the critics won't allow the fans to have a flight of fantasy regarding Poe's last days, which are historically vague--perhaps even debatable. There are several different explanations and accounts as to what happened. A film that would have been an accurate biopic would have been rather depressing and subject to debate and inconstistencies. But this film has a vision and a version of Poe and sticks with it. So there wouldn't have been much fun taking the route of making a pure biopic film. Yet, there are several films that do, though they are truly more biographical in natural. They are: "Poe: Terror of the Soul"; and The Learning Channel's biograogt of Poe, whose name escapes me. Then there's A&E's Bio of Poe. No...clearly this isn't what the makers of this film were after. And that's a good thing in this case, although the aforementioned films are excellent in their own regard.

* Poe has been considered wrongly to be an ever falling-down drunk incapable of little more. Although there certainly was that component to his personality; this film was able to portray the other side of Poe, especially his sharp mind and witticisms and his romantic nature, and you can attribute that to John Cusack's excellent performance. And besides, isn't it true that women often fall for flawed men? So why could we not see Poe in such a relationship with a beautiful woman who cannot help falling for him. A tired troupe perhaps, but find me a film that's 100% original.

* Some critics has condemned Cusack's perforamce because he didn't get the subtleties of Poe's language right and that particular period in Baltimore's history. Really is that possible? Now think about if for a second as Poe live a rather itinerant life and consider the time period. Quite simply this: There are no recordings of Poe's voice. Nobody knows what he sounded like. He was raised to be a southern gentelmen; he probably did have a southern accent; yet he attended school in England, and later, which is well documented, lived up north. Who the heck knows exactly how Poe spoke? If Cusack played it was a southern drawl it would have been out-of-place.

* The strength of the movie is that the writers were able to make Poe a sympathic, and yes tragic hero, instead of the neurotic he's often depicted.

* Now, SPOILER ALERT. The pitch of the movie was to sepculate regarding those last days of his life. Poe's making the fatal decision to take the poison to spare his beloved's life, invested a rather romantic quality to the fictional Poe that I think the real Poe probably had. Being an avid reader and admirer of his work and admittedly sympathetic to his tragic life, I think that given the choice presented to him in real life, Poe would have drank the poison to spare his belove'd life. I also think the real Poe would have made a competent amateur detective as he did in this film, because the real Poe had a gifted mind, especially in the fine art of ratiocination. Though again, in truth, the real Poe at the time was not in the physical shape and frame of mind as the Poe in the film.

* But that's my point: the fans are allowed to have their speculation; they are willing to suspend their disbelief; they are willing to allow the film-makers certain historical liberties when they are done well; the fans know this a fictional film. Again, contrary to what the professional critics have written about this film, they do that...and more, especially in creating some very DREARY atmosphere and some well-staged shock sequences, and a rather intersting mystery to boot. What if Poe really died that why? What a truly Poe way to go!

* All-in-all, I give the film two thumbs up, and I implore you to dismiss the critics and go see the movie for yourself. And undoubtedly, some of you more learned Poe aficionados out there can append to some of the points I have made.

*Should you watch this film? Evermore! Critics be hanged. Evermore!
