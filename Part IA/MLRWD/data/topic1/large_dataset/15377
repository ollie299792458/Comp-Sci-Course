I am surprised that I like the film.

I usually give an action flick a high rating if it's better than I expected, if I wished it was longer, or if I tend to miss that it was slow in various parts of the movie. I didn't have a problem with the believability of the film as I understand that with many flicks we need to suspend disbelief. Truth is stranger than fiction so it's possible that some of the covert missions of various forms of the government actually happen. If you listen to accounts from the Navy SEALS it sounds possible. Can she do any of this? I don't know, so I suspend disbelief.

I like that she was able to (as another reviewer suggested) lay waste to her compadres. She was deftly able to manage counterattacks. She seemed to be a peer among her friends, and that she had a good sense of her role was impressive.

I know people swoon over her but I don't find her attractive, and her appearance takes away from the enjoyment of her films. She is entirely too skinny and  her lips are a distraction. I find that her body is off kilter somehow. WHO she is as an actress is part of the overall flavor of the film for me her appearance detracts from the rating.
