Were there a way to give a movie a six, that would be this movie. It is truly the best film that I have seen in many, many years, and was a brilliant telling of a very classic story. The blend of musical numbers with acted scenes was pulled off remarkably in this movie, and the film version allowed for plays that would not have been accomplished on the stage. 
The vocal talents of actor Richard Gere and those of Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are unbelievable. Who knew? But it is Queen Latifah who really took the stage away in her brilliant portrayal of Matron 'Mama' Morton. We knew she had a brilliant voice, and we knew that she could act. We knew that she was gorgeous, but how she pulled this movie off is truly, truly outstanding. She brings it all together and it is her talent that glues the entire film together and makes it what it is. She is stunning and unbelievable in this role, and is to be commended for the great work which she did. Her fans will be thrilled with this movie, as will fans of the musical genre as a whole.
This one is a 'must see!'
