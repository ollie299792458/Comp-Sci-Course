As others have already mentioned, this movie explores the psychological trauma of European Jews in the post Holocaust generation.  It also looks at the life of Chaja, a young assimilated Jewish girl, who becomes connected to her people through her connection with a Chassidic family for whom she works as a nanny.

Although the film is clearly emotionally moving, particularly at the turning point, it is also intellectually stirring, as viewers are drawn to consider the meaning of virtue, community and survival.

It is for that reason that I disagree with reviewers who are opposed to the film because of its nudity.  The filmmaker uses the nudity to juxtapose the values and culture of the general Belgian youth of the time to that of the conservative, religious values of the Kalman family.  The swimming scene appears immediately after a scene in the Kalman home.  It is shocking, both because of the content and because of the use of light (low lighting in the scene in the Kalman home, and a brightly lit day in the succeeding scene).

I rented this movie, then bought it, and am considering buying a copy for a friend.  I've watched it several times.  That's how much I like it.
