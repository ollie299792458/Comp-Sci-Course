When I first watched the Barchester Chronicles, I was not expecting a drama about the interpersonal tangles within the Church of England would be particularly interesting. But what a surprise! After renting the series, I knew I had to buy it - and indeed, having now watched it three times, I believe it to be worthy of many more viewings. Never have I seen a film (or mini-series) with so many brilliant actors, creating such enchanting characters.

Donald Pleasance is heartwarming as Mr. Harding; every expression and gesture of his is perfect. Alan Rickman as the Slippery Slope is hysterically appalling, as is Geraldine McEwan as the Bishop's wife - frighteningly unforgettable. Nigel Hawthorne captures well the emotional, outraged but basically decent Dr. Grantley. And the delightful Susan Hampshire (who I first saw and admired in the Pallisers) brings a tone of playful lightness to the film.

I couldn't recommend this mini-series more highly. It is one of the best-acted and best-directed films I have every seen.
