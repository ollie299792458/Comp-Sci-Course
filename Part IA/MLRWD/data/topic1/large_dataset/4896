Emma Thompson thoroughly deserved the Oscar she received for her adaptation.  Her love for the novel and respect for Austen's art is obvious. Nothing significant is missing, and all changes stay true to the spirit and meaning of the book.

My only real complaint about the production is that, while Emma Thompson played an excellent Elinor, she was at least 10 years too old for the part.  There were times when her Elinor and Margaret looked more like mother and daughter than two sisters.

However, I think that the rest of the casting was spot-on.  Elizabeth Spriggs and Robert Hardy as Mrs. Jennings and Sir Middleton made an excellent team and Imogen Stubbs captured Lucy perfectly.  I think that Emilie Francois as Margaret was particularly well cast; it can be difficult to find good child actors, and she was very believable and not a bit precocious.

There aren't oodles of extras, but the ones that are present are worth viewing, and they make up in quality what they lack in quantity.

This movie would make an excellent addition to your DVD collection.
