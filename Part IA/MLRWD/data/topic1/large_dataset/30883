I put off seeing this movie because I had my doubts about it.  I had heard a lot of opinions about Harrison Ford's character being hard to accept.  I finally broke down and rented WLB and I'm not sorry that I did.  
I really couldn't stand Michelle Pfieffer's character, who is a bored little homemaker with too much time on her hands and a very nosy disposition.  However, my reaction to her character was due to some good acting on her part.  Pfieffer really did a good job bringing out her character's more annoying and compulsive behaviors.  
Harrison Ford's character is a departure from what he usually plays and may be a little hard to swallow but who says he always has to play the hero or adventurer.  He wasn't great but he wasn't bad either.  Just have an open mind.
The plot itself was pretty good.  When the supernatural things start happening, the movie gets pretty freaky.  All the ghostly apparitions are not in your face but more concentrated in things you hear or "sense".  They'll keep you on your toes.  The movie will set the kind of atmosphere where you can grab someone sitting next to you and scare them out of their shoes.  The story really didnt' start moving for a while so you may be pretty bored halfway through the movie but give it a chance, the plot picks up and has a pretty good ending.
I'm not going to give away the ending, but look for something in the ground in the final scene as the camera pans back; it's pretty freaky and will give you a real chill.
