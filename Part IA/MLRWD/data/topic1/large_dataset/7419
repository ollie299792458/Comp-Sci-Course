I HATE exercise but I've been doing this program faithfully for 7 weeks now and have never felt so fantastic.  I'm not some young kid trying to get into a skimpy swimsuit either but a life long very overweight 53 year old woman.  The exercises are difficult but adjustable to even my level of fitness (low).  I don't get bored and find I look forward to my work outs.  That's never happened before. Thanks Rushfit. I'm going to keep going. Maybe a swimsuit is in my future somewhere.

This is an update to my review.  I've just finished my 20th week!  I still LOVE Rushfit.  I'm stronger than I've ever been and can do so many things I never thought possible.  I'm hiking now and planning a walking tour next summer to Ireland.  I haven't missed a day of the work outs and still look forward to them every day.  I work at a hospital and have had people asking me if I've had gastric bypass or lapband surgery.  "Nope", I say, "I have Rushfit".  Give these DVD's a try.  Commit yourself for 8 weeks then decide.
