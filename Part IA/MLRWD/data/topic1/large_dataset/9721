I saw this flick on a Saturday night and actually liked it. From what I had heard from my friends, I thought I would not like it at all but then again, just goes to show when you make a movie out of a book - sometimes there are chances that it might turn out nice. 
The story line is fairly simple : No man dare come in contact with Owen Women - a long lost curse will surface everytime and kill the poor guy. Cut to Present: Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman live with their aunts in a cool house, eating chocolates for breakfast, drinking martini potions and talking about love. Sandra gets married, loses her husband and re-enters the aunts' house with her two girls only to save Kidman from her drunk boyfriend who in the bargain gets killed accidentally. 
Enters cop Aidan Quinn - dashing as ever to investigate the case and fall head over heels for Ms. Bullock. Wait! There's more. The boyfriend's spirit arrives within time and thereon what follows is to be seen and not read...
Good performances by everyone. A good, crisp script in hand and you have a nice made movie. 
I have to get the book and compare the two. Till then you go borrow or buy the DVD!!
