If you are looking for a method to help you lose weight and keep it off this is for you.  Some of the negative reviews I read about this video said it did not provide enough activity for weight loss.  They totally miss the point.  While the activity level may not provide a cardiovascular workout some may want, it provides something much more powerful.  If you follow the instructor you will find that yoga conditioning gives you practice in staying conscious, alert and relaxed.  This kind of practice helps those with weight loss issues make better decisions about food and exercise throughout the day.  I have used this video for years and when I'm not doing it, I find it harder to live consiously.  One of my food issues was eating when I wasn't hungry or eating for entertainment or eating at night without any thought for the number of calories I was taking in.  I have lost over 50 pounds through yoga, diet and exercise.  Following this yoga video each day, helps me focus, and consciously make food choices wisely and realize the importance of including a lengthly walk or hike each day.  I purchased this DVD for a friend who couldn't wait to try it since hearing about my method of keeping weight off.  This video is a big part of my success.
