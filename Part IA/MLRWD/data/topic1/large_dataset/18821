Quite simply, this is the most intelligent "slasher flick" since...well...probably ever. This tenth installment of the Friday the Thirteenth series culminates the best parts of the series and pokes fun at itself for the worst. The plot is as deep as necessary, but not insultingly shallow as horror movies typically are. The teens being stalked are not as mindless as the genre's predecessors, and the stuntman-turned-actor Kane Hodder shows where his cult following comes from as Jason.
  For those looking for new, creative death scenes, Jason X certainly delivers, with not one scene change leaving you wondering how Jason killed the last victim.
The writing doesn't worry with such matters as "How is Jason back from Hell?" or other trivial thoughts...he's just here, and he's not very happy about it.
  From the horror fans, to the "I only watch at Halloween" buyers, Jason X is certainly deserving of ownership, because let's be honest, we all take pleasure in horror movies at one time or another, and this movie is just fun. If it was worth looking up a review on, you have enough interest for this movie to all out entertain you; not to mention there are a healthy amount of bonus features actually worth watching, including a history of the character Jason, and a making of Jason X.
