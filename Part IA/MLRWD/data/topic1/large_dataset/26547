I'm a 50 yr old male, happily married, couple of late teen boys...and I just have a blast watching these DVDs...I have all of them now. I'm quite an admirer of Mr. Selleck, due to his independent conservative beliefs as well as his views on the 2nd Ammendment. I also gained GREAT respect for him for his handling of the Rosie O. attack he endured! I also find his cowboy movies are especially terrific examples of his acting ability, great story telling there. Never payed much attention to Magnum PI in the 80's when on TV, but now with TODAY's TV which is...well... total garbage, this show is a breath of fresh air. So I thought I'd buy the first season of Magnum, as I recalled it was a pretty good show, plus it has Selleck. What a great decision. The whole cast and the way they interact is like a tight family, funny, strong and loyal ties that bind, and is great fun to watch. You may find that a few episodes (here & there in season 4, 5, 6) are pretty simple (poorly written), BUT the actors tried to work with it and it's still the Magnum PI family. Buy it, enjoy it and turn OFF modern TV! It'll be good for you and yours, I promise ya ~
