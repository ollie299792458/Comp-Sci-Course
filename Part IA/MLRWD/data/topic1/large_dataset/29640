Finally RE-released. Now I know why used copies of this DVD were selling for $150 just a couple months ago.  I've bought every UFO documentary DVD that Amazon sells and this is far and away the best of the bunch.There's only two things missing from this DVD: the latest 2008 Edgar Mitchell story (which is widely available over on youtube).  And what's been titled the "smoking gun bombshell" by the Associated Press.  This is the blow-up photograph of the document in the famous Roswell photo which clearly states there was a ufo crash.  If you're interested all this info is on another Amazon DVD titled "The Roswell Crash: Startling New Evidence".This DVD, OUT OF THE BLUE, over contains 90 minutes of the best of the best interviews with military and astronauts that you're going to find anywhere.  There's also more interviews in the Bonus section.  Edgar Mitchell wasn't the first astronaut to open his mouth on camera.Now that copies of OUT OF THE BLUE are available for under $20 (at this writing) by all means get one while you can.  The government would have killed every one of these whistle blowers if they had notice of what they were going to say on camera.The BEST UFO DVD you'll ever own!
