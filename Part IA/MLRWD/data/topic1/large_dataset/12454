This is the best season so far of a stellar show.  Seasons 1 and 2 were both great, but season 3 goes the extra mile because the writers showed complete fearlessness by letting it get dark.  The bleak sensibility is endemic to the series' circumstances; what we have here is pure existentialism.  What hooked me into Battlestar from the beginning was not just obviously the amazing mini-series, but moreover its ending, when Admiral Adama admits privately that though he's just given a speech to the entire remaining human race about how they're now heading for Earth, he has no idea where Earth is.  This season goes beyond the tit-for-tat space battles with the cylons, which I do love.  The creators had the courage to dig down deep into the premise, to deal with life on board these ships, both human and cylon.  I love that we spend time on board the cylon bay ships, that we see the human class differences and basic social structure perpetuating from the colonies, that we really get the feeling of not just hopelessness that was present in season 2, but of resolve.  Most television programs turn away from that kind of darkness/depth and retreat when confronted with the prospect of boring down into the most organic inner recesses of a given premise.  That retreat is often referred to as "jumping the shark".  The creators of this new Battlestar series are crafting Sartre-esque literature.
