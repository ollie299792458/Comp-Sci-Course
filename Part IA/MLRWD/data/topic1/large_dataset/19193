Alfred Hitchcock - one of the most widely known directors of all time - was known as &#65533;The Master of Suspense.&#65533;  In 1948 Hitchcock directed the moral thriller &#65533;Rope.&#65533;  In my opinion &#65533;Rope&#65533; is not only a very splendid film, but rather thought provoking as well.  It is different than any other movie that I have ever seen.  The methods and camera style involved in this film make it one of a kind.  The plot is rather intriguing making the film a suspenseful thriller.
In the opening scene of &#65533;Rope&#65533; a murder takes place and the suspense begins.  Most thrillers today lead you up to a murder that takes place farther into the film.  In &#65533;Rope&#65533; the main characters, Brandon (John Dall) and Phillip (Farley Granger), decide to murder their friend David (Dick Hogan) because they feel that they are superior to him.  Brandon and Phillip strangle David with a small piece of rope and place his body in a wooden chest in the living room of their New York apartment.  The two hold a small party that night.  The guests include David&#65533;s father (Cedric Hardwicke), his aunt Mrs. Atwater (Constance Collier), his fianc&eacute;e Janet (Joan Chandler), his rival Kenneth (Douglas Dick), and the boys&#65533; former teacher Rupert (James Stewart). Brandon and Phillips servant Mrs. Wilson (Edith Evanson) is also in attendance.  At the dinner party, the food is served on top of the chest which holds David&#65533;s lifeless body.  Everyone at the party keeps asking about the whereabouts of David.  Brandon and Phillip both act suspiciously at the party.  Brandon keeps dropping hints that he knows something about David&#65533;s location while Phillip&#65533;s overwhelming guilt and fear of getting caught betrays the fact that all is not business as usual.
This movie keeps you in suspense.  The whole time you question whether or not Brandon and Phillip will be caught.  One of the scenes in the movie that I thought was nail-bitingly suspenseful was when the servant, Mrs. Wilson, almost discovered David&#65533;s body.  She was going to put away a few books that the guests had been looking at.  The camera work was done very well in this scene.  The camera follows each of her movements as she takes the food, the dishes, then the candles, and lastly the tablecloth off of the chest where David&#65533;s body is hidden.  Mrs. Wilson started to open the chest and just before she opens it enough to see inside, Brandon comes over and shuts the chest and told her she could straighten up the next day.  After seeing this film I now know why Alfred Hitchcock is undisputed &#65533;Master of Suspense.&#65533;
  Hitchcock also used other techniques to make &#65533;Rope&#65533; unique and memorable.  The camera work in this film is uncommon.  The film is a collection of ten minute takes.  At the end of each take, the camera zooms into a dark area such as a character&#65533;s jacket.  The result of this impressive camera work is that the story is shot in real time.  The period of time in which the film takes place is the same as the length of the film.  The setting of "Rope" is only in one place, the living room of Brandon and Phillip's apartment.  Hitchcock uses very little sound effects in this film.  The only sounds besides the actors&#65533; voices is that of Phillip playing the piano to distract himself, and the gun shots followed by the sound of sirens at the end of the film.  The actors cast in this film are superb and plausible, but James Stewart&#65533;s performance as Rupert stands out.  The scenes with Stewart and his two murdering former students are extremely gripping and believable.  He solves the mystery of David&#65533;s strange disappearance in a way that is natural to his character.
A good thriller film appeals to people of all generations, no matter what decade it was made.  A film with excellent directing, successful actors, interesting plot, and unusual camera work is always worth seeing.  After viewing this film I now understand why "Rope," along with other Hitchcock films, remains a timeless thriller.
