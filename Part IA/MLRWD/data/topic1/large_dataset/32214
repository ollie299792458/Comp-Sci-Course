Comments on DVD version...  When you start watching this movie, first thing that you notice is the bad acting...if you can get over that irritation, then you are left with watching a Gay character portrayed as a perversed peeping tom &amp; a relentless stalker. If it isn't for the way the movie ends, GLAAD should step-in and get this movie banned!
 Romance - well, you'll have to wait till the end of the movie, by then you'd be so irritated by all the stiff faces &amp; the lack of any feeling in the movie, you'll never get to see any chemistry between the two intended romantics. 
  The strory line - well, no surprices or anything new to keep the interest of the viewer, and the plot is fairly lame and un-imaginative!
  Bottom line...this is one BAD movie! if you can get it for free and you have time to waste, get it &amp; watch it...otherwise, blind fold your self, go into any movie rental or seller, pickup any movie at random, there's a very good chance you'll enjoy that one more than you do watching Chuck &amp; Buck!
