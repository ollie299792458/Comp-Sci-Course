I've followed CSI ever since the pilot episode.  Now nearly 11 years later, the show is still true to form and still as popular as it was when the show debuted on CBS.  I'll admit, I didn't watch CSI the first four years it was on. It was only after I rented the DVDs from Netflix that I got hooked.  I watched the first three seasons on DVD in under three weeks.  I'd get a disc, watch it and send it back the same day I got it.

When the characters in the show started leaving for various reasons, I was afraid the show would 'jump the shark.'  I was skeptical about the addition of Laurence Fishburne taking over the role of the departed Gil Grissom, but I was pleasantly surprised when he seemed to gel quickly with the veteran characters on the show.

I missed a lot of the 9th season due to different reasons so when I bought this a couple weeks ago, this was another instance of watching all the discs in one weekend and it reaffirmed to me that this show is still on top of it's game.  Most shows over the years deviate from their roots.  CSI has stayed true to their roots they planted in the first season and leading up until now.  Fantastic show with fantastic storylines (albiet a bit unreal at times - my brother is a real life CSI and watches this show so he 'knows how the public thinks crimes are solved') with amazing actors.
