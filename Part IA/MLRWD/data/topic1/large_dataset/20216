The Who was the greatest rock band to storm the world. Great lyrics, great melodies, great musicianship (Entwistle is/was the greatest bassist ever!).

To the reviewer below who quotes Kurt Cobain slandering The Who back in the 1990s: Who gives a rip what Cobain said about The Who? Nirvanna is the most overrated band in rock history, and didn't achieve what The Who did. Cobain was just filled with jealousy and envy that The Who are usually considered by society as being in the top 3 or 4 bands of all time. All Nirvanna did was be the first Seattle grunge band to have a hit single on MTV. So Cobain helped kill hair metal, big deal. That doesn't make them worthy to stand alongside The Who, no matter what the (young) big media says today. Say all you want about the post-Moon Who, but the band in 2000, still with Entwistle, was incredible! Nirvanna is just crappy music, crappy guitar solos, crappy singing. Boring. And their name wasn't even original. There was a signed band called Nirvanna in the 1960s. Keep your Cobain and Green Day. Those two haven't done anything new under the sun, although society claims differently now. Give me The Who anyway, anyhow, anywhere. Like The Beatles, Cream, The Stones, Queen, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, The Who really were innovators.
