As you watch and listen to this concert on PBS - pay attention to the details of each of the performances. The excellence is in the superb complement of musicians and ease with which they all interweave with one another. Listen to the warmth in the vocalists' voices and diversity with which they sing. Yet they are all thread together with Chris Botti's trumpet. The horn never overpowers any guest, never sounds crass, fused or brash but because the subtle beauty of the sound is so engaging - sometimes his beacon of sound is all there is to notice. There are no dramatic gestures, trumpet gymnastics, distracting pyrotechnics or contorted half-dressed dancers here for this televised special, there IS lyrical energy funneled through sound. My favorite guest appearances from the PBS special are "The Look Of Love"- featuring Paula Cole and Burt Bacharach, "Pennies From Heaven"- featuring Renee Olstead and "Lover Man"- featuring Gladys Knight.

We have a few gem musicians to hear live in the world touring at any one time. Many musicians are techinically superb; some are naturally gifted; some work hard at their art; and still others are emotionally connected to their music - very few are all of the above. I have reveled in Chris Botti's live and recorded music for several years, he is all of the above. He is not an overnight sensation, he is consistently brilliant. His live shows with the exceptional musicians he works with are never duplicated from one performance to another and yet his designed aesthetic is destined to be legendary.
