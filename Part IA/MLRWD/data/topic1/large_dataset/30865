To put this in perspective,I have always been the one to defend the prequels after it became trendy to criticize them but I have to draw the line at this particular cinematic travesty.

At best, the storyline reads like amateur fan fiction but to be fair, it has potential to keep small children occupied for a while. The action sequences were reasonably entertaining but unfortunately, I was too distracted by the painful dialogue to thoroughly enjoy them. If a movie that bears the iconic name of "Star Wars" has a need for comic relief, it could not come from a much more ridiculous source than assembly-line droids whose programming should not include personality of any sort, much less slow-witted ineptitude.
But the annoyance of the droids pales in comparison to that of the character of the young Padawan "Ahsoka Tano". From the word 'go', this alien brat exhibits an attitude that should have got her drop-kicked out of Jedi College a long time ago (in a galaxy far away). Her consistent backtalk and unwillingness to follow orders is difficult to picture being tolerated in any military organization but somehow she is given a free pass by the Jedi masters, and recalcitrant pre-teen girls will probably also find her quite inspiring. If 'The Clone wars' were an AT-AT walker, Ahsoko would be the snowspeeder tow-cable that brought it to its knees and crashed it.

For any true and long-term fan of the Star Wars franchise, this movie is worth its weight in Rancor droppings. For the writers of this animated insult, perhaps Vader could suspend Boba Fetts "no disintegrations" restriction...
