It's the final years of the ruling of Gods and when Hades (Ralph Feinnes) and Ares (Edgar Ramirez) decide to imprison Zeus (Liam Neeson) so they can raise Kronos - Zeus and Hade's father - in exchange for their immortality, Perseus (Sam Worthington) rides back into action to stop the destruction of humanity.

If you liked 2010's `Clash of the Titans', which I did, then you'll enjoy `Wrath of the Titans' as well. The film brings back the hammy acting, campy dialogue and dodgy accents that came with the first instalment. The action itself drives the movie and tries to reach the same grand spectacle of `Clash' and, for the most part, succeeds, pitting Perseus and his faceless, cannon fodder companions against big, mythical, creatures that are usually faster and stronger than they are. It's the perfect movie for a night-in of mindless action, those who watched `Clash' will know exactly what to expect, those who haven't should know to check their brain at the door, sit back and enjoy the chaos.

I watched the three deleted scenes on the disc, mildly interesting, they weren't really action bits so I can see why they cut them out.
