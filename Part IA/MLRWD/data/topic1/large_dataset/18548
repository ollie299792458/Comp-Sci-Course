For those posters who wondered about the quality of the new (Dec. 2008) DVD release of LILIOM, which is part of the pricey Murnau, Borzage and Fox set, the actual quality of this disc is unbelievably good. (I experienced it separately, via Netflix.)

I don't know where they found their source elements, but this is a beautiful print, with only occasional minor flaws. The black and white photography is detailed and beautiful, allowing the best look we've had at the elaborate sets and interesting production design. Even Charles Farrell's voice, which is not ideal for his hyper-masculine role, is much improved on this newly restored print.

There is no commentary, but an impressive collection of still photos is included as an extra.

The film is still the stilted, downbeat, badly paced film it was before, but for "Carousel" aficionados, or fans of early talkies, this is a very interesting movie, which can now be experienced in a much more pleasurable manner. I would give the movie a 5-star rating, and the print 8 or 9. Amazingly good for its vintage!
