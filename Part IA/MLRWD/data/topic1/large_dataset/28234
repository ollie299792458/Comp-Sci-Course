I'm a female, and I love great movies, whether action, fantasy, sci-fi, or girly tearjerkers. This is a truly great movie, a genre-defining classic, meaning that in the years ahead, students will study it in film courses, and film festivals will give critical retrospectives, and people will ask "Why didn't this movie win the Oscar for Best Picture?" Just as people now appreciate "Night of the Hunter" and "Blade Runner" as visionary works of genius.

What could possibly be visionary in a picture that some call "reactionary", "slow", "throwback", etc.? Well, the attention to warm, realistic detail that creates a completely different, utterly absorbing world where even what cgi there is, is imperceptible. The film is breathtakingly beautiful - Real Beauty, not synthetic gamer aesthetics. The sea, the ships, the colors, even the battles are beautiful and terrible and exciting and heartbreaking. The film explores a male friendship in an intelligent and, yes, sensitive but subtle way. There are no cheap thrills, no throwaways, everything about this movie is golden. The music, the inspired casting, the costumes, the story, the ending, everything is perfection.
