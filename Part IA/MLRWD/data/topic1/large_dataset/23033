Having seen a multitude of horror films over the years this one remains the best.  Watching the DVD alone in the privacy of your home late at night will do more to frighten one than all of the slasher flicks combined.  The  film is not particularly scary, yet it will indeed send a subtle chill up  the spine.  
My favorite scene is when Hutter is in his room at Count  Orlock's castle when the clock strikes midnight. (and what a creepy looking  clock).  Hutter opens the door to his room to see Orlock(Nosferatu)  standing at the end of the hall.  Orlock slowly moves toward Hutter as  Hutter shuts the door to his room.  Hutter runs to the window only to see a  substantial dropoff to the raging river below.  At a loss of what to do  next, Hutter runs and gets under the sheets of his bed. Orlock enters the  room and the scene ends with Orlocks shadow (claws &amp; bat ears) looming  over Hutter's form cowering under the sheets.  No blood, flying limbs,  rolling heads, etc - but for my money an extremely chilling scene.  I also  liked the outtake of this scene in the Queen/Bowie video for Under  Pressure.
The whole film is such a great work of art and not just a  movie.  Most people weaned on slasher horror will probably not like this  film as it is more like an aged fine wine that is savored and not a cheap  Boones Farm drunk.
The director FW Murnau is for my vote the best  director of the silent era. (Hurry up and release Sunrise on DVD already!)  DW Griffith is generally considered the best director of the early cinema.  Murnau's work remains intriguing nearly eighty years later, while  Griffith's work seems dated.  Birth of a Nation and Intolerance are 2 of  the most boring films I have ever seen.
Nosferatu is a must have for any  serious collector of silent films or classic horror.
