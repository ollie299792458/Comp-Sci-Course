First of all, The Song Remains The Same is a cool film, with great music.  If you have never seen it, check out all of the other reviews here.  "No Quater" and "Since I've Been Loving You" are, in my opinion, superior to the LP versions.
BUT!
This is one of the (worst) DVD trasfers I have ever seen.
Except for the original trailer, there are no special features.  And the sound is HORRIBLE!  I REPEAT, HORRIBLE!  Anyone familar with the film knows that some of the editing is dubious at best.  Jump cutting around different performances within the same song.  After decades of watching the film you kinda got used to it.  Well, whenever there is an edit between performace footage in a song, the sound goes completly out of phase, and you're left with a thin, "flangy" sounding audio track.  It gets very annoying, and very mich in the way of the music.
I guess Jimmy Page wasn't consulted on this DVD reissue, much like he wasn't for the original CD reissues of the Zep catalouge.  The band hass always seemed keen to wash their hands of this project anyway.
My advice: Stick with the VHS.
