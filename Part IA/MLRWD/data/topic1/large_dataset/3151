Disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of the book so that's very likely to bias this review.

Okay, first of all, if you haven't read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345418972">Sphere</a>, read it first if you're interested in this movie. It's a fantastic book and a much better presentation of this story than the movie. If you watch the movie and then read the book, you're likely to enjoy the book much less. The movie is a great compliment to the book and adds some very good twists to the story.

The movie has a problem with pacing. It dives into the plot at the cost of potentially leaving the viewer confused and doesn't build up the suspense up front as much as it could. This is more to focus more time on the middle of the movie, but it loses some of the magic of the book.

Samuel L. Jackson and Dustin Hoffman both do a good job portraying their characters. Samuel L. Jackson especially nailed Harry and is possibly the best part of the movie adaptation. Liev Schreiber did a good job as Ted, but I was completely underwhelmed by Sharon Stone.

The sets and atmosphere were nicely done and the music supported it well, but on a whole, something seemed missing.

I highly recommend getting the book, reading it (possibly overnight) and then buying or renting this movie if you like the book.
