This is my favorite movie.  I didn't feel that it took the Holocaust lightly -- in fact, I found that this movie helped me understand the true impact of the holocaust in a way that a documentary or even a heart-wrenching movie like "Schindler's List" could not.  You are introduced, at length, to a wonderful little family that shares a deep and abiding love.  You become attached to the characters in a way that no other Holocaust movie, in my opinion, achieves.  The transition to the death camp is shocking.  And yet it underlines the amazing power of love -- facing unimaginable horrors, the Benigni character refuses defeat, and puts all of his soul and effort into saving his son, not only from death, but from the scarring knowledge of the hell that is all around him.  The father's love for his wife and son are truly inspiring.

It may be true that this is unrealistic... how does anyone know how they would act in such a situation?  But it is uplifting to believe that it is possible to defeat evil with love, even if one loses one's life in the process.
