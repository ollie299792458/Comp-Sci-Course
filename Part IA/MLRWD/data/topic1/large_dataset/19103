I started watching this film, about two men who regularly crashed weddings as a way of finding women longing for love to sleep with, with high expectations of comedy and entertainment.  The film fulfilled these only partly.

It was based on a cute concept.  Two adult men, who were still immature, unfeelingly deceived women as a way to get sex.  Then one of them falls for his target.

After one particularly high profile wedding - the marriage of the daughter of the Treasury Secretary, the two wedding crashers are invited to the home of the Secretary and his family for a weekend with his two daughters (both bridesmaids in the wedding).  This isn't a very realistic scenario, but viewers agree to suspend disbelief and continue on.  The Secretary's family is composed of strange characters, but again, the strangeness extends the borders of believability.  Through these wacky people, the wedding crashers learn about love and long-term relationships.

Overall, the comedy level and interest of the story rate just middling.  Not a bad movie, but nothing special either.
