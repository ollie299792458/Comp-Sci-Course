This is the movie that made a star of Humphrey Bogart; he previously played bad-guy characters, as in "Petrified Forest". He is the hero of this Dashiell Hammett novel about private detectives who take a missing persons case.  But it soon leads to murder, and the story tells how Sam Spade solves the case.  The story is set in San Francisco, where Hammett lived for many years, and is the location for many of his other stories.
The amoral adventuress is a stock character in many of his stories, but often higher in command.  Here the 'Fat Man' is plainly in control, and the others work for him.  This actor does a good job in showing this villain as a charming, suave, and sophisticated person (the better to mask his evil); only his obesity marks him out, like a "bloated plutocrat".
Like other Hammett stories, it subtly tells of the techniques used by private detectives.  Like ditching a tail by entering the front of an apartment house, then slipping out the back way.  Or watching out for anyone watching him.  Most of all, how he plays along with the people he meets in order to solve the crimes.  He displays a quick wit when the police arrive unexpectedly while he has company.  He needs all his wits to resolve the different stories he hears; and he triumphs in the end.  "A crooked reputation is good for business, it brings in the high-priced clients."  It has the usual surprise ending of a Hammett story.  The elevator gates say where Brigid is going, the shadow on her face tells her end.
One anachronism is the dollar figures: $100 then was about a month's pay for the average worker, if they had a job.  This story is like a morality play on the vanity of searching for a lost treasure of easy money.  This turns out to be an illusion caused by wishful thinking.  This story may very popular as it is less political than "Red Harvest" or "The Glass Key", where you have to consider the actions of the municipal government.
