I found this final series exciting and deeply satisfying. The previous two parts (Winds of War, and part one of this) called very strongly for completion, and that is what we have here... IN SPADES! I found the same wonderful sense of historical perspective that I noted in my review of part one... I felt I had got an overall grasp of the essentials of a very important and complex period, but also, that I had seen, spelled out in graphic detail, the results of the concentrated arrogance, stupidity, and self-indulgence that the Nazi ideal foisted on this suffering planet during that time. Nothing in my life so far had prepared me for the absolute horror revealed in this coverage... and nothing, I am sure, will ever allow me to forget it... which is really good. This lesson in the consequences of selfishness comes at an opportune time. The sections on Theresienstadt and Auschwitch, were particularly forceful - the sheer heartlessness and purposeful cruelty of those in charge will remain with all who see this, as a salutary moral beacon... dangerous reefs beneath the surface of our common human nature.
