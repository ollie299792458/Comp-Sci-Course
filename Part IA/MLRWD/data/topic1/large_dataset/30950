What can I say about Roseanne and this show that hasn't already been said. It was groundbreaking for its time but still endures today.

Roseanne and her family often had a lot of troubles and bad times just like anyone else at the time but even through it all they loved one another and were there for each other when it really counted.

I would have to easily count this among one of my favorite shows all time and am looking forward to getting more of the seasons.

While I wouldn't necessarily recommend younger kids watch the show because of some of the language and what not but I think it would be OK for PG13 and up. It could even be used with some kids as a springboard to discuss family issues, "growing up" topics, and even things such as depression.

I recommend that you find it on TV check it out and then buy the seasons because you wont want to miss an episode and they tend to play certain episodes more than others on TV.
