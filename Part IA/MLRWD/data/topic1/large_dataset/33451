...It is not very noticeable, but near the end of the film as Dr. Stanglove battles with his unruly arm while trying to suggest a possible remedy to the apocalyptic plight of the world, it can be seen that "Mr. Ambassador" starts cracking up in the background.  This occurs about the time when the arm starts propelling Strangelove's wheelchair in aimless directions.  There are many knee slapping moments aside from this one, in which Peter Seller's and the rest of the cast really shine.
  I do take issue with some of the other reviewers comments about the darkness of the humor.  To a large extent, I found  the humor was mostly situational, not unlike the legendary TV series Seinfield.  One moment in particular in which this is illustrated is when British officer Mandrake, having information that may well avoid a nuclear holocaust, has to argue with a dimwitted soldier over the shooting of a lock off a pop machine for the necessary change to call the President of the United States.  After losing patents, and berating the office with insults, the officer tells Mandrake, "OK, I'll shoot the lock off, but so help me, if you don't get the president of the united states on the line, your going to have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company."  As if in the throws of nuclear a potential nuclear war such a reality is of any importance.
  Admittedly the movie is about nuclear winter and therefore inherently dark, but I would argue that the topic is explored in the most pleasant way possible.
