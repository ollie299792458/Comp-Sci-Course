Schinlder's List is the only movie I have ever seen in a theater where everyone there didn't move during the movie and stayed through the credits. The movie is so moving and powerful words can't do it justice. Spielberg for all of his great movies: Jaws, Close Encounters, Raider's, ET ect. None compare with the masterpiece that is Schilder's List. Not even Saving Privite Ryan, while being as powerful, the movie doesn't hold together as well as Schinder's List. Spielberg threw his heart and soul in this movie and you can tell. The Holocaust is one of the most tragic events in human history, and no movie can ever relate the horror of what happened. But in Schindler's List Spielberg comes as close as one can. The film is shot in Poland on some of the actual sights the real events happened. The true story of how a German businessman/war profiteer saved over 1100 Jews in WWII. With great performances by Liam Leeson, Ben Kingsley and a truely horrifying performance by Ralph Fiennes. This movie tells a story of the power of the human spirit.
