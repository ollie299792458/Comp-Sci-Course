After not finding any Easter Season viewing this year on cable i.e. Jesus of Nazareth, The Greatest Story Ever Told, The Robe etc. I decided to add them to my library. I saw The Greatest Story Ever Told many years ago when it aired regularly. I've always liked it but this time after not seeing it through for many years I was quite surprised at the depth of the performances which are really quite remarkable. Max Von Sydow is amazing. There have been quibles about so many "stars" thrown into the movie as cameos. Who doesn't want to see the likes of Claude Rains, Charlton Heston, Telly Savalas, Sal Mineo, Jose Ferrer and Van Heflin just to name a few. While it is true that by todays action movie instant gratification standards it is a bit slow moving, it is well worth the savoring of the acting. The Lazarus scene is amazing. Max portrays the real human side of Christ and is stung by the harsh reprimand of not coming earlier to save his friends life. Van Heflin's witnessing of the event explains why the people who witnessed these miracles became apostles and martyrs. Needless to say I was very satisified with this movie and would highly recommend it.
