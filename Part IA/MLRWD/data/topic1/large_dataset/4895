Re- Hutzler review below*

 I have the identical problem on my dvd where the vision freezes temporarily and the sound drops out during the transition between chapters 1 & 2, yes v.annoying! Seems OK elsewhere.

 btw, being a "Special Ed." I would like to have seen some extended scenes, alt takes or deleted scenes, as I know many were filmed but were edited out. An opportunity lost..

 Reviewer: M. Hutzler "Film Fan" (Canada)

 I admit picture and sound are exemplary but could someone out

 there please clarify and or confirm a serious problem that I

 have with my disc. Immediately following the director's credit

 as the camera is moving out of the dark alleyway onto the busy

 downtown N.Y. street filled with traffic the picture stops or

 "pauses" for a few seconds before moving forward. Has anyone

 else encountered this problem? Help! please let me know as this

 is a major debit for this film fan!
