I've been a fan of this movie for years.  I've always felt this movie was a classic and that it was way ahead of it's time.
I already owned this title on DVD prior to this version coming out, but I pre-ordered it in the hopes that it would live up to it's expectations of being the most complete version ever released.
Well, it wasn't just more complete, it was almost completely different!  My eyes popped out and my jaw droppped as I saw this release for the first time.  I immediately removed the DVD and ran to my collection to play my older version and refresh my memory as to the quality of the original release.  The differences were incredible!
I always assumed that the older version was just an indication of the overall production quality of the theatrical release, compounded with the problems with long term storage and that there wouldn't be much of an improvement in quality.  All I expected were a few additional scenes and perhaps a slighly cleaner picture.  How wrong could I be!
The picture is extremely sharp.  It's hard to believe the earlier releases were from the same film.
For those of you who still own an older release, and are wondering if it's worth the expense of buying another release (and a more expensive one at that), BUY THIS DVD.  You will not believe it until you see it with your own eyes.  This is truly a top notch restoration.
