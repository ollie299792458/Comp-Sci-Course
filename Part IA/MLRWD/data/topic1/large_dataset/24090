Elf is simply one of the best holiday movies EVER. I put this one right up there with A Christmas Story, A Charlie Brown Christmas, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, the very programme to which Elf plays homage.

Will Ferrell is brillant as Buddy, the human orphan who found a home and love at the North Pole with Papa Elf, one of Santa's employees. When Buddy decides to return to New York City to find his birth father, hilarity ensues.

Elf has wonderfully funny goofy moments, poignant moments, disgustingly funny moments -- like when he eats the already-been-chewed gum from a subway railing -- and a few serious moments.

Zooey Deschanel is great as Buddy's love interest, and James Caan and Mary Steenburgen are solid as Buddy's father and stepmother.

Elf is an intelligent, endearing comedy suitable for the entire family. Just make sure your little ones know that cotton balls aren't food, and that no matter what Buddy says, syrup is not a food group.
