The Show wasn't the same when Bonet left. The first series was the best, some say she wasn't the greatest ever actress but she did capture the imagination as the naive but good hearted Denise Hustable. The show lost its shape abit when Lisa Bonet left and its edge in a way for me. Dwayne was at his best when he was the cool nerd who chased the girls on campus and had a thing for Bonet character, Whitney was great as the superficial bitch. Don't get me wrong I loved the episode when Dwayne gate crashed Whitney's wedding but I can't help but think the show would have been even better if Bonet never left. A love triangle between Denise, Dwayne and Whitney would have been great viewing. After she left only Freddie could get close to pulling off the A character.

Another aspect I liked about the show was the talented Marissa Tomei was in the series which gave the show a balance.

Anyway if you are pro and you like your shows to be instantly quirky this isn't for you. But if you are a true Romantic you like your shows to be centred around a character which focuses on the centred character passage through life with real depth this series is for you.
