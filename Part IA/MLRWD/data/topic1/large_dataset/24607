Ok though I can't find the actual version of this DVD on amazon.com that I own I'm going to warn you anyway..

So I am at the local pawn shop and I see a DVD titled GRAVEYARD TRAMPS and it's all colored with black and purple HOT TOPIC style fonts and a very attractive goth girl on the front standing in a graveyard.

Now don't get me wrong I knew I wasn't picking up a piece of cinematic gold.. but I did not get what I expected.. I expected a modern cheezy low budget film about maybe zombies or just psycho girls in a graveyard.. GOTH GIRLS in a graveyard.. as the cover art depicted..

I knew it would be low budget I knew it would be [...].. but oh well I have an addiction for sexy young goth women.

So I get home put the DVD in and to my dissapointment I have a 70's cheese fest about naked better homes and garden type housewives sexing men to death..

I have yet to watch it past the first ten minutes.. and that was pretty liquored up.. so I can't judge if this movie is good or not..

maybe I'll get comatose and make it through the whole thing..

I can say the visuals remind me of the original STEPFORD WIVES.

sooooo don't be fooled by stock photos and creepy goth cover art.. I guess that's the moral of this story!
