The use of humor throughout the film Life is Beautiful allows the movie to accurately represent the horrors of World War II without being dark. One could argue that the humor takes away from the seriousness, dignity, and respect with which the Holocaust should be portrayed. However, there already exists an abundance of humorless, depressing movies concerning the Holocaust and the Second World War. Also, the humor is not at the expense of the Jewish people, but rather the [...] ideals. In my favorite scene, in which the main character jumps up on the table in the school and showcases himself as an example of the racial purity of the Italians, the whole notion of racial purity is being made fun of, since he is in reality a Jewish person himself.
 I personally think that using comedy in this film was a great idea. The comedic aspect of this movie has helped it reach a much wider audience than the vast majority of Holocaust related movies. The fact that Life is Beautiful is relatively well-known in the United States is an achievement in and of itself, seeing as Americans tend to dislike having to read sub-titles and not be able to understand Italian. It would certainly be possible for a movie to go completely overboard, trying to make everything into a joke, which would have the effect of cheapening the war and the Holocaust. A movie that contains so many jokes that it approaches absurdity and completely neglects the trauma and horrors of the Holocaust would be offensive and very hurtful to those people who experienced the Holocaust first-hand.
