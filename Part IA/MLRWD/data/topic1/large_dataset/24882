The culture in Britain and America are not as Christian as they once were and so much is missed by many on the cultural life of the forties. People have forgotten, and it wasn't that long ago.

Celia Johnson's character, Laura, is not a bored housewife, but is a woman, who actually is an everyday housewife, who is quite committed to her family; yet has not experienced, something we deduce by the turn of events, the thrill of passionate love, which is quite different from the tragedy of Anna Karenina.

Trevor Howard's Alec takes the lead, but it is truly Johnson's character to whom the story belongs.

This movie is sublimely directed by David Lean, whose use of the charging train is quite powerful and symbolic. This movie is quite unique in how it is very moral, yet shows the nature of temptation in a very realistic and not stagey way or with guile, which most relational stories suffer from today. The passions are real and so is the struggle. It is so very honest.

Adding more depth is the way in which the story stays within the bounds but allows one to travel the experience. While those who are not interested in Christian morality may find it boring or riduculous in places; and, some, whose moral guidelines won't allow the peek - will miss the point. Although, I think the depth of acting and excellent writing and cinematography succeeds for all. It provides something for contemporary people that the story of Samson or David cannot.

For those who love soundtracks - the incidental music is Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto #2, with Eileen Joyce skillfully playing the piano and conducted by Muir Mathieson with the National Symphony Orchestra.

This movie is in my top ten best made movies. Highly recommended. Interestingly, it won the Grand Prize at Canne in 1946.

It fulfills precisely what John Gardner said is necessary in a story.
