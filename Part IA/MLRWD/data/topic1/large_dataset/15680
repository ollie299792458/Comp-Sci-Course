At last a horror movie without the boring hollywood formula!  I'm not going to say anything about the plot of this film.  Just buy it/rent it and watch it! Start watching it with an OPEN MIND, and without all those pre-conceived ideas of how a horror movie should always be portrayed.  This is a really good film with a magnetic central performance.  I whole heartedly agree with one other reviewer here, that (despite the brutality!) this is a subtle piece and you need to get in between the narrative.  Remember...horror can come in so many guises.  I read the last reviewer on this page (the one who refers to the rest of us as "nitwits")  Well I read a number of his previous reviews on other films...etc, and I wasn't surprised to find various profanities and the tedious over use of the word 'gore'.  He also wants to "smack us all".....please take note Amazon!  What a bore!  How can anyone take seriously the rantings of a 'jar head'  who can't even spell s**t, and thinks the sequel to Resident Evil was a good movie!  Watch 'THE LAST HORROR MOVIE', it's excellent.
