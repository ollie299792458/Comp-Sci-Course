This was a great set, and will make you look forward to set two which comes out in October.  In ranking Robin Hood's.  I would have to say, the adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn is first.  Robin of Sherwood is second.  Robin and Marion is third.  Robin Hood with Uma Thurman is fourth, and Robin Hood Prince of Thieves is dead last.
