The big advantage of this DVD issue is that there are two versions on the disc. If you prefer the theatrical wide-screen (letterbox) version, that is on one side of the disc, and the pan and scan version that fills the screen  is on the flip side. I have a big-screen monitor, but I prefer the  Academy  Aspect (1.33 to 1) pan and scan, which is actually done better than the  previous-released VHS version. The detail of the sets and the expressions  on the actors' faces are much easier to discern. On this disc, the choice  is yours. Every DVD should be issued this way until we all have widescreen  TVs!  
While others have made comments that the transfer to video was  poor, I would disagree. There are some artifacts, but the film transfer  quality is much better than the VHS version I purchased several years ago,  and is about the same as those used by cable movie channels. Considering  that the film is nearly fifty years old, this seems reasonable.
As for  the film itself, it is simply THE classic Sci-Fi film of the 1950's. It was  so original in so many ways, and still seems fresh and new.  It was one of  the first major-studio big-budget attempts at Science Fiction, and it  succeeds on every level.
If you are a sci-fi fan and do not own this  movie, it is a gilt-edged priority that you consider it.  If you own an  older VHS copy, the new DVD release is worth the investment.  You will  watch this again and again.
