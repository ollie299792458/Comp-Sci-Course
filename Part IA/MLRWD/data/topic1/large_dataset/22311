This film thrives on characters played perfectly by the foppish, bumbling Hugh Grant, the regal (and sardonic) Kristin Scott Thomas, and the very American and open Andie Macdowell. Everyone shines, but not any brighter than the scene in which they are written.

The singletons are all secretly on the lookout for the person with whom to finally share their own vows. Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas) is stoically in love with Charlie (Hugh Grant) throughout the film, although it is clear from the start he is meant to be with Carrie (Andie Macdowell) even if he doesn't follow-up with her after their one-night stand and even if their chemistry seems a bit questionable. I find Macdowell cute and pretty and sometimes witty, but rarely sexy.

The wedding bits are usually hysterically funny especially with Rowan Atkinson as the priest, but it's the funeral scene that always compels me to watch this again.

The recitation of W.H. Auden's Funeral Blues, complete and quietly, except for a few sniffles, is perhaps one of my top ten favorite poignant scenes in any movie.
