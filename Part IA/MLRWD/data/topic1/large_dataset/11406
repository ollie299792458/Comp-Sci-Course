Jane Monheit has one of the greatest voices of our time. She was schooled in music theory, among other things, at the renowned  Manhattan School of Music. Under the guidance of eminent vocal instructor Peter Eldridge she has achieved total command of the  brilliant instrument that is her voice. Through many ranges and moods she will take you on a musical journey that will make you appreciate our good fortune in being able to enjoy the delight of hearing great music done well. The accomplished musicians who accompany her are some of the best in the business and it shows not only in their ability to 'Bring It', but in the way that they support Jane and let her 'Fly'. Just ask those guys if Jane is a prodigy! This is not Acid Jazz. Jane Monheit sings songs the way they should be sung. The way most of us want to hear them. You may fall in love with an old tune or hear something very satisfying that you've never heard before. But you will, most likely, fall in love with Jane Monheit's voice and think of a dozen songs that you wish she would put on her next album. Songs come alive when Jane sings them with a sincere feeling that is rarely witnessed these days. She lives the song. She captures the essence of it. And she truly appreciates her audience and loves what she does. And don't be fooled by her older 'Performing' appearance as she wows the famed Rainbow Room. This is a young girl and you can see the real fresh faced Jane as she rehearses in the 'making of' segment which is also offered on the DVD. You will also hear heartfelt praise by legendary musicians who are shocked at her knowledge of music and repertoire of songs. Many think that Jane Monheit is important to Jazz. I think she may be important to Music. I read one review that said Jane Monheit was just another Linda Rondstadt. Believe me when I tell you that Linda Ronstadt wishes she could sing like Jane Monheit. Just ask her!
