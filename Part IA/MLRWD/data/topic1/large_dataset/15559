No, this isn't a review about Porky's XV or its ilk. Yet, Casino Jack is as infantile as any "17-year-olds-try-to-get-some" flick out there.  Reading newspapers or watching TV News (infrequently) I tell myself  that media liberals can't possibly be as ignorant as they appear about basic aspects of American life - politics, economics, business, social policy.  Then they make a movie like Casino Jack, a crass vehicle for the mainstream liberal world view, shouted unapologetically and fervently. The result is truly scary.  I'm not referring to the caricatured conservatives we're supposed to fear -- racist, homophobic, drunk, insensitive, greedy, hypocritical, stupid (Ronald Reagan, as "everyone" knows),and corrupt-- mind you, but rather the ignorance/arrogance one-two on which this flimsy script is built.
Lobbyists are pushy and aggressive? Oh my! Some (or many) are corrupt? Heavens! All Republicans dream of turning a family out into the cold in the middle of the night?  Of course!
Frankly, yawn.
This dog lurches from stereotype to stereotype, without any pretense of originality or creativity.  Wait,I take that back: The corageous granny-bespectacled, fast-talking, all-knowing, Lenin-bearded Washington Post reporter is also... a haemophiliac!  Didn't see THAT coming.  Must have been SOME writer's meeting that day.
Any-hoo, I didn't get much beyond the part when bad conservative drunk white guy punches the reporter (he'd only been on screen 15 seconds and I wanted to punch him too), so the review ends here.  What's the point of writing a lot of words to advise against wasting your time on, as my fifteen year old would pithily put it, "Casino Crap"?
