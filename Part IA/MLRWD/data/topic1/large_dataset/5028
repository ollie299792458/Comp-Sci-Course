This would have to be the worst music DVD i have ever seen.
First i am a huge Paul McCartney fan & after he pulled the plug on his Australian tour i wanted to see what the US has been enjoying.The problem is that this DVD is so bad that it leaves you with the thought that Paul McCartney has got a serious ego problem & that he is so intoxicated with himself, it will make you throw up.
You may ask why?.Watching this DVD & you can see McCartney is the best Beatles tribute band around (certainley the most
expensive one),he is living off past glories & if you are a fan of his solo stuff you better look elsewhere. 
The problem is with Paul's tours it does not matter if you miss a tour as he will perform the same songs tour after tour.Once again on this DVD we have Yesterday,Let it Be,The Long & Wind ing Road so on & so on.He even does the same songs in soundchecks that he has been doing since 1989.
As people have mentioned the DVD is poorly put together.The concert is not the full show,songs are edited (We can work it out,Something,My Love) & are out of sequence.The picture qaulity is bad VHS & is in Pan & Scan,the sound is also flat & does not have any clarity to it.In between songs you have footage of stupid fans who should know better,saying how much they love Paul YAWN!.Also spaced out in between songs we have Paul being Paul (which is laughing at his own jokes,making sure he has all his hangers on around so they laugh with him,this is so Elvis it is scary).As well as songs being edited some of the songs have talking through them or in Hey Jude's case come on around the second verse.When you do get a complete song the camera angles switch so fast it is hard to know what is going on.As well during songs you have alot of audience reaction shots so you get to see more people making fools of themselves GREAT!.
All in all this makes for a very bad concert film.Paul McCartney should know better or people around him should.There are plenty of concert DVD's around & many production companies to do them it is not that hard.It obviously was in this case.
