First of all, I'd like to address the fact that this movie's target demographic was never, EVER intended to be small children. The show's creator and the movie's director, Craig McCracken, has himself said this on several occaisions. Yes, it was advertised in such a manner, but it wasn't Cartoon Network that supervised how the movie's promotion was conducted. Just thought I'd clear that up for the mother who posted a few reviews below me as well as anyone else who might be considering bringing their child to see the film.
Anyways, being a huge fan of the series for quite some time, I was really looking forward to this movie's release. I saw it as early as I could on the day of its premier, and I can't say that I was at all dissapointed. The movie, like the show, is chock full of media/pop culture references (one scene almost entirely composed of Van Halen references, and the scores of Planet of the Apes refs should be easy to spot towards the second half of the movie) and punny humor, most of which the little ones probably won't be able to pick up on. At the same time, though, there was a nice element of seriousness to some parts of the movie that would never be found in the series. 
Lots of people would enjoy this film, and if you haven't already seen it, I really suggest you go and do so. It may not change your life, but it's certainly entertaining.
