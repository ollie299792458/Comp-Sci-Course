It's a snowy Christmas night in the nation's capitol, one year after the terrorist attack of Nakitomi Plaza in L.A.  New York detective John McClane (Bruce Willis), the terrorist attack's underdog police hero, is there at an  airport to wait for his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) to arrive from her  flight.  But when military terrorists, led by the unmerciful Colonel Stuart  (William Sadler), seize the terminal and start to take over, McClane faces  the nightmare of his past in this new emergency as he slips into top gear  in a daring attempt to save the terminal and his air-born wife trapped in a  doomed airplane.  Provides the same suspenseful action-packed adventure  from the original, and a worthy sequel to that awesome thriller.  Also  stars Reginald VelJohnson (original "Die Hard", "Family  Matters" T.V. series) as McClane's old friend from L.A.  This specific  film, unlike the original and the third episode directed by John McTiernan,  was directed by Renny Harlin, who also directed "The Long Kiss  Goodnight" (starred his now ex-wife Geena Davis), "Captiva  Island" (starred his now ex-wive Geena Davis), "Cliffhanger"  (starred super-action star Sylvester Stallone), and the genetically  engineered shark horror tale "Deep Blue Sea", just recently  released in 1999.
