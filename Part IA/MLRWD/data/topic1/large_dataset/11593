I caught this movie a few times on the Disney Channel, and I thought the whole plot was clever and appropriate for kids.  It does not make a lot of sense, but that is the whole point, isn't it?  Dreams are not supposed to be sensible, but the story itself propels through out the film.  Thus, creating an adventure where kids discover what really goes inside their minds at night.

Now, for the acting.  George Lopez is hilarious as he is in many of his films, and him as an electric outlet to match his name was nearly genius.  He makes me laugh nearly all the time, and I thought he pushed his comidian persona a little bit farther in this.  That is what gave the film its spark.

Taylor Lautner:  First major film role, and he definately nailed it as Sharkboy.  He is funny, and a little mean, but that is what made it good.  The thing that I observed about Lautner in this is that he is suppoosed to be ten in the film, but I can tell that he is maturing, and looks older then what he is supposed to be.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed him play the part.

Camdyn Boyd:  I have to admit that although he is a cute kid(I meant that in a obsevation sense, not the other way), he was kind of annoying to me in the film.  Usually got on the friends nerves, but how he came up with the whole dream sequencw is really smart.  I just wish he did less whining, then it would have been better.

Taylor Dooley:  She is very pretty, but like Lautner, looks older then the part.  She played the role of Lavagirl quite well, and her ability to show the right emotions ruled out. However, she and Lautner worked really well together, and hope that erases the 'icky' thought of a boy having a girl best friend.

So, if you want to have a fun family movie night, this one should be a plus.  Lots of action, but no violence, and fits most age gaps.
