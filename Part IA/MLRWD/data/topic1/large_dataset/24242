This is a great drama.  Portraying human interactions in a plausible fashion, sort of like an independent movie.  Some short, possibly deep, statements about God and existence made by characters within the movie.  The conversations which fall into the conceivably deep existentialism catergory are mainly one sided.  Edward Norton as the Stoner, at one point makes an overly complicated statement, which could have much easier been said - God represents the unattainable.  That's about how deep they get.  The attempts at comedy fall flat on their face.  Situational comedy doesn't work so well when the situation is all to predictable and plausible as something which commonly happens in real life.  I would say that the parts of this movie some are calling funny serve mainly to lighten things up. So that the movie doesn't seem too serious.  Richard Dreyfus, in a small role, is the only funny person in the movie.  He made me actually laugh out loud one time, throughout the movie.  Then again, baking might be the condition one is meant to watch this movie in.
