Linus Roache gives a commendable, even accomplished, performance as the "Priest" torn asunder by his need for faith and his need to fulfill his fleshly desires.  The film moves at an even pace and is done tastefully.  The movie poignantly shows both the burdens of faith and the burdens of the flesh.  When the title character, in a pivotal scene, refuses to administer the eucharist to one of his "partners", the paradox becomes conundrum.  Even though the motivation behind this action appears immediate, I fully suggest watching this scene alone three or four times; only then will Linus Roaches' perfomance show the true nuance of subtle understanding which the actor seems to bring to the character.  This movie is worth owning for several reasons, not the least of which is its underlying tenet of truth.  But, issues such as religion, faith, spirituality are fluent concepts that everyone comes to their personal terms with through thIer own personal experiences.  This film encourages the audience to be challenged by the content and subject matter without truly passing harsh judgements. (The characters may judge themselves and each others' actions, but the tone of the film is more ambiguous.)  Go on, challenge yourself; and do it more than once.
