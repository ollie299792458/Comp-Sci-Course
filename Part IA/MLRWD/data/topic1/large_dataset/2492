I love having the ability to rent cheap movies through Amazon. There has been absolutely nothing on tv and we have all channels possible through DTV.  Totally bored I checked Amazon for some cheap movie to entertain me.  Reviews were decent on this and the price was right.  Starting out I tend to agree with the 1 & 2 star ratings but the more I watched it the better I liked it.  You have to realize these are 'young people' not survivalists.  They don't think about zipping jackets or to jump from a distance & try landing on your back instead of your legs.  These are just young people out for a good time and are immature not thinking about any consequences for their actions.  It has slow parts but I do recommend this movie if you can rent it cheap and just can't find anything else to watch.  It may be a little too graphic for some in places but not gorey.  Just shows details of injuries which those who are very squimish may want to close their eyes in parts.  It's not very original but nowadays what movies are?  If you watch the movie with the concept that these are immature young people and not 'survivalists' then I think you'll get more out of it.

I'm rating it 3 as in my opinion it's an average movie.  Not extraordinary but not a total waste of time either.
