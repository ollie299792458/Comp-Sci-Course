I have mixed emotions towards this film.  It is quite unique as it is not really part of the Bond series, yet it still is.  It was produced by the company that had the copyright of the script but not the movie series so it lacks the traditional Bond theme and it was released the same year as Octapussy and they competed against each other.

This was also Connery's last perfomance as James Bond and lathough he is nowhere close to his originla 60's perfomances he is way better than Roger Moore.  The script is a remake of Thunderball but not as good as the original and it does have some flat points.

If one judges this film with today's standarts then the film is quite weak- however if you judge it with the rivals of its time then this film does have merit.  Klaus Maria Brandauer is a wondeful villain but on the other hand Kim Basinger perfomance is rather poor.

All in all this film is worth seeing if you are a Bond fun but do not have high expectations and that way you will enjoy it
