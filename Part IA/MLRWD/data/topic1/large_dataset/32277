Sure I'm biased; been a fan for many years. But this is a great live recording. I wished there had been some songs after the Antenna ablum on here, but still, this is a good "hits" concert. The band is really tight, and the music sounds clear. Hint: the louder you play it on your TV (without distorting it), the better it sounds. This is both for die hard fanz and for those who recall mainly the hits of ZZ Top and like them.

La Grange, although it's been played over and over is probably the high-light. In the middle of the song they switch modes and go into the rockabilly tune BBQ for a bit!

A plus about the concert is that the 80s stuff is probably only a quarter of what's on it (Sharped Dressed Man is done wonderfully). Some very good stuff before the 80s songs is played. Rather jammed. This is a very blues-based rock live performance with great camera work. Be prepared to have your head a swingin. Pincushion is a welcomed blessing too. You really get into this; it is almost mesmerizing.
