The 'surprise' ending to this movie is, to anyone who has read Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge, visible coming a mile off.  But that's okay, because the real surprises in this film, the terrors and mysteries and jewels of  meaning, go far beyond simply determing the time of a character's death.  Like 'Barton Fink', this is a movie that you can watch over and over,  extracting layer after layer of meaning.  Indeed, it really needs to be  watched at least twice, in order to put some events near the beginning in  of the film in their proper context.
Some thoughts to ponder:  Why does  the movie change its opinion about Sarah's love for Jacob? What separates  one of the children's names from the other?  And why does Jezzie not like  Biblical names?
Why is the bike that causes Jacob to call out Gabriel's  name adult-sized?  Why does the chemist who supposedly created 'The Ladder'  save only Jacob?  Why does he look like Jacob - but not exactly?
And if  the devils are really angels, what are the angels, really?
