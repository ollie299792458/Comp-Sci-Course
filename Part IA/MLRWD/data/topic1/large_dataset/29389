Any fan of Michael Mann's films knows he is a master storyteller
who combines great cinematic visuals with strong characters. Without ever have seen one of his films, you can look at 30 seconds of a scene and see a signature style. "Heat" delivers on all levels. Great insight to the relentless pursuit of goals on both sides of the law. It's one of the first films I found myself rooting for both the good guy and the bad! I do disagree on one point that everyone seems to applaud. That two of Hollywood's best actors appear together in one movie. I challenge anyone to find me a scene in the movie where DeNiro and Pacino actually appear together. The restaurant? I see the back of a head when Pacino/Deniro are talking. The end? I still don't see the two of them together. Brilliant editing and great stand-ins, but I doubt these two were ever together on screen. That's just my opinion, I could be wrong. I recommend this movie highly to anyone who has not seen it. This is how movies should be done. A Brilliant Michael Mann Film!
