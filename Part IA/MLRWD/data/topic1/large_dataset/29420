Previously I owned the laserdisc version of this film, and was impressed by the quality of the image and sound of that disc. The film itself is nice entertainment, with Arnold Schwarzenegger in good shape. Visually and  technically this film is very good, filled with all kind of technical  gadgets. There has been paid much attention to the quality of camerawork  and imaging. Also, there are some nice sfx, especially in the scene where  they have to cope with a few alligators broken loose from their cages.  Playing the DVD did please me much, for it's quality is a bit better than  the laserdisc I mentioned before. Image quality is very sharp en steady in  color reproduction, which cannot be stated for every DVD production, as I  know from experience. The DVD sound is impressive, with great clarity in  the whole sound image and a nice output in the lowest frequencies, when  needed. If you like Schwarzenegger action-movies you probably should own  this one, but since the disc is exemplatory in quality, you might want to  own it anyway and add it to your action genre collection. A great disc!
