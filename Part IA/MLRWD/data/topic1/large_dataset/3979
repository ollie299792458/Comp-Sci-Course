i can't believe all the reviews i've read saying that the DPS is nonsensical tripe. It must be one of the best movies i've ever seen.  Each time, it gets better.  The "villains" (admin, parents, . . .)  are not one-dimensional.  The script explains their motivations and actions  clearly without diverting the story away from the students. The students  themselves provide some of the best young acting in recent years.  They  each progress throughout the movie, and you can't say you don't know at  least one person who resembles one of the boys.  I'll admit the Robin  Williams character seems unfinished, but his screen presence and his  simple, profound words and actions make him a perfect mentor for the kids.  he serves the story well as a supporting character, not the main character.  we see enough of his life to feel as if we know him, and it isn't as if we  expect his character to candidly spill his life's recollections to his  students.  We expect him to guide them, to teach them.  
Finally, to  those who don't care about the character who commits suicide, I can't  believe you wouldn't feel anything.  To me, he was the embodiment of the  story, and very few singular moments in a movie have hit me as much as that  one.  It's what i remember the most from DPS, and it is the most important  scene we see.
