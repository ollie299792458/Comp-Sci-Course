Well, the story is simple.  Robin of Locksley returns from the crusades to find the Sheriff has mismanaged the King's lands.  With help from characters like Little John, Will Scarlett, Marian, Hazim (sp?) he "robs from the rich and gives to the poor."  The scenery is beautiful and there are some funny parts.  Liked the movie alot.

Special extended disk has a featurette, the Bryan Adams music video for the theme song, and interviews with main cast members.  If you are into this type of thing it's ok.  The featurette appears to be made around the time that the movie itself was made.  Contains a few interesting facts but nothing super special.  A young Pierce Brosnan narrates it, and is kind of cheesey and entertaining in itself.  There is also a behind the scenes section, which is disappointing.  It contains four topics of subjects for you to READ about.  In the whole special features part they never address why Kevin Costner never used an English accent, which to me did not at all affect my enjoyment of the film but none the less should have been explained (I suspect he just couldn't pull it off convincingly).

If you have not seen the film, it is in my opinion a great version of Robin Hood.  The special disk, in my opinion is always worth owning but in this case should have been done much better than it was.
