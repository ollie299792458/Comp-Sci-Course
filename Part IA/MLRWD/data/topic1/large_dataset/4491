George Stevens masterpiece is, for me, the best of all the Biblical epics.  It takes dramatic license in setting the scripture and the events, but it does so in a very peaceful and profound manner.  The script is very well written, presenting scripture in a poetic, dramatic manner and the musical score is superb.  Biblical scholars disagree over the meaning of the Matthew 16:18 passage "on this rock I will build my church"  - here seemingly presented to refer to Peter himself as the rock when the true meaning and most accurate translation would appear to be that the statement of Peter - that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God - is the rock or foundation on which the church is built.  The cast of this film is very large, with cameo roles from many of the major stars of the day.  Max von Sydow is an exceptional actor who captures the loving, caring spirit of Jesus.  The location, including the four corners region of the US, is a striking background for the story of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ.
