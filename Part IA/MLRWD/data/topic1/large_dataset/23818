The plot is oscar-worthy, the characters are detailed and well-developed, the special-effects are up with with the likes of Avatar, and theres duck tits! need i say more?

A fantast- or, should I say, QUACK-tastic film of the 1980s. Howard lives in a different world, where ducks are human-like and dominate the planet. one day, he is suddenly transported to the planet... EARTH!

hilarity, intrigue, and suspense ensue!

join howy, his rockin' love-interest, there nerdy friend, and a whole lot more as this film will take you for a WIIIILD ride!

what caused Howard to get there to the planet Earth? Why is he on the planet Earth? Will Beverly and her band get the break they need?

find all this out AND MORE as you tune into Howard the Duck!

and, not only is this movie quack-tastic, but theres extras!

yes, for a film many people didn't like, the studio was nice enough to give us a few extras!

sadly no commentary, but what you get is plenty to satisfy any fan of the motion-picture. just go up top and look at the picture to the back-cover provided!

some fun stuff.

so, if your lookin' for a good sci-fi movie, check this baby out!

if your lookin' for a good FAMILY sci-fi movie, may wanna stay away. like i said, theres duck tits. also, howard smokes cigars and drinks. not too much, but he certainly ain't no Donald duck for the children. may wanna watch the film first, then cover the little ones eyes when certain parts comes up that may be a bit too much for them.

a must-buy for sure!
