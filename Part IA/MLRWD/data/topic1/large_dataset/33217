Would Amazon be so kind as to offer negative stars?  Having reviewed the "novel"  (actually a poorly written novelization of the movie script) a few weeks back, I decided to rent the movie on cable.  First of all, not a single scene after the first twenty minutes or so (the Soviet and German combat) was even remotely plausable. Hannibal is able to  track down and kill the killers of his sister because one of them just happens to be an intelligence officer in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic  who just happens to be alerted that Hannibal is in Lithuania, and who just happens to find Hannibal on the grounds of his family's estate- Hannibal somehow manages to walk freely around all kinds of interesting area in the Police State of the Soviet Union.  At just the right moment the intelligence officer finds and tries to kill Hannibal. A minute earlier or a minute later and we probably have no movie (which would have been preferred).  Guess what- it gets worse!  Every character- except maybe the police inspector in France and possibly Lady Murasaki- is as one dimensional as the ideal line segment.  I could go on and on but I will just say this: Thomas Harris used to be a very good writer.  Black Sunday, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were all very good novels. Everything following is cartoonish nonsense. He must be laughing all the way to the bank- he gets millions of dollars for two "novels" and "screenplays" about Hannibal Lector that are better suited to for the world of manga- bad manga at that. Scary? It was a joke. What kept me "interested" is waiting to see if it could possibly get worse- it does! It continues to get worse!  I think this movie couldn't have been worse if i the dialogue was in Tibetan and the subtitles were in ancient Sumerian....
