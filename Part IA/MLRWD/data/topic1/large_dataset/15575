Bereavement is a horror film that seems to be a combination of "Frailty" meets "Psycho" with a twist of "Texas Chain Saw Massacre". This movie starts out with the dark stranger trolling the neighborhood for children when he abducts young Martin Bristol. We soon find out the stranger is a serial killer that loves to butcher and murder young women because he is being driven or possessed by the ghost of his late father.  The child has an illness that thankful causes him to feel no pain. While the serial killer continues his reign of terror over the years the young boy stands by in terror to witness these horrific crimes. Allison is a young woman who has recently lost both of her parents and she comes to the small town to stay with her uncle and his family. While Allison is exploring the new town she meets a handsome young man named William. Allison is trying to get use to everything and she soon becomes intrigued by the empty slaughter house she jogs by and wonders who is the young boy she keeps seeing in the window.  This movie has a great plot that quickly draws you in but the delivery gets lost along the way somewhere. I think that the ending leaves a lot to be desired so I was happy when I found out this movie was a prequel to Malevolence and I can't wait to watch that to see how it all ties in. Good job Steven Mena, I think with a slightly bigger budget this could become a really successful franchise.
