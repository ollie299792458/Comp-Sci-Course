So I never thought I would read so many negative reviews about this movie. It seem's that there are a lot of "know it all's" that have seen this movie. However I doubt that even they didnt gain some bit of unknown knowledge from this flick.

Anyway, this film will definately confirm a lot of what you already think about fast food and it will also throw in some surprising new info.

If over half of American society is obese then it would be safe to assume that most of them eat fast food enough times a week to warrant the health problems that Morgan Spurlock endures. Many, many people eat fast food on a regular basis even though they know they shouldnt. Not until recently has McDonalds tried to market themselves as "healty". Now they have the "go active happy meal" and plenty of young, hip, thin, active looking people in their commercials.

What I find most interesting and revolting about this movie is the state that our school nutrition is in. It seems that school's have let junk food take control of the lunchroom and get rid of physcial education.

Most people know or say that will power and personal responsibility is what is most important. But in a society where eating healthy is not as accessible or affordable as eating quick and tasty then you have a problem.

Watching this film will get you talking and help to open your eyes that we need to do something fast.Our school's need a big turn around as do our marketing and accessibility of healthy low priced nutritious food.
