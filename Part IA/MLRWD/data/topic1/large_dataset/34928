Having read the book as a boy, I have tried in vain to view the various Metropolis's out there and make some connection to the book I had read.
Finally, I understand.  I have never seen the movie the way it was intended!
The best part of this version is all the restored scenes!  Granted, not all are even available any more, but I can finally follow the book.
The second best part is the score!  What a great piece of music which was actually written for the film.  In fact, much of the success of the restoration is due to the score, since the detailed cues and scene descriptions in the score gave the restorers a perfect, original overview upon which to base their work.
Last, but not least, the picture quality is miraculous.  Watching the featurette concerning the restoration showed what meticulous care went into it.  And it shows!  Crisp Clear better- than-your-average-`50s movie with great care to retain the depth of the animated portions - while maintaining consistency throughout.
Kudos and Thank You for finally making the film come back to life!
