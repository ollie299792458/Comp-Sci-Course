If you are expecting this to be a simple spy vs spy plot, forget about it. Oh yes, it has spies galore, but this hilarious sendup of all things "Spy" must have inspired comedic authors galore. Every time I watch it I catch another sly pun or comment that cracks me up. This movie is very clever and every actor is hilarious in this all-star cast, from David Niven (as the Original, retired James Bond) to his wily and troublesome nephew, Jimmy Bond, played to perfection by Woody Allen. Deborah Kerr plays Mimi, villainess turned nun for her love of Sir James. ("Doodle me, Jamey!") Peter Sellers has fun with many costume changes but does not play the bumbler; rather, he is an expert in Bacarat standing in for 007 to help beat one of the bad guys (played hilariously by Orson Wells) and assisted by the fabulously beaded and feathered Ursula Andress!
The sets are those of dreams and nightmares, with plenty of the mod patterns of the 60's when this movie was produced. If you love off the wall comedy, this one is a keeper. But watch it closely; the jokes range from subtle and dry to outright silly puns and the confusion created is deliberate and fun. Watch for cameos by Peter O'Toole, Humphrey Bogart and many more.
