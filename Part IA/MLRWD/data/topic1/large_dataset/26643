There are two major flaws with this "Casanova." One: it seems to have been made a bit on the cheap. I disagree with reviews that say this film is a "sumptuous visual treat." It has nice costumes. but what might have been lush Venetian scenes (had they actually gone to Venice),  instead looks like it was filmed mostly indoors on some abandoned stage set from a production of  "The Merchant of Venice." (Contrast this film with the Venice scenes in the old televised "Brideshead Revisited" and you'll see what I mean. I know the budgets aren't comparable but, well, it shows.) Two: This young Casanova is not a seducer at all, but merely a foolish innocent who, for some reason, women keep falling for and imposing their wills upon, rather than the other way around. He reminds me more of Davy Jones of the Monkees than of any Italian master of the arts of love. I mean, he's cute, but *Casanova*? This guy could never even have grown up to be Peter O'Toole. (Meanwhile he keeps babbling about an old friendship with the Pope, which is never explained or verified.) True, the film is light and breezy and enjoyable enough as light comic diversion, with a bit of true love drama thrown in for good measure, but I was not especially impressed by this one; Casanova is supposed to be a great romancer, not an extra from "A Hard Day's Night."
