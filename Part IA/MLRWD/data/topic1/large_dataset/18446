There is not big secret to the plot of this movie. You have seen it before, in movies like Major League, but the comedy in this movie is second to none. 
Amidst a players strike the Washington Sentinels hire replacement players and coaches to finish the season. With only three more wins the Sentinels can make the playoffs. Enter Gene Hackman. He is the maverick coach that brings in the most unlikely group of players the league has ever seen. In just a few weeks he works his magic and tries to transform this group of losers into a winning team. Hackman is probably to greatest actor on the planet, and he proves why in this movie. He takes an ordinary script with average dialogue and delivers it in such a way to make you feel and believe what he is saying. Keanu Reeves is the "Never Was" quarterback who does his best to lead the team to victory, and along the way falls in love with the head cheerleader. Along the way he has to deal with angry striking players, and a bevy of nuts that have given up their day jobs to play professional football. The group includes an insane S.W.A.T. cop, a felon on work release, a Sumo wrestler, two professional body guards, and the fastest grocery clerk on the planet played brilliantly by Orlando Jones (the 7UP guy). 
The action is well paced and the football sequences look real enough to please the avid football fan. Veteran announcers John Madden and Pat Summerall lend their talents to the film and give that added touch of realism. Hackman is the consummate wise old coach, and Reeves gives a passable performance as the struggling quarterback. Even the romantic scenes are well written and evenly placed within the film, but the real star of this movie is the in your face slapstick, side splitting humor peppered throughout the film. From the cheerleader tryouts to the dancing huddle you will be laughing from start to finish.
