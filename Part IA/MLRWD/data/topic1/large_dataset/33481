First off....Mark Carlin needs to know what he's talking about before opening his mouth.  there is nothing wrong with the "Rabin era of Yes"....Altho Trevor did alot of writing...many of his songs were rejected because they just didn't "fit" the style the band was wanting to convey.  If anyone is familier with Trevors solo cd "90124" it contains his versions of the songs he provided during his tenure with Yes.  By no means were these guys a "tired lot" as Mr Carlin called them....

In my opinion, these songs fit the Yes style very well and segwayed them into the 80s nicely.  They were given the gentle nudge they needed....Obviously they took thehint well.....seeing as they are still going strong...Thru the 90s and well into the millenium.

I really love the fact they boosted the output to where it needed to be and they also give you the option of turning off the video effects that were present on the original version....It's great to actually WATCH the band perform...withOUT all the added effects....I dont know what they were thinking the first time around.

The audio and visual quality is simply superb....and a definite MUST for any YES fan.....
