'Tough Choices' seems to be the basic mantra constantly resounding throughout this film, as well as the urging for the American people to 'bite the bullet' and 'learning to do without' and 'holding our representatives accountable', etc., etc. Gee, and to bring world-wide peace to the world, all we have to do is love one another.
Duh...
For me, the only truly informative result I got from this movie was the animated charts and such which helped sum up the basic gist of it all. I, too could have done without the "roadshow" subplot, as one critic aptly put it.
At times, the makers of this film seem to be trying too hard to appear 'objective'. I would have liked a bit more of a hard-hitting evaluation of the specific policies responsible for the economic debacle we find ourselves in today. I would also have liked a bit more depth put into conveying the whys and wherefores of these policies.
Above all, I would have liked a bit more of a specific idea of what needs to be done; should we totally get rid of social security, or drastically reduce its outlays when the baby boomers come to collect? Should we ask the baby-boomers to commit suicide before they reach 65 so as not to unload such a burden on those who will have to pay for their upkeep. Should we forget about overhauling the highways, mass trans, and other infrastructure applications?
And why is most of this belt-tightening to be borne by the average Joe Shmoe? What about the military? What about the space program? What about all those subsidies that the oil, auto and factory farm conglomerates rake in by all of us suckers?
The makers of this movie sound the economic alarm relentlessly. Yes, something needs to be done but their badgering, after a while, start to sound a bit too insensitive, too dismissive of the actual consequences that will surely come about when we, the people, have to do "what's necessary."
