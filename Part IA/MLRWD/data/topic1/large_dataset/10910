Luckily, most HP fans read the books, because you would be mislead and lost here trying to figure out the story, present--and most importantly, for the future of the series.

Some changes were just stupid, not paralyzing Harry during the climatic scene, for example.  Some make a certain kind of sense, not having the Hogwarts battle in this movie, saving it for the great finale in the last book (movie) and perhaps that is why they added the Burrows fight.  I didn't really mind the Burrows fight for that reason, since it was consistent with the tone of the book, but allowed the BIG Hogwart's fight that is coming to (perhaps) have more of an impact.

Others have detailed the other horrid omissions, so I won't recap them all here.  One that REALLY bugged me was not having the Snape, "DON'T CALL ME A COWARD!" Harry scene.

They should have also explained the constant dreary foggy look of the movie, at least a throw away comment from a muggle, or about muggles not understanding the weather.  Hogwarts has always been able to control it's internal weather though, and a few sharp, clearly photographed, colorful scenes would have been a RELIEF to see once or twice during this visually dull movie.

WAY too much Quiddich!  It's never worth sacrificing story for that crap--and this director did.

Pretty disappointing, but I am FURIOUS that those with DVD players don't get to see the extras!  THAT is marketing at it's worst, and it is infuriating.
