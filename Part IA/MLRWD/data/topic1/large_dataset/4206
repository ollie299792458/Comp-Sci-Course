This is a great movie. Iwo Jima was one of the bloodiest battles ever fought by U.S. forces. This movie shows the battle from the Japanese side. It shows the deprivations & suffering the soldiers suffered way before the invasion. It also takes us through the battle as the Japanese fought & died. Two parts of it struk me. The scenes were a wounded US Marine is brought into the cave network & is given what little medical care the Japanese had. There a Japanese officer talks with him about life in the states & the marine talks with him about his family & vice versa. Eventually the marine dies of his wounds. The other scene is where a couple of Japanese soldiers try to get to the marine lines to surrender. One makes it. Only to be executed a while after surrendering because the men guarding them were tired of their task & wanted to move on. So the prisoner was killed. A fantastic movie. I also have So sad to fall in battle, the book used as a starter for the movie. I highly recommend this. It's great!
