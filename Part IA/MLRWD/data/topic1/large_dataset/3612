The Show

Season 4 is about Love. The start of every diabolical scheme by a mad scientist is started because of love, or love lost. The show creators managed to wrangle in the over the top plots and scenarios and focus in on how love really overpowers the decisions we make, good or bad.

The Video Quality

Blu ray quality video is top shelf. The show is crisp and stunning for the most part. The show involves a ton of creatures, video screens, on screen graphics from phones, lasers, and other assorted light sources and they come across great. The only bad elements are flashback scenes from previous seasons that feature softer images. Some skyline establishing shots are soft, but they take up 2-3 seconds of screen time.

The Audio

DTS Master Audio gives your stereo system a workout. The bass was much deeper and richer, the highs are much more crisp. It actually makes other shows sound bad. Seasons 1-3 don't include DTS Master audio, and now I wish they did. Dialog is fast and crisp, and subtitles are very accurate. They even include titles for the many songs the shows play, which helps in purchasing songs from iTunes or Amazon.

The Extras

No commentary, which is a bummer.

The Roundtable is compelling. I have watched it about twice so far, very engaging.

A few more features about Peter Bishop's "disappearance" and other show related highlights.

The comic created for the show, written by Joshua Jackson himself! is explored.

A neat blooper real.

Oh, and Anna Torv speaking in her original Australian accent, it throws me off every time I see it.
