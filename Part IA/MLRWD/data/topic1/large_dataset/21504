Being in the Army myself, I found many of the details concerning the National Guard (or Nasty Guard as active duty Soldiers call them) to be laughable in their inaccuracies.  That said, I found the movie to be enjoyable because it delivers on its premise: unprofessional and incompetent national guardsmen go up against some crazy mutants.  In that vein, it has many similarities to the movie Southern Comfort (just replace crazed mutants with backwood hicks).  Most importantly (at least for me), is that the production values were pretty high for a horror movie.  The cinematography was good, and the special effects much better then most horror movies.  To be sure, the acting won't be winning any awards, and the plot doesn't have any real turns or twists.  This movie reminds me of other recent "horror" movies like The Cave and Descent which, I think, actually are closer to the action/thriller genre then true horror.  This movie also gets points for being a good quality transfer to blu-ray.  To keep things in perspective just watch the Uwe Boll train-wreck "House of the Dead" for a movie that deserves 2 stars (House of the Dead 2 deserving 1 star).
