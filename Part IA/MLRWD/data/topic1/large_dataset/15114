I read the book, then saw the film in the theatre and was vaguely aware of not having a real opinion. Did I like it? Yeah...no...yeah I THINK so. Hmmm, I am not usually so confused about cinema. Now, after viewing the DVD, I understand my problem. I was reluctant to allow "Hannibal" to be appreciated as a stand alone film and, in my opinion, that is how it must be considered. It sheds new light on this chapter (and the inner character) in the life of our favorite cannibal. Scott's film plays like the foreign film it should be, the screen is both dark and deeply shadowed as well as bleeding with vibrant color, locations spectacular. The photography truly wraps around the actors and brings them in to a secret little world that, while it did not allow me to forget Jodie Foster and her perverse would-be paramour, did allow me to accept the first film as "another time, another place." In the here and now with Lechter abroad and Starling's career on the skids after a disasterous FBI raid gone wrong, a fresh start emerges playing once again on Starling's lack of self esteem and the undeniable relationship between the two. To go further with the plot is a waste of your time, Gentle Reader, as so many have already gone before me. I will say the DVD is probably the best one on the market right now, packed full with extra scenes, alternative endings, and plenty of features which allow you to ruminate over the story without the screaming crowds. It personifies what DVD is actually for and why it's worth having. If you turned your nose up at "Hannibal" due to loyalty to the first film, may I suggest a taste test? This is very, very good.
