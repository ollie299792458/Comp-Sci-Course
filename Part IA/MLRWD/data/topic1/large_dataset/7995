One of the reasons Charles Busch's parodies work so well on stage is the number of drag peformances that that make them high camp. In the stage play of this work for example he played the lead role of Chicklet and the beautiful sex kitten Mary Ann was also played by a man. In the film they are played by "real" girls and, as a result, much of the fun is lost. Busch does appear in drag in the new role of the police detective. But being the only drag performer makes him stand out glaringly. This coupled with his exagerated stage performance rather than a film performance only makes it worse. However, if the other actors had chosen to work in the same Susan Hayward look-ma-I'm-acting style of Busch the film might have made it. So, instead of being campy as the original, and as it should have been. The film doesn't achieve its potential. It's rather a mediocre version of the tedious (but often funny--still often unfunny) parodies the Abrahams brothers crank out. Let's hope that when Busch &amp; Co. make another film they aren't afraid to go all out. (Mrs. Brown and her church cronies aren't going to come see it anyway.) Then it won't be so disappointing!
