There is no doubt that Paul McCartney is a gifted artist whose talents span (Wingspan, as well) into several media, e.g. painting, music, poetry.  He was one quarter of the world's number one band and subsequently led another very successful band, Wings.
I truly respect and admire the fact that Paul McCartney is a family man.  He wanted Linda at his side and encouraged her to be a part of his second successful band, Wings.  I like the way he wanted to share his life with her and that she also inspired some of the most beautiful love songs such as "Maybe I'm Amazed," "Just Another Day," and "The Lovely Linda."  The love he clearly had for Linda is touching and beautiful; everything he says about his late wife points up to a loving and nurturing union.
I love the May 2001 "interview" Paul had with his daughter, Mary.  I am somewhat reluctant to call their exchange an "interview;" rather, they were engaged in a conversation that just happened to be filmed for television.  I love the way Paul talked about Linda and how they wanted a family; the family film footage is what made this so much more captivating for me.  
Paul McCartney is a man of many talents and credentials.  The credential I most respect is that of family man.
