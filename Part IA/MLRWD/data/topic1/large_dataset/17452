I saw "Danny Deckchair" many years ago almost completely by accident.  I was thumbing through channels and stumbled upon an ad for it on a channel I don't remember.  I had decided to watch it because I saw Rhys Ifans in "Notting Hill" and as well as Miranda Otto guesting on an episode of Star Trek The Next Generation (Lower Decks) and was impressed with her as well.  "Danny Deckchair" is a story (loosely based on actual similar event) about a blue collar jokester (Rhys Ifans) with an unappreciative girfriend attaches balloons to his deckchair and floats off into the wild blue yonder until he's shot down (accidently) by and into a small town.  He meets a girl (Mirando Otto) who he pursues a relationship with when his past catches up with him.  I'm not one for romantic movies in general, but "Danny Deckchair" is one of the sweetest movies I've seen.  It's about one man, who just hasn't been able to find where he belongs, and one woman, who long since put aside her dreams for the numbing sameness of responsibility.  Each finds what has been missing in their lives.  This movie reminds the viewer to look around, smell the roses and appreciate those in your lives WHILE you have them without being preachy.  There are no boring spots in it and the humor is mature, adult and British.  This movie belongs next to my other romantic comedies such as "Return to Me" and "My Big Fat Greek Wedding."

I highly recommend watching "Danny Deckchair." (Especially with a loved one with you)  :-D
