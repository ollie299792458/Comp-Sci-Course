Toy Story was in many ways a new kind of film for Disney.  It had an origionality that the company hadn't shown in a long time and was quite refreshing to say the least.  A Bug's Life, however is pretty much the same formulated and trite Disney film that he have all seen a million times before wrapped in some flashy new computer animation.
The movie starts out with Flick(an ant) trying to find a more efficient way to gather nuts.  Flick is part of a colony and doesn't fit in.  The evil grasshopers force the poor ants to give them food every year.  Flick decides the only way to end this is to this is to get some "warrior bugs" to come and get rid of the grasshoppers.  However, being a niave little ant, he instead gets a bunch of circus rejects by mistake.  If this sounds familiar, it should.  It's the same old contrived plot that we have seen more times that we can count in Disney films and other films.  Anyone with half a brian can guesse what is going to happen.  The "warrior bugs" are going to be exposed as fakes but the ants are going to find the strenght to defeat the grasshoppers themselves.  How touching.
The film has a few amusing parts but for the most part A Bug's Life is a total disapointment.  When compared to the likes of Toy Story, Ants, or even Alladin; A Bug's Life ends up looking terribly dated(even with it's great computer animation).  Maybe Disney should quite telling the exact same stories in new settings and try to do something origional.
