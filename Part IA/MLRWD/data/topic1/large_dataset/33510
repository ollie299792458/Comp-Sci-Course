Any Given Sunday (DVD) is a "pro" football film experience that is hard to describe in typed words. I have watched it many times and affirm that it really gets one "ready for some football". The story is a collection of mini-stories, all woven into the tapestry of professional football. You will see the good and bad in people, and you will see a team forged from all levels of physical, psychological and emotional combat. Don't be "drawn offsides", either. This is not a predictible, sappy sports film - though it has seemingly all the formula for it. Oliver Stone orchestrates a music-video-like, surreal production in which the football action is explosive, crystal clear and totally believable. The "talking scenes" are not like the typical film, scenes that you casually wait through to get to the next action sequence. You are drawn into each of the evolving tales, seeing new things every time you watch this movie. Any Given Sunday gets my vote for just the DVD to watch - on any given evening! Please note: This is a grown-up's film, not for kids.
