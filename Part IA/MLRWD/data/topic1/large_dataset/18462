It is a set of circumstances I'm sure that makes this movie click for me; hit me very deeply, softly. I've run into many people who I respect who find this film cheesy or manipulative, which just goes to show that so much of our tastes and likes and loves are so particular. One detail here or there can send us in opposite directions.
The first time I saw it I thought I loved it because of Minnie Driver, I've always had a warm crush on her. And her character is so appealing, so likable, lovable, the kind of woman you hope to meet in college and start the second chapter of your life with and you hope it'll be a long, lush chapter two.
The second time I watched it was several years later and I watched it just before I moved to San Francisco and I thought, "A-ha! really i am so touched by this movie because I identify with Will Hunting: his quickness, his alienation and stretch between different worlds and just like me he's heading west."
But, by the time I was done watching it I realized why I had loved it all along, because Robin Williams is a father and mentor that I've never had but so desperately, dearly want. "it's not your fault, it's not your fault, it's not your fault" they don't seem alive on the page, they seem like they might even be cheesy or maudlin, but when they come out of Robin's mouth in his room there...well, they work, they are real and good and right and any flaws this film has don't much matter to me, I can take that moment and tuck it away in me for later and it burns as hot and strong as the first time I felt it.
