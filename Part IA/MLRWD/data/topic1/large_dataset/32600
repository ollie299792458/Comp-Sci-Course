This was certainly a nice surprise. What seems to be a light hearted fun movie for children certainly has a dark, undercurrent theme for adults as well. It's both uplifting and tragic at the same time. Peter Pan is certainly the main hero type thing, but unlike the Disney version (the only one I've seen previously), it certainly shows the character's "fall from grace" and shows the "Peter Pan syndrome" in not wanting to grow up. But at its heart it does well to depict that it's not "just a mere choice" as it often seems but does well to show that it goes beyond the surface exterior most people show. His unwilling to grow up is his safety net on preventing from getting hurt. The movie shows the hope for Peter to truly breach that skin, and the sadness when he doesn't but you still feel for him. He embodies that innocence many have forgotten and/or try to protect still. A recommended movie for families with young children to watch with as they grow and mature as they may pick up the themes along the way. I would give a perfect 5 star rating except (as difficult as it may be) there is room for perfection. As the movie begins it certainly has that "kids movie" feel which may put off some "maturer" viewers. Certain scenes appear as gimics which some people may not enjoy. In a sense it calls out to the child in us and asks us to use our imagination to fill in the gaps where the special effects don't quite make it. Not to be taken too seriously, it never the less leaves quite an impact (whether you like it or not).
