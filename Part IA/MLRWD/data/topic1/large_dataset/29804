I hadn't seen this film in almost 18 years...until I was in the midst of updating my DVD collection and rediscovered it. I was 15 when this film hit the theaters, and back at that time, this movie freaked alot of people out. The story itself, the atmosphere, and the setting all works for me even today. The most talked about scene has always been "Eddie's transformation". I still think it works. Rob Bottin was a young upstart in Hollywood at the time, and had something to prove....which he did spetacularly.
Anyone who knows Joe Dante, should realize all of his films have a certain "tounge-in-cheek" quality.....real horror fans will get the joke and have fun with this movie. In an age where Hollywood seems to be on a major re-make trend..(I've counted 23 films in just the last 2 1/2 years...not counting back the last 10!)..do yourself a favor and watch one of the originals. The effects may seem dated to some, considering the CGI all over the place, but it does still work. Good, campy, spooky fun....
