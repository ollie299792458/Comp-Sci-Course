I had the honor in seeing this film by accident when it was first released, not that that's important but this small accident lead me to the libertine and one of Johnny Dep's phenomenal acing parts. Let alone John Malkovich, Samantha Morton, and Alcock played by Richard Coyle"" The dark hummer is un-doubtfully some that will make you wet your self. Other Reviewers either love it or hate it and some go as far to say it's to dark and perverse "please" In the beginning there is a huge blinking neon sign "Johnny's characters monolog" Saying: YOU WILL NOT LIKE ME!!! He basically sets the stage and if you whinny critics and closed minded Cunnys can't see this from this monologue then rent a film that's more on your intellectual level! ""Maybe'  Bring it On Again ` is more your IQ echelon""

  Excuse the tangent, but it is what it is, a period piece about the Earl of Rodchester, about a most masterful man at words, Theater, Wine, paying for company of the Women, STDs, Love Lust Homosexuality loss, Catholics and Protestants, an actress fighting her way to the top , the battle of will, pride, lust addiction, Drink addiction, Ego addiction, a man so beyond perverse that his servants' name Is Alcock  AND don't forget the Monkey!!!

  All this must be contained, followed, thus told, and it is by this cast, and with one of the most brilliant performances of his life J. Dep holds this movie and your attention with a script most beautifully written in his words and expressions and delivers what I fell is nothing less, then a masterpiece.
