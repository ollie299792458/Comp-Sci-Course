This is not just a "teenage" movie full of obscene gestures and language.  This is not just a chic flick full of romantic scenes that make your cheeks hot and make you wish you had a guy as swoon worthy as the  actor.  This is not just a comedy that makes you laugh until your side  hurts.  This is not just another Drew Barrymore movie.  This is a  masterpiece! Whether you're young or old there is something in this movie  for everyone.  Although it's fairly predictable with a title like  "Never Been Kissed", it still has the moments that make you cry  (i.e. the prom speech, the baseball mound), moments that make you laugh  (i.e. the banana/condem/penguin scene, loser on the forehead), and moments  that make you lapse into one of those far off dreamy looks where all you  can think about is love (i.e. the ferris wheel, and the climatic ending).  You truly cannot dislike the movie or plot.  Sure it may be a little far  fetched, have a few lame jokes, and predictable, but there's more to it.  It teaches you a lesson that everyone needs to know and that is that being  cool is being yourself.  I cannot think of a better movie that shares the  same moral.
