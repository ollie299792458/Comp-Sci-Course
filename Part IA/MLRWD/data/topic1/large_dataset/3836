I have to buy this film on dvd.  I had it one vhs.  I love, love, love this film and cannot watch it enough.  The cinmatography is so brilliant with its sepia-toned color. And that music is beautiful and haunting.  But the cast is uniformly brilliant, especially Woods and De Niro, one hyper and violent and the other subdued and more "caring."  Tuesday Weld is wonderful and she has been used too litle on film and is a great actress.

What makes this film so brilliant is the way the Italian filmakers capture the Jewish lower East Side so perfectly (to me, at least).  One of the cable channels ages ago showed both the long and short versions and it's amazing how the short version, in chronological order, made no sense while the longer version with its flashbacks did make sense.

And if you can, catch it on a big screen in a repertory theater.  I did in DC and was surprised at the opium den scenes where the pictures on the wall were very pornographic which I missed watching it on tv.

But the ending is truly amazing.  I've never seen an ending like that in any movie ever!
