I just rented this yesterday & have to agree with the reviewer who said "if you like to see bad guys get wasted, this movie rocks".  In that respect, it certainly does.....it's Death Wish on steroids, & nearly non-stop.  I lost track of the body count about 1/4 of the way through.  If I have one issue with it, it's that Jason's character was TOO good a fighter (& marksman, for that matter) to be real...after all, many of the bad guys would have been (in real life), martial artists & he went through all of them like a knife through butter.  BUT! (the guilty pleasure part) is what made it enjoyable for me....as soon as he decided to help the little girl, he was invincible....never got shot, hardly even got punched or kicked, so in every action scene, you just KNEW that the bad guys (there were LOTS of them) were going to get it.....and he gave them no quarter.  All were beaten, then shot dead, or just simply shot dead.  And I loved the last scene with Jason, the girl & the bad guy.....reminded me of a certain scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark. And, although it easily could have been, the violent scenes never got out of comtrol with too much gore-there was actually very little, considering the amount of deaths throughout.  A fun action movie for me, anyway!
