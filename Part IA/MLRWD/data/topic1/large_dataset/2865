Most people consider South Park a show/movie that is just pure sexual innuendo, fart jokes, gross out humor, and four letter words...and that is right on the money, but what they neglect to point out is the brilliant weaving of social ideals into the mix. "South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut" is an absolutely brilliant film that does something that most film makers would not dream about: creating a microcosm of itself. The seemingly ascinine plot (the boys sneak into an R-rated Canadian film, then, through a series of extremely comedic events, eventually ends in a war with Canada, thus unleashing the Appoclyps), is what they thought was going to happen when the movie was released (granted, vastly over blown for theatrical effect). 
The movie itself is filled with side splitting humor and one-liners galor! Never leaving a dull moment open. To the addition of the genius of it, the fact that they made it a musical just upped the ante. With songs like "La Resistance (Medley)" (sung by the entire cast) and "I Can Change" (sung by Saddam Hussein) the movie is just incredible. The role of "Mr. Garrison" is remnisant of Jonny from "Airplane!", even resurecting spome old and brilliant jokes that were slightly changed from the aformentioned movie. The portayal of Satan in this movie is VASTLY DIFFERENT than any other portrayal I have ever seen. Satan is shown as a kind hearted homosexual in an up and down relationship to lover Saddam Hussein. Such entertaining happenings as that fill the movie. Look, whether you want a solid piece of cinema to disect and enjoy, or a gross out, offensive comedy that is pure fun you need to pick this up this movie, you will not soon regret it.
