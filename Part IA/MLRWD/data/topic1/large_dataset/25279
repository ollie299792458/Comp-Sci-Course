This show is entertaining sure, but that entertainment comes at a premium. I don't think there's a single crime lab on Earth that looks anything like this. It's what you'd expect people who've never stepped foot in a real crime lab to manufacture. Plenty of mood lighting, brushed stainless steel and glass everywhere. Aesthetics are not of primary concern to the architects that build these facilities. Plus everyone in this show seems to be beautiful or handsome. What are the chances that so many attractive people would end up in the forensic science field? I also love how every actor explains everything to each other like nobody knows anything. Every time they take a measurement, or a sample, or they scratch their nose the camera has to zoom in, and then a bunch of explanatory visual flashes. At first their kinda cool, but their novelty wares off very quickly. I know they're trying to educate the viewer by treating them like their an idiot, but we're not all idiots, so why do we have to be dragged down to their level? Do CSI's carry firearms, question people, or arrest people? I honestly don't know, but this show would have us believe that CSI's are supermen (and women) that accomplish every sexy facet of crime fighting. Do they prosecute too? CSI is entertaining, but it's so unbelievable that the more I watch it, the less entertaining it becomes. Is all the flash necessary? Apparently so...
