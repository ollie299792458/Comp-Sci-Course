I was hoping 'The Eye' was going to be fresh filmmaking and would bring something new to the overly cliche Horror/Mystery genre.  This film has been recommended to me several times by others, and the reviews it's been getting by critics have been over the top.  I was left unfulfilled and severely disappointed by the time the end credits rolled on screen.  In fact, the film hardly leaves me any desire to see the newly rewritten Hollywood version next year.
There are a lot of problems with 'The Eye'.  The pacing seems oddly clunkish at times.  I was hoping the story would take off within the first 30 minutes, but it never actually does.  See, I'm not going to rag on the small problems, like having to believe that the main character can see AND hear dead people after her corneal transplant, because there is so much more.  Few of the moments that are SUPPOSED to be scary are not because none of the moments prior to the scare get built up enough.  Then the audience has to put up with a very sappy (romance?) between the main character and her doctor.  Outside the hospital sequences, the script never really found anything interesting for the doctor to do.
What I did like about 'The Eye' was the main character's connection with the corneal donor.  That and the cinematography was decent.  But besides all that, the editing was rather poor and the musical score wasn't really suited for a horror film.
&gt;&gt; 2 stars.  Like a dry cupcake, the movie just crumbles.
