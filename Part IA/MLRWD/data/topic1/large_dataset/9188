This is a classic for all ages.  Yes it is old, yes it is in black and white, but yes it holds up fairly well.

People start coming up missing and the police are there to investigate.  Shortly after they find bodies and bags of sugar along with an occasional vibrating shrill sound that everyone swears is just the wind.  Soon scientists are brought in to examine tracks they find in the sand and they soon deduct it is ant tracks of a very large scale.  The reason... nuclear fallout of course.(the reason for ever mutation)  Soon a group is formed to invade the nest and exterminate the giant ants.(You will see a trend with my reviews I give the cliff notes synopsis. Why tell you the whole story, then you won't have to watch the movie)

Other then the same ol' reasoning behind the mutation this film is very well done.  In fact it was the largest grossing movie the year it came out.  My twelve year old son loved it so it tells you even with all the video games, MP3, DVDs, CGI and the like this film can still captivate your attention.

Out of all the movies that fall into this genre I have to rank this movie #1.  My suggestion though is to get the two movie set of THEM/THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, it is 3 bucks cheaper and great picture quality.  Highly recommended for anyone that wants to watch the best of this genre of film.
