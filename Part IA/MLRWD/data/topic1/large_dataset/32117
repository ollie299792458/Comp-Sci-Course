he thinks seinfeld is lame but spiderman is the best? come back kid when you get pubes and start understanding life a little...it ain't about spiderman i can tell you that much...seinfeld captures every awkward type accident that we have ever encountered before and makes us realize how silly the little things are that annoy us ...I have posted reviews for dvd's before and amazon rejected them, although I felt they were entirely appropriate, so how this little punk kid gets not one, but two lousy reviews in that aren't even reviews is beyond me...I don't know, maybe he's related to someone on the amazon staff...anyway, I reported it as inappropriate...so whether you'll ever see MY review will see the light of day remains to be seen...this is one of the best shows that has ever graced the tv screen, and now it has finally been given the royal treatment and released on season sets...i applaud the folks responsible for their efforts and if you are a fan, you should not hesitate in purchasing every season set
