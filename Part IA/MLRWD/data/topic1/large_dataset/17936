I have to say that I enjoyed a good portion of the movie, namely the first half, but once everyone gets stuck in the church, well, things collapse faster than the old builing itself.  What made this movie strong in the begining was that it didn't try to focus on to many characters.  But then we are introduced to everyone who is caught in the church.  Soon characters just vanish from the plot all together, and then re-appear later, and then vanish again.  And what happened to all the children?  There where like at least ten kids, and they all happen to magically vanish!  Plus, it is very hard to tell how people become transformed into demons in this film.  Some are scratched (as it was in Demons1), but some just magically change (like say the old woman).  The main fault of this film is that it doesn't commit to anything.  It throws all these things together, and only follows through on some of them.  So, yes, while the first half is quite good, and well written, the last half is nothing but pointless gore, sex, and an attempt at sounding sophisticated.  So rent it first before you commit to buying it.
