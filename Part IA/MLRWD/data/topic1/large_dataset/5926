I was dismayed by the less than stellar reviews this film garnered.  But not daunted by other's opinions I always want to develope my own.  I was not that disappointed in this film.  While it lacked the darkness that some parts of the book possessed, it was not a failure.

The beautiful cast, strong and outspoken, gentle and poignant, was a pleasure to watch.  All the women were very fine.  I particularly appreciated Sophie Okonedo.  But can I say enough about Paul Bettany?  He is so deep, so talented, so enchanting.  He mesmerizes, and this was not a starring role.  The simple line:  "Because she didn't come after me."  Takes my breath away.

Of course, the period, 1964 immediately following LBJ's signing of the Civil Rights Act, an important time, brings this to the fore with it's still virulent racial hatred.  The scene in the book where Rosalie is harrassed by the town's white protectors was much stronger and I was hoping that it would be emphasized in the film as well.  I missed that.

I've always liked Queen Latifah.  Alicia Keyes did not disappoint, and Jennifer Hudson.  It is thrilling to find a new talent so fine yet surprising.  (Her Super Bowl turn--exceptional, better than Houston's.)  And to have all these wonderful women on the same screen at the same time.  Of course, Fanning moves into more adult roles and I expect that she will continue to shine.
