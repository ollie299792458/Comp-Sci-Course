In every way Rent is a perfect work of art; tremendously enjoyable as entertainment and emotionally satisfying. Cinematically it's masterful, true to life, and wonderfully well cast and acted. Impeccable singing, powerful music, witty and brilliant lyrics combine intricately to deliver an exciting and transcendent experience.

Rent is the universal story of creative and artistic misfits trying to make it in the big city. It's a tale as old as civilization, which gives it added punch and turns the film into a wellspring of inspiration. It's a modern retelling of La Boheme, the classic French story, but is original in almost every way. The characters are fascinating, the music sounds new, and the vision of New York City looks and feels fresh as well.

It's a 'must see' for everyone who enjoys the mating of music, great storytelling, and powerful characters. The companion disc 2 (included) is terrific in its own right, and tells the background story of the creation of Rent; first as off-off Broadway theater; then through many versions over the years as a monster hit that toured the globe.
