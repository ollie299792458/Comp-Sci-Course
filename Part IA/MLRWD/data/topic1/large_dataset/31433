If you're open to an older movie as your next one to watch because you've burned through the new releases, check this one out.

If you're into historical fiction, you may like The Company, with Chris O'Donnell, Alfred Molina, and Michael Keaton. It just occurred to me we have some superheroes here - O'Donnell and Keaton from Batman, and Molina was Doc Ock in Spiderman. Appropriate maybe for a movie based on the CIA's history.

The film follows 3 men recruited into the CIA from college in the 50s through 40 years of the Cold War. The thread that connects them to actual history besides events like the Hungarian uprising and the Bay of Pigs is the ongoing search for a mole within the CIA.

What's enjoyable?

A feeling you get the inside story on how the espionage world works.

A chance to argue about how much of an impact the intelligence organization had on the outcome of the Cold War. The episodes tended to emphasize the CIA's less than stellar moments, but we'll likely not know about its successes in our lifetimes.

An understanding of the sacrifices made to serve in the world of espionage.
