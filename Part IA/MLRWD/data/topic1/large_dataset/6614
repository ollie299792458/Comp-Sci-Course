This movie is about a young boy named Florya who joins a group of Partisans fighting the Nazi occupation in Byelorussia.  While the movie is quite interesting despite a flawed collage of backwards scenes in the epilogue, where a now hardened Florya shoots repeatedly at a photograph of Hitler, it is well worth watching-but though the movie stresses the German horors inflicted upon Byelorussia, it totally ignores the historically documented atrocities perpetrated by the Partisans on the German troops which led to these vicious reprisals.  When the Germans are captured in fact--in this movie--they are eliminated about as humanely as one could expect in a time of vicious warfare--but in reality they were typically tortured--including emasculation, tongues being cut out, or eyes gouged out (see the BBC documentary "When Hitler faught Stalin" for brief evidence of these and other horrors)

None of this stops this from being a good movie-but the accuracy of the events depicted-seems to have a very Soviet slant--as in the days before Perestroika and Glasnost.

In no way defending the Nazi atrocities-and they were in fact the invaders--I just found the partisans to be presnted in a much more honorable fashion than the historical truth reveals.

Still, I recommend this movie strongly if for nothing more than to see Florya move from his own boyish idealism to becoming a hardened junior partisan, to demonstrate what the hell of war does to people!

I would have given this movie a "5"if it had contained less propaganda and hadn't had such a bizarre ending
