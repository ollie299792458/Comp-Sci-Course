I love every single episode of Seinfeld and seem to associate almost everything in my daily life with something from either Seinfeld or the Simpsons. That being said, this season of Seinfeld contains one gem after another. A rundown on my favorite episodes: Episode 5, The Bris: The most hilarious part of this is the moyle that doesn't even make it as a kosher butcher is now tasked with circumcision of infants. He is unsteady, has a fear of loud sounds, is generally anal retentive, and doesn't like children...and yet he is the person they let do the deed! So funny I can't even describe it. In the extras, Jason Alexander says that he didn't think it was good for the moyle to hate children, but I differ with him and think it was a very funny, subtle touch to the episode. Episode 7, The Non-Fat Yogurt: I appreciate how Guiliani actually came on the show...I'd say more, but don't want to give it away. Episode 8, The Barber: Sheer comic genius. Take one part Seinfeld, one part Newman, and two parts Rossini and mix them all up, et voila! Although it's never mentioned, I have a feeling the old Looney Tunes with Bugs in the comedic roles had an influence on this. Episode 13, The Marine Biologist: The extras indicate that many consider this a classic episode and you can easily tell why: just funny from start to finish! My favorite part is when George is giving his "Melvillesque" telling of how he saved the whale ("Easy big fella!"). Episode 22, The Opposite. The title says it all. Enjoy Seinfeldians!
