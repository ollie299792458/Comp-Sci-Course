I heard about this movie a while ago on one of the horror sites I go to, I have been looking forward to it ever since. The past couple weeks the reviews have been easier to find and they have been very mixed so my excitement went down just a little so I decided to rent it before I buy. I must say the movie was enjoyable, the film looked great and didn't have that low budget look to it which bothers me when it comes to some of these movies. The acting was good, the killer looked great, the atmosphere was cool, I like that it took place in the day time. I just really wish there was more of the killer and more gore, I would love to see a Madison County 2 with a higher budget. The movie didn't invent anything new but not all movies have to do that to be enjoyable, give me a cool looking killer with good gore and kill scenes with descent acting and im all in.

I look forward to seeing what Eric England does next, Madison County might have to be added to my horror movie collection at some point, give me a 2nd one with a higher budget, its definitely possible with the way this one ended.
