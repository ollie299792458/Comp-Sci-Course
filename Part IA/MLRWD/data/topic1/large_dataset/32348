The film opens with a return to Isla Sorna. A man and a boy are soaring behind a boat; then something happens to their tow boat. An ominous beginning, like with the first "Jaws". Professor Grant says he will never return to Isla Sorna. But a wealthy businessman shows up with a blank check. And so we return again to a very scary story. Again, the best laid plan of man fails due to an unforeseen event. When will they ever learn?

The film quickly gets up to speed and action. The computer generated images are better than in the first "Jurassic Park". The chatter among the survivors is better too. Having a cadaver pop up for horror recalls "Indiana Jones". [Does this kill off people's appetite for snacks?] Why do these people travel to a dangerous place unarmed? Is this film meant as a warning against cloning and genetic modifications?

By half-time the film tells of the survivors journey to the coast to escape. This film assumes there would be no monsters in the sea. But guess what they find up in the air? Of course, they manage to find a boat to take them down river to the coast. A last attack by a monster is averted with a flare gun (again recalling "Jaws"). Then they are saved when the Marines land!

Tea Leoni shines like a star in this film. The fewer number of actors suggest a lower budget, compared to the original film. The conventions are followed in showing what happens to a man who steals. [But would that nest be uncovered? Not for alligators.] It seems unrealistic for a cell phone to be working after it passed through the digestion system.
