" . . .  fills in gaps . . . "someone said.  Said gaps are in the Carpenter film . . . there are no gaps in the original [1951] film or in the original story by Campbell.  Now . . . in 1951 we lacked the GCI tchnology to have TheThing marph shapes as in Campbell's original story.  So we had James Arness + the USAF and a love story.  Today we have the gci effects and it is possible, tho no one has had the guts to do it, to make the film an honest adaptation of the Campbell story.  While the original film had the spaceship be both a recent arrival and a flying saucer in shape [which of course reflected  the flying saucer reports of that era] at least the ship was destroyed accidentally . . . as Campbell wrote it.  BUT, the Campbell spaceship was not saucer shaped but an obvious space ship design. It's destruction was  also accidental as was the discovery of The Thing some distance away apparently having be sent on a solo reconnaisance before whatever happened to bury both that individual and ship/crew in ice.  Moreover it had been in the Arctic ice  for apparent eons AND the dicoverers and scientits who had to fight it out with The Thing had to improvise -- no flamethrowers, helicopters, assault rifles etc -- both the human/non human tests and ways to kill the morphing monster: blowtorch and a jury-rigged electrocution gadget.  [Campbell's heroes were always earth humans, of mostly anglo-saxon descent and instoppably ingenious in a pinch.]

Now that could be one helluva movie.  Too bad no one has the guts and/or brains to do it.  Go read the original Campbell story and then let your imagination truly soar!
