I have heard a lot of reviews criticize this movie because it's plotline is ridiculous, or at least count this as a downside to the movie. These reviews are missing the point. Of course the movie is ridiculous: it's Looney Tunes. Yes, the Chairman's plot to use the Blue Monkey diamond is silly and unrealistic: it is supposed to be!If the Looney Tunes are going to save the world, they should save it from something silly. You want serious and deadly, go watch Batman. Moreover, the movie is extremely accurate with the personalities and personal styles of each of the cartoon characters as they have been portrayed in the original cartoons. All of this is not to even mention the multiple movie references and commentary that this movie dishes out. As a matter of fact, "Looney Tunes: Back in Action" is the only movie that I have ever seen that actually makes fun of it's own product placemnt. All in all, this is a movie that is remarkably funny and remarkably true to the spirit of the original "Looney Tunes" cartoons.
