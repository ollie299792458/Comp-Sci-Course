forget vampire slayers, Deacon Frost is enigmatic enough to make me want to BE a vampire. Stephen Dorff's portrayal of Frost as charismatic, intelligent and evil is close to perfection. What makes him truly evil is his thirst for power which pales even his thirst for blood. BUt as all Hollywood movie ends, no amount of hunger for power and good looks can get a person with bad/ evil intentions anywhere. Frost would have been a great character to follow up in Blade II. most of the 4 stars i gave would go to this character portrayal.
apart from that, the storyline, i found, was a tad bit too cheesy. Blade's identity as the day walker; half man/half vampire, and the history of how he became what he is, his revenge yadda yadda... is all too predictable. But i guess it's a standard for some comic superhero turned movie to have a dark past and some vengeance.
i have yet to watch the sequel, but i hope that it (blade II) doesn't fall into the stereotype for sequels: that sequels usually [are not very good].
