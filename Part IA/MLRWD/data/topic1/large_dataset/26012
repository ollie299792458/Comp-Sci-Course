This film, in my experience, is a very polarizing one.  There are basically two sides...those who get Prince and his style, and those who do not.  If you are someone who not only enjoys Prince's music, but also get his unique, wry sense of humor, you will almost definitely enjoy this film.  If, however, you don't appreciate Prince's talents, or are one of those people who like his music, yet never understood why he was always so "weird" or "odd", this film will either annoy or bore you.

For those of you in the first group, be prepared to experience Prince's quirky sense of humor full blast.  As director of the film, he gave this movie a full dose of himself, and Jerome complements him wonderfully.  Neither of them are particularly amazing actors, but they bring a sense of fun and enjoyment that are hard to manufacture and extremely infectious.  There are some truly classic moments that you'll want to quote all the time, but, unfortunately, no one else has seen the film so people won't get the reference (Wrecka Stow anyone?).

Also, there are several music videos on the DVD, which we all know are almost worth the cost of the DVD itself.  "Kiss" is found on many music video compilations, but "Mountains", "Girls and Boys", and "Anotherloverholeinyahead" are unique to this DVD as far as I am aware.

Basically, it all boils down to this...for a true Prince fan, this will become an instant classic and must-have for your home video collection.  For anyone else, this is a rental.
