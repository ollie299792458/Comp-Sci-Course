I don't want to say a lot about this film other than to say that it is incredibly underrated right now, and I'm really sad to see it did so poorly in the box office. It took a funny, nerdy, action movie to places where no one else has been bold enough to go, and did so in a way that I guess isn't accessible to a larger audience, but if this film doesn't become any kind of cult classic, I'll be double-disappointed. It functions on the level of a big Hollywood picture without selling out or trying to go easy on the audience, and even if you don't outright get everything that's happening, it's incredibly entertaining if you're willing to meet it at the completely-not-serious level that it's purposefully functioning on.

However, it's full of a lot of things that push people's sensitive buttons -- Michael Cera, things that are vaguely "hipster" (though it mocks all of them), and nerdy video game references. How everyone who ever sincerely enjoyed a Zelda, NES, or arcade game didn't go to this movie, I don't understand -- I suppose a lot of people deny that inner child part of them now because it's "uncool" to be a "nerd" (though the story isn't even about nerds, it's about absurd hipsters in a band).
