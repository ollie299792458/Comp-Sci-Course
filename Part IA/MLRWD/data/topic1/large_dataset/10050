I have adored Winnie the Pooh since I was a child and have owned several copies of the The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.  I have owned the Friendship Edition DVD and more recently the 25th Anniversary Edition DVD, because my 3-year-old broke the Friendship Edition DVD.  When I tried to purchase another Friendship Edition at a local store, to my surprise, it was not longer available for sale.) I am appalled at the recent price gouging that is happening on this site for these two DVD copies of the movie.  I purchased the Friendship Edition for $19.99 at Target 18 months ago and The 25th Anniversary Edition used in "like new" condition at a movie trading retailer about 6 months ago for $16.99.  I strongly recommend that amazon.com customers look elsewhere to purchase copies of these DVDs.  There is no excuse for this flagrant exploitation of consumers, especially parents who want to share their love of Disney with their children but can't afford inflated pricing like this. :  I guess I got lucky when my daughter broke her DVD earlier this year and not recently.

With regard to this copy of the movie, it is almost exactly like the Friendship Edition.  Thank goodness, because my daughter would be devastated if she didn't have a copy of "A Day for Eeyore" in the bonus materials.  The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is also the only feature-length film my daughter can sit through.  She gets bored or sometimes frightened by the villains in some other Disney films.  If you can afford it and are willing to be taken to the cleaners in order to purchase a copy from amazon.com sellers, I recommend every family have it in their movie collection.
