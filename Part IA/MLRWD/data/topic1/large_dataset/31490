After seeing Pirates of the Caribbean I was impressed that a ride could be made into a really good movie.  And when I heard that the Haunted Mansion was being made into a movie I was excited. But then the trailers came out and I was even more excited.

It wasn't everything I had hoped for but its still worth a see and a rent/buy.

I like Eddie Murphy a lot and this was a movie where he could really shine as Jim Evers, the workaholic dad.

The special effects on this film are amazing,the Zombies really had me scared and I don't think that they could have looked much better. The work on madame Leota is amazing.

THE RIDE

The Haunted Mansion was one of those rides that as a kid I would always want to go on but somewhere in the line I would regret it and get out of the line terrified of what would happen if I would go through the front doors.  But one day I did and it quickly became one of my favorite rides.

The filmakers were able to take a lot of the ride and put it on the screen

-Madame Leota has a major part, and the s&eacute;ance room is a cross between the ride scene and a gypsy tent

-The singing busts appear, singing a verse from Grim Grinning Ghosts

-The Portrait Gallery is an almost exact replica of the one in the ride, although the portraits are somewhat different from the ride

-The ghost duellists from the ballroom scene

-Jim has to battle suits of armor in the film. This is a reference to the moving suit of armor in the rides

-The Hitchhiking Ghosts make an appearance

This film isn't perfect but for people who don't want to fly to California to see the real Haunted Mansion this about as close as you can get.
