I love animation and cant wait for new ones to check out! I really want to like them all.
Megamind, I found, has great animation, but forgot one very important factor that any good
animation always delivers; You have to like the characters; and there was nothing really
likeable about any of these characters!
The main superhero is all about ego. The woman reporter is a cardboard cliche. The villian
that Megamind creates is a total jerk. Megamind's minion can only be described as weird,
-and the homage to "Robot Monster" doesn't work. That leaves Megamind himself to relate to,
-and I cant! At the end of the movie, he is still totally egotistical and self indulgent.
All of the plot twists did not help to warm up to him and his changes of heart seem superfluous.
I doubt I will ever watch this movie again because I just don't care about the characters. I find
that I watch "Despicable Me" over and over because it delivers everywhere Megamind fails.
