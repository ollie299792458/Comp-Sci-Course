I saw this movie when i was in 6th grade i think.. but watching it 9 years later made me think twice about whether this is really for children. Its about a boy whos grandmother tells his stories about witches who come after children..

Even though its supposed to be for kids, i dont recommend it for anyone under .. say, about 13. Its up to you personally, but i showed it to my neice and the scenes with the witches chasing after the kids and attacking them was quite scary for her. It also scared her when one of the witches pushes a baby down the cliff..

And i dont think thats suitable for little children to watch as it can be quite frightening. For older children who can understand its just a movie then its fine.. its a good movie otherwise. Actors were good, especially the little boy he is adorable and plays his character well. The witches are scary enough for their roles and theres Rowan Atkinson who is always fun to watch.

Good movie overall, but i suggest adults watch it first or supervise their kids when the little ones watch it.
