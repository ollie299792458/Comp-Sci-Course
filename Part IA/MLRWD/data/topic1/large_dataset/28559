...possibly because he didn't direct it, this film is powerful and affecting, with a good cast choice and a poignant ending.  However, it was let down in a few ways.  Firstly, the apparent contradiction in the way that Costner treats the boy and how he is prepared to treat the family that take them in and show them kindness.

The main thing that made me cringe thoughout the movie was Eastwood's (?) apparently arbitrary decision to make the boy a Jehovah's Witness (note the spelling!).  Perhaps this was for sensationalist purposes, but the intent to portray him as somehow deprived because of this showed a distinct lack of understanding of the religion.  The biggest howler was when the boy steals the Halloween costume and tells Costner that "I'm going to go to hell for this."  Anyone with even a passing knowledge of Jehovah's Witnesses will know that one of their fundamental beliefs is that hell does not exist.  Okay, so they don't celebrate Christmas or Halloween, but then neither do Jews, Moslems or Hindus.  Are all children of these religions deprived too?  And who came up with the notion that they aren't allowed to go to fairs or ride rollercoasters?  Instead of trying to promote understanding and clarity, this film just added to the general misconception most people have of this religion, as exemplified by Jay's comment that JW's aren't "a true religon. I believe that Christianity is the only true religion."  This is a non sequitur, since JW's believe in Jesus Christ they are, by definition, a Christian religion.  You can excuse his ignorance, but not the film's.  They really should have done some research.
