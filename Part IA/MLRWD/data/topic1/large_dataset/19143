God Grew Tired of Us is a documentary tracing the experience of three young men -- from their war-torn Sudanese village as "lost boys" to their escape trek through hundreds of miles of dangerous terrain to their decade-long 'waiting' in Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp to their resettlement in the United States.

The story effectively shows the challenges facing these young men. While the US does offer opportunities,  the culture here is quite different from sunlit Africa. People in the refugee camps think everyone in the US is rich and has an easy life - learning the truth can be depressing. Also, thousands of lost boys had banded together when their families were killed. They did everything together.  But in the US - they are spread out across the country -- no longer close -- it can be quite lonely.  Additionally, with very few Sudanese women here, the opportunity to marry and continue their culture is challenged.

But, in spite of all this, the film is not depressing. These amazing young men find a way to adapt - yet be true to their heritage.
