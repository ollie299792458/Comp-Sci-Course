I'm picky about which films I take the time to write a review for.
But this is one that I felt deserved it because it has less than 5 stars for the average rating
an to me is a five star film.

Now going into this movie I didn't expect much. I thought we were going to see a blair witch project film
but with aliens . Only reason I even watched it was because I recently seen something in the sky I couldn't identify that had an impact on several towns in my area. Didn't know any good films on the subject and a guy recommended this to me, an I found it for only a couple bucks on here so decided why not.

Well as it started out it at first looked like I was going to be write about it. But with in the first 10 mins of the film I started to see this was like no other movie I've ever seen before .
The story is very interesting, has some facts and evidence that something truly happened to the people whom this film is based off of.  For the reenactment part of the movie it the actors were spot on, an when they were crossing real life video with movie footage the mix was perfect to the second and to the slight nuances of the voice's .

I don't feel I should even attempt to explain the story to you. Others likely could do that better than I , but I feel it's almost impossible to explain what this film is with words.
Its backed by so much reality and such that it's honestly one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen .
I Highly recommend you give this movie a chance.
