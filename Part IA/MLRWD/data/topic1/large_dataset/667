This is one of my favorite romantic comedies. I think what it gets right is something others don't focus on. It is not enough to just have a great couple, but you have to create a world for them as well. The supportive roles are just as important as the leads.

I think most women like Sandra Bullock, because she beautiful, but not so beautiful that we cannot relate to her. She is smart and very funny. She is a good person who deserves love. I think it's great that there is this guy she idealizes and projects all of her romantic fantasies on to. Of course, if she ever talked to him that would end quickly.

She ends up being drawn into this kooky family, which is what she is really looking for...not just love, but a home. Bill Pullman is very attractive as a good down to earth guy who sees how wonderful she is. There are so many warm and wonderful moments in this movie.

I think the humor is the other thing it has going for it. Michael Rispoli is hilarious, as is Sandra. I think guys who are not that into romantic comedies may be able to deal with this one because of the humor.

My favorite scene is when she is pouring her heart out to the Peter Gallagher character in the hospital. The loneliness and sadness is something we have all felt at some point.

A wonderful movie all around.
