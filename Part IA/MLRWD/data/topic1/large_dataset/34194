I REMEMBER MAMA? I'm not very good at "reviewing" films. With that said, I'd like to tell you that the first time I saw I REMEMBER MAMA was as a twelve year old girl and I watched it with my own mama. The story is about a Norwegian family that immigrated to San Francisco near the turn of the century....the twentieth century, that is. It's about their rather large family and extended family of aunts and their blustery, larger than life uncle who is head of the family in the new country, but most importantly it is about the woman who, with her old and new world values holds this large family together. The story unfolds through the writings of the eldest daughter who fancies herself an author, and by finally writing about something that is "real and true" becomes just that. The star of her story is, of course, Mama, played here endearingly and expertly by Irene Dunn. Ms. Dunn is one of those "earlier" stars who like our Meryl Streep has the ability to "become" the character she plays. The rest of the cast, from the head of the family Uncle Chris to the youngest daughter Dagmar and her cat Uncle Elizabeth are not just characters on a page, but real and true people, each with their own interests and storylines. This is an excellent feel-good movie that i highly recommend and once you watch it, i'm sure that you'll Remember Mama too.
