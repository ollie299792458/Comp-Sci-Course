This was a bold film.  It spoke to the seemingly insatiable appetite of the American public for pop icons as well as the tendency for artists to be demanding prima-donnas.  We are all under the microscope in this one.
Al Pacino is excellent as a director, frustrated in his attempts to convert his vision to the screen.  The opening scenes with Wynona Ryder as a demanding starlet can't be too far from the truth.  Pacino creates a beautiful, computer generated actress who captivates the public, leading to mass-hysteria.  
Rachel Roberts as Simone is incredible and believable.  I found myself wondering if in fact she was real at all.  The premise is so credible and the acting so perfect that the viewer easily buys into the technology.  
The plot is fairly predictable at times which detracts from my overall rating.  But the story is one that stayed with me after the movie was over.  How far away are we from this level of technology?  We are already using computer-generated people in film.  Imagine the possiblilties.  
This movie certainly did not receive the recognition is deserved and I predict that it will find a niche with the rental crowd.  Well worth a viewing.
