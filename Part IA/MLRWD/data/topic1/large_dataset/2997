This Disney outing is perhaps my least favorite in recent memory, which is too bad. It sports some amazing effects animation and computer-aided technical detail that would have been inconceivable just a few years ago  (watch for various water and motion effects throughout the film).  But  something about the different elements -- the hyper-real jungle  backgrounds, the plucky animal characters, and the cartoonish, buffoonish  Europeans -- just didn't mesh stylistically.
Perhaps more striking, the  feel of the film is strangely dark, and it lacks the heart of other Disney  efforts (even recent efforts like Mulan, which our kids enjoy much more).  The tone is set when the young baby's parents are bloodied and killed, and  he is left to the elements in the jungle; I didn't feel that the movie ever  shook that sense of omnipresent dread (and the frequent, manic  vine-swinging/falling from great height montages only fed that sense of  precarious dislocation).  I am wary about letting our younger kids watch  it. At the same time, the simplistic story line doesn't provide enough  dramatic interest to sustain adult attention.
Sad to say, Tarzan left me  cold.  Rent and watch this one before deciding to buy it.
