Through the entire movie I kept saying to myself, "What the?"  An amazingly interesting plot, Being John Malkovich nearly shot itself in  the foot with its odd ball advertising scheme, the trailers and t.v. spots  were so confusing that noone I know wanted to see it.  But I was strangely  intrigued.  So I waited until it was releaed on video and quickly grabbed  it.  I was immediately sucked into the movie within just a minute.  The  style of acting is so real from Cusack, I had never seen him so natural in  a role.  But then the movie takes off, twisting and turning itself into one  of the most original scripts that I've ever seen outside of a film  festival.  I guess thats what happens when you give an original story  financial backing, a movie that really takes off.  This will change your  take on what a movie/script is and can be.  It moves itself very well  towards its climax, and flows so easily that you don't even realize you  were watching a movie until its over. Its definately worth viewing
