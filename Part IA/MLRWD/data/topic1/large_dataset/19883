This is a great movie to see if you like dark comedies about small town America, like I do. I loved this movie as I live in Texas and although I've never been to Carthage, I encounter people like the ones portrayed in this film in every day life, which made it all the more hilarious to me. People criticized this movie for making a comedy about an actual murder. I don't condone murder, but if your being honest, who among us hasn't fantasized of killing that one annoying person who drives us all insane and delights in making everyone's life miserable? Bernie actually did what some of us only dream of doing on occasion, but don't and it's not like he wasn't repentant about the murder. I really liked the unique way it was made, almost like your sitting on a jury listening to why someone felt it necessary to commit such an act, including testimony about the defendant, both pro(mainly pro)and con. Great performances by all- including the big and small name actors. For all these reasons, I would highly recommend it for a great Saturday nights entertainment.
