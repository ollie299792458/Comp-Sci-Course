This was a film I had bought on  the basis that it concerned gambling. I believe it may have been a cross reference product when I purchased "The Cincinnati Kid". Clive Owen I was totally unfamiliar with as an actor. I had never heard of the film, yet it was rated well and relatively inexpensive. So, I took a chance when I ordered it from Amazon.
Well, to put it mildly, I won the Roulette number on this spin of the wheel! Croupier is an excellent picture for the narration of the private thoughts of the character overstriking everyday activities and the James Bond stylistics that form the background.
An ambitious author in search of the great novel is sidetracked by a career as a Croupier. Suddenly he discovers the best material for a book lay in that career and the people that surround him in real life. There is no waste in this film. It is cut almost as well as the greatest cut movie ever made "Casablanca" where not one scene is wasted. There are some violent scenes and I would say it is not for the young. The basic philosophy is the desire to "....the whole world over." (add curse word in front). This theme is repeated several times during the film.
Well, films about gambling and punters are always interesting. This is certainly one of the better ones.
