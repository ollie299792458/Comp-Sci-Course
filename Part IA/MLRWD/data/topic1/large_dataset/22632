The Cure "Trilogy" DVD is "Just Like Heaven" for Cure fans! To hear three landmark albums played in their running order and played so well is amazing. Moments frozen in time from three decades. So many of these songs never made it to a traditional tour stage that to hear them now is treat. Interesting too is the older Cure material played by a newer version of the line-up... fascinating.

The performance is straight ahead music... these are my words and they mean something to me! Robert Smith as always is the focal point of the whole concert... and he is older just like the rest of us and a tad heavier too.

The wonderful aspect is that the words, sounds, and songs hold up... the passion and emotion is there on songs 20 years old and songs 2 years old. What a tour de force.

The encore set offers a stand-out rocking performance of "The Kiss" and just as the show kicks off with a haunting version of "100 Years", "The Kiss" sends the viewer/listener on their way with a blow to the mind.... awsome.

There is a glut of Cure music available but if you own more than one Cure CD then  Cure fans you  need this... Older, wiser, better...
