I hate musicals, with a passion. I even hate people who burst out into song in real life for no apparent reason. It grates my nerves something fierce. But I saw the preview for this and I blind-bought it (mostly because Anthony Stewart Head is in it and I love his acting). I liked it so much I went to a shadowcast of it in a local theater and had a blast. I'm not into things like "Rocky Horror" either, but Repo just has something to it that makes it stand out against most everything else. The cast is pitch perfect for their roles (even Paris Hilton, who seemingly does have some "pipes"). I'd say that if you like rock operas, or if you liked the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode, "Once More with Feeling" or perhaps even Sweeney Todd, (all of which, coincidentally, include Anthony Stewart Head in the cast), Repo is a safe bet.

As for the Bluray portion of this review, the audio is just right and for a lower budget film, it still shines on hi-def visually. It's not as polished and punchy as premier Bluray titles, but that's to be expected given the budget and look of the film.
