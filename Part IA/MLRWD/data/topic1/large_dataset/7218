I saw this a few times as a kid on local tv. I didnt get it then, just thought it "looked cool" and had awesome microscopic ant footage. It really does put you right there alongside the ants. I get it now and love it. Im glad this dvd finally became available on amazon, it was a bestbuy exclusive that soon became nearly impossible to find anywhere. It is an awesome movie and beautifully executed. Directed by title sequence legend Saul Bass (he did every title sequence for Hitchcock), the entire movie is an exercise in great visual composition and design. Interestingly, its small in scope, just a handful of characters in one location out west. But at times it feels vast (especially with all the ant footage) and it works and it is creepy. An unknown cosmic event has the earths scientists baffled as to how we will be effected. Will the oceans rise, will earth quakes destroy everything? One eccentric scientist discovers the effect of the phenomenon, and it nearly goes unnoticed. All the different species of ants begin uniting, killing their natural predators and constructing mysterious monoliths in the desert. Ive said too much, but if you like sci fi in the vein of 2001, the andromeda strain, and the like (made in the late 60s early 70s) then you will dig this movie.
