This movie is far better than it has any right to be, considering the genere it falls into. I saw this movie because I'm a Jack Black fan, but ended up liking the movie far more than I expected. While not mind blowingly intelligent, Orange County surpases most other 'coming of age' flicks or 'teen comedies.' OC actually has a message more responsible and less corny than 'do what you feel' or 'follow your dreams.' Although there is a smattering of the latter (like I said, not a great movie)these staples of the genre are replaced by an occasionally clever theme that ends up with Hanks' character discovering that family (no matter how odd)is ultimately the most inspiring aspect of life. My favorite character in the movie, Schuyler Fisk puts in a solid effort as Shaun's girlfriend Ashley, who is perhaps the most loyal and likeable girlfriend ever seen in any 'teen movie.' It is this character that really brings the movie together (despite her somewhat out-of-place environmentalism). Different enough to distinguish itself in a lackluster genre, Orange County is an endearing and highly likeable movie.
