I am rating this four rather than five stars just because I think Universal is overhyping an inferior reissue that they easily could have gotten right.  They have upgraded the picture quality (which *could* make the upgrade worth it if you've got a really big screen), but it's shameful that they did not include the DTS soundtrack as an option with the normal version (it was previously available as a stand-alone DVD).  The only new extras are two documentaries about the space program and Apollo 13 itself (there are enough of those documentaries already out there for any Apollo fan) and the IMAX version of the film--with a DTS soundtrack option!  The IMAX version is stupendous when seen in an IMAX theater, but to present this edited version (made before IMAX upgraded their film platters to accomodate longer theatrical release conversions) on a DVD makes little sense other than as a throwaway extra.

I saw "Apollo 13" at least seven times during its original theatrical release and three times in IMAX.  The original Dolby Digital DVD was the first DVD I bought.  Back then they issued a separate DTS DVD which I never found in a store, and some people said it lacked some or all of the bonus features so I had not been willing to buy it online just for the superior sound--hey, this was back when Universal SE DVDs were priced at about twice what they are now.  As many separate DD/DTS DVDs were reissued with both soundtracks, I was sure "Apollo 13" would so I never bothered to pick up the DTS version.  Looks like I'll have to wait for the HD release for them to fix this glaring oversight--or now go find the out-of-print DTS version....
