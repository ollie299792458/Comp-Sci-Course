What a spectacle, the numbers and routines take your breath away.  The approach is clever in that the routines are seen through Roxie's dreams, much more acceptable than the old style musical where everyone on the bus starts singing together on cue despite being total strangers.  
The story underlying the glam and glitter is a satire of celebrity status being available for sale , public servants being corruptable and the legal system being open to manipulation.  Some reviewers find this depressing, I agree that it is depressing, depressingly realistic that is.  Despite the lack of "Yellow Brick Road" goodness this is a well written, extremely funny movie that is well worth watching.
The performances from Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere are superb.  Zeta Jones in particular is nothing short of stunning in the "All that Jazz number".
If you are looking for the everything is rosy in the garden musical of old this is not it.  However if you are prepared to open your mind to a satirical musical, look no further.
I think Chicago is worth every award it received and then some.
