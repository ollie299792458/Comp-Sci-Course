He took a security clearance and committed espionage in the release of information, based on his political opinion.

He lied when he said he would honor the protection of classified documents, he handed the enemy a bonanza of information and propaganda points.  He worked hand in hand with a leftist press (not that it's changed, but in fact is even more obvious) to change foreign policy.

He's not a Whistle-Blower, but essentially a traitor.

You now have the intelligence agencies now filled with this type of narcisitic scum.  Disagree with what the elected administration is doing?  Well just cherry pick and release classified information to try and derail it.

These people wrap themselves in the mantle of being oh so special, but simply show how huge an ego they have, that they alone should release the nation's secrets.

You may not agree with policy, but it's not your policy to make.  That's what elections are for.  And if you think a nation shouldn't have secrets, you are simply some naive dreamer that doesn't understand the real world.
