This magnificent film was made more than 50 years ago but you would hardly notice it except for some minor details like its B&W format.

One possible reason is that it is more a theatrical play than a typical movie. Another, that its plot is more deep and elaborated than the average stories of the films of those times (after all it is based on a Shakespeare's work). But without minimizing the weight of those factors, the most probably reason for the timeless enchant of this version of Julius Caesar is the quality of the actors in charge of the story's major players.

Although Louis Calhern was not considered to be a particularly gifted actor, in this film, as a credible Julius Caesar, he gives us what probably was his most brilliant performance. John Gielgud in the rol of Cassius show us why he will later become one of the great supporting actors of the century. The performance of James Mason -in those times at the peak of his career- as a complex Brutus is just magnificent. But the jewel of the crown is without any doubt the impersonation of Marc Anthony by a young and incredibly gifted Marlon Brando. This magnificent crew makes the difference that allows the viewer to enjoy a real masterpiece.

The 5 stars rating given to this item also includes a recognition to the DVD edition's good quality.
