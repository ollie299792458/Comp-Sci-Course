This movie showed up on quite a few "Best Picture" listed when it was released but I didn't really notice it much when it was out. Turns out the acclaim was well-deserved. This is a really good movie, a great  date movie, something both the guys and gals can both enjoy. It's a crime  story and a love story and it crackles with the usual Elmore Leonard  energy. 
I don't watch ER so all I've seen of George Clooney was that  Batman fiasco, and I didn't know much about Jennifer Lopez besides that  overplayed album, but both are excellent, playing people on opposite sides  of the law who find themselves drawn irrestistably toward each other.  Clooney plays Jack Foley, a bank robber who busts out of prison and abducts  Karen Sisco, a U.S. Marshall who is at the jail to pick up a convict for  transport. Even though it's hard to imagine Lopez playing a cop (especially  with all her legal problems and the whole Grammy dress thing), she plays  the part with complete self-assurance. And even though she can't stop stop  thinking about Foley, she's determined to catch the guy who got the upper  hand on her. 
As for Clooney, he shows Foley as a man taken completely by  surprise by his attraction to a woman who is his sworn enemy. He can't stay  away from her, but he had no intention of going back to jail, either. The  rest of the movie is how the pursuer and the pursued change places over and  over, and how both characters go about their business with a great  supporting cast, all the while circling each other, getting closer and  closer. 
A great movie, a fun movie, and I actually liked the movie  ending more than the book ending. You'll have to see the movie to find out  what happens. Definitely a must-rent.
