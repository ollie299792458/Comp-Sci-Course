Guilty as charged: I'm a Sandra Bullock fan so writing this review is pure fun for me. Though I have watched this film many times, it is now that I got a chance to write a review to this truly romantic and funny and heartbreaking film. As a matter of fact, everytime I view this film it never fails me to shed a tear. There are many funny scenes and dialogues in this Bullock film but those who watch this may also agree that there are also
a many sad scenes and feelings in this film. For instance, Sandra
as Lucy all by herself in an apartment with a cat as her companion and her conversation with Peter Gallagher while he's still in coma. Gone are the days for me when I watch a film due to visuals, now I really listen to the dialogue even if the film's script isn't award winning. I believe that's how I get the
substance of the film. Though this film isn't perfect, it's near
perfect. From the first rate stars down to the overall mood of the film. And one of the things I like in the film is its season:
Christmas. Personally,this season brought sad memories for me so it isn't hard to relate to Lucy's situation. I think everyone can
very well relate to Lucy or anybody's character like longing for
someone to love us and the lesson that falling in love is mainly due to the matters of the heart and not by physical thing.
