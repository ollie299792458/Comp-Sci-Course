I own many of Leslie's DVDs because of their simplicity. Her workouts are all based around walking in your own home so anyone at any age can do them, you don't need a lot of space to do them in, and you can do them even if there's inclement weather. I personally do not like to exercise in a place where anyone can see me because I am overweight and I feel like people are thinking, "she needs to exercise a little more." So her DVDs are the perfect solution for me.

The first time I used this DVD, I was on a very strict diet and I was using it everyday. I saw results immediately. On the back of the DVD cover, it states that after only 10 walks, it will have you looking and feeling slimmer. I put that theory to the test then and it worked!

Now I am on Weight Watchers and I am starting this DVD back up again and also will test the theory once again.

I enjoy this DVD because it gives me the option to challenge myself by "boosting" the walk which is really jogging, or to stay low impact by just walking at a fast pace. In this workout, she leads you through interval training which in this case is 3 minutes of fast paced walking then 2 minuets of jogging. You do 5 sets of those.

The production is not the best, the participants look like they need more room, she talks a lot as usual, and you never know if the participants are sweating because of the really bright lights or the workout itself. Those are the only cons I can think of.

Overall, I like this one because it is something different, but it's still basic movements, and I still work up a good sweat.

Yes, I would definitely recommend this to others.
