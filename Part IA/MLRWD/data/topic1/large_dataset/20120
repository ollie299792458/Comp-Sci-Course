If you can switch off the demand for realism from a film for a couple of hours then this is for you. Harrison Ford and Glenn Close start in this Box Office blockbuster about Soviet revolutionaries who hijack the US Presidential place (Air Force One) and the heroic one-man battle against them in the guise of the US President who remains aboard the plane. Gary Oldman plays Egor Korshunov, a trigger-happy terrorist who fires at will and is prepared to sacrifice his life for "Mother Russia" whilst Glenn Close's negotiating skills bring for an interesting aside to the main plot. As I mentioned, it is essential that the flying scenes (look for the one at the start involving their return to the air) and rescue scenes are not taken as rigorous to the truth as, in many respects, they are as flimsy as the security systems aboard Air Force One.
In general this is not a bad film (after all, the Box Office ratings were good) and as far as typical blockbusters go, I could probably watch it again. Some good special effects improve it and there is always something going on, it could be argued that there are some holes in the plot but then nothing is going to be perfect! Definitely watchable but don't rush out to get it.
