I wasn't expecting much when I originally saw this film, and even half-way through watching it I wasn't sure really if I liked it or not. Though the look and sound is very stylish (the soundtrack is particularly interesting and original in a movie like this), sometimes the cuts and filmwork are rather jarring and draw too much attention to themselves. The entire movie almost looks like an MTV video, and yet it's hard to deny that all of this brings with it a definite atmosphere that works in spite of itself.
Even though Stallone stars in "Get Carter," I would not call it an action flick as much as a thriller. The action scenes are brief and relatively scarce, yet still intense when they roll around in the later stages. This puts more focus on the plotline, which is very rarely ever a bad thing. Still, the plot can sometimes be hard to follow, and by the end of the movie there remain a great deal of loose ends that were never tied up. In fact, you'll wonder if the vast majority of the bad guys were killed or just wounded, which is mostly a result of the film's artistic lisence. Sylvester's character, however, makes a charming hero you want to follow to the end. He may once not have been such a great guy, but there is certainly a strong moral fiber embedded within him, espesially where his family is concerned.
When the credits rolled I realized that "Get Carter" is a unique film, sometimes confused, and yet ultimately entertaining, and fans of action-thrillers (and Stallone) should definitely give it a look.
