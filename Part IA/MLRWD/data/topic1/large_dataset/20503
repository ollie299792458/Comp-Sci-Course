Dressed to Kill is Brian DePalma's attempt to give audiences whiplash,it's basically an exercise in style and trickery.The first half is undeniably great with some of the best scenes DePalma has ever created.A sexually frustrated Angie Dickinson tracks an attractive mysterious stranger through a musuem in the film's best sequence(Shortened on T.V.).In this long wordless cat and mouse sequence her search through the museum is accompanied by Pino Donaggio's music that mirrors her rising anxiety.It is one of the best combinations of music and film ever made.A little later on is a terrific harrowing elevator death scene that's DePalma's equivalent to Hitchcock's shower scene in Psycho.Unfortunately the film can't match these 2 scenes as it goes on.There's a routine investigation conducted by the son and a hooker former DePalma wife Nancy Allen(Whose mom used to reportedly complain "Why can't Brian get you any nice roles?")and the movie ends with a dirty trick that's a cheat.Dressed to Kill may turn silly in the 2nd half but it has enough moments of stylish brillance throughout to make it a lot of fun.Just don't expect a lot of substance...
