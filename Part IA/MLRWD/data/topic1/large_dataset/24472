Ordered recently from Amazon through GoHastings with a great low price & fast delivery of this used Blu Ray in excellent condition with no marks on the case and absolutely no scratches. However, the Blu Ray would freeze up about 20 minutes in to the movie. I was able to restart from a much later scene only to have it freeze up again and again. I did speak to GoHasting who has a 30 day return policy with a free mailing label to return the defective blu ray and upon receipt they will issue a refund. I also learned that they have 140 stores and that each store manager is suppose to run each blu ray through a machine that checks for defects before it ships. Sounds good. So how did I end up with a defective blu ray? The only conclusion I can come up with is that someone didn't do their job, or the machine that checks the blu ray for defects is also defective!! GoHastings did admit that they have been getting a high number of returns on this item. I believe the manufacturer is ultimately to blame for creating a defective batch of blu rays in the first place. I know I'm not alone, and others have received some of the bad batch. You may be lucky and get one that actually works. I hope you get one that works. They can't all be from the bad batch. I will try to order again. I feel lucky.

Update: I received my refund from GoHastings after 10 days which included the cost of the used Blu Ray plus the shipping. I decided to re-order the exact same used Blu Ray of Eagle Eye from GoHasting. In less than a week, I had received the used Blu Ray with some red markings on the case in the upper corner on the back. No big deal. Guess what? It played perfectly. Not one problem. No freezing up on this one. I am completely satisfied and will continue to order from GoHastings.
