First, one thing I love about this movie is recognizing the actors that were in another classic Jimmy Stewart/Frank Capra film called "It's A Wonderful Life" (you may have heard of it!).  Actors like Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, and HB Warner all have parts in both films with Jimmy Stewart and they all have one thing in common: greatness.  Add to that great performances by Jean Arthur and Claude Rains, and this may be one of the greatest American underdog stories of all time.  What makes this great is that the story unfolds slowly but perfectly, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat as you think that Jimmy Stewart can't possibly overcome.  As he delivers his speeches, the words are really touching and that says a lot about a movie that came out over 65 years ago!  This is one of those timeless movies that must be watched and should be required by high school Government classes on a rainy day.  Jimmy Stewart proves he is one of the greatest actors of all time (my personal favorite!).  Few movies can entertain as well as captivate as well as give you goosebumps, but this is one of those movies.  A pure classic!
