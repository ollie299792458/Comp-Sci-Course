This is one of the few movies that I have been able to watch repeatedly without growing tired of it.  I have read the review that suggests that it could have been fleshed out more into an epic (and that would have been great) but, as it is, I found that the story moved well and the action sequences were amazing.

I have heard some complaints from well-known movie critics regarding such things as "he wasn't a warrior but could suddenly fight" and "he learned the norse language very quickly".  The thing is that this movie gives us all of the information that we require to reconcile everything that happens.  We are told at the beginning that he is a minor noble working as a poet.  This means that he is educated and has been trained in swordplay but (as he says) he is not a warrior, meaning that he has never been in actual battle.  I took it that his gift with language aided him in learning the norse dialect.  The movie was historically accurate right down to the Arabian horse that he was riding which, at that time, would have been a distict cut above any Eurasian horses in terms of speed and agility.

In response to another review on this board, he did not meet the vikings in Iraq but was up into Russia at the time and vikings are known to have travelled far into Asia on the river systems.
