To the Nay-sayers of this film.

First of all, yes, the dysfunctional family is over the hill in film-age.  However, I felt that there was some originality with the camera work if not so much the story-line.  As far as the characters, Alan Arkin did a TREMENDOUS job pulling in the audience to really love him for his great qualities, while ignoring the bad ones.  Not just any actor could do that, and thus Alan's win for best supporting actor.

Next, I would say that this movie suffers from the "Sideways-Syndrome".  A lot of people HATED Sideways simply because it was marketed as a pure hilarious comedy.  Sideways did have a lot of very funny lines and moments, but narrowminded viewers think that movies should only be in one category or the other.  Comedy mixed with an overall dramatic film was too much for some viewers to handle, and they missed out.

The dark comedy along with painful realizations of real life drama (losing a loved one, fighting social stereotypes and expectations) provides a beautiful build up for triumph; a triumph which is the FUNNIEST MOMENT ON FILM IN THE PAST 5-10 YEARS.  This is slow painful build up, gives the viewer such a release of happiness, which is the film's strongest point.

And finally, if you are going to be a 'Hater', give more reasoning than "This movie was a waste of time...."  because those kind of "reviews" are a waste of time in themselves.
