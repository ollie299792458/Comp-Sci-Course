James Cameron was sued by Harlan Ellison for taking the Outer Limits episodes "Soldier" and "Demon with a Glass Hand" and tuning them into the Terminator series. Michael Crichton could've got a piece of that, as his story involves a murderously minded robot that relentlessly pursues our hero. Even the poster for the films have torn-faced robots menacing the viewer.

Crichton first try at an amusment-center-gone-amok story, used again in Jurrasic Park, was this terrific tale of robot revenge. He not only wrote but directed the picture, and with solid filmic storytelling at that. If you enjoy the genre referred to as "steampunk" (mixing historical and SF elements) than this movie's for you.

Interestingly this film was made during the height of the "revisionist" western film cycle of the early seventies, best exemplified by Philip Kaufman's "The Great Northfield Minnestota Raid." This was a period where the classic approach to the western was no longer in fashion. Ford, Hawks, Wayne, and even the Italians, were pretty much done with the genre. By the end of the seventies the cowboy was replaced by the space cowboy, such as Han Solo.
