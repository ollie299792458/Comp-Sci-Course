Music taste is a very personal thing, so perhaps music reviews are a waste of time unless aimed at existing fans of the artist or performer. This, however, is one of those rare concert experiences that you just want to share with everyone! It's the only music DVD I've ever bought having not previously experienced the artist's music. I bought it on the strength of the amazon reviews alone. Sure, in this day and age, it's apparently easy to fool many people much of the time, but surely SO MANY people couldn't virtually ALL be wrong??? No, having now experienced the DVD, I reckon the rave reviews were absolutely spot on!

Yanni's compositions are brought to life in a spectacular orchestral experience - combining new age, classical and contemporary music - highlighted by a refreshingly varied world mix of supremely talented musicians. It sweeps you along for a journey that will move you - both in body and soul.

The full depth of this concert is best enjoyed through a fairly competent hi-fi system or better (surround and 2-channel are both catered for) - not least because the soundtrack recordings are as good as the best I've ever experienced. Just remember to 'make nice' with the neighbours first, as that volume control is headed in one direction only!
