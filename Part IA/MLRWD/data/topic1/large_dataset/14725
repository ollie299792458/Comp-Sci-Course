I watched the movie, I laughed at the jokes, I understand the plot but I simply cannot accept this movie as a defence-in-disguise of a regime that was positively criminal in nature. The mother in this movie is a diehard Communist-by-conviction. She is consistently portrayed as a good, idealistic Commie who had been let down by those evil power-hungry Commies - the subtle punchline being that Communist ideals are OK whereas the Cold War implementation in the Eastern Bloc was bad. Having lived on the wrong side of the Iron curtain for some time, I personally think that it was not just the implementation but that the Communist ideals are inherently flawed.

As the title of my review points out, most intelligent people would not accept a similar movie made on the basis of any other inhuman regime of the present or the past. Imagine a plot where a German Frau falls in a coma in March 1945, wakes up a few months later and her kids put up a show pretending the Fuhrer is still in charge. That would not be a great movie, it would be a scandal. And don't even get me started on Good bye, Jefferson Davis.

Look, the movie is entertaining, it is reasonably well done and it may even be educational for those who want to learn about the moods and public opinion in Germany around the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall. But I cannot accept as great work of art something that makes the point of (even indirectly) defending oppression, inhumanity and intolerance. Hence 2 stars.
