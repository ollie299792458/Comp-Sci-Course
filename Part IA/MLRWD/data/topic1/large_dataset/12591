admittedly i had absolutely no intrest in seeing this movie in the theaters. it wasn't until i was bored one night and happened to catch it on television that the movie stirred my intrest.

the theaterical version is incomplete. there are many additional details in the director's cut that are quite significant to the plot of the movie that the theatrical version simply either leaves out or glosses over. granted, the moments time wise are very brief, but things such as Sybilla having a son, or Balian's memories of his wife, add depth to the history of the characters and their motivations that you do not necessarily grasp in the theatrical version.

that having been said, if you are someone with any disillusions regarding traditional definitions of christianity and what it means to be christian, then this movie will provide a point of view that you may find intellectually stimulating.

there are so many awesome actors that were part of this film, it is unfortunate that marketers chose to headline the film with only Orlando Bloom (who plays his role appropriately, regardless of what people would say about his breadth of acting ability).  Liam Neeson, Edward Norton, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis - all very well regarded actors who played important roles in the film. Even Alexander Siddig (from deep space 9) played his role so well i didn't recognize him.
