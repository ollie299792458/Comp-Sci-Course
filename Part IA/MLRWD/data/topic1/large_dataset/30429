After 58 reviews, it's hard to add anything new, so I'll be brief.

It took me an hour to disconnect from this movie after it ended.  I'm not a fan of the "handheld camera" technique, so it took me a while to adjust to it.  However, the technique worked well inside the plane.  Anything else might have seemed less real, more Hollywood.

As another reviewer noted, it would have been nice to have seen some reactions from people on the ground receiving calls from their loved ones trapped in the doomed plane.  It's probaby impossible to imagine going about your day and then getting such a call.  Maybe it's too intense and was not included for that reason.  I also expected some scenes of the people who leapt to their deaths from the towers rather than be burned alive.  Afterward, I was glad the movie didn't show pregnant women smashing into the pavement far below.

Putting aside those issues, this is a "must see" movie.  People need a reminder that our Islamofascist enemies cannot be bargained with.  They have and will continue sawing off the heads of anyone, even another Muslim, who doesn't completely submit to their version of Islam.  For them, it's 100% their way or no way.  No negotiation is possible.  No middle ground exists.  And they are not afraid to die in the process of killing you, your kids, your loved ones, your friends, and everything else in the world, including ideas, that they don't accept.

If you think the US brought this attack upon itself, explain what the US did to bring similar attacks upon the Russians, the Buddhists, and the Hindus.  The modus operandi is clear, as UNITED 93 reminds us.  The terrorists weren't conflicted about who their enemy was and what they were doing.

When the time for action came, neither were the passengers.  In their own, brave way, they were leaders then and still are now.

As the film site says:  Never forget.
