I truly loved, strike that, really liked this flick. To love this movie is perhaps an obsession saved for the pages of a Stephen King novel or a sign that I need help. This movie is very, very violent both overtly and passively. You are left with a sense that New York is nothing but a cesspool. While many non-New Yorkers might agree, I think its gritty cinematography and dialogue, really work to amplify the murderer's personality. Not only is he deadly insane, but also he is the deadliest in a world filled with violence.
In addition, I think the movie has an originality that makes you smack your forehead and wonder why you hadn't written it first. It is the perfect tale where we all already understand the symbols and the motivations, but they are turned on their head. It was as if Hieronymus Bosch was the writer and we are looking at the modern day incarnation of the last panel of the Garden of Earthly Delights. In essence, the grotesque is used to shock, but also to teach us. The lesson could be religious or the fact great horrors have been committed under religion's banner. Or, which is most likely, that films are simply to make money. 
This movie has great acting beyond its violent and disturbing story. It is so good I don't think there is a movie studio that could afford to ever reassemble the four key actors to make another movie-Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, &amp; Gwenyth Paltrow. This power pack puts the story beyond other disturbing tales like Kubrick's Clockwork Orange into a lasting package that, had it been a more tame topic, would be a standard on television for years. This movie belongs only a notch bellow the pinnacle of serial killer movies, Silence of the Lambs, and light years beyond such utterly awful attempts like Hannibal &amp; Copy Cats. This is a great movie, but definitely not for children or the faith of heart.
