Since Deborah Kerr passed away last week, I feel compelled to write a review of this wonderful motion picture which, after more viewings than I can even count, remains in my top five alltime favorites.  Yes, the movie is corny.  Yes, it's mostly unbelievable.  What two people, so in love as Terry and Nicky, would promise to meet in six months and have absoloutely no contact with each other during the six months?  I like to think of it as a test of their love.  After all, they gained some depth of character while on the ship together.  I like to think that they wanted to see if the changes in themselves would last.  Yes, it's unbelievable that Nicky would not try to find Terry when she didn't show up atop the Empire State Building.  Yes, it's unbelievable that Terry would not tell Nicky why she wasn't there.  But, It's a movie, for goodness sakes.  And movies, at least for me, are about escapism.  They're not about the "real world."  They are a place I go to fantasize, to dream, to cry tears of happiness.  This classic love story gives me all of these 'places.' And it gives me so much more.  I only wish that those days were not long gone from the hills of Hollywood.

Deborah kerr was 86 years old when she passed away last week.  But, to me, she will always be Terry McKay who, once upon a time on a cruise ship, fell in love with Nicky Ferrante and who, after going through hell, found her way back into his arms sitting on a couch beside a warm fireplace at Christmas time.
