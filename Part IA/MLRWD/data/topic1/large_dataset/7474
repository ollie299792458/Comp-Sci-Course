I bought this movie with mixed feelings, I read all the reviews about how the movie was all about alba and walker showing a lot of skin, and nothing else going on.  In the other hand I also read some reviews that said the cinematogrophy was excelent. so I bought it, and I'm happy I did. the movie is not a five star movie, and maybe not a four, but it is fun to watch, it was mastered in HD, and I love the way it looks on my hdtv!  I'm not going to lie, I do love the fact that Jessica Alba has a great body, but this movie does have a lot of great parts.  and watching on HD makes it even better, the underwater scenes are some of the best I seen, exept for a cheesy shark attack late in the film nothing looks out of place and the actors swim next to big sharks without being nervous and I bet that took a while to get them used to the fact that the sharks were not going to attack them.  I say if you are looking for something bright and lively to watch this is it, a good way to spend a couple of hours in front of your tv.
