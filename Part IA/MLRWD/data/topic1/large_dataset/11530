Four DVD's and they have some pretty good shorts in my opinion. The features which give a lot of history about these artists is fantastic. My 3 grandkids loved them and thankfully are not brought up with just the crappy cartoons of today. While I realize some of these classic cartoons are still shown once in awhile on TV, why not more?  Warner Brothers closed down these artists because television needing something every week could not keep up with the demand and put out such quality.  My idea?  Forget about needing to produce 52 weeks of new material. Show quality as often as you can produce it. Maybe they are right... maybe the artists of today just can't compare with these, but why not give them a try?  Who has given anyone a try to produce anything that looks like these?  The only reason crappy cartoons are on is because no one cares or can influence big corporations like WB to do it again. Produce 12 a year and show them 4 times a month and the public would scream positively (or at least I think they would).
