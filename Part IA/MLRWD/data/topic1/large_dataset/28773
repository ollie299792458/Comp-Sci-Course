The director/composer team of Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone is perhaps the greatest, most creative team in movie history, and this is perhaps their greatest collaborative work of art. Far from being simply a "shoot-em-up" or an Eastwood vehicle, "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" depicts a ruthless world of violence and greed, then couches touching moments of genuine tenderness amist all the chaos. The effect is a surprising sort of affirmation of life lived in peril, and of unlikely friendship.
Consider the moment when Tuco climbs aboard the wagon with Blondie after having argued with his brother, the priest. These two men are mortal enemies, but Clint obviously realizes how hurt Tuco really is. In one of the most nuanced scenes of all time, Tuco says (if I remember correctly),
"Still, I know that there's a brother out there that never denyed me a bowl of soup."
To which Blondie responds,
"Yeah...and after a big meal, there's nothing like a good cigar." At which point Blondie passes his cigar to Tuco, one of those classic Morricone cues comes sweeping in, and Tuco smiles as the duo rides off together to take on the world. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. If you enjoy this picture (and how could you not!), I highly recommend Morricone/Leone's OTHER greatest movie, "Once Upon A Time In The West," with Hendry Fonda. If anything, THIS is more the sister film to "..The Ugly" than either of the "Dollars" movies. Not yet available on DVD, unfortunately.
