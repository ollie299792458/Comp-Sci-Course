Blow Up has its strong points in that it's a fine representational time-capsule of London in the sixties.  Notable is how rapidly the culture was changing and how its attitudes still reverberate today.

Aesthetically, I find it interesting that many films of the sixties look cleaner and crisper than many from the seventies decade.. they even feel relatively more modern in comparison.  I don't think anyone has ever satisfactorily explained this phenomenon to me, other than something happened to film stocks in the 70s that didn't preserve well.

Blow Up is a hybrid art-meets-commercial endeavor.  But it cannot be both things at once and not do a bit to undermine itself.  Aesthetically, It is very well composed but I found its pacing and mannered acting very frustrating.  Characters move  as if in a slow-motion funk and then they randomly jerk about.  It's like they attended the school of Ritalin-method acting.  In one scene, David Hemming goes skipping up the path on the way to the park, clicking his heels together midflight --made me laugh and cringe!  Somthing not right with that boy.

Yes, evaluated in the context of its time, Blow Up does deserve meritorious honor among the canon of must-see movies in your Cinema 101 class.

Maybe I just gave myself away; that I'm not into the literati approach to this film --like I'm required to strain it through my teeth like a fine wine and evaluate its bouquet.  Let's just say I'd watch it over most contemporary films (especially anything with Tom Cruise)  but it didn't get me any more excited than a six'er of Papst.
