Prof. Finkelstein. Is he a saint or the devil? Neither, but I do think he is honest.

His parents were Holocaust survivors and his mother's life centered around her experiences during her captivity. It affected her profoundly and Prof. Finkelstein has taken her lessons to heart. When he sees injustice being done by the Israeli government, he is bewildered and upset by it.

However, he seems to be looking at the problem from one side only. When you ONLY look at one side of this conflict, it is very easy to take heart with that side.

Some (e.g. Alan Dershowitz) see him as a Jew-hater. I believe this opinion is as shallow as it is ridiculous. Jews everywhere have ostracized him, so it is understandable to me how Finkelstein has lost his affinity for the Jewish faith and taking issue with Israeli policies does not make one a Jew-hater.

Some problems I have with Finkelstein:

In the film, he says that his parents had no problems with his outspoken views, but at another point, he admits that his mother thought she had created another FRANKENSTEIN.

Though I think Prof. Finkelstein is indeed a creation of his parents upbringing, he (unfortunately) likes to look at issues (e.g. the Israel/Palestine conflict) from only one side.  NOTE:  This is not a unique quality!  Most people like to look at only one side of a problem and then come to a conclusion.  The only thing that makes Finkelstein unique, is that he is a Jew who doesn't latch on to the Jewish/Israeli narrative.  This doesn't make his viewpoint more valid.

This film won't tell you everything about Finkelstein's opinions, but it will give you a good look into this troubled man's soul.
