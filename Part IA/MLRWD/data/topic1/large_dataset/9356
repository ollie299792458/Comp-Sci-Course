(3 and 1/2 stars) Free of the novel's lousy ending, the film version of "Hannibal" contains enough suspense and atmosphere to make it worth a viewing.  Agent Starling's detective work is fairly involving, and some of the scenes are remarkable in the way they are constructed and their intensity.  I'm thinking particularly of the "Cat and Mouse" scene where Starling pursues Lecter through the shopping mall.  Even while I was repulsed by the "Dinner" scene near the end -- the only scene that justifies the kind of "gross-out" descriptions some critics gave the movie, it fit in well with the Lecter characters actions elsewhere and gave a measure of comeupance to Ray Liotta's character (certainly beyond what he deserved!).  Taken as a whole, it was an entertaining flick, well directed by Ridley Scott and well acted, but nowhere near as great as "Silence of the Lambs."
As for the double-disc DVD edition, the director's commentary on the "feature" disc is fairly typical of such DVD commentaries.  It does contain several interesting items of info.  The 2nd "special features" disc is a cornucopia of background details, including dozens of movie poster variations, the usual "cast &amp; crew" dossiers, 14 deleted or alternate scenes, etc.  Definitely check out the "alternate ending" with Scott's comments, and decide for youself if you agree with the ending chosen for the film.
