This movie is great, it shows poverty for what it really is.  The true story of 2 kids growing up in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  One of them ( Rocket )grows up well, the other ( Lil Ze )grows up horribly.  It seemed that that was the focus of the movie.  Well, that, and to show how hopeless the whole situation down there is.  The whole thing builds up to the documentary portion found in the ' Special Features ' option.  But watch the actual movie first.  The documentary definetely verifies how corrupt things are down there.  With an interview with the chief of police where he admits that the Brazilian Police force are corrupt, and he maintains that it has to be that way " otherwise I wouldn't be able to get my special wednesday night dinners at the country club ".  If this is the chief of police down there, then the situation is truly hopeless and perhaps an A-bomb would be the best option for the City of God.  Not actually, but I'm just trying to get a point across.  Watch the movie, but don't forget the documentary in the ' Special Features ' because it is way  better than the movie itself.
