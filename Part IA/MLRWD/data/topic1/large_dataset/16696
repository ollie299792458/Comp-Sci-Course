"The Edge" is without doubt one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. The flick is outstanding on virtually every level: cinematography, acting, suspense, score, locations, etc. 
Three men get stranded in the remote Northwest wilderness. The plane crash that causes this predicament has got to be the best such scene ever filmed -- it looked very real. Although nature itself presents some harrowing dangers for these men (especially in the form of a kodiak bear), two of them find out that their biggest danger is HUMAN nature -- in the form of covetousness, adultery, greed and murder.
Anthony Hopkins stars as an intellectual billionaire who is insecure about his accumulated wealth of (seemingly useless) knowledge, his money and his beautiful model wife played by Elle MacPherson. He's not sure who he can trust, or who is really his friend just for the sake of such. He's a bit paranoid that people will naturally assume his sexy wife married him just for his money. And he suspects that she's having a fling with her photographer, played by Alec Baldwin.
All this is the character backdrop to what is essentially a grand survival adventure. The entire mid-section of the film involves their encounter with the bear that stalks them. This chapter of the story could be called "Claws" ("Jaws" with a bear). The men work themselves up into a savage frenzy in determination to kill the bear. The final scene with the bruin has great suspense.
After this Hopkins and Baldwin face their greatest natural threat: eachother.
