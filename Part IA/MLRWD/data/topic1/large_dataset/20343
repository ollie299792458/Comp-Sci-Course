My wife purchased this movie for our collection and I just finished watching it, and I must say I thought the movie itself was alright, but it could have been so much more than what it was. Historically, the viewer is left with little background and some inaccuracies are evident. Christian Bale's dialouge using a psuedo-southern accent was if anything, annoying. I agree that Depp's portrayal of "Gentleman Johnny" is a lot more of a somber and subdued character than the real Dillinger (from the books I've read). That being said, the action sequences I thought were well done and I was surprised by the accuracy of the sound and weapons that were utilized by the men on both sides. All in all, I thought Depp and Bale did a good job, and any blame for the faults of this film should lie solely with the director and producers. If you want historical accuracy, I suggest you avoid this movie. If you're just looking for a good shoot'em up, then I'd reccommend it. This film, I thought was good, but could have been a lot better.
