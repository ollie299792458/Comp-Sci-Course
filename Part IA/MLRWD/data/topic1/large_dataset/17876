The movie centres on Logan, a quiet loner who doesn't fit in at school. Most of the other kids ignore Logan but one or two actively dislike him and make it abundantly clear. A geeky boy called Joey is Logan's only friend, although all they really have in common is that they have nothing in common with the rest of the kids at school. They're really just two lonely kids thrown togther by the need for friendship and yet unable to completely cross the divdies that seperate them from each other and from everyone else. Then, one day, one of the in-crowd, a popular older called Rodeo, notices Logan and Logan's life is changed forever.

This is a movie that tries hard to be stylish and relevant and it mostly succeeds. the production values are excellent as is the acting, especially of the three main characters. Although deliberately stylized the movie does manage to caputure the awkwardness and infatuations that lay at the essence of adolescence. In short it smells like teen spirit but liberally doused in mum's perfume.
