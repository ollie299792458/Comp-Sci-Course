I will make this very easy for you....buy all three seasons, only watch them in the proper order, at least for the first time through, and you will be rewarded with the most unbelievable viewing experience.  This is without a doubt the funniest, best acted, best written British TV show ever.  The League of Gentlemen are the 3 best actors I have ever seen.  Each play around 30 characters in the 3 seasons, most of which are reoccurring characters that come alive and evolve over the course of the show.  Every so often, new characters come in and go, but the core characters endear and grow.
That is why it is very important to watch this in the proper order as the characters grow, you grow with them.  This troupe of 3 male actors is best when portraying women, which seems to be an English thing, but all of the characters are amazing.
Listen....I cannot do this series justice here.  I can only tell you that if you watch this show from beginning to end, it will become clear.  The end of the show is just perfect.  The characters all fall into place.  They all make sense and you will understand the genius of the 4 who wrote the series, and the 3 of them who bring the characters to life.
Please, I beg you, try it...you will not believe how well crafted it is.
