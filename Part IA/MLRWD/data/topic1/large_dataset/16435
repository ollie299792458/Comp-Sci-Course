Firstly, I'm a huge fan of Jackie Chan and his work, but I just can't give this movie a good review. It is one of the most depressing films I've seen. Basic plot synopsis; Jackie has to watch all of his team members be executed, he is given an opportunity to save each one and fails each time. So thats the first 20 or 30 minutes of the film and all his closest friends are dead. The next portion of the film deals with him trying to drink himself to death. Then we watch his relationship with his fiance fall apart. Then we get to see one of the gang members being abused by his father. and thats at least two thirds of the film.

And then there's the whole subplot about the gang members making a video game out of all the people they kill so the good guys have to play the game in order to figure out what bank they're going to rob next. Kind of cheesy.

As I said, I really like Jackie Chan and he does display some really good acting talent in this film. But I don't like waiting until the last 20 minutes of the movie to see some good action and fight scenes especially when I just had to sit through some of the most depressing stuff I've ever seen.
