Got the DVD in with great anticipation.  Having previously watched this concert production of Les Miserables on VHS, I had high expectations of improved audio and video with the DVD.  In this regard, I have been somewhat disappointed.
The conversion from analog to digital to produce the DVD caused far more video quirks than I have seen in any DVD - artifacts, washed out details, unusual dithering patterns, blurry still pictures, etc.  The audio also does not live up to my expectations for a DVD - pops, clicks, and strange sound variations including drop-outs.  
One other irritating oddity - a true "two-sided" DVD.  This means you have to take it out, flip it over, and re-insert it in your player.  With the common availability of dual layer DVD's of high capacity, the need to flip this disk over to play the entire production is an inconvenience.
The performances contained in the disk are overall superb and do an honor to Boublil and Schoneberg's musical.  It is unfortunate that the recording quality is not up to the performer's level.
Now, as harsh as I have been on the production of the DVD, I cannot imagine a true LesMisarables fan not having this DVD in their collection, although don't expect it to be better than the VHS.
