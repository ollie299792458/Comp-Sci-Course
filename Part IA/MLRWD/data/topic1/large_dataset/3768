If you're a fan of the campy Vincent Price horror genre, you will love "The Tingler". The idea here is that the tingling feeling we get when we are scared is not adrenalin after all, it is really a lobster growing on our backbones. The creature is called, surprisingly enough, the Tingler. The Tingler would continue to grow until it killed us, except for the fact that it dies (and apaprently also disappears) when it hears a scream. Pathologist Price is on the  hunt to be the first to capture this creature (and with no regard for the safety of anyone). Some of the characters in this film are stranger than the Tingler - especially the owner of the movie house and his wife. Might be a little necrophilia going on here behind the curtain. Price's cheating wife is also a jewel - I'll bet you can't guess what happens to her... There is also an interesting gimmick with the film's original release, one that is fully explained in the DVD, but unfortunately not one we can share with the theatre-going audience. This is one you'll watch more than once.
