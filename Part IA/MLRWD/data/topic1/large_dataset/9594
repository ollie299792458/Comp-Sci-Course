This review covers both box sets, as well as the character Mr Moto for newcomers.

You're heard of Jackie Chan, but his lesser-known spiritual cousin Mr Moto is far less famous.

Throughout the late 30s/ealry 40s, Peter Lorre traded on his unconventional looks and perfect sense of timing in Hollywood "quickies". The resulting series, Mr Moto, is now brought to you in two box sets, beautifully restored, at a bargain price. If you come at this a rookie, as I did, there are many great pleasures to be had:

First, Peter Lorre. This is before he succumbed to self-parody, as a Hollywood newcomer fresh from Germany, and his huge successes there both in Fritz Lang's masterpiece M, and stage work for Brecht. Lorre makes this unique hero endlessly engaging, playing up Moto's coy charm and deceptive use of stereotypes.

Second, the films themselves. The formula is impressively efficient, up to 75 minutes of breezy, playful fun, with exotic locations, impressive - given the conceit - production values, and enough nostalgia to find a place in your heart. While some of the subplot romantic leads may be horrid actors and painfully bland, watching Moto run circles around them only enhances the viewing pleasure.

Third, the love. Most of these films were directed by Norman Foster, and while many historical documents reveal his contempt for the original material he was handed, you can't help but respect the work he put in trying to elevate it as much as he could, from reworking the script to delivering a breezy direction, replete with some really nifty fight scenes (an anarchic bar fight in Mysterious Mr Moto is a particular case in point).

Now for a quick episode guide:

- Think Fast, Mr. Moto (box set 1): our entry point and a great start, mysteries on a cruise ship, and some occasionally ruthless action from Mr Moto (5 stars)

- Thank You, Mr. Moto (box set 1): some Oriental mystery and tomb-raiding in this China-bound adventure. This one feels more like an exploitation-Tintin crossover, with some fun to be had despite some painful racial stereotyping (3 stars)

- Mr Moto Takes a Chance (box set 1): a wild adventure this one, also part Indiana Jones, but with the absurdity-factor amped up. Solid fun (4 stars)

- Mysterious Mr. Moto (box set 1): this one is more in the Arthur Conan-Doyle tradition, plots within plots, a mysterious league and some death-traps. As good as Mr Moto gets (5 stars)

- Mr Moto's Gamble (box set 2): some boxing action in this one, with Mr Moto in more of an observer's role, Gamble was not directed by Forster, and while there are some interesting new stylistic flourishes, this adventure lacks a bit of focus. It also saddles Moto with some annoying comic relief (3 stars)

- Mr Moto's Last Warning (box set 2): some international intrigue and pretty nasty villains in this adventure, definitely one of the better installments (5 stars)

- Mr Moto on Danger Island (box set 2): another non-Foster directed installment, this time with a hint of Agatha Christie, and Mr Moto teaching judo to a dimwitted but loyal wrestler (3.5 stars)

- Mr Moto's Vacation (box set 2): a fan-favorite, this one. Artifacts, a mysterious nemesis, traps in a museum, and masked villains. The irritating posh English comic relief is wearing thin, but everything else is pitch-perfect (4.5 stars)

The films do not share a specific chronological link, but the first film in box set 1 gives a more rounded introduction of the character. There has also been some complaint that quality dips in box set 2, which sometimes goes overboard on the comic relief. I have to confess I bought them both, after reading the excellent Lorre biography "The Lost One" and just went on a Moto binge, culminating, oddly and antichronologically, with M. Watching them in this quick a succesion does help you poke more fun at the formula (mystery + endangered romance subplot + hapless comic-relief + wink-wink ending) but also provides an interesting insight into how maleable the formula is.

Thank you Fox for releasing these.
