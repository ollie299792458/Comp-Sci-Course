My review just deals with the movie "Seventh Planet from the Sun".  I find these old sci fi films interesting because it shows what we thought we knew back at that time period, for example, Uranus having a solid surface.  I also like how when the crew flies past Saturn, the rings of the planet are fairly blury, just as it would be seen through the old telescopes of that day and not the actual tac sharp rings we see from the Voyager probe flybys.

I also find interesting how this movie made in 1962 has a fairly similar story theme to Stanislaw Lem's "Solaris" written in 1961.  The crew of a space ship start seeing people from their past, somehow connected to an alien intelligence and being manipulated through these created beings.  In Solaris the lead Kelvin rekindles his love for his departed wife suggesting to take her back to earth and warned by the avatar that she could not live away from Solaris, in Seventh Planet, it seems all the boys are smitten with their own girl from the past and the lead does bring back his love only to have her disappear on the way home.  Of course this movie's alien is much simplified in that it sees the earth men just as invaders and "they must die" although, like in Solaris, there is a scene from Seventh in which one of the bombshells talks of the alien intelligence as being separate from her and speculates about it.  What's interesting is that Uranus is really a great ocean just like the planet Solaris.
