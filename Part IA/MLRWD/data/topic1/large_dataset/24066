When Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in Paul Verhoeven's "Total Recall" in 1990, he was at the peak of his career as a Hollywood action icon. While many of the entries in Arnold's oeuvre are thinly-plotted, absurdly over-the-top affairs, Verhoeven's intelligence and proclivity for satire (see also: "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VD5I94">Robocop</a>," "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAFDP2">Starship Troopers</a>") and a finely-honed screenplay allowed both director and star to create an action film that works on multiple levels -- literally, a fun, ultraviolent romp about a secret agent saving Mars, but laced with the ambiguity that it all may or may not be happening in the main character's head, staying true to the thematic concerns of Philip K. Dick's literary source material.

Despite being a global smash hit, "Total Recall" has previously only been available on Blu-ray in the US with a recycled, smeared transfer that in no way does the film justice and only a short featurette as the sole extra. Fortunately, Lionsgate has finally remedied this by coinciding the release of this "Mind-Bending Edition" with the theatrical debut of the remake.

The video transfer is absolutely filmic in appearance, with vivid colors and fine grain and detail throughout. I have read complaints that the picture is too bright, preventing true blacks, and there were several instances where I thought noticed such an effect, but honestly I wasn't too bothered. The film is over 20 years old and one of the last to feature extensive optically-composited effects; it can't and won't look like Avatar, although for its age the presentation is quite impressive. Approved by Verhoeven himself, this transfer is undoubtedly the best the film has looked in quite some time.

Sound is about par for a film of this type and age. The track isn't reference quality, but there is some nice directionality and a good bite to the gunfire, explosions, and bone-snapping action. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000053GUJ">Jerry Goldsmith's score</a>, one of his very best, sounds wonderful.

We also are finally presented with a fine assortment of extra material. The fast, informative, and funny commentary by Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger that was featured on the DVD Special Edition is now included, as is a vintage EPK-documentary and a making-of from the DVD. New features include a half-hour interview (in HD!) with Paul Verhoeven that is refreshingly frank and honest, as well as a twenty-minute look into the creation of the film's miniature and early-CGI special effects. A photo gallery, restoration comparison, and SD trailer round out the supplements.

In summary, this new Blu-ray is a fine edition of "Total Recall" that is greatly superior to the previous Blu release and is absolutely worthy of a purchase, whether as a double-dip or for the first time.
