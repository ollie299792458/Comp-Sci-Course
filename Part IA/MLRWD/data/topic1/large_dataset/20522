Worth viewing for a glimpse into life in Russia and the plight of Russian orphans and birthmothers.
The movie does not inform that 730,000 children live in Russian orphanages The statistics are grim for those not adopted. They are released into society at age 16 to fend for themselves. 70-80% do not survive. The suicide rate is 20%. The rate of alcoholism, crime, prostitution, or drug use is even higher.
20,000 run away every year as did Vanya in this film.
We adopted two children from two different orphanages in two different regions and saw none of the corruption or greed that is shown in this film or in the media in general. We had good agencies.
It does a disservice to the kids who desperately need homes to present adoption as corrupt and the adoptive families as trivially as they were portrayed here.
But the movie does show the plight of birthmothers and the misperceptions and biases of people in Russia and the fears of kids themselves.
As for who is a "real" mother: the birthmother who gave her child a better life or kept him from starving to death by taking him to the orphanage AND the mother who travels around the world to adopt him as God has given her the ability and circumstances to do are both real mothers.
