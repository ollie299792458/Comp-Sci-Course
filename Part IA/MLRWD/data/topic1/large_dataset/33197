A great cast got plugged into a very mediocre script, with painful moments of forced physical comedy that made for slow, unfunny viewing.

Three older museum guards develop obsessions for specific pieces of art. Each piece of art reveals something about the characters that isn't immediately obvious, but would become apparent to anyone who knew them well. Roger (Walken) is drawn to the image of a mysterious, lonely woman on a beach. George (Macy) is so obsessed with the bronze statue of a naked warrior that he strips to the buff and poses near it. Charles (Freeman) adores the painting of a woman feeding many cats. When the guards learn their art is being moved to Denmark, they decide to substitute fakes and steal the real art.

Not a bad recipe, but the ingredients are combined with a heavy, unimaginative hand. If you're a Macy fan, The Maiden Heist is worth watching once. Walken had a lot of screen time, but even his brand of wonderful personal weirdness was under-used. Freeman's character was just wrong; someone apparently thought he should be channeling a little old cat woman who might be sexually ambiguous, and that would be funny.

But there's nothing really funny about The Maiden Heist. It's a pleasant, unremarkable 90 minutes you'll start forgetting as soon as the credits roll.
