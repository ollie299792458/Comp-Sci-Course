What a gift it is to now have the two versions of this wonderful musical reflecting the differing personalities and outlooks of its creators.  Hammerstein was the dominant force in the 1957 production, giving Julie Andrews' Cinderella the outgoing, tolerant, and optimistic elements of himself, which added a sparkle to his dialogue (and Rodgers' music).  Following Hammerstein's passing, Rodgers was to give Leslie Ann Warren's Cinderella a good dose of his pessimism and introversion, while deleting and adding musical numbers to set his tone more persuasively.

Both casts are wonderful.  There are so many virtues in each cast and production, the differences and minor faults do not matter.

Although colorization usually annoys me, and I would not want to be without the original black and white kinescope as presented here (since it was a black and white experience for most viewers), the fact is that the production was designed for color television and, as can be seen in photographs included with the additional material on the DVD, the true colors used in the actual production can be determined.  I would much prefer that sort of restoration than to watch the version with Brandy.
