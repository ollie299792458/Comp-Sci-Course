I need to correct the review by "J. Glemby" when he states that the Region 2 release is anamorphic widescreen. It is a "faked" widescreen rather than true anamorphic.  The case is correct when it says that the screen aspect is 4:3 Letterboxed. In other words, the actual frame size is 4:3 with the black bars on top and bottom as part of the frame image. With a true widescreen presentation, the black bars are generated by the DVD player/TV with the full screen resolution dedicated to the movie image. When the Region 2 disc is viewed on a 16:9 TV, you will have to manually expand the image to fill the screen. That means that you are zooming in which essentially lowers the resolution. If it had been mastered in true anamorphic widescreen, there would be no loss in resolution. Still, I'd rather watch a "faked" widescreen than a full-frame release.

That said, this is a great movie and it is a shame that this has not been given a decent Region 1 release (or true widescreen release for Region 2).
