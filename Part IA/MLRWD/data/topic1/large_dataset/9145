With all due account to the James Dean classic, that accomplished plan alone took in almost 1/3 of the novel. The 1981 TV miniseries is a abundant archetype of how to alteration a arcane plan assimilate film.The writers managed to accumulate all the capital characters, a lot of of the accessory ones, and accumulate accurate to the adventure too....no baby feat. The casting was impeccably chosen--they looked and acted just as they were written. (A analytical exception: Kate and Aaron--described as fair and albino in the book--and Cal--dark and somber--were physically just the adverse in Jane Seymour, Hart Bochner and Sam Bottoms)....but why nitpick? Their performances accomplish THAT inconsequential. Miss Seymour will apparently be best remembered as Dr. Michaela Quinn, or as TV-movie royalty, but her achievement as Kate should be the standout---she absolved appropriate out of the pages of the novel. She's electric in her scenes with Bruce Boxleitner, who is accomplished as affiliated spirit Charles Trask. And if with her bedmate (Timothy Bottoms, aseptic and aloof, just as Adam was written)she does the spectrum, from admiring chastity to the apotheosis of evil. A must-see for anyone who's anytime apprehend the book--SEE IT. You won't be sorry.
