I love this movie, I saw it 8 times in the theater.  It was so nice back then to have a new heroine type that was a good role model for young women to emulate.  And the humor is marvelous, not nasty.  On my BBS, lines from  the movie were quoted second only to the Princess Bride.  ("I'm a  god"...**whack** "*now* you're a coatrack!")  Beautiful  performances turned in by Donald Sutherland and Luke Perry.  The music is  great, the sound track is very playable on its own.  Many of the scenes  reminded me of my high school days, the miserable ones of course.  Why  does it irk so many Buffy series fans?  Probably because it is the closest  thing to the series without being the series.  There is a crossover novel  where Pike comes to Sunnydale, that true fans of the movie shoudn't miss:  "Sins of the Father".  As for the differance between the series  and the moive, "I ain't gonna eat out my heart, anymore!", Just  enjoy it for what it is, the first Buffy.  Like Adam West is the first real  Batman and Clayton Moore is still the Lone Ranger.
