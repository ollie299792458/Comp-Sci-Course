THE FIRST SEASON WAS THE BEST, THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE LIGHTING,ALONG WITH THE FILM STOCK,CAMERAS,SET DESIGN THAT NOW HAS LONG BEEN LOST..SO SIMPLE NO STUPID SPEILBERG [ dreamworks ] CARTOON ANIMATION.. JUST GUYS IN RUBBER SUITS THAT WERE MONSTERS..THE CAST,,A PERFECT MIX BILLY MUMY,[WILL]  J HARRIS [SMITH] AND THE ROBOT'S VOICE NOT THAT GUY THAT TAKES ALL THE GLORY OF THE ROBOT, WHATS HIS NAME BOB MAY !!!!DICK TUFELD WAS THE REAL STAR...THE VOICE..
  GUY WILLIAMS [P ROBBINSON] WAS A STRANGE KIND OF GUY THAT IMPRINTED REAL EMOTION THROUGH THE CAMERA.HE ALWAYS SEEMEED TO HAVE A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER IN EVERY SCENE,LIKE HE WAS GONNA EXPLODE. HE CONSTANTLY WANTED CLOSE UP'S OF HIMSELF IN THE LAST YEAR OF FILMING, BIG EGO !!!!!!! THAT MADE HIM WHAT HE WAS.. GREAT...
  MARK GODDARD [MAJOR] WAS ANOTHER ACTOR WITH AN ATTITUDE THAT CAME THROUGH, HE SEEMED TO HATE HIS PART BUT HIS WILLINGNESS TO ACT THE PART CREATED REAL SPARK IN THE WAY HE APPROACHED HIS INTERACTING WITH THE OTHER ACTORS..
  BILLY MUMY[WILL] THAT KID CREATED WONDER AND ADVENTURE IN ME WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY EATING MY LUNCH IN FRONT OF MY OLD BLACK AND WHITE TV.NEVER HAVE I EVER SEEN SUCH A YOUNG ACTOR INTERACT WITH EVERY OLDER ACTOR PUTTING THEM TO SHAME, HE HAD AND STILL DOES HAVE THAT MOVIE MAGIC IN HIS VEINS,HE MADE THE JUPITER SEEM POSSIBLE..AND THROUGH HIS ACTING IMPRINTED VALUES,MORALS THAT I STILL REMEMBER FROM WATCHING HIM 40 YEARS BEFORE..
  JOHNATHIN HARRIS[ ZACK] WHAT A INTERESTING PERSON,AND ACTOR, HE CARRIED THE SHOW AND WAS THE STAR..HE HAD THAT SPECIAL TALENT TO TAKE NONSENCE SCRIPT AND TURN IT INTO REAL ENERGY,HIS VOICE WAS HIS GIFT THAT TONAL QUALITY TO PROJECT OUT LIKE ON BROADWAY BEFORE THEY HAD MICROPHONES. HE COULD PROJECT AND CREATE EXCITEMENT,HE HAD GREAT TIMING BETWEEN HIS LINES,HE CHANGED HIS VOICE CONSTANTLY CREATING ENDLESS INTEREST IN THE CHARACTER,GUESS WHO ELCE HAS IT...GIVE UP? ORSON WELLS WATCH HIM IN MOBY DICK AS THE PASTOR GIVING A SERMON.. THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME MOVIE MAGIC GIFT..NEVER BEEN SEEN AGAIN
 THE REST OF THE CAST WERE IMPRESSIVE IN THERE CHARACTERS AND DID WELL...
 THE SET DESIGNER WAS A GUY WHO DID THE TWILIGHT ZONE,FANTISTIC VOYAGE, FORBIDDEN PLANET REMEMBER THEM...YEA YOU KNOW!!!!GUYS USING ALUMINUM FOIL, RUBBER,STYRAPHOME,DAY GLO PAINT, SURAN WRAP, MAKES THE MOVIES TODAY BY THESE GUYS  WHO HAVE NO IMMAGINATION WITH PROPS, THEY USE COMPUTTERS,RE- INVENTED STAR TREK FIRST GENNERATION MASKS OVER...OVER AGAIN  LOOK STUPID..
  THE SET OF THE JUPITER IN THE FIRST SEASON [B-W] WITH THAT GREAT CONTRAST AND DEPTH OF FIELD, CREATING THOSE BLINKING LITTLE LIGHTS BLURED IN THE BACKROUND STILL IMPRESS ME TODAY. WAS IT THOSE OLD GERMAN HAZZENBLAT LENS IN THOSE OLD FILM CAMERAS ALONG WITH THE PRE HALOGEN LIGHTS YES.........AND THE LOST ART OF HOLLYWOOD FILMING...
