Holy cow, this movie is a breathe of fresh air. I don't care about "indie" flicks or the whole "idie" scene. If you snub entertainment because you think it's "indie", you need to remove the stick from your colon. Who cares if it was made on a lower budget or wasn't released with the same publication and funding that the newest Spielberg movie got. If the movie is good, then it's good.

This movie was great! It's a very paced, clever, funny and emotional experience. I'm sure you know the plot, but here it is: A kid returns home after hearing that his mother has died. Upon returning, he must deal with the relationships he left behind, lots of unfinished business and his own personal demons. There it is, pretty simple right? Well, yeah, it is simple. But the storytelling itself is what drives this movie.

The kid returns to find his friends all stuck in similar ruts, or extraordinary ones for that matter. His connections with them are very ture. I am serving in the military and when I go home to see my family and friends, it is almost exactly as akward and uncomfortable as this movie paints it.

The gorgeous Natalie Portman joins in after a little while and the story really takes off. I'm not going to give away any spoilers because that would make the film less enjoyable. I'll just say that my favorite parts were the Mideval Times, and the bow and arrow scenes. I can't remember when I laughed as hard as when the guy shot the arrow into the air. Pure humor.

It's not all laughs, there is a lot of feelings being thrown around in this movie and it all works wonderfully. There is a decent amount of swearing and some drug use, but it's all done with class. Nothing is flaunted or overly used. This is a great movie for when you're feeling down or lost. It's a strange and wonderful movie. I wish I would have seen it in the theater.
