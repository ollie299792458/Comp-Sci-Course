While this film does not offer anything really new to those who are fans of Science Fiction and Fantasy, it does present a  plausible, though dark and depressing, contemporary setting for use of the film's vehicle - time travel / alternate realities.  The moral issues are key here. If you were presented with a means to go back and change events in your past that led to the mental and physical pain and suffering of those you care about, would you, or should you go back and change something that would affect the outcome of that event?  What if you go back and change terrible acts and find that other unexpected bad things occured as a result of your intervention?  Should you continue to try to affect changes?  What if your motives are selfish? Does that affect the outcome?  Besides the moral choices and issues, the movie provokes one to assess the consistancy of the logic in aspects of the film - its timelines and premises. These are the things that make this movie thought provoking, especially since the film was well thought out in advance by its authors / directors.  Please don't get hung up on the inevitable logic flaws that one finds in this type of movie; learn to see past them, for they are minor. This movie is definitely worth seeing, but be prepared both to put your brain in gear, and to face the darker aspects of growing up in today's world - this is not a casual movie.
