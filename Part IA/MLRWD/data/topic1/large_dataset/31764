this film is extremely moving. without giving the plot away, a mother is trying to protect her deaf son from a secret -but you can't keep a secret forever from a bright child (especially about his father). the best option the mother feels she has to buy herself more time (as she is not ready to confront the past just yet) is to find a temporary substitute to be Frankie's (her son) Dad. Obviously this isn't a great idea but for reasons you will have to watch the movie to see, she is short on time and under pressure. A new friend comes through with a connection that will work. Bonds form, decisions need to be made and the past demands recognition and rights. What will happen? Watch and find out. This movie is not your typical feel good movie but it will touch you in a such away that the "feel good" sticks a little more.

The actors and actresses do have Scottish accents in the film (as it takes place in Scotland) so it may be hard to understand at first if your ear isn't trained... but listen closely. It's worth it.
