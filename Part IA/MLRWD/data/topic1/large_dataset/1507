"...A Slick Movie Thriller...", says Michael Wilmington of the 'Chicago Tribune'. And that is exactly right. "The Glass House" delivers chiils, laughs and a whole lot of suspense. Wit impeccable performances by Leelee Sobieski and Stellan Skarsgard, this picture is everything you want.
Summary:
Sixteen year old, rebel, Ruby Baker, and younger brother Rhett have just been put through a horrible ordeal. After an anniversary dinner, her parents, are killed ina terrible car accident, leaving the two children orphaned. After the funeral, the family attorney informs Ruby that her parents carefully considered and designated guardians to take care of Rhett and her, should the parents die together. The guardians are to be former neighbors, and good friends, Erin and Terry Glass. Ruby is a little anxious to join the Glass', because she has no one else to turn to. Once moved in, she becomes overly uncomfortable with the new atmosphere. After, she finds herself in very awkward positions, Terry (male), brushes up against suggestively, she finds Erin passed out, and with needles, and becomes scared for her and her brother.
She eventually finds out the secret of the supposed "perfect" couple. Terry has some serious money problems, and Erin is a doctor on her own medicine, and they are using the children's trust money. Also, the biggest shocker is, when they find out the truth of their parents death.
This one is a practical horror/mystery movie, but although seeming as a all cliched flick, it is none of the sort. Great performances are delivered, both dramatic, comedic by Sobieski as a sarcasm filled teenager, which at sometimes, seems very funny, and a powerful performance from Stellan.
