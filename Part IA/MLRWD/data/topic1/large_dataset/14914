I have bought every Planet of the Apes release in the past on VHS and every DVD release. I have to say that this new Blu-ray transfer has let me experience all 5 Apes films like I have never seen them before.
Being that the original is 40 years old now, I had my doubts on how good it would look transfered into HD. My doubts were put to rest when the movie started. It looks stunning! As I previewed the rest of the films, the picture quaility does not falter any! I know many look at this as a way for FOX to re-issue the same DVD in a different box, but this is not the case here!
Yet, I do have a few gripes with this set. First is the package. The DVD's are held on by rubber bumbs. They are almost impossible to remove and put back on. Also, the DVD art work stinks! It does not have any of the original art work of the  actors or the movies. Instead, FOX used members from APEMANIA and put them on the DVD's as art work. Now I appreciate APEMANIA and what they do to keep the origianl Planet of the Apes makeup and style alive and take nothing from them. But they do not belong on DVD covers of movies that they are not in.
Most of the special features are from the previous release but each DVD has new mini features as well. Both versions of Battle for the Planet of the Apes and Conquest of the Planet of the Apes are included on this set. Both versions are transfered into HD Blu-ray.
All in all, this is a must have DVD Blu-ray release and I can not be more than pleased with the quaility. I only wish FOX would have issued the Apes TV series on Blu-ray with this set also. Since they didn't we can only hope that the TV series will get the Blu-ray treatment also.
