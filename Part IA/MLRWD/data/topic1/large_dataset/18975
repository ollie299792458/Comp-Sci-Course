Believe it or not, I just spent over five hours with this disk even though I already own the original DVD release.  It was worth it.  First off, the video is a(much)cleaner and sharper transfer, a marked improvement over the  old disk.  And the extras are great too. After watching the film the first  time I actually sat through whole thing again again while listening to the  director's commentary, something I have not done with any other DVD.  The  extra footage, while only a few minutes, does add something to the ending.  I liked it.  And Milius' comments about it made me appreciate it even more  later.  My only complaint might be to wish that the commentary had been  extended to the outtakes and deleted scenes.  I would have liked to hear  more about the deleted King Osric scene and how it was originally intended  to fit in the movie.  Finally, the documentary "Conan Unchained"  was a pleasant surprise. I expected the usual 15 minute "making  of" promo dating back to the original release but it is a beefy,  informative(and amusing)featurette with many recently filmed interviews  with cast and crew.  A fan's wish come true.  And speaking of wishes, that  exchange between John Milius and Arnold about getting together sometime to  make a third Conan....YES! Let's get Conan on that throne!  Anyway, while  we're waiting, we can all watch this one till the sun comes up like I did  last night.
