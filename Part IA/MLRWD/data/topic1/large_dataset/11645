I really liked the first Underworld and was looking forward to this movie (though I never got to see it in the theater); unfortunately this sequal was vastly inferior to the original. After watching the movie for a while I looked at the timer and saw that 36 minutes had passed and absolutely no plot advancement had occurred and through the whole rest of the movie it seemed that there was more time-filler action than actual plot. It's almost as if someone wrote a treatment for a movie and that Evolution was shot off of that rather than a script.

 With all of that said Kate Beckinsale looks fantastic (as always) and there are some fantastic special effects/cool fight scenes in the movie that make it worth watching.

On the Blu-ray side the transfer is amazing; this ranks up with the very best video and audio I have seen/heard on the format. If only the storyline could have matched the absolutely amazing picture.

2 1/2 Stars for the actual movie and 5+ stars for the blu-ray.
