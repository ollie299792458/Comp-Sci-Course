I've read many of the reviews posted previously about this film, and I'm actually suprised by the wide range of opinions, good and bad.  After careful consideration of other arguments I still have to say that this movie is a real STINKER.  This film is one of the worst WWII films ever made, really.  Despite it's feeble attempt to portray the more "realisitic" battle weary, lassiez-faire attitudes towards the end of the war, the characters remain stiff, overacted, transparent, and just plain stereotypical by today's standards.  As usual, the portrayl of the Germans is laughable.  Robert Vaughn's (plays the lead German role) forced aristocratic German accent is so bad you find yourself wondering why the producers didn't just cast a German actor (as they did for some of the more competent supporting cast).  Ben Gazzara's "Angel" character is just plain ridiculous, and George Segal should have stayed with comedy, because you'll laugh at his authority role, and supposed "apathy" towards almost every event in the film. The conflict set-up between Segal' character and his superior officer (also badly acted) is painful to watch, and I don't mean in the emotional sense.  The movie was truly doomed after watching the young actress who was thrown in for &lt;5 minutes simply for meaningless frontal nudity - she should feel very exploited... it's the kind of stuff shoveled in history classes taught by the victors. If you want to see a truly "gritty" war film, try the German perspective, as in "Stalingrad" or "Das Boot," or the Finnish film "Winter War."  They're not sappy, overly-patriotic, and won't pull their painful punches, the kind you won't see in relatively older Hollywood films like "The Bridge at Remagen."
