This long overdue collection of the four films Bogie and Betty made together is an absolute must have for fans of both Forties flicks and of course the greatest romantic screen-team in Hollywood history. Starting with 'To Have and Have Not', which was Lauren Bacall's debut film, as has been said many times before one can literally watch the pair fall in love on-screen a la Garbo and Gilbert in 'Flesh and the Devil'. The story is pure Hemingway with wonderful support from Walter Brennan and Hoagy Carmichael among others.

Next came 'The Big Sleep', a wonderful (if not baffling!) film noir adapted from the popular novel by Raymond Chandler. Betty never looked more glamourous and sexy than she does in this one.

Their third film togather was the highly underrated 'Dark Passage', another noir gem expertly directed by the equally underrated Delmer Daves with superb support from Agnes Moorehead and Bruce Bennet. Bogie plays a framed innocent man just escaped from San Quentin who is aided and abetted by Bacall after winning her trust.

The fourth and unfortunately last film with the pair is 'Key Largo', more in the vein of 'To Have and Have Not' than the previous two. The best supporting cast of all four films includes Claire Trevor (who won Best Supporting Actress), Lionel Barrymore and Edward G. Robinson in one of his last tough-guy gangster roles. In her book, Bacall describes the experience of making this film as one of the happiest memories of her career with daily afternoon tea served in her dressing room!

The price of this set considering the high-quality of the prints and the marvellous and relevant extras included by Warner's makes this set excellent value for money. Don't think twice, get it!
