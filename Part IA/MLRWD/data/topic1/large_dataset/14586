Hilights of this season include the introduction of Robin (previously unavailable, I read, because of a rights issue concerning his appearance in Teen Titans. This I don't get, if Batman could appear in both Justice League Unlimited and this show at the same time, not to mention Batman Begins.) As a result, for the first time in DC history, the Batman legend is told in this series introducing Batgirl first (in season 3) and then Robin in this season 4. It probably makes a lot of sense, as Batgirl was traditionally 8 years older than Robin in the comics. By the time they got their romance going in the comics, Batgirl had been crippled by the Joker, and the characters had become Nightwing and Oracle. Let's hope they do it sooner in this series, and leave out the tragic fate of Barbara.
The greatest character gathering for fans will probably be the formation of the Justice League (an enjoyable reworking of the way this was done live for young Clark Kent to join the Justice League in Smallville Season 6).
Following the trend of telling back stories begun by George Lucas (in Phantom Menace), Warner have done well reinventing the Superman legend in Smallville, and the Batman legend in Batman Begins and "The Batman". (The early appearances of Hugo Strange in this series make a lot of sense in the storyline too.
The only 2 things I don't like is the lack of any good instrumental music in this show (compare it to Batman The Animated Series 1992-1995 or Filmation's two Batman serieses from 1968* & 1977), and the way Batgirl and other female characters look like cupie dolls beside the male characters.
Warner, be kind, and respond to my many requests to release the complete 1968 Filmation Adventures of Batman cartoon series.
All that said, you'll still love this DVD set. The cover looks great too.
