Of the distinguished german films. Which represents the seventh art is Panic Box, which describes the hidden side of war panic. It is a documentary film that recounts the story of German navy crew, on a  submarine, who is trying to survive during the Second World War.
The  scenes are shot in exciting manner. It is a film about  the last look  during a destructive international war, as represented in panic box. It is  life of stress, fear of death, and life hope. The expression were very  clear on the face of the submarine crew, who spend long time in panic and  stress waiting for death or hope to survive and get victory.
It is  exciting film indeed and makes you feel that you are one of this crew  members. You share them their fear  stress and anticipation of what will  become of them. It is a mixture of unbearable tension, which is quite  apparent on the face of crew members. You move from this sever tension to  mid-level tension and later you face fearful silence.
Production is  wonderful. Shots are very clear and expressive. In addition to accurate  details and exciting finishing. I regard this film the most exciting  surprise. This film is considered as a psychological study for mans  psychology during war. It picture sever and violent changes in which man  becomes another person.
