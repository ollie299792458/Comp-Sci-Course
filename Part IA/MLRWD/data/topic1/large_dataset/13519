...and an excellent film!

I am scratching my head over G. Haugen's review. I, also, am a huge fan of THE OTHER, TCM, and THE SHINING, and right after viewing this, I let some of my fellow psycho-logical horror fan friends know just how highly I think of this. I am surprised to see someone with such taste give this only one star.

Unlike most mainstream horror flicks, this one takes its time in developing the characters.

Gordon and Bill are heading a remodeling project in an old abandoned mental institute. It is revealed early on that Gordon has been having some family problems, and Bill has been involved in some shady business. The crew members are comprised of an intellectual law school dropout, a not-so-bright, but good hearted mullet head, and a free spirit.

Each character becomes sort of drawn to something in the building. The intellectual starts sneaking off into the basement to listen to recordings of sessions of a woman w/ multiple personalities, the free spirit discovers hidden treasure, and the mullet head can only work in a limited capacity because of fear of the dark.

As the intellectual listens to a new session each day, the tension among the crew grows stronger, and it remains like this up to the chilling end.

Don't worry, I didn't reveal anything. I just felt compelled to review this after reading that last review. All of you psychological horror buffs should think of this as a "second opinon"

The features on the dvd were great. The alternate ending is worth watching.
