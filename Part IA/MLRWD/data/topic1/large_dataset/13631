This film is a perfect thriller for our times.  The plot is about a computer company, NURV, run by a Bill Gates-like CEO, Gary Winston (Tim Robbins), who is perfect for the part.  He hires a young programmer named Milo Hoffman (Ryan Phillipe) who is deemed a genius.  Winston wants him to develop a program called Synapse, which reminds me of AT&T's MLife.  But this dream job becomes a nightmare after Hoffman's best friend is killed, and the clues point to NURV.  Now he plans to finish the program for the sole purpose of exposing Gary Winston.  Along the way, he is aided by a sexy coworker, Lisa (Rachel Leigh Cook), and learns the truth about his girlfriend.  This is a great movie that will keep you guessing.  It shows that in the world of business, especially software, you must know who to trust, and know how to deal with your enemies.  I give it four stars because it has a great story, and the actors are wonderful, however, some things are a little goofy, and I don't like one of the final twists.
