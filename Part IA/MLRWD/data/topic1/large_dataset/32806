A stunning, gorgeous work. The seemingly accidental colliding of scenes, which come and go as memories do, is what makes Fellini's Amarcord (I remember) such a perfect depiction of one's memories of youth. It feels like a collection of moments so bright and vibrant, that it is totally believable that it would be those that the central figure, Titta, would remember. Fellini remembers his own childhood, of course, through Titta in Amarcord, and the help of a lot of fantasy and fiction, which Fellini loves to deploy in order to reach penetrating truth. Rich colours, cinematography, and a beautiful Nino Rota score also help create the dreamlike feel of memory. Fellini had such a sense for movement - both of the camera, and for the arrangement of figures in the frame (also known as mise-en-scene), and though it is nearly impossible to pick a favourite Fellini work, this sense works here just as marvellously and hypnotically as it does in 8 1/2. Amarcord is an enrapturing film - truly a thing to behold
