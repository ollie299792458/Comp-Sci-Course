I gave away my viewing copy of ROTJ, ordered a new one on Amazon. No biggie. BUT, sadly, tragically, I made a blunder on this one. The DVD is in great condition, it arrived in a timely manner, and it's the action packed, innovative special effects filled, wonderful sci-fi story expected.
  Due to my inept ordering, it was the Full Screen Version! NOT widescreen! Not the special two disc DVD package with both the remastered, enhanced verson, and the original theatrical release version. (Yes I know there's an even newer pacakging available. It took me long enough to go with this one. But I'll move on up to that one soon enough)
  First off, I'm a widescreen fan, I want the full view of everything, the detailed sets, all encompassing veiws of the action, effect of panoramic views, etc. No pan and scan for me, if there is camera motion I feel it should be as a necessary dramatic component of the action and story of a movie, not to quickly show some otherwise missed visual aspect of the story that would was included in the original frame.
  The movie is still incredible, I still love it. Even in fullscreen version. Even with those annoying Ewoks! Alright, alright, they do save the day in the battle of Endor, They are cute and cuddley, but everybody seems to forget........they were going to eat Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie for dinner!!! I would have never turned my back on one of those things, ever. Don't care how cute and cuddlely they are.
  And liking the Star Wars saga as I do, being able to watch one version, then the other and compare, especially with other SW fans (who else would sit thru two viewings of the same movie at one session?) is a fun thing to do.
  Like I say, it was my blunder when I ordered. Didn't pay attention, must have clicked on the wrong one. Learn you must, from my mistake. Use the Force. Select the good DVD package.  (Or that new one if you must)
