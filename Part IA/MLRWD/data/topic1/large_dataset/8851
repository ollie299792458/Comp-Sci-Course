From the music, to the accents, to the absolutely beautiful cinematography, this movie had me travelling to Newfoundland from the moment the characters drove toward it.

Kevin Spacey had very little to work with in a character that was written so very internally, and he brought what little light there was to Quoyle right out through his eyes.  The man is the king of the smouldering look, and Moore plays her role with a quiet reserve that likewise is carried mostly by gesture, stance, and expression.  This is not a verbal movie, not an audio experience in the slightest: this is a visual experience, where body language usually matters much more than not.

Sets, weather, and the ever-present character of the Ocean itself all stir together in this movie.  With fade-ins and flashbacks of skill woven into a theme of regeneration and restoration, there is a thread of humour and kindness to this movie that had more than one person in the audience sniffly, myself included.

The daughter had a real screen presence, and is a child actress with skill I think we'll be seeing more often.  If the movie itself has any failings, it's that it tried to stay as wide as the novel, and as such, some minor plotlines got nearly no screen time, where they might have been better removed, allowing more time for more central characters (especially that of Aunt Agnis, played by Judi Dench to perfection).

I highly reccommend the movie, most centrally for its beautiful visual scenery, and gentle handling of nonverbal language to portray the emotions involved.  The cast of characters managed a story that wasn't spoken, and the impact wasn't lost at all.  Newfoundland has never looked so wonderful on the silver screen.
