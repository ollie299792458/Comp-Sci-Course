As a Gettysburg fan, I was really pleased with this purchase. The older video version I had looked like a cheap copy from a guy in a trenchcoat, but that was what was at one time available. This new product is crisper by far, revealing things I had never been able to see or hear, like the fact it is visibly raining with thunder in the background as Gen. Buford arrives through the orchard near Seminary Ridge. The additional footage, however, really, really helps the story line. (If you are historically inclined, it was the only weakness of this movie as shown in theaters.) So many things that are essential to the story were left out of the theater version. The brief interview with generals included with this cut regarding why fire was not placed on the hills behind Gettysburg at the end of day 1 is critical to the quality of the story. I had been disappointed in Gods and Generals when it came out - poor CGI, actors who were older, but supposedly younger in chronology of events, and a less cohesive story line. This version is much improved, even given those general drawbacks. The additional footage helps this become much more tolerable as well. You will LOVE this. The extra freebies are fun, too, as are the bonus CD items.
