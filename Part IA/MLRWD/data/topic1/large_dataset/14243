This sequel was not disappointing at all! It has everything a sequel needs - more dead bodies and more gory deaths. What makes this movie unique, though, is the fact that it has a brand new plot!
Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is back with a whole new life, new friends, far away from South Port. When her best friend Karla (Brandy) wins a trip to Bahamas, she is ecstatic. Karla brings her new crush along with her and Julie (after Ray rejects) hooks up with her new friend Will Benson.
During their stay on the island of Tower Bay, they fool around at the Karaoke Bar and Julie sees a menacing message rolled on the screen "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer". She is badly shaken and wants to get off the island, but no one believes her. What is even worse, the storm is starting and therefore the telephones stop working. So, the four teenagers and five-member personnel are trapped on an island with a brutal murderer.
Soon, the bodies - killed in a very inhuman way - start to pile up and the history begins to replay itself. 
I gave the movie 4 stars for the great music, acting, gore, scare factor and the unique plot twist. However, it was not better than I Know What You Did Last Summer and the ending was a little confusing, so that's why I didn't give it 5. You've got to see this horror movie, cause it is a one of a kind film.
