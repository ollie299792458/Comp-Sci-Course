My wife had asked me to find a DVD of The Quiet Man but I could never remember the title when at the DVD rental store! Since obtaining the DVD from Amazon.com I can't get Maureen O'Hara's brilliant appearance with John Wayne out of my head. Wayne plays the part of a returning Irish exile, nursing a secret boxing past in Chicago - where he accidentally killed an opponent in the ring - and on arrival in Ireland is captivated by the beautiful O'Hara driving sheep across one of the many splendid landscapes in the movie. To obtain Maureen's hand in marriage, John Wayne has to reluctantly take up the boxing again - this time without gloves - to win O'Hara's brother's consent to the marriage. Funny yes; comedy - not entirely, though when the catholic village turns out en masse to support the local protestant vicar in a tricky situation, it is hillarious; romance - yes, in a special Irish way. The appearance of Barry Fitzgerald as chaperone for the courting couple, is precious. This is the timeless Ireland I have taken my expatriate wife home to each year for the past several decades.
