This is the brilliant 4-part tv miniseries 'Lonesome Dove', caught on DVD.  It is the story of a group of cowboys, led by long time best friends Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call, trying to push a herd of cattle across the United States, from Texas to Montana.  With stars such as Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, and Angelica Houston, you are sure to have a quality movie.

I won't deny it -- I'm not a Western fan.  But this movie has changed my entire perspective.  I would have to say that this is my all time favourite movie.  It has all the basic elements - action, adventure, comedy, love, drama... combined to create one of the most amazing films of our time.  I never really knew much about the heart of american history, the wild west, until I saw this movie.

In some ways, I compare this film to the 'Lord of The Rings' series, in that most of the movie is literally gripping (other than the slow start at the beginning - in both movies), and at the end of each part, excluding the last, you feel very compelled to watch the next.  I have yet to meet someone who stopped watching the series part way through.  Other Westerns give this movie a bad name.  My joy gets a little more crunched every time I hear someone say that they hate westerns, therefore they would hate Lonesome Dove.  This is the way a real western should be.

Words cannot express how great this movie is.  I cannot stress the fact enough, and though I keep recommending this film to my friends and family, I wish everybody had the opportunity to experience the joy...  This is not a very well known movie, and I do not understand why -- I've seen hundreds of movies, and this old classic is still #1 in my books.  I guarantee that you will enjoy it, if you give it a chance.
