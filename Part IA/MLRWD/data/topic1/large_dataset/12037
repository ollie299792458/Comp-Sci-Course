My, my haven't so many Amazon reviewers who saw this movie become a little spoiled in their entertainment demands to write such unfair, harsh and condemning words for this highly enjoyable animated film.  I admit, I've only seen part of it on cable t.v., but what I saw impressed me.  It was highly creative, well done and I really see no justification for why so many reviewers have ripped this movie apart in such a way.  Sure, I've never seen Shrek and I have little to compare this movie too other than Nemo, but I was genuinely entertained and found this movie very enjoyable to watch.

For those concerned about their children watching inappropriate material they describe in their reviews, Disney movies always had evil and conflict in them.  The Wizard of Oz and tons of classics had these attributes.  I really fail to see what these parents are concerned about or what planet they are on that they believe a movie such as this to be a problem for children to watch in today's world. They must be Christian Fundamentalists who expect unrealistic scenarious that have nothing to do with reality. Looney Tunes cartoons had a lot of violence too by the way. They were popular in their day and age.

So many of the reviewers here have become impossible to please.  They are far too demanding and expect far too much from a movie.  I think the word spoiled suits some of these reviewers quite well.  They expect and demand far too much from these creative artists.
