Probably saw it for the first time since the movie came out.
I knew I always liked the fast-paced no-nonsense action movie, but had  forgotten a lot of the story.
The theme music grows on ya, and you are enamored into the hard-core action.
A simple and fun 'Friday night ' movie.
The opening elevator scene alone is pretty 'sweat-in-palms' stuff, but thats only the beginning people!  And just when you thought it was all over with the non-stoppable bus, lol! there's the subway scene! Yikes!
Keanu looking sharp with that cool short haircut.
No real 'making of' on the disc, but a few special features including a game for the kids.
Director Jan Debon went on to do <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W4D94I">Twister [Blu-ray</a>] but we haven't heard from him lately. Speed was actually his directional debut, and he delivers!

Pity about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G6E8">Speed 2 - Cruise Control</a>... Its not the same without Keanu. Notice they haven't issued Speed 2 on blu-ray. Figures...
