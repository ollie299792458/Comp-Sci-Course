I am a HUGE fan of animated movies and take them very seriously when watching them. I love Pixar movies to death, but I haven't liked a Disney movie since Mulan. When I went to see Bolt in theaters, I expected it to be a very badly made sell-out just so more toys could be made for kids to buy. I had to admit, the plot was pretty intriguing but I didn't expect much. In about 5 minutes after the movie started (I'm not kidding) I was intrigued. Bolt was an incredibly likable character as was Mittens.  The plot was hooking and though the story moved at the pace and technique of a normal Disney movie, the script and the interesting characters kept things unique and creative. I DO think the movie could have done without Rhino, the annoying-as-hell hamster, but it IS a kids movie and Rhino is full of kid-humor. Bolt convinced me to love it when I was sure I'd hate it. I've never been so happy to eat my words. I'm definitely pre-ordering this and everyone who's been longing for a GOOD Disney movie should too.
