Love this movie! It's cute and funny! Not only are the computer animated graphics brilliant, the story is creatively plotted out. 
It's a warmhearted story about a boy named Andy whose favorite toy, Woody, feels suddenly left out when a new toy, Buzz Lightyear, "replaces" him. The relationship between Woody and Buzz goes from jealousy and hate, but once they're put in a situation where they are left to fend for themselves in order to survive, all that changes into learning how to accept each other for their differences and becoming friends. It definitely contains valuable lessons for children young and old, and maybe children will learn how to treat their toys better. In addition, I love a movie that can convey every emotion, from happy to sad to happy again... And "Toy Story" is it! I love this movie! And I'm sure that even if you're not into watching children movies or cartoons, you'll still enjoy what "Toy Story" has to offer. And if you enjoy "Toy Story", you'll also fall in love with "Monsters, Inc.", another Pixar creation. But be sure to check out "Toy Story" first!
