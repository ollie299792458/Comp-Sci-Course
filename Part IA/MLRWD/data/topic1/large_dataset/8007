I saw the movie because I had heard of Romeo and Juliet as one of Shakespearefs works, but I didnft know the story in detail.  This movie arranges the original story setting it in modern Italy. I was deeply moved by its themes : they are gEncounterh and gDeathh.  Romeo and Juliet first get acquainted with each other for the first time in a party held at Julietfs house. The party is very funny!! In the middle of the party, suddenly Petruchio begins to dance and sing ! I was very surprised  by seeing it, for the Montagues and the Capulets are oppsed to each other. If Petruchio is found out, he will be killed for he is a loyal retainer of the Capulets. (Finally, he was killed by Tybalt, Julietfs cousin.)  While the party continues, Romeo meets Juliet across a fish tank in the powder room by chance. ( The fish tank is very big and beautiful ! ) The scene is very charming! Romeo and Juliet get married in secret.  Their wedding is simple, but they seems to be happy.  After their marriage, Petruchio was killed by Tybalt. Hearing of his death, Romeo rushed to his head, and he killed Tybalt. Because of this matter, he was banished from the country. Although her cousin was killed by her husband, Juliet kept believing and loving him. It is marvelous!  Sad to say they donft be happy, but the Montagues and Capulets make peace by their death. After I saw the movie,I was greatly impressed by it !
