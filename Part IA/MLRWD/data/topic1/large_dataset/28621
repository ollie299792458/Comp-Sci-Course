This film is a great introduction to The Club Dumas by Arturo P&eacute;rez-Reverte.  What's missing in the film is almost deducible from the title of the book.  An entire subplot is removed to simplify the film.  This was probably Polanski's only and best decision.  The literary sub-plot had to go, but unfortunately, this film does suffer from the lack of credibility that subplot brought to the overall structure of the work.  In the movie, we are asked to believe that Depp is a rare-book vulture/genius while he smokes all over a work that is worth millions.  At times there are references to things left out of the movie (the Raymond Chandler reference toward the beginning) and other odd anachronistic moments, but we are too often distracted by Polanski's gimmicks for them to be believable.  And, finally, the Devil.  Hmm, well, even the book didn't pull that off well.

For all its flaws, this is a good film.  Almost everyone who enjoys it likes the same things - the books, the attitudes, the intrigue.  There is virtually no horror and the devil stuff comes off a bit lack-luster, like Polanski returning to the tried and tested well of "Rosemary's Baby".
