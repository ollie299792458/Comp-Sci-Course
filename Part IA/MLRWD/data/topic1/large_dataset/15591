I am a newcomer to this genre. (I have a son who keeps up with the European and Asian media and drags me along at times.)
I am not easily impressed with this type of movie or book...but this author was brilliant! (He will be missed)

I read the last of the trilogy "The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest" because it was recommended by a reader's group at a local library. I had never read a Swedish author before and half of my interest was held by the description of a different place in the world.
The story was riveting. The differences of Swedish and USA laws was interesting.
The action and suspense was awesome.
Everything about this story was a surprise.
I agree with all the reviewers with more than 4 stars!
This is a MUST SEE!

I have also seen the 1st movie and believe it is a must before watching the others!
(Since this most likely will NOT be at the local cinemas...you can find it online at Netflix as well as the usual video stores)
