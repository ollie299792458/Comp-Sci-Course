Errol Flynn dosen't actually use a buckler, but you get the idea. This is 'the' Robin Hood movie; don't waste your time on Robin Hoods with Midwestern accents.  The political implications of Robin Hood are usually thought to favor the Left.  This movie shows Robin in his true color - as a counterrevolutionary, fighting for restoration of the legitimate government, for the rights of yeomen farmers not to be taxed to death, and against usurpation and tyranny.  Thomas Jefferson could have written much of this script.  The un-PC Robin uses weapons to poach deer, confronts the local government over their abuse of power, and his democratic manners come out in sharp contrast to the rigid formality of the Court Party.  Errol Flynn fits the part to a 'T,' and the viewer can well imagine him, had he been born seven centuries earlier, actually being the title character.  Olivia de Haviland positively glows, and portrays the spirited courage and character that her faith and breeding were supposed to instill in every scene.  Not as often mentioned is Richard the Lionheart, who, although absent until the final scenes, is so much larger than life that he dominates the screen when he appears.  The duel scene, the use of shadows, and the many-splendored pagentry have been celebrated often enough to make any further praise redundant.  Taken as a whole, this is the best movie of its' kind, and the standard against which this writer has measured all others since it became his childhood favorite. -Lloyd Conway
