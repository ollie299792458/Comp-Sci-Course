I thoroughly expected to hate this movie because of previous reviews, but the opposite was true.  I loved it.  As a fan of Gerry Butler I was once again impressed by his performance, but it's the writing and the subject matter of the film that grabbed me most.  This woman was an inspiration for any person looking to see life from a new and precious perspective.  As for those who slammed Gerry's character Sam for spending the last few weeks with a dying woman and leaving his poor suffering wife I have this to say.  If Sam's wife had any sense of compassion like Sam says in the movie, she would have been more understanding and wanted him to make this woman's last days here wonderful.  He would have loved her more for that. How can a woman be jealous of someone who's dying?  I thought she was horrible and was glad to see Sam dog her.

The end of this movie was great as well.  It really choked me up and I was thinking if something were to happen to me I would hope I would handle it with the same courage and humor that this woman did.
