I am, for the most part, not a huge fan of sequels. "Rush Hour 2" is one of those rare exceptions. The duo of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan simultaneously thrills and stills the mind in this Taoist reflection that brings together comedic idealism and merry police mentality. 
This sequel stands about a foot below the original "Rush Hour," but rest assured that this DVD will bring about a positive afterglow for those seeking both enterainment and awe. Chris Tucker's dialogue lacks the charisma he carried in the original, but perhaps his toned down delivery was an intentional homage to Johnny Legend in the almost forgotten Philip Pine masterpiece "The Cat Ate the Canary." I can't help think that Tucker's subtle delivery in "Rush Hour 2" is an attempt at recreating Johnny Legend's vociferous triumph in the above-mentioned flick.
And speaking of nostalgic sleepers, "Rush Hour 2" is worth seeing simply for the slick filming of its action sequences. Too many people write off Jackie Chan as "slapstick," but his phenomenal physical performance blends beautifully with the revved-up lense subterfuge and quick scenic cuts. This technique is reminiscent of a short-lived 1960s motus operandi known as "Speedcolor." Speedcolor was used most prolifically in the 1967 car race film entitled, appropriately enough, "The Speed Lovers." Such a technique is quite at home with a talent such as Jackie Chan.
Whether you are looking for sheer entertainment or a well disguised work of cinematic beauty, "Rush Hour 2" is well worth the price. The plot itself lacks the continuity of its predecessor, but the scenic cinematic wonderland more than makes up for the slight Guajardian absence.
