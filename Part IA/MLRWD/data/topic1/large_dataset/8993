Several things about this film sticks out.  First,  I enjoyed it more than I expected.  Second, throughout the whole film I constantly thought will happen next?" which is the sign of an interesting film for me.
I  enjoyed the eerie nature, the overall dark tones.  Kubrick uses what I call  "space" or "silence" in this film which adds to the  uneasiness of the viewer.  Example: Tom Cruise's scenes with  corpses.
There are also a few things I did not like such as, Nicole  Kidman's performance, the obviously English actors sliding in and out of  American accents. Sidney Pollack, who is usually a nice light addition to  any film he's in, doesn't hold up well here.  There's nothing light about  this film nor his character, he seemed misplaced. The hype surrounding the  orgy scene was unwarranted.  Even with the digitally altered states, I  didn't see anything overly provacative about it.  Much ado about  nothing.
The film left a few questions.  First, why did it take 18 months  to make this film?  What happened to the Jennifer Jason Leigh role and if  it weren't cut out, how many more hours would the film have been?  
My  best friend and I watched the film together and her response was "I  felt like there was more to the movie that was never explained."  That's exactly what kept my attention...when would Kubrick explain the  questions?  He never does.
Films which do not wrap everything up in a  nice little bow are always more interesting.  For those who'd rather have a  pretty ending , rent "Notting Hill."
