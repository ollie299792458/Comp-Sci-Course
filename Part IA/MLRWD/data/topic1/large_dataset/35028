I first saw Taxi Driver when it was released in the mid 1970s (over 30 years ago!), and was amazed then at DeNiro as an actor and the movie as a whole. The movie was so fascinating to me back then as a youngster that I remember dragging my girlfriend to the movie theatre at least 6-7 times to see it over and over. I just got the double DVD set and am re-amazed (is that a word?) at DeNiro's acting and again , with the movie as a movie. This is a film that you need to watch several times to take it all in. As for DeNiro - in my opinion, the best actor ever (forget the wasted performances in Meet the Parents, the Flockers, etc.), watch his facial expressions, catch his voice mannerisms, etc., and I think you'll agree he really nailed the part of a man who is a little off to start and whose life spirals downhill. Screenwriter Paul Schrader's commentary (on disc 2) on society's fixation with fame/media, and with making anybody a "hero", even a killer, is even more applicable today. This is a fascinating movie, really one of a kind. The 2 disc set also gives you a 2d DVD with over 2 hours of really enetertaining documentary/commentary on how the movie was made.
