The first half of All The Real Girls is an atmospheric, visually intoxicating exploration of the beginnings of deep love with a narrative structure that I found full of wonderful odd touches and surprises. Then a weekend separation between the newly formed couple ensues and when they reunite, an entirely different sort of film morphs into view. For me, this transition (an egregious discontinuity in both plot and filmic ambiance) failed to work. To the extent that the first hour of the film had me mesmerized with its highly nuanced, impressionistic approach to the way in which authentic attachment between individuals progresses, the second hour seemed tediously bloated with cliche and weighed down by an often hard to believe storyline. I made it a point to see All The Real Girls because I have greatly enjoyed the work of actress Zooey Deschanel in minor roles in movies like The New Guy and The Good Girl. I have always wanted the opportunity to see what she would do with a more expansive part. I thought she was excellent in All The Real Girls up to the breach; fully able to handle the considerable burden of holding an audience's attention over a significant period of time. I look forward to seeing her in future starring roles in films that hopefully use her formidable talents to better overall effect.
