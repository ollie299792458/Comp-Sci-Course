OK, it's not exactly Spielberg and it's not exactly Kubrick. So, it's Spielbrick or Kuberg.  That's OK.  If you came looking for Spielberg's happy ending or Kubric's hallucenogenic or dystopian ending, prepare to be disappointed.  But if you want a blend of the best of these two directors, a bittersweet and aching examination of love, its formation, its endurance and its consequences, you will love AI.
I love absolutely everything about this movie.  From the first, Spielberg treats technology as incidental, not forefront in the movie.  It's simply there, part of everyday life.  Sure, it's more advanced than we have today, but it's so firmly rooted that it doesn't intrude on the viewer like a normal SciFi movie.
The plot, true, is a variation of Pinnochio, but still, the upshot of the story is no so much that David wants to be a real boy so much as it is that he wants to be loved.  He loves, and doesn't understand why that love is not returned.  He thinks that by becoming a real boy, this will happen.
The music, the direction, the way the film falls neatly into five main parts, the lighting, the acting by Haley Joel Osmont, Jude Law and all the cast is pitch perfect.  The ending is so emotional, I defy you to not shed a tear.
