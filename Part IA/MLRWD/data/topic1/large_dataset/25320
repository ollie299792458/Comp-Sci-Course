To coincide with the re-release of this movie on DVD with all the extras, and the now-famous "Spider-Walk" scene, The Exorcist was shown again in movie theaters at the time. My Wife and Son and I were treated to an interesting experience during the movie; AN EARTHQUAKE! It was not a major one, but that along with the movie being as scary as it was, almost half the people in the theater walked out, and you could hear some of them saying things like "I can't handle this", "this is too much", "I'm gonna have a heart attack". I must admit it was a bit overwhelming, but I felt like I got my money's worth even if the Earthquake was not a special effect dreamt up by the theater or the producers of the film. (i.e. the vibrating seats during "The Tingler").
WHAT A RIDE!!! The only thing that would have made this movie scarier is if Alfred Hitchcock had directed it. I recently read that he was more than a little interested, and even tried to secure the rights to it. Who could've handled a film that scary? Not Me.
