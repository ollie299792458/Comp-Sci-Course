All right, so it could be better.
If you're an Aaron Sorkin (writer of "Sports Night," "West Wing," "American President," "Few Good Men") fan like I am, you'd probably  expect "Malice" to possess a crackling dialogue and the  back-and-forth banter that has become Sorkin's trademark. In this area,  "Malice" disappoints. 
The acting by Pullman and Baldwin is  more than a little stiff, but Kidman does well, and Anne Bancroft steals  her scene as Kidman's eerie, presumed dead mother. And  "Frasier"'s Bebe Neuwirth is wonderful as a homicide  detective.
The story is decent, but it possesses very little to set it  apart from any other thriller movie, save an almost anticlimatic scene  where Pullman wrestles a serial rapist and the final twist at the end of  the movie, where one character learns he or she has been hoodwinked. 
I'd  be very interested in seeing what Sorkin could do with this script now, and  how he'd jazz it up a bit. With a little patience and work,  "Malice" could be a phenomenon.
