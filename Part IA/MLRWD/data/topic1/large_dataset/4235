This series was interesting the first time I saw it on television, years ago, and I always wondered if I would be able to view all of the episodes, in order.  Among the works of Ken Burns, The Civil War strikes me as quite balanced in its viewpoint.  It takes mainly a Union-sided view, but it looks rather deeply into hearts in the Confederacy as well.  It acknowledges that the Civil War was heavily based on the issue of slavery, but also as it stood within broader questions, such as the unity of a nation, the rights of Americans and the states, in the presence of federal decrees, to decide their own way of life, and the right to keep property.  This film strongly emphasizes the humanity and higher potential of those who suffered under slavery, and it reveals many individual attitudes of the time.

The production stays interesting to watch because of good camera work with still photographs, modern scenes of old battlefields and other places, constant attention to message and tone, interviews with subject experts, narrative discussion, quotes from letters and history, good use of voices, and other techniques that combine to build an informative and moving story.
