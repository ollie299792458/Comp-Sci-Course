It is fascinating to see how many viewers are still invested in this story. Having read the epic poem myself I was impressed by this cinematic retelling. I didn't see it in the theater, so my review is of the director's cut. It is funny how some reviewers write about the destruction, or dishonor that this version does to the classic. I disagree. This postmodern version of the story makes explicit everything that is implicit in the actual text. The sins of the father theme is elevated to the foreground of the narrative. The flawed character of the hero is very well defined and serves the purpose of the story, illuminating the actual text for me. The seductive qualities of Grendel's mother were well served by the figure of the very sexy Jolie. The pathetic and sympathetic portrayal of Grendel was the best part. The CGI was great except for the facial expressions. They were a bit restrained, almost wooden. It is very much like Miller's 300. I think it would have been better had there been live actors mixed in with the CGI like in 300. It reinvigorates an overblown folktale, breathing human frailty into its monolithic heroic frame - I loved it!
