Ok, maybe you've seen too many Ben Stiller/Owen Wilson movies by now, but this has to be one of the funniest of them all. It beats Starsky and Hutch! The parody of the fashion industry in general, picking on all of the cliches and stereotypes on models, together with a tremendous comic versatility by Ben Stiller is brilliant. The slow-witted model Derek Zoolander finds himself brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia but then... And I won't spoil it for you. The cast includes Ben's dad, Jerry Stiller, which you'll probably recognize from the "King of Queens" show, Ben's wife, who plays the Time magazine reporter, Owen Wilson as the rookie model and the inevitable and oh-so-funny Will Ferrel in a very funny portrayal of a fashion designer. And Milla Jovovich as Katinka Ingabogovinanana (it's hillarious to hear Will Ferrel introduce her to Ben Stiller). And then you have all sorts of celebrities that you'd find in fashion shows and the like. If you want some laughs at the expense of the fashion industry (which, in itself, is comical) then get this movie!
