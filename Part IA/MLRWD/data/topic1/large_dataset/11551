When Warner Bros. substituted BRENDA MARSHALL for Flynn's usual romantic interest they made a big mistake. Certainly she's pretty (in a remote sort of way with a facial expression carved in stone), but there's none of the usual back and forth wit and spirit that OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND always shared with Flynn. In other words, the spark of chemistry that made them such a memorable love team is completely missing here.

So is Technicolor. Hard to understand why the studio didn't back this investment (which cost a hefty sum at the time) with color photography which would have added so much richness to the story. As it is, the crisp B&W photography is handsome enough but with all those gorgeous sets and costumes, color is an ingredient that should have been seriously considered.

The story has its points of interest but exists mainly to showcase the athletic abilities of ERROL FLYNN and, presumably, most of the vigorous male cast. All with the exception of HENRY DANIELL who, although a fine screen villain, was not up to the requisite swordplay and had to be doubled for all the long shots. Basil Rathbone, where were you???

Capping the whole thing is a majestic score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold that is worthy of a far better film. But sea tales don't get much better than this and the studio backed their production with a wonderful ensemble cast that included WILLIAM LUNDIGAN, ALAN HALE, CLAUDE RAINS, FLORA ROBSON, JAMES STEPHENSON, UNA O'CONNOR and many, many more.

Summing up: It's a lusty tale of piracy on the high seas and lots of treachery afoot so that Errol Flynn can swing into action and save the day for God and Queen. Smooth sailing.
