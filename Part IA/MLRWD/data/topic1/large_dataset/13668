It's amazing what they did on this movie with a budget of only $55,000!  For a big production, $55,000 is probably how much they pay for one of the main actors hairbrush! 
This was Dan O'Bannon's first production, he  later went on to write the script for Alien and many other sci-fi films.  Dan plays the character Pinback who wants to improve morale on the ship,  but the others won't cooperate. The sequence with Pinback and the alien pet  is one of the best scenes.
Dark Star was released in 1974, but virtually  nobody came. After the movies premere, Dan O'Bannon went to a local theater  and asked the manager how long the line was to see the movie Dark Star. The  manager wryly replied "What Line?", then Dan became heartbroken  and stopped writing movies until he got the opportunity to write the script  for Alien.
Dark Star, in many ways, continues to be the most popular cult  sci-fi movie ever filmed. It was also the lowest budget sci-fi movie that  more than fully recovered the budget expenses in less than a week!
