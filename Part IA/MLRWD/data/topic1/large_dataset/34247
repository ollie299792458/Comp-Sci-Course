I am very happy with this purchase. The video itself is aesthetically pleasing in many ways. Nice work-out space, great music, beautiful movements, and I think Tracy looks great. I don't agree with many of the criticisms about her hair or alleged 'pouting'. Of course you are going to want to look good when you are filming a video presenting your work. I don't see anything wrong with that and think the critics here are just being catty.

I also think the criticisms about her moves/cues being difficult to follow are exaggerated. They are challenging moves indeed, but if you are a person who is used to following videos or classes, I can't see how this is SO hard. They do film different angles, and in instances where you can't see her leg, she does give specific instruction about how you should be lifting it or how high your knee should be, etc. I never had any problem following her cues. And I prefer her minimalist approach to instructing. I do not need someone cueing every rep, but maybe a beginner would become a bit more distressed at the lack of hand-holding. I found Tracy's relaxed tone and style very refreshing.

I won't be doing these DVD's exclusively as Tracy wants, but I think they are a great addition to my routine and I am going to splurge on the 3 DVD box set for sure. She leaves me wanting more of these unique and really lovely flowing movements, which create a surprising amount of burn! Especially the arm exercises.

Separate from my opinion about the video itself, I realize that her statements about 'bulking' and the 3 lb max weight rule have stirred a lot of uproar in the fitness community. I don't find it to be true FOR ME that heavy lifting has created bulk, if anything, it has made me firmer and tauter. But everyone's bodies have a different reaction, and some are just after a certain look. I think she is entitled to her opinion about this, and it has no bearing on how much I like the video.
