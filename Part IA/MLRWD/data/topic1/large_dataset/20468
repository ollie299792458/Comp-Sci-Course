To begin, yes its true, this release does not include the widescreen format but thats not why you are reading this review, you want to know if these films are great, and the answer is a resounding Yes!!

Beginning with A Little Princess, I passed on watching it for many years ignorant of the fact that it is a true classic. I must give the director Alfonso Cuaron all the credit in the world his vision for this film is pristine. There is symbolism and meaning in every scene. If you are a student of film making, then this is the way it should be done. A Little Princess is a true Art Film, a work of art, and watching it is almost like admiring a fine painting. The music, script, cinematography, and dialogue are nearly perfect and the emotional impact of the film is intense. My advice would be to watch it several times and gauge how it operates on different emotional, spiritual, and mythical levels. I always found Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to be the best of the Potter films and it is now no surprise that it was directed by the same man responsible for A Little Princess.

The Secret Garden is also a fine film, written by the same author, both films share a common theme of a young child raised in India whose lives are suddenly uprooted. The substance of the film centers on how they deal with the curveballs life throws at them. The story here is not as complex as A Little Princess but it is a pleasure to watch the evolution of the children, the family, and those around them and how they grow as the garden blooms. Simple but still poignant. Most importantly both films are great for adults and children alike.
