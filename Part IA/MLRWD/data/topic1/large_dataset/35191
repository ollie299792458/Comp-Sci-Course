We picked this movie up because we like both of the stars in it and the plot sounded pretty good.  It was enjoyable to watch, fun to see how a woman deals with a male escort since usually it's the other way around.  Kat is completely self-conscious about bringing Nick to her sister's wedding, since she's not dating him, is going to see her ex-fiance at the wedding, and for some reason her parents have decided to abandon their old rule of couples having to sleep in seperate rooms when there's no ring involved.  But Nick is, of course, an expert at this and has everybody convinced that he and Kat are in love with each other.  Messing and Mulroney are good onscreen together, the supporting cast does pretty well, though the sisters relationship kind of broke my heart through most of the movie.  If you're looking for a lighthearted movie that is actually both romantic and a comedy, go for this one.  If you're worried about appropriateness though, there is a lot of suggestive language and some partying scenes portrayed.
