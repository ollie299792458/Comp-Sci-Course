"Die Hard" was the prototype for the 90s action film and "Speed" remains one of the best reworkings of it.  It delivers enough non-stop action and thrills to satisfy even the most-demanding  action fans.
Keanu Reeves (who'd have believed it before "The  Matrix"?) stars as Jack Traven, LAPD SWAT commando.  Traven and his  partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) battle one-thumbed mad bomber Howard Payne  (Dennis Hopper) throughout nearly two hours of wall-to-wall testosterone  and mayhem.
The script by virgin screenwriter Graham Yost delivers not  one, but three thrilling disaster stories, accomplishing that rare  Hollywood miracle of actually giving the audience more than they  expected.
Reeves gives a surprisingly good performance, showing  uncharacteristic confidence and ease.  Daniels is largely wasted and Hopper  gives his stock crazed villain performance--and once again I loved it.  The  always delightful Sandra Bullock, co-starring as Reeve's love interest, is  excellent, giving just the right touch to her scenes.
"Speed"  was a remarkable directorial debut for veteran cinematographer Jan De Bont.  He obviously learned a great deal while lensing pictures for Paul  Verhoeven ("Basic Instinct") and John McTiernan ("The Hunt  for Red October.")  The action sequences and stunts in this film are  as good as any you'll see.  This is one movie that really delivers.
