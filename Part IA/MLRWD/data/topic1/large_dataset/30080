This is the most intelligent of all the 'Alice' adaptations. Even though it was filmed for BBC TV, it was filmed in 35mm B&W,using deep focus, wide-angle cinematography. A technology usually associated with theatrical feature films. The result is the best cinematography of all the 'Alice' films.
  The musical score by Ravi Shankar is hypnotic and mesmerizing. Jonathan Miller's direction is daft and subtle and calls to mind the offbeat films of Richard Lester at that period.
 And the mad tea party. It's the best and most subtle of all the Hatter tea parties on film. It's truly mad and crazy, and it's done without special effect gimmicks or cute little songs.Peter Cook is the best of all the Hatters I've seen and I've seen over a dozen in just film alone. He is truly mad. Not a cute,sweet mad like Johnny Depp, but a disturbing and real sort of mad.
  This film is a great adaptation and a beautiful work of cinema.
