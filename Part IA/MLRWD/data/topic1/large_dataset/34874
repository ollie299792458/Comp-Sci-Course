What a disappointment! I can't comprehend the good reviews for this movie. Despite what the reviews say, this movie was not directed by anyone who has ever SEEN the inside of a tank, let alone ever served in one. I could go on forever with details, but suffice it to say that the "tank" in this movie is more like the submarine in "Das Boot" rather than any tank ever built. Similarly, the movie bears no resemblance whatever to tank crew tasks, tank tactics, or the "tank experience" in general. For example, the crew don't wear headsets (how else to hear?) and never once open the hatch to look around (although anyone on the outside can open the hatch and look in at will!). Utterly ridiculous in every aspect. Lastly, the entire final hour of the movie features only the crew members yelling at each other (in subtitles), inside the "Das Boot" set. I can't comment on the "larger" issues of Jewish guilt etc, but can say with certainty that this movie is so boring and absurd that it will bring tears of laughter! No redeeming qualities - avoid at all costs.
