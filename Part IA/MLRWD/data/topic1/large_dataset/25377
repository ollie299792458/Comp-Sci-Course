I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it.  It's one of the first videos I ever bought.  This movie has captured how it feels to be a kid--dealing with bullies, friends' dares, little brothers, Christmas anticipation, teachers, broken glasses, disappointments, and fear of your dad when you're in trouble.  Some things never change, I guess.  I love Ralph's daydreams, his whiny little brother Randy who won't eat unless he can be a pig, and the pink bunny pajamas from Ralph's aunt Clara who "had for years not only perpetually labored under the delusion that [Ralph is] 4 years old, but also a girl."  
Oh Fudge, wash my mouth out with soap (but please don't use LifeBouy)!  There are a few bad words in the movie, but not many.  It's limited to a couple of S.O.B.'s and a couple of smart-a**es.  Most of the bad language in the movie is simulated.  Because Ralphie's father swears all the time, Ralphie learns to swear.  I think that is a good lesson for everyone.  And who has not at least wanted to beat up a bully?  
As a mother, I can understand the "irrational prejudice against Red Ryder and his Peacemaker".  What I can't understand is the few people with irrational prejudice against this movie.  It's just as cute as can be.  See it with your family.  I think just about everyone will enjoy it.
