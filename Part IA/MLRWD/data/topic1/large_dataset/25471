Although this is not the best concert I have ever watched it is a superb DVD to have in one's collection.  I have watched the DVD four times since receiving it, less than a month ago, and enjoy it more each time as I grow to know the performers I have never seen or heard of before.  Seeing Julie Andrews is always a delight to me.

The best 'chapter' of the DVD, for me, is Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag performed by Karen Ziemba & Bebe Neuwirth.  It is excellent.  The two ladies were superb together.  Bebe, technically, is the better of the two but I loved them both.

The best performances were: Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag, Nothing, Everybody's Girl, Some People, The Lloyd Webber Love Trio, Life upon the Wicked Stage and Adelaide's Lament.

The best performers were: Bebe Neuwirth, Karen Ziemba, Priscilla Lopez, Debra Monk, Liza Minnelli, Rebecca Luker, Kit Kat Girls, Dee Hott and Faith Prince.

All the ladies were superb in their own ways.  The only performer I was really disappointed with (and she was greeted with such delight by the audience when she came on, and after) was Jennifer Holliday.  I hated her hairstyle to start with.  She obviously has great talent but I detested the way she sang 'And I'm telling you I'm not going'.  I don't mind anyone giving their all but I hated her rendition.  If her throat hurt her after the show I'm not surprised.  Someone needs to fine tune her natural talent, because she certainly has it.  Miss Holliday, I would like to have seen you perform another song where you could have blown my mind away.

Audra McDonald impressed me with her varied singing styles.  She is delightful.

Of course every review is subjective and what I don't like, someone else could love.

All-in-all it is a wonderful evening's entertainment.
