First of all I'd like to say I am VERY picky about comedies. Some drop the F bomb every second and it really makes the movie stupid, and others try way too hard to be funny.
I'm a Family Guy type of person and that makes me just die laughing lol

When I saw this it was just the greatest movie (99 percent of the time I don't laugh out loud at comedies, just chuckle on the inside) but I was laughing out loud at this movie!
I know it may seem like an inappropriate/trashy movie the first three or so minutes of the movie (I'm trying to convince my mom to watch it when it comes out, and just to ignore the first part) But it really is just the greatest movie.

The story line is even great, the characters are all so unique too. Great actresses and actors even though they're not big time stars, they're actually better than a lot of huge actors/actresses. I had a lot of hopes throughout the story, like the outcome, and when it's a really good movie like this one, I get into the story and am like "oh I hope this happens ahh!!"

There were so many OH MY GOD!!! HAHAHAHHA! moments, and it really made my day and I wanted to see it again and again.

Overall, this was a very good movie. So many funny parts, not really even slow or boring parts.
