I recently purchased a new HDTV and was having a lot of trouble getting it calibrated correctly.  None of the presets were even close to what I would consider to be the ideal settings, so I decided to try out a few of the calibration discs available including Disney WOW, Digital Video Essentials, and Spears & Munsil.  As one would expect from Disney, I found their WOW disc to be the most straight forward and easiest to use by far.  Although it comes with a step by step user manual, I found that I didn't even need to open it.

I am pretty technical, so I have to admit that I was initially concerned that the Disney disc might be geared too much for the beginner and wouldn't be as useful as some of the other discs.  However, I am happy to say that I needn't have been concerned.  The disc provides three different modes of operation Beginner, Advanced, and Expert; so it is ideally suited to anyone from the least technical to the most technical.

One of the things that really impressed me about Disney WOW was its test patterns particularly the ones for brightness and contrast.  I absolutely love them!  In my opinion, they are much easier to use than the patterns that come with the other brands.  Each test pattern comes with a clear and concise audio/visual introduction and demonstration which makes it very easy to understand exactly what the pattern is intended to reveal and how to adjust the corresponding TV settings.

The bottom line is that Disney WOW provides exactly what you need in a calibration disc.  It contains appropriate explanations and guidance without overwhelming the user with a lot of technobabble.  The other two brands that I tried were nowhere near as easy to use as Disney WOW and both of them just seemed too technical for the average home user.  If you're looking for the perfect home theater calibration disc, then look no further than Disney WOW.  I highly recommend it!
