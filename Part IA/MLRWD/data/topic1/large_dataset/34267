The Bond movies are not so much a series of films as they are a cultural phenomenon.  Every 007 fan should own these sets.  Having said that, the quality of the films varies widely, but that is to be expected from a series 40 plus years in the making.  Mr. Wilkinson (see other reviews), misses the point of On Her Majesty's Secret Service entirely.  Love it or hate it, it is the most satisfying emotionally of any of the Bonds, and I only wish Sean Connery had been the star. I also think referring to any 007 epic as "retarded" is a vapid generalization.  What does that mean, anyway?  "Retarded", as in not a fully realized work of art, cinematically retarded? Anyway, to me Pierce is the best Bond since Sean, and I feel all the movies are worth watching, even Never Say Never Again, a pallid remake of Thunderball.  At least it brought Connery back, something which Broccoli and Saltzman weren't able to accomplish.  If pressed, I would say highlights are Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Goldfinger, Goldeneye and The Living Daylights. Enjoy!
