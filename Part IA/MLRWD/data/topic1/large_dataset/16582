Dazzling 23rd century seamless special effects, fantastic set and wardrobe design, brilliant directing (Luc Besson is always a name to watch for); acting by Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Gary Oldman, Chris Rock (!), Ian Holm and a great supporting cast, too!!  A "perfect" being is dubbed as a great warrior to fight the ultimate evil which has an opportunity every 5,000 years to destroy the universe, if certain conditions are met (of course!).  Bruce Willis is a great hero character and just that little bit of sardonic humor to make you laugh as the s**t keeps hitting the fan in the downward spiral of his cab driver existence.  It's barely relevant as he will be catapulted into being a disbelieving hero as event after wild event unfolds.  Milla Jovovich is wonderful as our "warrior" whose one function is to defeat the great evil, but she must overcome great odds and things between her and Bruce are a "crash-hit" from the beginning (pun intended).  Gary Oldman, as always, shows his amazing depth of talent when he plays the greedy corporate owner and CEO of "Zorg."  He is wicked and dependable with his joy in creating havoc and destruction for others in the effort of his objectives.  He gives you a laugh even as he frightens or blows up underlings and will give you a kick even when the "clock is agains him."  Chris Rock is one hysterically silly DJ who gloats on his power over his groveling entourage and adoring fans.  Conversely, Bruce Willis will give him a very different ride for his money which you will enjoy... time and again.  So much more can be said, but I will say we all will be reminded of the four elements early in the movie, but "the fifth element" is something you will enjoy and discover on your own.  *****
