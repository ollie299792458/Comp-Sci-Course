I thought this movie was great even though the story was predictable.  It kept me entertained every minute!  One of my favorite scenes was when the two Italian cars got all dressed up to cheer at a race, and I almost died laughing since they looked just like the Italians we saw here in Germany during the month of World Cup games.

I also love that Pixar takes pride in the details.  The non-talking characters in the movie were just as well thought out and lovingly crafted as the "human"  characters.

Another great thing about Pixar is they continue to entertain even after the story is over. The credits in this one were especially great. If you see it don't even think about leaving the movie theater until the credits are done rolling.

And finally, I was impressed by the number of notable people they had play caricatures of themselves. Mario Andretti, Richard Petty and his wife Lynda, Bob Costas, Darrell Waltrip, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were all in there. (Not that I knew this until I checked out the IMDB entry for the movie, but it's still cool. I'm sure there are other famous names that I just don't know since I'm not a NASCAR fan.) Aside from racing names, they also had Click and Clack from NPR, as well as Jay Leno playing a TV talk show car called "Jay Limo."

Genius!!
