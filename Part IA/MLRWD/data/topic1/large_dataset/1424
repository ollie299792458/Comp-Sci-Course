I enjoyed this film thoroughly. Perhaps more for its few subtleties and heart-twisting moments of pathos than for all of the outrageous and shocker elements. Contrary to most of the reviewers, I thought Macauley Culkin was suberb. He made the absolute most of each scene, performing with the camera in the most symbiotic manner I have seen since Anthony Perkins in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Seth Green was a knock-out, totally compelling as the witty, jaded, but basically decent James St. James.

Unfortunately, the film itself needs much rework. In order to be a latter day 'Cabaret' as I am sure this film aspires, on some level to be, it would have been a good idea to look to past film masterpieces that address historically decadent times and places in the most effective cinematic manner. Too much of Party Monster needs polish and much better editing.

No regrets though, I will watch it again if only for the chance to experience a world that was here and gone as fast as a Fourth of July fireworks display.
