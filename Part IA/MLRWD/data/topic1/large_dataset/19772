This movie portrays what many, many American males went through in high school. Being bullied. This movies not only puts to rest old demons that still sometimes haunt grown men when they think about high school (by seeing Jerry beat up the bully instead of the other way around), but it was so funny that I can't resist watching it whenever it is on cable! The crazy antics that occur in every high school in America (and abroad), are displayed by the nutty teachers, the rabid dogs that sometimes pass for school security guards, and the crazy girl that likes you for who you are so much that she wants to "bond" with you on a display table in the school store . It is excellent! I feel that a defining moment in the movie is when Jerry is in the bathroom, washing his face, deciding whether or not it was worth getting killed by standing up to the overgrown neanderthal, Buddy Rovell. Regardless of whether or not you like the movie, we are ALL overjoyed when Jerry decides to risk life and limb for personal honor!
It is a fun movie, and I would suggest it to anyone.
