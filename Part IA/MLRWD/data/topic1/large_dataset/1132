If you are looking for a bang bang ... F * F ** movie (as so eloquently stated by the 1 and 2 stars ratings), this is not your stop. But if you have appreciated the complexity of Syriana and are a M. Moore fan, then this could be another GREAT movie to add to that collection.
I was not going to watch it, even though I am a Penn fan, because it is still very painful memory for me. The day Bush invaded Iraq, was the day I stopped believing in truthful government ...

Still, I am very glad I did. The acting was impeccable, the directing superb and shilling.... It is difficult to re-live the magnitude of the power of a government set to serve its own business goals to the detriment of human lives. But it was worth the time, because it is a great reminder about what this country stands for.

There isn't much I did not know about the hypocrisy behind the invasion of Iraq, but I am glad I saw the movie anyways because it reinforced that a government should be afraid of its people and not the other way around.

So if you are up for a cup full of emotional discomfort that will leave you with more questions than answers, then this is for you.
