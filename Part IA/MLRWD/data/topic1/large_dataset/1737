Legendary films like this just aren't made anymore. Don't believe me? Then go watch Caspar Milquetoast boy Tom Cruise in "A Few Good Men" which was a blantant ripoff off this fine effort. Bogart once again  delivers an unforgettable performance. Like all great movies from this era,  we are treated to a strong cast of personalities and how they react during  a great story line. Bogart is the hard-line captain who hides behind a  tough exterior as a way of distancing anybody who tries to get close to  him. But this is just what he needs after the hell he's been through  fighting in the Atlantic campaign. He's does make a few attempts to buddy  up in the movie, but the men reject him each time due to his growing  strictness and deteriorating mental condition. A real study of the human  psyche which Bogart plays like a master. A nice sideline story in this  movie is the new gung-ho ensign Robert Francis. Watching him slowly mature  from a dominating mother, appreciate his vivacious girlfriend, all while  becoming a competant naval officer. The final courtroom drama is a great  climax to this great effort. Sorry, Jack "You can't handle the  truth." Nicholson, you're no Humphrey Bogart.
