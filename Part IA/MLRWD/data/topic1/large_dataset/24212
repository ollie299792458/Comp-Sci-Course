This movie is very disappointing in SO many ways! Technically poor, mostly boring, mediocre performances from the actors, confusing and not accurate. Hector Babenco sure has done better things, such as Ironweed, Pixote or The Kiss of the Spider Woman. This movie could have been at least more honest on telling us the whole story about the police and immates clash at the Carandiru prison, which of course, wasn't motivated by a fight during a soccer game, and everybody who's informed about the events knows that, huh Hector? Instead of telling us the real story, Hector Babenco prefered to serve us with a stupid and inaccurate politically correct version of the things. HIS biased version of the things. It's more like watching a fiction movie. An awful fiction movie, I must add.

Not worthy watching or renting this piece of junk. Don't waste your time or money with this, I regret wasting mine. I wish I could rate this movie 1/4 of a star because 1 star is waaay more more than it deserves.
