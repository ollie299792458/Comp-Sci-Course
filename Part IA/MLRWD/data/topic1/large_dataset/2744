I have seen just about every version thus far made of Jane Eyre and it was only until I stumbled upon the BBC version played by Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke that I truly fell in love with Charlotte Bronte's magnificent work.  Many have proclaimed that the actors do not fulfill the complexity of their original story-book characters, but I must refute such thoughts.  Timothy Dalton could not have placed any more emotion and life into the harsh character that he is in Bronte's book, and the same being for Zelah Clarke who, although I thought was underwritten in some parts, portrayed the very images that the reader might have conjured as they read the book.  And, in comparison to the other movie versions, this much more lengthy script performs better as we (the audience) gets to see the troubling and hurtful life Clarke's character, Jane Eyre, had to endure as she grew up in a charity school for girls and the cold-heartedness of her aunt.  I have to give two thumbs up for this brilliant adaptation of such an elegant and romantic drama story.  It takes the audience back in time and allows them to experience the life and love of Jane Eyre, which Charlotte Bronte so wanted to grant her readers.  END
