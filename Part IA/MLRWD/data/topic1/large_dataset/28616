I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as it pulled a number of appealing heart stings personally. Originally I got to see this film on the big screen on an invitation from friends studying Russian language and literature. That means without a doubt the great and incomparable writer giant Pushkin.
Straight off I found the setting of a rural backwater setting and photographic panorama of leafy forestry lakes and waters a wonderland. In fact an autumn delight to set a stage for what are good and convincing actors. The heart stings are the somewhat sad and confused signals in the main protagonists love games ending in the unrequited finality of the final scenes. Yeah romantic rubbish I hear people shout, but at the same time the Pushkin story and poise delivered by these this cast of actors brings it all to totally and utterly truth. Hey it happens that way even in fast modern times, except without the duels etc..
Another heart string in the "inner space" this film version seemingly has. Type of thoughtful resistive moments you get in those there samurai movies with Akira Kurosawa. Those thoughtful pauses that make you wonder what's going to happen next, what is the characters' decision or action going to create.
Frankly read the poem in an English translation and have to say prefer the movie as the poem/book whatever I guess looses so much unless one is a fine Russian speaker. . .
