The FILM: After all those years, Sam Raimi's debut feature still delivers very well. This film did not only become a cult favourite because of its excessive use of gore, but because it was made by a bunch of very talented people. You want proof? Here you go: The special effects seem, especially to our nowadays CGI-spoiled eyes, very cheap, crude and primitive, yet the film still works extremely well. Even after all those years, the film still manages to conjure a very special atmosphere which greatly contributes to the success of this film. Many, many scenes still stand out and it is still a delight to watch in fascination the imagination, enthusiasm and creative wit of Sam Raimi and his team.  The DVD: The picture quality is hardly striking but, considering the source material (it was, after all, an "amateur"-film), very pleasing. Special note: In order to preserve the correct aspect ratio of the original film, this film was transferred in full frame instead of a letterbox format. It's great fun to hear the demons dashing through the woods in remixed surround sound. Also, do not forget to check out the audio commentaries which feature a whole bunch of interesting trivia. Kudos to Anchor Bay for another great disc, if you want a definite edition of THE EVIL DEAD, don't look any further...
