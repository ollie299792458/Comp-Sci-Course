I was a big fan of the first Starship Troopers. The characters, the action, the attitude, they all satisfied my hunger for good old fashioned sci-fi war movie. I was expecting (from the ending of the first one) that the weapons and ships were upgraded and the fight against the bugs continued on the same epic scale. That's when my disappointment kicked in.

The movie begins with cut scenes from the first movie, then focuses on a dark planet surface where a unit is fighting the bugs. The bugs looked the same, but they were much less aggressive, acting more like a pack of wolves rather than the fearless drones they were on the first movie. It gave time for a long and boring dialogue. This movie picks up where the first one left off, but the relation ends there. The rest of the movie is like that of a dark horror flick. If the first one was not to your liking, this one may suit you better. It just did not work for me.

This progression reminded me of the movies Aliens and Alien 3. It feels just like that.
