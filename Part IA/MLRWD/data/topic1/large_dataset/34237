This movie is a creative milestone for animated movies, not only for the animation but for its warmth, charm and delightfully loopy dialogue.  There are also underlying positive themes of forgiveness, acceptance and helping each other out that are refreshing.

Shrek is the story of an ogre who starts out on a quest to save his home and finds love and friendship along the way. His journey is told from a "fractured fairy tale" point of view that keeps you laughing and engaged.  Every character from every fairy tale seems to be in the movie and that is part of what makes it so hilarious.

The interaction between the main characters is the main reason the movie is so funny: Shrek, the mean ogre who actually has a heart of gold and just wants to be accepted as he is; the obnoxious but lovable Donkey who turns out to be a loyal friend; and the idealistic but tough Princess Fiona who is looking for her true love.  They have issues and bicker and get on each other's nerves at first, but they discover they have more in common than they realized and that they really care about each other. All turns out well in the end.
