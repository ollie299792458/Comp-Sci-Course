This is no great film in terms of plot execution or dialogue or acting. But this movie is still an amazing piece of craftsmanship. Made on a low budget, even for the time, it is visually amazing. A giant bronze statue comes to life. Harpies torment a man and are captured. The hero fights a multi-headed hydra. And a climactic battle with undead skeletons. All without any computer work at all. No computers were used to make this film. And while the special effects might seem a little dated in this day and age of polished digital CGI beasts and worlds, they still work. I still have seen every little in modern films that impresses me as much as the work done on the giant bronze Talus in this film.

The blu-ray transfer of this film is really well done. It's clean and not at all grainy. This film also comes with a pair of commentaries. The one with Ray Harryhausen and film historian Tony Dalton is good. The one with Peter Jackson and Randall Cook is good at first, but unfortunately they begin to start talking about other Harryhausen films and spend as much if not more time talking about the Sinbad films as they do about "Jason and the Argonauts." Scenes where I wish they were commenting on the action on screen they spend talking about how much they prefer "The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad." Which is a fun film, but not what I want them to talk about when I'm watching "Jason and the Argonauts."

Anyway, this film is entertaining as spectacle, and it looks wonderful in the blu-ray format. It is even child friendly, if your child can handle fantasy and skeletons. There is no gore, and the closest it gets to overt sexuality is a scene of Nancy Kovack dancing while painted gold. So buy it and watch it with your family.
