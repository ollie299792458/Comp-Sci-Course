This is an extraordinary and emotionally-moving historical drama, one of the best films I've seen in recent years, a beautiful symphony of actors, direction, cinematography, script, costumes, music, editing and direction. There isn't a false note anywhere. Not many films can boast that. The cast is uniformly close to perfection, particularly Dougray Scott(playing Sir Thomas Fairfax) and the beautiful Olivia Williams (as his wife Lady Anne.) Their realistic emotional interplay, with their characters almost painfully at odds at times, is breathtaking to behold, helped by a very literate script.

The film concentrates on the bond--almost a mutual love--bewteen Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell, and the interplay of Lady Anne to this bond. Never do the historical aspects of the film overshadow the emotional aspects. That's a difficult balancing act, and only a few great directors (notably David Lean) have been able to pull it off successfully. I would add this film to that list. It deserves to be seen by a wide audience.

My only small gripe is that the DVD doesn't have any subtitles to choose from; there are times when the dialogue is difficult to understand--at least from this American viewer's point of view. British audiences would probably have no problem with it.
