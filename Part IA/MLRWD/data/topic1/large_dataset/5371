I watched Waking Life a few months ago with my then-boyfriend, and we both could not stop talking about it with everyone we knew after that. The movie is really dense, in that there is so much dialog that you can barely keep track of it all. And every conversation between the characters is interesting and makes you think. On top of that, there's the whole "plot" of the movie, if you could call it that, but it has you thinking and wondering about the very existence of the main character and what it is and what that means. Anyway, long-winded but you get the picture. So I think the two of us probably got about 25 other people to go see it, and they kept coming back to us and talking about it. And just when I thought the Waking Life topic had died down, I get the DVD for my birthday. So now I've watched it about 3 more times, and lent it to some friends and IT'S BACK. This movie is so unique and excellent that I don't think I'm ever going to get away from it. In fact, I'm starting to feel like I'm the one in the crazy dream-state since every conversation I have nowadays is linked to Waking Life somehow. Anyway, if you like to think, watch this movie. And then watch a few more times. And then talk to other people who have watched it and see what happens. If you don't like to think, then go watch a Steven Seagal movie. You'll love it.
