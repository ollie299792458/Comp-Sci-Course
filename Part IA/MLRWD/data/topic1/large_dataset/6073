It's been at least 20 years now since I first watched Circle of Iron as a teenager with a keen interest in the martial arts. A friend and I rented it from the local video store. We didn't really know what we were in for, only that it had been written by Bruce Lee and starred David Carradine of Kung Fu fame. I'm sure I didn't grasp nearly as much of what Lee intended to express back then. I think I get it a bit better now.

I'll be honest. By modern standards (and probably even those of that time, I would think), the fight scenes are rather poor. They are a bit overdramatized, the camera work isn't very good, and the general athleticism demonstrated is average. The sound effects are pretty typical of the era, meaning really bad by today's standard. If you can look past that, though, you may actually find yourself enjoying the film.

Overall, the cinematography reminds me a lot of the Conan films, though I don't think they same folks were involved in the shooting. I happen to like those movies, even if they were clunky in places, so take that for what it's worth.

If you like movies that make you think, then you will probably get something quite worthwhile out of Circle of Iron. Lee's intent was to explore and display elements of Zen philosophy and the film certainly does that. How much it keeps to Lee's intentions (from the original The Silent Flute script), I have no idea, but there's at least enough of it to make viewing a pleasantly thought-provoking experience. And there's a bit of comedy tossed in as well. :-)
