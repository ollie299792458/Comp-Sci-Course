This is a great, dark, funny, scary, roller-coaster ride of a modern noir B-movie that felt like it was discovered in Jim Thompson's waste paper bin.  It might be pastiche, but it's entertaining pastiche.  I don't know!  Give you people a good film and, firstly, you don't go and see it and, secondly, if you do catch it on DVD, all you do is moan, moan, moan, not even like would-be critics but distributors or accountants.  Everyone knows by now that the B pictures are usually much better than the A pictures.  Now, of course, they make B pictures with A budgets.  True pulp should be made for chump change, not $20 million, with big stars.  For me, Stone is interesting but deeply flawed.  He just loves the big subject.  Here he has virtually no subject at all, and it's great fun seeing him take a breather and let his hair down.  I understand this did no, or little, business but now has cult status, which is justice of a sort and probably the best you can hope for these days.  Hay, lighten up.  Have a few beers and slip it on the DVD.  If you're disappointed then you have no taste and deserve what the studios throw at you.  By the way, I'm an English noir fan.  What do I know?
