For film buffs it is not necessary to talk about Frank Capra, or its importance in film history, aesthetics or language. But since this film has had several home video incarnations, it is important to point out one that has made justice to the original negative and soundtrack.

This new edition also includes a colourized version, but no one is obliged to see it. Why would Paramount include such a version, with this kind of picture, is beyond my comprehension. Given that colourization emphasises colour distortion, especially on the actors' faces, and since the movie itself was never intended for colour photography, it is somewhat difficult to understand why anyone would like to see the film in this version. But, since the original is still there, no harm is done.

Undoubtedly, "It's a wonderful life" is the best Capra film ever made. No matter how many times we have already seen it, it is still impossible not to keep as part of anyone's film library, now in the best video format possible.
