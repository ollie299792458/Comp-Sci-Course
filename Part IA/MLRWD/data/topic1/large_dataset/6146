Ignore the negative views of those who dislike or do not appreciate the genre - rent it then you will buy it to watch over and over - you will laugh at new angles and unseen nuggets even after multiple viewings. 
A Wilder classic, with Jack Lemon, Curtis nee Grant and MM!
Staged in the prohibition era and framed around the St Valentines Day Murder it shows how laughter can be drawn from desparation in two bystanders caused economically and corporally.
Being a Cary Grant fan adds to the enjoyment - with Curtis playing "Cary Grant playing Cary Grant" so well that rumour has it he was only able to clear the slate with the suave master when they played together in Operation Petticoat -the first time since SLIH.
How MM managed to stay in that dress (worn during "I wanna be loved by you") is a feat of quantum physics - no wonder they never let it be seen out of shadow...
A masterpiece is an oft used phrase but I watch this jem to laugh, cry, smile and think. It can work in multiple dimensions and help you along in life through your emotions. How many movies can perform such a feat?
I am in their debt as they have enriched my life.
