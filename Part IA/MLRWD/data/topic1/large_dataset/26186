Let's face it - Scarface is an American classic. For those of you who went to film school, Scarface follows the classic pattern of any successful dramatic work.

*THE STAR YOU LOVE TO HATE. Tony Montana epitomizes everything a lead actor should be. He's egotistical. He's violent. He's not very intelligent, but he's extremely "smart". He's a drug addicted, narcissistic, alpha male drug lord who you just can't help but to like. He has a sense of humor, but he can turn on you on a dime. You know he's bad, really bad, but you want him to win in the end.

*THE CLASSIC RAGS TO RICHES TO RUINS TALE. It's the American dream. The movie is long, but you'll never notice. It takes you on Tony Montana's journey from a Cuban "political refugee" to the most powerful drug lord in the world. And you're riveted by every blood soaked scene. He finally has money, he has the woman, he has the power, but he never quite gets the happiness or satisfaction. Like all classic rags to riches to tales, it doesn't end well.

*THE CONFLICT. There are so many subplots in this movie, you must pay attention to keep up. But they all come to a head in the dramatic finale. He loves his sister, but will kill anyone who looks at her twice. His best friend seems to be the only one who has a sense of reality, but he's intoxicated by Tony Montana's power. Montana is surrounded by "goons" who would kill him to be him, but it just makes his character stronger. You see his self destruction, but you can't turn away.

This is one of the best movies of all time. Pacino is SO good, no role he's played in the last 25 years lives up to this one.

If you don't have the Scarface collector's edition in your DVD collection, you're not a true aficianado of the art of the gangster movie.

5 stars.
