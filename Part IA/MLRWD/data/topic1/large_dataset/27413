I saw Young Frankenstein a long time ago, and thought it was really funny.  I've recently seen FOR THE FIRST TIME the original Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein.  After having seen these classics, I can truly appreciate all of the jokes in Young Frankenstein, as well as see what a totally LOVING tribute this movie of Mel's is to the first three Frankenstein classics.  For example, I thought Kenneth Mars's character with his wooden arm was just some wacky Mel Brooks thing - but, no, the inspector in "Son of" had a wooden arm just like Kenneth's, and the inspector and Dr. Frankenstein played darts in "Son of" too.

One little weird coinky-dink which I just discovered tonight regards Madeline Kahn's singing of "Oh sweet mystery of life at last I've found you..." after she and the monster make love.  Well, what's funny about this is that this song is from a movie called "Naughty Marietta" which happens to co-star Elsa Lanchester, the original BRIDE whom Madeline is parodying!  (I've been watching anything with Elsa in it ever since I saw Bride.)

See the three original Frankensteins, then revisit (or see for the first time) Young Frankenstein.  It becames crystal clear what a brilliant film Young F. is.  And, for shear Mel Brooks wackiness that has nothing to do with any of the three Frankenstein movies, you've gotta love the "Puttin' on the Ritz" scene.  I don't want to spoil it, I'll just say it will leave you grabbing your sides with tears rolling down your cheeks.  Young F. has got to be Mel Brooks at the top of his game!
