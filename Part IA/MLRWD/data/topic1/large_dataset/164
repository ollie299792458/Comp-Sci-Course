Frank Black is the best. With the amount of CSI style shows on the air, it is great to go back to Millennium and see who started it all.  Mulder and Scully were good, Carter did an excellent job with the X Files, but Frank is exceptional. Lance Henrickson never missed a beat in this series. A complex actor who was true to the charecter.

I am glad I purchased the first two seasons. The complex storytelling and forensic factor are addicting.

My review of the series is as follows:

The first season is a "monster of the week" show. (similar to X Files first two seasons which I really enjoyed)

The second season is darker and exposes the truth behind the Millennium group. Frank loses his wife and his big yellow house.

The third season is even darker. Frank no longer trusts Peter or the group and struggles to raise his daughter Jordan.

I anxiously await my third season and will share it with my co-workers and family to enjoy.

I enjoy all of Chris Carter's work. My one major complaint is that he should have teamed Frank and Scully to work together after the departure of Agent Mulder from X Files. Now that would have been the best team!!
