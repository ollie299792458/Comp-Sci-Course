Enough superlatives have been heaped on this Bergman masterpiece and justifiably so. Lets talk about the much awaited Criterion DVD. The transfer is nothing short of superb, doing full justice to Sven Nykvist's luminous cinematography, one of the best in cinema ever. Very few artefacts are present, and the sound is the original magnetic mono transfer.  The extras are little. There is an interview with Bergman (which is a rare treat since he is so camera shy)and Erland Josephson. However, the interview has very little to do about his craftsmanship, and is primarily concerned with his personal life. Bergman comes across as a real "ordinary Joe" filled with the same human folly as all of us. For many of his fans like me who like to worship his enigmatic philosophical existence, this comes as a surprise and a bit of a disappointment to see that he is no "god" after all.  No other features, or any commentary.  But thank you Criterion for this superb transfer. This is reason enough to toss out your Home Vision VHS copy and get the disc. Especially if you have a widescreen 16X9 TV, where you can enjoy the superb anamoprphically enhanced image.
