I am of the sometimes misguided notion that most of the great films (and not-so-great films)were produced in the 70's. That being said, most of the movies I want to see are not available for rent so I must purchase in order to view. Many times I've been burned, and as a result, I have many DVDs that I've only viewed once, or only a quarter of the way through. With BUG, I managed to watch the whole thing, but found it quite ponderous. Bradford Dillman was good (as usual), but the movie dragged and dragged. The blurb on the back cover made it sound like it was going to be a typical 70' disaster film involving giant roaches. In spite of the plot taking the turn it did (Dillman's character breeding roaches for sinister purposes), the movie needed to be tightened up and moved along. This type of movie needs to have thrills and excitment, both of which were missing. To paraphrase Herschell Gordon Lewis, if I want a test of endurance, I'll go to a health studio and see how many pushups I can do, not sit through a piece of garbage.
