An overwhelming minority of reviewers have found fault with this documentary. "It's biased," they say. Well, if you have read any Howard Zinn, you know that there is no such thing as objectivity - nor is it particularly desirable. Yes, this film criticizes the war, but it does so utilizing facts and primary sources. In other words, it provides an honest antiwar bias. Instead of simply stating that our government lied to us, they show various video clips of officials making contradictory statements. They document how the official story changed over time from 'Iraq might have weapons of mass destruction' to 'Iraq definitely has weapons of mass destruction' to post-invasion excuses like 'We will find evidence weapons of mass destruction' and finally 'Sorry, we couldn't find any weapons of mass destruction.' Along with these primary sources, "Uncovered" also contains interviews with a number of active and retired CIA analysts, State Department officials and diplomats. This expert commentary is actually the merit of the film; their analysis is penetrating and insightful. Along with "Uncovered," you might also check out "Bush Family Fortunes: The Best Democracy Money Can Buy." Then again, does anyone really need a DVD to tell them that the US invaded Iraq not for security reasons but to control the oil fields and profit from reconstruction contracts? Even the most casual look at the history of US intervention reveals this repugnant pattern of the dollar following the sword. If anything, "Uncovered" could have been more antiwar biased, exposed more lies, more deception, and the ugly business of bombs for oil - because such bias is justified. For those of you who would like more historical context, I recommend William Blum's amazing book, "Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II" and Howard Zinn's impressive "A People's History of the United States."
