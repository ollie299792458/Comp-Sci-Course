Save your money and your time and take a pass on this one.  Not only is it not appropriate for children, but Robin Williams is creepy and inept, further adding to the worthlessness of this picture.  Travolta is somewhat likable, simply because his character is harmless, but overall if this is what Disney is now calling a family movie you are best advised to preview it before sitting down with the kids.

Here's the short list of reasons kids should not be viewing this film:

Very few actual kid-friendly scenes; instead adult situations and conversations.
Travolta and Williams live together which is sure to invite questions parents are not ready to answer, especially from very young or impressionable viewers
Williams has twins from a fling in Mexico, that suddenly appear with the mother.
Williams and Travolta accidentally take each other's prescription drugs, resulting in a funny, albeit questionable and extended hallucinogenic scene involving both.
Travolta is constantly hitting on the opposite sex throughout the movie, in a very forward manner not appropriate for young viewers.
Robin Williams character is truly a poor representation of a father.  Sure, he has not seen the kids and didn't know he had them, but when he does finally meet them, he acts completely helpless.

The list goes on.  I am by no means some uptight fundamentalist with no sense of humor, but I found myself constantly trying to distract my three kids, 8, 7, and 5 during most of this film, to avoid having to answer questions before they are old enough to understand the answers.  Stick to Sleepless in Seattle.
