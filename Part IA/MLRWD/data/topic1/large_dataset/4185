I think what comes though the most on this is the complete lack of effort put into it.  Now I understand that a person under the influence may require assistance to put out a professional product, but one would assume that there are managers and editors somewhere in the pipeline between him and my DVD player.  I also hope he got permission (or a lawsuit) from the "Super Size Me" movie - be absolutely clear that this is NOT related to that movie (perhaps it can hide behind by 1st ammendment parody rights) or the people that produced it.

Great comedy takes months of practice and refinement on the road to even have a hope of working.  This seems like completely unrehearsed, stream-of-consciousness stuff that relies on the listener to be sufficiently stoned that anything is funny.  And if you're at the point where anything is funny, this might be as well, but by definition you don't need it at that point.

It seems as though he has 8 basic jokes which he retells in various forms (the "I Forgot", the "I Don't Know Where I Am", and so on).  But there's certainly nothing here even on the level of a Cheech and Chong outtake.

If you've ever seen a good standup comic do 20 minutes on drug use, then you've already heard everything here.  Save your money.
