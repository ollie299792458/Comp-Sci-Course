I'm a big Formula 1 fan, and I'm glad F1 decided not to get involved with this picture.  This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The whole idea that a guy would dump a young talent just because he didn't win the championship in his first year is ludicrous.  The ancillary story about Estella Warren and her switching between Bly and Brandenburg is not at all compelling, and then aside from that there seem to be not a few but several auxiliary plots that are only hinted at but never fleshed out, (Tanto's ex-wife, Memo's distress at losing his job, what happened to Tanto's career, etc.)  The dialogue is just atrocious with lines such as, "YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE ANYMORE!" and, "Joe, you never crawl!" Maybe you think you can forget all of that stuff and just watch the racing scenes?  Nope, they suck too, because it seems the only way they could think of to make them exciting was to have ridiculously overwrought crashes that would never happen in real life.  But the most ridiculous scene comes at the very end where suddenly Jimmy Bly pulls away from Brandenburg on a straightaway just because he suddenly realizes how much he loves racing.  The only three reasons anybody might want to watch this movie are:
1.  The racing through the streets scene is cool if you don't take it seriously (which shouldn't be too hard considering how awful this film is)
2. The music is really good.
3. For House fans, Robert Sean Leonard plays a significant (and stupid) role.
