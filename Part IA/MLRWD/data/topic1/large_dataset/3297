The premise is fairly simple. The Hellsing organization has been around for about a century bringing down the various undead creatures that pop up across the globe. The organization is headed up by Integra, a woman who so closely resembles a bishounen that even the most trained anime fan's eye will have trouble discerning her exact gender at first glance. She controls Alucard, an uber-powerful vampire who does all the things you'd expect vampires to be able to do and takes out vampires and zombies with ruthless efficiency. Watching these characters interact is a joy; the dialogue and character interaction here is charmingly written and executed. Hellsing has the honor of being the most character-driven horror series ever. Horror almost never focuses completely on characters. Hellsing does the opposite; the characters are given as much detail and background as possible. Therein lies the beauty of Hellsing; it isn't just about blood and guts. The violence is tempered with drama that takes itself seriously enough to validate the entire thing.

The show isn't without its problems, though. After the first episode, which is beautifully animated and brings the unconventional and daring character designs to life, the animation quality gets wildly inconsistent. Characters are frequently off-model and change from scene to scene. I'm not sure why the vampires have gigantic tongues but it winds up looking poorly-drawn and gets fairly distracting at times. After the first 8 episodes or so, the series derails a little and starts developing an "original" storyline that has nothing to do with the manga series it's supposed to be based on.

Summation: Excellent for what it is; one fo the best. Everything has drawbacks.
