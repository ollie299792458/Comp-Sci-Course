I recently set up my "home entertainment system" so I could pull content down from the web. Now on top of my 200 channels from cable, I also have available about a thousand other programs, movies and the like. It is ridiculous and has made TV watching an experience in gluttony. I say this because I am now so inundated with choices that it has become difficult committing to anything. I now spend more time searching for programs than actually watching them. So naturally, anything that holds my attention and makes me forget that I could be watching something else is really quite a remarkable feat. I didn't think this movie would make the grade. In fact, it was more from curiosity - having read Seven Years in Tibet (which I picked up at a library while on vacation and very much enjoyed) and having investigated purported reincarnation  phenomena in the West, that I thought - Why not try it? All I can say is, Wow. This truly is a film that will stick with you for days. I was spellbound.

How you feel about reincarnation won't in anyway prejudice your feelings about this film because there is so much more going on and it is not about trying to prove or disprove the belief; however, it is difficult to watch this film and not come away with a completely different attitude towards it. I went in totally skeptical, but intrigued. As a parent who has raised four daughters and finds it fascinating how strongly formed their personalities and inclinations are from very early on, this little kid was remarkable for the resemblance he bore towards the lama. I went from being very skeptical to being very impressed. Anyone who would try to dismiss this by pointing to nurturing, environment, conditioning, etc. just simply has never raised kids before. You can't make them do anything they don't want - not a two year old! - let alone be someone they are not. Incredible film.
