Paths Of Glory is one of the essentials films that any serious movie buff should see. It is quite simply one of the best movies ever made.

Directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, a French WW1 infantry officer whose regiment is given the task of assaulting a heavily fortified German position over open ground. The attack fails and the remnants of Dax's regiment retreat, a fact which so infuriates the French high command that three soldiers are pulled from the ranks, supposedly at random, to be shot for cowardice.

This isn't fiction; it's based on an actual WW1 incident that historians have verified.

The defence of the three condemned troops falls on Colonel Dax, who, in civilian life, is one of France's leading criminal lawyers.

The end result is brilliant. This film has timeless things to say about war, physical and moral courage, the internal machinations of bureaucracies and the atrocities that can result from venal and totally amoral people being put in positions of authority.

This movie is a timeless classic. Any serious movie buff should have Paths Of Glory in their collection.
