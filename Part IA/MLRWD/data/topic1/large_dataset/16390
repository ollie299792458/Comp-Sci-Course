The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has become known worldwide as a groundbreaking thriller, and with good reason. The mystery of Harriet's disappearance may not be the most original of plots, but the characters all bring life and intrigue to the story, especially Lisbeth Salander. She has become one of my favorite literary characters and Noomi Rapace, one of my favorite actresses.

The movie does omit some characters that were key in the novel and thus changes how and when some events occur, but I like to think of the movie and book as two separate entities rather than compare the two. Since I was introduced to the story and characters through the novel, it will always be my favorite of the two, but the movie is definitely impressive in the way that brutality and corruptness aren't sugarcoated for viewing pleasure. Definitely a must-see, even for those who have not read the books.

About the DVD, I was disappointed to not see more bonus features. One interview with Noomi Rapace, a family tree of the Vanger family and the theatrical trailers for the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and, its sequel, the Girl Who Played With Fire, are all that's included.

I have noticed that 2-disc extended versions have been released in Sweden for all three Millennium films. I'm not sure if they include a lot more bonus features than the U.S. release, but it would be nice to see the scenes that were cut from the movies. Here's hoping that the extended versions will be available in the U.S. eventually.
