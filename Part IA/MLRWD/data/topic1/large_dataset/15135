I was one of the "lucky" ones to see this as a sneak preview in Boston in 1980.  All I knew is that it was R rated and a horror film.  Boy--horror is right!  It's about a bunch of annoying one-dimensional college students.  There's the nerd, the fraternity, the jocks, the sluts etc etc.
 For no reason whatsoever some guy driving by the campus stops and starts slashing people up left and right.  That's about it.  All the "actors" are terrible (I don't think any of them hit it big), there are plot holes galore, no nudity and next to no blood or gore.  It's boring, stupid and pointless.  When I saw it my audience came barreling out of the theatre laughing and complaining nonstop about how terrible the film was.  We were given little cards to fill out saying how we liked the film.  Needless to say NO ONE liked this one!  It never even played theatrically in Boston.  It was released a year later at a drive in as the second feature of some other flick.  That should tell u everything u need to know. This is REALLY bad--and I love almost any horror flick!  Avoid.
