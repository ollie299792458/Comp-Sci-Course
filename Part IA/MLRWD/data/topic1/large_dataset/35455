The was by far my favorite ECW Tape. Unlike other tapes there were no "filler" matches. All carried a purpose and all were done pardon the expression EXREMELY, well. Justin Credible w/ Chastidy,Nicole Bass and Jason def. Jerry Lynn. Cool match. Chris Candido w/ Tammy AKA Sunny def. Lance Storm. great wrestling. Masato Tanaka def. Mike Awesome one of their best. Rob Van Dam and Sabu w/ Bill Alfonso def. Hayabusa and Jinsei "HAKUSHI" Shinzaki ECW Tag team title match. Oh my God, words cannot describe the action and the diversity of moves utilized. six man dudlyville street fight. Tommy Dreamer, the Sandman and Little Spike Dudley def. D-Von, Buh-Buh Ray and Big Dick w/ Sign Guy, Joel Gertner and Jeff Jones.This match came about when D-Von and Buh-Buh Ray Dudley gave Beaulla the 3D(Dudley Death Drop) breaking her neck and putting her out of wrestling forever.They also sent the Sandman to the hospital and Spike is fed up with his brother's abuse. Alot of scores to be settled here. Taz faces the "Beast from the East" Bam Bam Bigelow in an ECW Death Match AKA Falls count Anywhere with Taz's FTW(F*** The World) title on the line. An amazing tape from start to finish this truely is the Best of ECW.
There are also backstage segments with Rob Van Dam,Sabu and Bill Alfonso. RVD says they will defend "his" world tag team belts against Japan's best tag team. RVD :"And after tonight RVD's record will be six and 0." The other interview segment is with the Dudleyz it is ok in my opinion the worst part of the PPV wich means it is not bad.
