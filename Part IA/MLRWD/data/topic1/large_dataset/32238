I must admit I have not seen this movie in its entirety, rather just managed to catch most of it at different points a couple of times on HBO.  My son loves it and is freaked out by it at the same time, referring to it only as "The Squirrel Movie" (he's 3). But I will say that Johnny Depp by far is one of the most fascinating and engaging actors of our time -- I loved him in 'Edward Scissorhands' and the 'Pirates' series, but he is equally wonderful and sexy and heartbreaking in roles such as 'Chocolat' and 'Finding Neverland'.  For this alone it is worth sitting and enjoying 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', because there is not another actor working today that can embrace and make believable the quirkiness, weirdness, and vulnerability that Depp does with Willy Wonka.  I read the Roald Dahl book as a child and do not remember the backstory of how Wonka came to be such a weird little chocolate-loving man, but I think that this subplot certainly gives the movie and the other characters (Charlie and his family) some depth and certainly an explanation for why the Buckets seem to (in the end) invite Willie to be part of their family.  The movie has obviously more than its fair share of Computer-Generated Imagery, hence the squirrel scene and why my son is obsessed with the movie, but it still manages to be believable most of the time, particularly if you forget about the backdrops and concentrate on the relationships between all of the young characters, their parents, and of course what along the way in Wonka's factory ultimately becomes their demise.  For as happy and sugary-sweet as the Gene Wilder version was, this version is certainly dark and weird but just as lovable if you give it a chance.  The Oompa-Loompa(s), played by one little man and a lot of CGI, are the only parts I just didn't like -- just because he is (and thus they are) all weird-looking and fodder for bad dreams if you are a little kid.
