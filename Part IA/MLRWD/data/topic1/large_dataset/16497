The original Double Indemnity is excellent.  If I were teaching a course in Film Noir, this would be my choice for the archetype of the style.  The transfer is great, the extras enhance the experience, especially the featurette which provides glimpses of the execution of Walter Neff cut from the film.

I was originally unhappy with having to buy such an expensive version because Universal included the '73 tv remake.  But having just watched it after watching the original (and each commentary track), I love the original all the more.

I never thought of Richard Crenna or Samantha Eggar as bad actors, but if this were your only exposure to them, you might form that impression.  The script and the staging is nearly all the same as the original, but the result is flat and stale (a little bourbon would NOT get it on its feet!).  Only Lee J. Cobb contributes a performance close to quality of the original movie.

So the contrast of the two versions of this classic made my experience of the original all the richer.  But a word to Universal:  don't pump up the price and inflate the packaging if you pair such movies again.  Other studios are providing learned commentary tracks for no extra expense to the consumer, and that's a good thing.  The inclusion of the TV movie should not have doubled the price.
