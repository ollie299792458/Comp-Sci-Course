Let me start by saying I had no preconceptions about this movie. I'd never seen the originals. The only I thing I even knew about the originals was that the "Planet of the Apes" was really the Earth. Since this isn't true of this new version, I really went into it with an open mind.
I really liked the first half. The apes were established very well, with broad differences in character. A smarmy one, an evil one, one who, if a human, would have been a member of PETA, etc. The action was good, the concepts good. I was enjoying the ride.
But half-way through, the movie just dies. It stops short. I sat there waiting for something to happen for several minutes. And when it finally did happen, and the action exploded on the screen... it didn't make any sense. The resolution to the conflict was incomprehensible. And the very very end itself made ABSOLUTELY no sense at all.
I haven't been this disappointed in a movie in a long time. I felt especially cheated since the first half was so good. Oh well.
