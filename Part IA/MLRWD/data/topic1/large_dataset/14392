The movie illustrates more clearly than any other that I can remember, how important integrity and self-respect are.

Dr. Aziz, in his eagerness to please, is not honest with the visitors and he could've avoided all the trouble he got into by simply being  more like the Professor.  This is a lesson that he learned in the end.  The Professor can be annoying to his companions, but he shows us how, even under British domination, his supreme yet civil self-assurance, earns him everyone's respect.  Unlike too many people I know, his supreme self-respect extends to respect for all others.  He's never rude, loud, or over-bearing.  Just someone who respects the universe and is respected by it in turn.

The British can be annoyingly stuck up, but a small minority of them are shown to be decent and honest and to be appreciated for it.

All in all a movie that ought to be shown a whole lot more, not for the usual "look at how the imperialists victimized these people", but for what it can teach about civility and honesty.
