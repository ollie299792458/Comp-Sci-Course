I thought this was a good film and I liked that it explored the hardships and difficulties faced by milita men.  I don't think I've seen that in a film about the Civil War.  Usually Hollywood makes glamorous depictions of this time in history with handsome leading men and not-a-hair-out-of-place-and no-mascara-running leading women.  The actors in this film felt more relatable because they looked like real people.  Australian Simon Baker, for one, was completely unrecognizable in this film. Tobey Maguire's boy-man appearance, I thought, was completely shed with the long hair and five o'clock shadow. It's kind of a subtle change to his appearance but it brought out something in him that, at times, I couldn't see the Tobey Maguire I've gotten accustomed to seeing in the Spider-man movies.  There was a world-weary quality to his performance, and he seemed more like a man than anything I've seen him in.  I also liked the parallels between Maguire's character, Jake Roedel, and Jeffrey Wright's, Daniel Holt.  I like that even within the midst of so much bloodshed director Ang Lee allowed moments of humanity.  I enjoyed the scene when Roedel reads a letter to Holt and then asks Holt about his mother.  In this moment, you can see that Roedel begins to see Holt as a human being and the men begin to establish a bond.  I also thought Jewel's performance was good.  She's very natural.  I had read that Universal did not promote this film very well at the time it was in theaters, and that's really a shame.
