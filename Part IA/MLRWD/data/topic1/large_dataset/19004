The first thing I noticed with Arkadin was the similarities with Citizen Kane. Both stories revolve around an aloof wealthy complex figure, both are a character study of one great man. Arkadin, however, doesn't take it's time to tell a clean story. 
First, about the DVD. I share the comment with other online reviewers that it's not good. The image has the look like it was mastered from video, and the sound is flat with characteristics of generation loss. The audio is compressed so much, the music, effects, and dialogue often seem to be at the same volume level. This makes the movie irritating and difficult to watch all the way through.
Welles would rather talk about his accomplishments on Arkadin than his other movies. But I'd stick with Kane as his best work. Arakadin's pacing is fast and furious, much like that of radio drama intended to keep the audience interested and excited. It doesn't work in this movie, however. The fast cuts, dutch tilts, and overlapping dialogue drove me batty. This movie most closely resembles bad Italian films from that period. 
Arkadin's character, as well, is creepy and unbelievable. I didn't see real depth in the character, as in Kane. Arkadin seemed one-dimensional, lurchy, and uninteresting. Symbols (like the sled in Kane) are replaced with mystery around who Arkadin really is. But who really cares?
For anyone studying Welles and film, this is a movie that you should see. But you probably don't need to watch it more than once.
Tony Curtis, looking really creepy and donning strange black gloves, stumbles through an introduction of this DVD speaking mostly of Welle's life and times. He is right, in his half-drunk commentary, Welles was a shooting star that rose to stardom and faded away through the rest of his career.
