There are those of us who see this movie as an epic the likes of which Hollywood is no longer endowed with the skills or abilities to ever produce again. While taken by the magnitude of seeing the incredible visual detail of Blu-ray, my heart quickly sank at omitted iota's of dialog such as "you just wait one Jiffy" touts Billy Fish -Gone! So now he silently waves from the tower wall. Moreover, as mentioned in other reviews, the infamously missing "falling scene" from the bridge. I recently purchased and watched "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" in Blu-ray. That was a treat!!! Why? Because the guys who did the format transferring were huge fans, totally enamored with the movie. Their efforts went over the top. Well, that didn't happen here. Is the visual detail incredible? Yeah, but when your work subtracts from the original intent why would you even make the effort to start. Here's the bottom line. If you really love this movie wait for a future reformatting. Or, find it used at half price from someone like me. Don't pay to be disapointed.
