If you (like me) grew up in the 80's, you've probably already seen Goonies (many times!), and don't need to read a review about it. 5 stars for children of the 80's. For us this was a real coming-of-age story, about kids learning independence (and the value of friends and parents, too--what a great reunion scene at the end!), maturity, responsibility, acceptance of others, and doing "the right thing". Oh, and of course a great adventure too!

If you grew up in the 90's or are still in the process now, the movie of course still has all those things, but it's a little dated and not quite as "glamorous" and flashy as many movies made today. (But as another reviewer noted, I do believe it holds up pretty well, better than many 80's movies.) Still, it is partly with this in mind that I give it only 4 stars.

The other reason for "4" instead of "5" is the inappropriacy of the PG rating. Even as a pre-teen at the time I thought the scene with the nude statue on which a certain piece breaks off and the boys glue it on upside down was too much--I remember being pretty embarrassed sitting next to adult friends in the theater! For those moms and others who've just recently discovered Goonies and this odd rating, you might like to know that, at least if I recall correctly from back then, Goonies is the very movie which led to the creation of the PG-13 rating. It was clearly not an R movie, but was a bit too much for PG, and many unsuspecting moms were pretty upset when they took their 6-year-olds to this movie! So, for those undecided about the movie because of this issue, keep in mind that although the rating is officially PG, the content is absolutely PG-13, and would be rated as such if made today.
