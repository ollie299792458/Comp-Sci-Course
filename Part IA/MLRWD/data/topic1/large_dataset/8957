This is a short review/recommendation of the Criterion Collection Bluray disc of Ride With The Devil. I'm sure you've all heard all you want to know about the movie itself. For a quick recap this movie shows the strife within the state of Missouri during the Civil War between those who remained loyal to the Union and those who felt the Confederate States were right. It wasn't pretty but it did happen and this is a terrific account of how it effected a group of young men living there. This is a different version of the movie than you may have seen in the theater or on DVD. Quite a bit of the footage has been added back in to really fill out the story and this more complete version is very welcome.

The Bluray itself is really wonderful, just what you would expect from Criterion. The picture is wonderful and really shows off the beauty of the countryside. Clear, sharp and everything Bluray was supposed to bring us in video clarity. The audio is spectacular, too. Dialog is clear and the effects really come through. Someone really did some good research to add reality to the soundtrack. Black powder does not make the same type of explosion that smokeless powder does and director Ang Lee made certain the effects were accurate. A lazier director would have just added in gunfire but this is how it really sounds.

Want to find out something about a little known aspect of the Civil Way, away from the big battlefields in the east? Try this Bluray movie on for size. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Oh, a little "ps", my Amazon and Single Action Shooting Society alias is Cave Wyatt, the name of a character in this movie. I liked that the character was fighting for his ideals and not for the plundering that happened so often late in the war. Too bad the guy who played him died a few years after making this movie (he was the kid in the TV show Seaquest 2032, too), I thought he did a good job.
