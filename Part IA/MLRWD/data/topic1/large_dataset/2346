I am always craving a good horror/suspense movie so the premise of 1408 was interesting.  However the movie falls far short of maintaining coherency, even early on.  Cusack, while tremendously talented in other features, just is not strong enough to lead in a movie with supposed gravity, especially paralleled to Sam Jackson and a severe lack of supporting characters which his quirky acting style benefits.  The plot, while has potential, quickly becomes cliche and muddled. The pacing has us racing from once scene to the next without plausibility or explanation, this causes apathy towards Cusack's character as he undergoes his plight, since we have to do the movie's job and piece things together instead of focussing on the interactions between Cusack and the room/his psyche. All this mess only leads up to one of the most nonsensical climaxes and endings I have seen.  I cannot think of any positive things to say, the acting is weak, the plot is a mess, the pacing is awful, and I cannot recommend this to anyone.  I would avoid this if at all possible.
