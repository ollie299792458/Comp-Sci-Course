As a granddaughter born to the tribal chief, Pai seems to be resented by him due to the fact she was a girl.  Her twin brother and mother died during childbirth, leaving no male to carry on as chief.  Her grandfather begins to teach other boys the ways of their ancestors.  He completely ignores the fact that Pai possess many of the traits he is currently teaching the young boys.  When his final test to determine who will be the next chief fails, her grandfather begins to feel that he too has failed. Pai is able to complete that test, but her grandfather does not know.  She chants to the whales and they listen and come to the shore.  With so many whales beached, they find one that they believe is that of their ancestor.  The whole tribe fights to get him back in the water, with no luck.  It is Pai who climbs onto him and rides him back into the ocean.  It is then that her grandfather truly realizes her potential, but it might be too late.  Pai ends up in the hospital, but thankfully she ends up okay.

This directly relates to indigenous religions because they follow many ways that their ancestors set before them.  They have chants that they perform depending on what is needed.  Their tribe is mainly male dominated and they have a hard time accepting a woman who steps out of her role.  The follow traditions to a T, and Pai's grandfather gets very upset when things are disrupted.  He believes that each ritual much be performed just as their ancestors had previously done so, or it may have very harmful consequences.  Their tribe seems to greatly worship the whales of the ocean, and they all come together when the whales are in harm.
