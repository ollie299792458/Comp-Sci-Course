This is, without a doubt, an amazing acomplishment in post-war Japanese cinema, as well as my personal favorite Kurosawa film (though Yojimbo comes in close second). From start to finish; simple, understated, austere, and yet it works so well under the circumstances. Kurosawa seamlessly blends a unique multi-angle form of storytelling with a simple elemental setting, and his own minimalist direction to create a truly fascinating vision. The use of pounding rain, sweltering heat, a cool breeze, the shade of a tree, all serve so well to convey the atmosphere of each of the respective scenes. Still, equal praise must be lavished upon the actors themselves. Takashi Shimura brings a wonderful humility and honesty to his role as the woodcutter, and serves to tie the various accounts together. Toshiro Mifune, in one of his earlier performances, creates a striking mix of ferocity and malaise, evoking a predatory lion, toying with his prey. Truly, a masterpiece from start to finish, and one of the greatest films to even come out of the land of the rising sun. Watch it as soon as humanly possible. You shall not be disapointed.
