Frank Sinatra was eager to give newcomer Steve McQueen a break by having a pivotal role in NEVER SO FEW. I am watching all of Steve McQueen's films and didn't know very about NEVER SO FEW. It is great to see Sinatra and McQueen together. Sinatra is great as the troubled Capt. Tom Reynolds trying to deal with the excitement and horrors of war. Burma is an unusual setting for a WWII drama pairing American and British soldiers with local Burmese guerilla fighters. I am not sure how they all fit together and how Sinatra's Captain Reynolds was in charge.
It is an interesting war picture as our group is stationed deep in the wood attacking and being attacked by Japanese soldiers. Shouldn't they have had a more secure location?
McQueen is again co-starring with Charles Bronson and being directed by John Sturges. Sexy Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida makes her Hollywood debut in a very unbelievable romance with Captain Reynolds while being the "kept woman" of a much older man played by Paul Henreid.  The romance doesn't fit the story and detracts from the movie. Reynolds is on leave and runs into Lollobrigida. Hey, what could be better? No one seems to take into consideration that The US and Italy were at war during WWII. It makes an Italian-American love affair seem highly unlikely but anything is possible in love and war.
The film gave Steve McQueen some great exposure and no doubt was a great stepping stone in his career. Sinatra showed his acting talents. Plus Gina Lollobrigida always lights up the screen. NEW SO FEW is worth a watch.
