Having been a Superman fan from the Kirk Alyn days, through George Reeves and so on & so on....up until Smallville. I was amazed at the title of the 'George Reeves Story', why they didn't call it "The George Reeves Story" or "Up Up And Away" or similar is truely strange, as strange as the story behind dear old George.

Hollywoodland did not really make any new claims as a true fan already was aware of, however the movie is wonderfully acted and the sets are amazing in the true setting of the period.

For someone with a passing interest in Superman would find this movie extremely interesting, a great crime show in all ways. It shows George as a true flesh & blood human being. You can only feel for George and the ups & downs of his career from Gone with the Wind through to his death. If you have not viewed the "Bill Cody" short movie starring George before Superman, I recommend it highly. I understand it is available on one of the Boxed Sets of "The Adventures of Superman".

I found the movie very enjoyable, it did make me feel a touch melancholy.

If you enjoyed Superman or George Reeves or simply interested in the goings on in Hollywood, this is a must.
