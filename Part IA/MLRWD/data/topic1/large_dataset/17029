But, oh, there really are.  There is rarely a movie (or a novel) today that moves me to tears.  The Green Mile is one of them.  Stephen King strays from his usual genre of vampires, telekinesis, evil clowns, clairvoyance, and whatnot to a heartwrenching story about the human spirit, right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, and conscience.  Never have I experienced a screenplay that rivaled a novel's brilliance.  When he wrote the screenplay and then directed it, Frank Darabont did the world of Stephen King justice and then some.  This movie came together with an extraordinary cast - Tom Hanks taking on the role of one of the central characters, Paul Edgecomb, and Michael Clarke Duncan taking on the role of the other, John Coffey.  The supporting cast thereafter is marvelously deep &amp; talented with the likes of Bonnie Hunt, David Morse, Barry Pepper, Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, Doug Hutchinson, Patricia Clarkson, James Cromwell, Graham Green &amp; a small role by (one of my many personal favorites) Gary Sinise, each giving an Oscar-worthy performance.
Truly, the shining gem in this DVD package is the movie itself.  If you haven't seen it, please do, and you will probably agree with me.  If you have seen it, you most likely know what I'm talking about.  But as an added bonus, there is a behind-the-scenes documentary called 'Walking the Mile' included.  In this time you will be taken inside the world of The Green Mile with snippets of conversation from most of the cast as well as from Frank Darapont and Stephen King.  Mr. Jingles even makes an appearance!  The only complaint I had about the extra footage was that it didn't last long enough!  So, the long and short of it is that The Green Mile is time and money worth spent.  If I could, I would give it ten stars... aw heck, I will anyway...
