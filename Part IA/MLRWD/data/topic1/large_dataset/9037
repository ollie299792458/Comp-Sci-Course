In 1979, an Australian film was released starring 23-year-old Mel Gibson. This movie he is a cop in the future. Only a few years ahead from the present point in time. It was a great hit and had two sequels follow it. Only difference about them was that they were during a post-apocalyptic period. But this one is the best one of all in the entire trilogy. It is a pretty normal movie with regular things happening most of the time. The action doesn't start until the end when Max Rockatanski seeks revenge on a nomad biker gang for the murder of his wife and infant son. Max starts out as a kind loving man. But once everything in his life falls apart and he loses the people who are most important to him, he no longer sees the need to care for the lives of others. The evil bikers led by the Toecutter all suffer painful and terrible deaths for what they had done to Max's family. He starts out as a regular man with a job who has a family and a best friend. But sometime in the movie, Jim Goose, his best friend, is murdered as well. Then Max decides to quit his job due to that one event. He just happens to lose everything he had. All you see of him in the end is Max driving a Canyonero and armed with a shotgun while wearing his police uniform. A courageous hero doing what he can to rid the scum of the area. This is the best movie to watch out of all three.
