When the movie originally came out I was not allowed to see it because I was a child and my mother had been warned that it might upset me, since it was darker than typical Disney movies. So my first time getting to sit down and watch it, I'd just turned 25. I loved it almost immediately, and quite frankly, cried more than once.

Keep in mind, this is an adaptation of a novel, not a perfect animated copy. It is almost completely different than the novel, seeing how the book was written by Victor Hugo who likes to end books by having killed off all of his characters. There is no happy ending in the book, it's a miserable, unhappy, completely avoidable tragedy. Disney animator's took the novel and said "Let's tweak a few things since they didn't have perscriptions for anti-depressants back in Victor's day". Victor Hugo was a fatalist. Disney is not.

The movie was excellent. The animation from beginning to end, the story is amazing, it goes from bright and hopeful to 'Oh my God, how did things go so horribly wrong so quickly', the characters are all vastly different and likeable and loathesome in different ways. Like i said, I loved it, but as if you are a parent, perhaps it would be best to watch the movie first yourself before letting young children watch it, just to decide for yourselves if it is something they are ready for.
