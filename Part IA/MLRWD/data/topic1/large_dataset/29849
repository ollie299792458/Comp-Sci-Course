I love this Bond film, because the plot is so much  different from the usual.  No mad super criminal is trying to take over the world, or blow it up with nuclear warheads, so it's a big variation from the usual.  Hey,  different is good.
Robert Davi gives a great performance as Franz  Sanchez, one of the most evil, ruthless Bond villians of all time.  His  henchman, Dario, played by Benicio Del Toro, isn't any less evil, and  matches up well with Jaws and Oddjob of earlier Bond films, maybe Dario's  even a little better, because his character is more realistic.
Carey  Lowell is a great Bond girl, because she's a looker as well as a fighter,  and shows up Bond big time in the fight at the Barrelhead Bar.  Gone are  the seductive locales, as this Bond movie takes place mainly in South  America.
I don't particularily care for Milton Krest.  Though being a  villian, I've seen Bob Barker get meaner than him, and besides, he takes  away from the evil generated by Dario and Sanchez.  
All in all, this is  a great Bond film, rent it or buy it today.
