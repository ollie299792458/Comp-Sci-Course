This is one of the lamest excuses for a blues show I've ever seen.

Many of the performances had little or nothing to do with the blues, and even those that did were leaden, stiff, overproduced and over orchestrated, not to mention that there just had to be three or four completely irrelevant guitarists on almost each tune (Odetta was righteously angry, and rightly so, about the band overpowering Ruth Brown during rehearsal).

Natalie Cole? Chuck D? Meanwhile, Dr. John, one of the two inheritors of the entire New Orleans piano tradition (Alan Toussaint was nowhere to be found), is reduced to playing barely audible side man on a few numbers and giving sound byte interviews? Puh-leeze.

Not that there weren't a few highlights, hence two stars instead of one. BB and Gate were their usual reliable selves. David Johansen's tongue in cheek Howlin' Wolf vocal impersonation was fun. It was nice to see Fast and Funky Larry Johnson get his five minutes before slipping back into undeserved obscurity. Honeyboy Edwards is long past his prime but was still good.

The sole shining, spontaneous, "hairs rise on the back of your neck" performance was, unsurprisingly, by Ms. Slide Slinger herself, who obviously insisted that the band shut the hell up while she was onstage. She has some serious stuff and she does not fool around. She always goes for the throat from the first note. But two minutes of Bonnie Raitt doesn't make it worth to slog through two hours of this "Blues for Yuppies" DVD.
