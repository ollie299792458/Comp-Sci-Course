This show gets better by the season. Even though the sixth season isnt done airing on the CW yet, it already been my favorite season yet. It all begins witht the season premire episode of ( Zod ) where we pick up after seasons five episode where lex is possessed by General Zod to take over the planet while clark is left helpless for a short while in the Phantom

Zone imprisoned with other criminals who are holding a grudge on Jor-El and takin it out on him. We also see a young Oliver Queen aka ( GREEN ARROW) make several appearances. We also see more of the future justice league members from previous seasons aswell as the Martian Manhunter in human form. Best episode i liked of-course was ( Justice ) featuring five of our heroes. also we see the up-dated S emblem from Superman Returns on the seasons first episode which is also one of the best. another episode to watch is ( Combat ) where clark takes on titan who resembles Doomsday from the comics in the ring. and one more thing is the introduction of Jimmy Olson who will be dating chloe and this season, well someone finally places pieces of clark together.  this show is so great, cant wait for season seven. dont miss out on this great season yet.
