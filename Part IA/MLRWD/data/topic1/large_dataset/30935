I have heard of THEY LIVE for a very long time but I never did really want to see it.  I thought that it was just a stupid old horror movie that wasn't any good.  But lately I have heard some things about it and it sounds great.  Ever since I heard the plot I was hooked.  A guy finds some sunglasses and when he puts them on he can see aliens walking around and orders in billboards that no one else can see, it's crazy, but it's really cool.  When I heard about this I went looking for informaion on it and I found out that people really like this movie.  It's considered a cult classic by some people.  I also found out that it's out of print and hard to find...  That sort of got me going.  It kind of gives me a little adventure to find it at a price I can affored.  Anyways I found out a lot of other good stuff about it and I decided I wanted it.  I looked for it for a while and finally found it for VHS...  So I bought it.  ...But with all the good stuff I've heard about it, it has to be good.  So if you can find it at one of your local video stores or if you can find one that is cheap enough to buy than get it and watch it.  I've heard it's a good movie to watch with your friends...
