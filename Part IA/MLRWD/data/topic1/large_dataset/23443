John Wayne, to me, is the consummate actor for the roles he played in his long career in movies. I have been a fan of his and his work since I was a little dude. As an adult I continue to collect his work and enjoy them over and over. I spent 30 years in the Army which started in 1968 and his character and the plot of the movie is very believable and true to the real life war in Vietnam. The rhetoric, clothing, operations and missions and all else about the movie are within acceptable tolerances for this story. The booby traps, the visciousness of the Viet Cong against their own people and the missions are true to life. This movie will be represents actual places, people and events in our military history that should help Americans honor the fewer and fewer Vietnam veterans in our great nation who fought a war that wasn't fought to be won (in my own opinion). A lot of them weren't honored when they came home, they were branded as "baby killers" and the like which caused untold mental agony and distress. God bless 'em (us).
As a side note, his westerns are entertaining and action filled. One of the reasons I enjoy them so much is the screen writer he used for so many years, especially his westerns, James Edward Grant. He is the one who put the Duke's famous phrases onto the screen; phrases like, "a man's got to do what a man's got to do", and "Comfortable?!?! I've been called a lot of things in my life, but comfortable was not one of them." The legend lives on in his movies, as does each of the actors that worked with him for all those decades. He is my favorite western star. The vendor was very particular in the packaging and prompt in getting the DVD out to me. My thanks and kudoes to you and your staff for their attention to detail and professionalism. I'll be back for more.
