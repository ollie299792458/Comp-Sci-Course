As another reviewer stated, I cannot stay dry eyed when viewing this movie.  Melinda's story may be harder for some people to take than others, particularly if they have been victimized themselves and feel that maybe they are somehow to blame when the immediate aftermath around them is negative.

There is no sugar coating here:  One day Melinda (Played with incredible depth and sensitivity by Kristen Stewart.) is a fun-loving teen, and the next she can never look at anything the same way again.  I was angry throughout the film because her suppposed friends should have guessed it took more than calling the cops at a party to turn her into a social outcast.  In fact, her behavior could have told a very perceptive stranger what was wrong, but nobody noticed except one male student and Steve Zahn's art teacher character Mr. Freeman.  Everyone else was cruel and/or indifferent, and that's before they found out what happened to her.

This is the story of one year in the life of a bright young girl after a very troubling incident but, unlike other victims, she didn't keep silent about it for years until her entire life was a complete mess.  It is incredibly moving and well-done.  If you are having some of the same problems, please don't wait until you have a mountain of trouble ahead of you.
