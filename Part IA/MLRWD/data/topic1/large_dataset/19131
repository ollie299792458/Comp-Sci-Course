It is a cold, bitter world that sets the stage for "Dolores Claiborne"--a deep-seated cold that is reflected in the bleak winter landscape. Nowhere is the Hollywood lighting, the softening perfection of characters too beautiful to be real. Nor is there the epic drama of a tragedy that is larger than life. The story is small, concerning one family, and the characters are ordinary people. Yet the depth and intensity of this film is unmatched, perhaps even heightened by its narrow focus.
 
Cold is the feeling one gets from the film...The chill between mother and daughter, the truths frozen behind a protective shield. The film is structured in such a way that only pieces of the truth are revealed, a bit at a time, and each piece more ugly than the last. Therein is the genius of the story's structure: it is almost unbearably ugly until the last piece has fallen into place, and then it becomes apparent that the ugly truth is dazzling; it is harsh, cruel, yet at the same time incredibly beautiful. During the entire film this beauty is never articulated until one point near the end; ironically that moment is its one weak link.  
 The acting can hardly be called acting; the artists live their roles to such a degree that they deserve the name. Jennifer Jason Leigh is haunted and haunting as Dolores's daughter,her brittle exterior a mask for deep suffering, her pain consuming her from within. Kathy Bates is so much the character she plays that it is impossible to think of her as an actress. For the genius she brings to this role, she deserves ten oscars.  
 This is recommended to anyone who looks for something deeper than standard Hollywood fare: the story centers on the complexity of human relationships, the underlying beauty of even the deepest darkness. Truly a masterpiece.
