King Corn is fascinating, funny, and filled with solid research.

A grass fed calf takes 5 years to reach slaughter weight.

A calf fed GMO corn takes 15 months to reach slaughter weight.  However, if they don't slaughter the calf at 15 months, it will keel over dead at 18 months because bovines are designed to eat grass.

One can of soda a day, with high fructose corn syrup, doubles your risk for diabetes.  Because people are getting hip to the dangers of HFCS, high fructose corn syrup, HFCS is being rebranded as "Corn Sugar."  Really, though, HFCS by any name is toxic.

Don't get me started on diet soda aka Aspartame, soon to be rebranded as "Amino Sweet."  Google Aspartame + "Donald Rumsfeld,"  Or, "the history of aspartame."  It's a dirty business.  Aspartame is implicated in Alzheimer's Disease, diabetes, leukemia, and a whole lot more.

Back to King Corn.  This is one of the most important movies I have ever seen.  I would like everyone to see it.

Amazing info in this very funny movie.  Hard to combine funny with facts, but they succeed.  I am buying a copy to show friends.  I first saw it in a college class.  It also played at the Maui Film Festival.  Bravo!
