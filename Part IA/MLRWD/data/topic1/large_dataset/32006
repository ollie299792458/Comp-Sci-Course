This film premiered late in 1984 with a lot of hype about Eurythmics soundtrack. The story goes that when Eurythmics attended the London preview which featured the now DVD version of the soundtrack, they thought it was a joke. Sadly, this was in fact the director's vision of what might otherwise have been a really powerful realization of Orwell's famous novel. After a legal suit, Eurythmics won out and director Michael Radford was forced to honor his own advance publicity and include Eurythmics soundtrack for the public release of the film. Because he had never intended to use the soundtrack at all, the original cut of the film (available on VHS) is hauntingly silent, devoid of music except for the very odd and occassional moment where Eurhtymics soundtrack makes an appearence. This is the film I remembered, a retro-futuristic examination of Orwell's work. Eurythmics' music was powerful and unsettling and really stands on its own as a studio recording (for those who are fans of 80s techno-pop)- keeping in mind that the lp release of the sound track was sooped up for the dance-floor. All in all, Radford's original/DVD vision of this story was hoakey and uninspired. Had he stuck with the material Eurythmics brought to the film, he might have had a real daring film on his hands. As it stands, well...it's hoakey, and uninspired.
