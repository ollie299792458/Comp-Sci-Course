The story of Jackson Pollock is not a happy one, unless you happen to have bought a few of his pictures cheap, in the 1950's. Then the story of Jackson Pollock would be a lifetime of christmases every single day.
In life, Pollock lumbered from one god awful mess to the other. In between messes, he created some more. He drank too much, felt too much, and made everyone near him as unhappy as he was. Then, he died. This is not a happy film and it is not an easy one to watch. It is depressing, and rather like watching the aftermath of a road accident. If you are depressed when you start watching it, you will get worse. If you are happy, and pay attention, you will most probably stop being happy at some point while watching it. You have been warned.
That said, POLLOCK is a brilliant film. Ed Harris directs with true talent, and puts in easily the best perfomance of his career. When one is speaking of Ed Harris, that is high praise indeed. Harris acts the part of Jackson Pollock with so much intensity that I was sometimes half convinced that he could jump through the screen and start physically attacking me. This is an odd experience. Imagine Frank Booth in David Lynch's BLUE VELVET. Jack the voulme control up from 11 to somewhere in the low 90's. Add brilliant dialogue. Now imagine that the character is someone you want desperately to LIKE. Now imagine that the character is in just about every single scene.
POLLOCK is not an easy film to watch. It is however, an extremely rewarding one. Ed Harris should have won both best actor and best director for this. He should also have won some sort of medal for having made it in the first place.
Top marks. This one is heavy duty.
