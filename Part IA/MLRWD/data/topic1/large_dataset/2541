As a huge fan of this manga/anime, buying this DVD wasn't a hard choice for me to make. I have followed the anime for a long time through the means of fansubs, but I have always wished for a legal DVD of the same high quality offered by the best fansub-groups; Funimation was the answer to my prayers.
The video quality is great, the sound is perfect and I'm watching my favorite anime on the big screen... how can I go wrong? After 4Kidz, I was sceptical of the english dub, but was pleasantly surprised after watching an episode in english. The characters' voices are well made and the script is great as should be expected, and lets not forget the incredibly well made intro-song!! If you're like me and prefers the original voices, they're all in there. The subtitles are dull and boring compared to the hardsubs offered from fansub-groups, but they work well enough and that's all I can wish for.

An overall great purchase. If you're a fan of the show (or just want to check it out), buy it!

The only cons I can come up with has to be where they left off, but that's to be expected from a show based on a popular Shonen Jump manga.
