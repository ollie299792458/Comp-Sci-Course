It is always the original which is best in the series. The 1989 blockbuster Batman delivers this. It is hard to talk great about the Batman series thanks to Joel Schummacher who took over and made the last two batman films: Forever and Batman and Robin both were terrible in thier own rights. But Tim Burton who directed this film and Returns got it right. The dark mood is there, and the way Gotahm is portrayed adds to the uniqueness to the film. Michael Keaton still is the best on screen Batman, as he says few words to add to the mystery. Kim Basinger at her hottest as reporter Vicki Vale, and off course Jack Nicholson as the Joker, how many great lines does this man deliver in this film!!! From: "wait til they get a load of me" to " this town needs an enema" every line is pure classic Nicholson. Let us also not forget a great supporting cast including Robert Wuhl, Jerry Hall, Jack Palance, Billy Dee Williams, and Michael Gough as Alfred. To this day it is still the greatest Batman ever made. One of the crimes of this century is that Tim burton didn't direct the third and fourth Batman, which is why they both were lame. But the first still the best.. but i could be wrong when i see another great actor named Christian Bale don the bat suit in Batman Begins, unitl then the first is the best. two thumbs way up!
