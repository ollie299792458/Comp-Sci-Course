I saw this movie many moons ago at the Fox Senator Theatre in CA & I thought it was incredibly funny & way before it's time. Beautifully photographed, & endearingly portrayed by all the principle performers, this movies is & always will have a special place in my heart & DVD library. I have never shared this before with anybody until now, but here goes, I saw this movie (alone)at the Fox on the afternoon of August 8, 1969, & the following day I witnessed the news reports & read about what had occurred the previous night before in Los Angeles. I was shelled shocked to say the least. Beautiful actress Sharon Tate, the female lead in this movie & the pregnant wife of director Roman Polanski & four other house guest were horribly murdered at their home in Bel-Air by the Manson morons. I have since then always had this strange connection to this movie ever since. It's not very often that you can successfully combine the genre's of horror & comedy, but when you do & it works, well then what you have is very funny little gem of an overlooked vampire movie. Never did Sharon Tate look so beautiful, then in this film.
