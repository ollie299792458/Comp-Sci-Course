I downloaded this to watch Stana in another genre (film) since I've enjoyed her acting talent on the tv show "Castle". I was disappointed in the film since I'm used to seeing a wider range of emotion and versatility in Stana on television and perhaps that's because it's a weekly show and viewers get to learn more about her character throughout the season. I must also say this movie was too slow for me, didn't have enough depth to the two main characters, and the writing seemed very weak for their conversations. I think the lack of strong writing also made me not care very much about the two roles since I didn't truly understand their draw to one another besides just the physical. The movie was shot in the classic black & white, and I thought that would lessen the movie in some way for me but actually the lack of color wasn't a detriment. I also thought the film should have had ALL the dialogue subtitled on the screen, not just the parts spoken in French and then translated into English.
