Like many films Robert Redford has been associated with ('Ordinary People' 'The Horse Whisperer), the characters are hurt and are in need of healing.  Mostly they need to stop grieving, forgive someone, and just accept the contingencies of life.  Instead of being the director, Redford plays Einar Gilkyson, an aging ranch man with horses living in North Central Montana, close to Glacier Park.  He shares his ranch house with his friend, Mitch Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who has been debilitated by a grizzly bear attack.  Einar also tends to his horses, but his tight-lipped personality is interrupted by some of his cantankerous tirades.  He is bitter over the loss of his son who died in an automobile accident with his daughter-in-law, Jean Gilkyson (Jennifer Lopez) at the wheel.  His daily visits to his son's plot don't seem to ease the grief or bitterness, and in only becomes exacerbated when she turns up at his doorstep after leaving her abusive boyfriend to stay with him.  Giving him no notice and turning up with an unknown granddaughter doesn't exactly work as an ice breaker.

The development shows how everyone must cope.  She must get over her survival guilt that festers in her father-in-law's eyes while recovering from the wounds of domestic violence.  Mitch tries to face his fears and anguish with the bear, and the girl must come to terms with a juggled family.  Sensitive and soul-bearing, 'An Unfinished Life' is a drama that matters about life and how to accept it with accepting terms no matter what it may hand out.
