Watch until the ending credits complete and you'll see Barnabas' body fade away and a bat fly away. Apparetnly Barnabas survived impalement and drowning in a mouthful of fake blood.
Note to self: only way to properly dispose of vampire is:
1. Decapitation,
2. Burn head and body seperately,
3. dump into holy water font at local Catholic church.
4. Rinse/Repeat

As a vampire movie, HDS was acceptable; except for the occasional lapses such Roger-as-vampire mirror reflection, and the fact that the cross on the headboard of the recovering Maggie's bed seemed ineffective against the aged Barnabas.

But as a Dark Shadows fan when I first saw this movie, I left feeling more depressed than when I went in.

Yikes!! Dead OR alive Barnabas is truly a monster in this setting. Viewing the DS re-runs on Sci-Fi Channel reinforce the view that yes, despite the so-called "sympathetic" edge to Barnabas, he certainly deserved a real painful stake through the heart! And that's before he single-handedly murdered almost the entire cast.

Meanwhile, poor Willy Loomis got batted around by everybody!  Good thing John Karlen is such an excellent actor 'cause he really took a lot of abuse on DS and in HDS.

Forget this mashup and get Dan Caurtis' real vampire masterpiece: "The Night Stalker!" The first and best of the modern vampire movies that forgoes the obvious questions when dealing with a caped creature that hasn't seen the world since the 1790s such as:
1. How did Barnabas know what a doorbell was?
2. How, straight out of his coffin, did he know how to open a car door?
3. Did he pick up the check when he dined with Willie at the Blue Whale?
