While I think Vol. 1 had more consistantly good films, Vol. 2 is no pushover. 
*While Goldfinger will probably always be my favorite, From Russia with Love is still a great Bond film (with one of the best villians IMHO). While better than Dr. No, this one can be quite boring at times.
*You Only Live Twice is one of Connery's weaker Bond films (see also Diamonds are Forever) and you couldn't believe how disappointed I was when Blofeld was revealed (the whole theater went crazy). I never believed for a second that James Bond looked Asian at all.
*Diamonds are Forever was a big letdown after OHMSS, and Connery, who was looking too old for Bond at this point, should have stayed out and Lazenby should have stayed. Charles Gray was also a dud after Telly Sevalas perfected Blofeld in OHMSS.
*Moonraker was basically a Star Wars knockoff. With all of the hype that came out of SW, Cubby Broccoli tried something new in having Bond go into space. This was actually a decent film up until the last 20 minutes or so. BTW, I can't stand Hugo Drax.
*This is where I disagree with the previous reviewer. For Your Eyes Only is one of the best entries in the series, as Bond returns to earth after Moonraker. This is Roger Moore at his best (never lived up to Connery), and while the action is toned down a bit, it has the best Bond girl in Melina. A horrible villian and an annoying kid kept this from being higher on my list. The best Bond song was "For Your Eyes Only" by Sheena Easton.
*Growing up with Bond, I was initially disappointed when I went to see The Living Daylights. The villians are officially the worst in the series, though having a Bond girl (Kara) that needs to be protected is a nice change for Bond. I have recently grown to appreciate Dalton more, but Licence to Kill (yes that's how it is spelled) is still the better movie.
*Pierce Brosnan has been a savior to the Bond series. While Connery will always be my Bond, Brosnan is a close second. The World is Not Enough is a good Bond movie, though not as good as Goldeneye. While the villian (Renard) and the Bond girl (Dr. Christmas Jones), are not up to par, Elektra King really makes this movie. Brosnan returns the ruthlessness that was present in the Connery era (look at Elektra for evidence) and it makes him truly one of the greats.
***Buy this set, and get the third only if you are a true Bond fan (OHMSS and Thunderball are worth it).
