This movie was delightful and brought a moment in time forward so it wouldnot have been forgotten . I did live in Britain in the early 50's in a  village was full of 300+yr old homes Life had not changed much for a long long time.  The children ALL believed quietly in faeires in the yard at night &  house brownies  Many of the older adults in their 60's made comments to me about  them.  As a child of 4-6, I accepted the fact that many  magical things happened that I did not understand  The wonderous  fairy pictures in the movie  made me remember breathtakingly beautiful books illustrated wtih fairies  and glistening spider webs with dewdrops for jewels  This movie brought back the awe of that whole era and the

wonderment of ....are they real???...  For those who did not live in that moment in time , it is a lovely experience and a delightful movie  For those lucky few who grew up in a place which quietly believed --it was a glimmer back to the past  Great movie and well done
