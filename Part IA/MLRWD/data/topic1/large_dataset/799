Although the movie may be regarded as a mediocre movie by some, let's face the facts here: Tokyo Drift ain't no Schindler's List. It's an all round fun ride and the Drift sport was well translated into this movie. For sports car fanatics, this may well be in one of your collection as the cars are highlighted in a way that they have their own characters and could very well be the actors of this movie. Not to say that the actors are shabby, though. Although there are no Oscar nominated performances here, the cast have chemistry and are entertaining enough to keep you glued to the story, albeit predictable.

As for the disc itself, Tokyo Drift on HD DVD paves the way for future titles to include the U-Control feature as one of a powerful, interactive tool to play with. Tokyo Drift has the Picture in Picture feature, where a 'behind the scenes' featurette plays throughout the movie; Set Pictures; Tech Specs where car characteristics or damage specs pop up during certain scenes; and Storyboards - all at your control. You can bring it up or switch it off whenever you want (only for the PiP. Other features have the option to pop up during certain scenes), without returning to the main menu. Besides the U-Control feature, you also have other staples such as deleted scenes, commentary, etc. There's even a garage mode where you customize (with a limited set of colors and designs) Han's car and actually see it in the "Doughnut" scene from the movie. Pretty useless, but cool nonetheless.

Overall, Tokyo Drift is a fun, fast paced adventure with a predictable storyline (as well as a sweet cameo) and seeing it on HD DVD is a totally new experience. Have a new HD DVD Player and Plasma/LCD? This is what you should play to demo your rig!
