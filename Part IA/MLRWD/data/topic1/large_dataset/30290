IMPOSTOR is a good movie, a solid and effective adaptation of Philip Dick's short story.  The screenplay is gripping and tightly written.  It's a wild ride, troubling, involving.  The story is simple in a way, but not simplistic.

All of the key characters' performances are good, and some are extraordinary.  Gary Sinise is spot-on as the protaganist, Spencer Olham, accused of being an inhuman duplicate of himself.  Madeleine Stowe gives a genuinely moving performance in the role of Maya, Olham's wife.

I saw the original on HBO years ago, and liked it enough that I recently bought the DVD with the director's cut.  I'm not sure what the differences are, but the director's cut does feel leaner and tighter.

The effects are uneven, which I expect is due to the movie's origin:  it was originally conceived as a short, then the producers switched gears in midstream and retooled it into a full length feature.  Some of the visuals are borderline, by today's standards, reminiscent of some bad moments on the Sci Fi channel.  Others are excellent, so don't let that stop you from seeing the movie.

Looking past the uneven SFX, the movie is well worth seeing.  One caution: if you haven't seen IMPOSTOR, be wary of the reviews that contain spoilers. Much of the story's impact has to do with specifics of the plot it's best not to know about when watching it the first time.
