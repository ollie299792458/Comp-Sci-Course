First off, from an apolitical standpoint, the production values of this film are horrible...quality varies from clip to clip (some of which, I might add, are in B&W), and while I might expect this from a student filmmaker (having been one myself), it's downright insulting to try and pass this off as a commercial video release.

That said, now to the matter of the film itself: If director Peterson wanted to market this solely to, say, the type of people who avoid mainstream media at all costs and rely strictly on alternate (i.e., *conservative*) news sources for information and current events, it would be easier to aceept the finished product. However, attempting to market this as a bipartisan response to Fahrenheit 9/11 only serves to damage this film's credibility even further, as one glance at the cast listing will tell you:

- Ron Silver (the narrator), a liberal-turned-conservative actor
- Dick Morris...while the pacakging touts him as a consultant to both Trent Lott and Bill Clinton, no mention is made of how he's since become an outspoken critic of the latter's wife, even joining the on-air staff of Fox News ('nuff said!)
- Ann "I hate liberals" Coulter...do you expect Democrats and the political left to get a fair shake from any work that includes her as a participant?
- Sen. Zell Miller, a glorified DINO (Democrat In Name Only)...even the packaging mentions his voting for Bush in 04 and being a keynote speaker at the same year's RNC
- Former NYC mayor Ed Koch, a conservative Dem...but regardless of his views, Peterson should've though twice about using him regardless, given the apparent senility he projects in his on-screen time

And what did the disabled solider from Farenheit expect when he gave that interview, regardless of its context? Moore was still free to use it as he pleased.

Anyway, if you're looking for a politically one-sided response to Moore, don't let me stop you. However, if you want something that offers a better representation of the political spectrum as a whole, you're better off plunking your $$$ down elsewhere.
