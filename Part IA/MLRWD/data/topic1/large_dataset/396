Many other reviewers have already written detailed and insightful comments on the quality of the show itself, so I won't duplicate that.  I do want to comment on the discussion regarding the quality of the disks.

Yes, it's true that some episodes have that classic faded-out, washed out look you sometimes see in film from the 1960s-70s, and I agree that I would have preferred a more compact package instead of the over-sized box and silly extras (e.g., coasters).

That said, the less-than-perfect quality hasn't diminished my enjoyment one bit!  Perhaps it depends on what kind of TV viewer you are. If you're the type who hangs back and critiques the cinematography, the washed out color may very well annoy you. If, on the other hand, you're the type who allows yourself to get caught up in the flow of the story, the quality is perfectly fine.

The first two seasons (or one-and-a-half, really, since it started as a mid-season replacement show) comprise some of the best TV viewing of all time, IMHO.  In the third season some of the energy was sucked out (mostly due to the loss of Noah Bain but also because they traded the mod urban vibe for a laconic Mediterranean paradise feel in many episodes), but even then it was very good. Not as great as seasons 1 and 2 but still very, very good.

In short, if you loved this show back in the day and you're the type of viewer to pay more attention to the narrative than the technicalities, don't let the negative reviews here scare you off. There is more than enough great fun to be found in this boxed set!
