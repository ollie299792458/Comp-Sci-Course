I saw a portion of this movie on IFC, and I got on Amazon and ordered it right away.  This piece is well acted and well written, and with all the trite, Hollywood movies selling these days, that's saying a lot.

I also read the reviews and knew I had to write my own, even though I haven't watched the entire film.  To be a parent, a good parent, is to want what's best for your child.  Sometimes we want this so much, we go a little overboard.  Harry does this at times.  He understands that his son is going to have a tough time finding love in a homophobic world, but he desparately wants that for Jeff.  The asides to the camera are some of the best, and often comic, aspects of the movie.

Don't let some of the other reviews throw you off this movie.  Yes, the dad goes over the top, but the important thing about this characteristic is that it's real. Movies should reflect our real emotions and motivations.  No parent is perfect.  But this movie, with it's poignant writing and real portrayals, is pretty close.
