I get so tired of cliche spoof movies, they are basically all the same EXCEPT Kung Pow.  First of all, it is so stupid silly that you have to laugh, no matter how crappy of a day you've had!  Secondly, from an industry enthusiasts view, the editing on this movie is crazy awesome!  They used an old martial arts, full feature movie and put Steve Oedekerk and the rest of the ensemble into the movie.  This is an editing feat, even with the new and intuitive software, starting with the film and lighting crews.  It was almost a flawless marriage of the old and new....Oh, sorry, I love that stuff!  The movie itself is great, not serious and just campy enough.  It is a family friendly movie and everyone over the age of 6 should enjoy it, or at least parts of it.  It is not completely predictable, and it starts out funny and just keeps on going.  I have enjoyed this movie many, many times after several kinds of days.  I hope you enjoy this film, and the prices are an extra bonus!  Have a great day!
