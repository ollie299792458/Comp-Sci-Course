I had never heard of this movie and was browsing NetFlix at a friend's house to pick out a movie for us.  We didn't see anything that really jumped out, but this looked interesting  So very, very glad we picked it.  I'm not going to go into any details about the movie but its was solid and well done from beginning to end.  I'm kinda picky about movies sometimes.  If they get too unrealistic, go off the rails or are easily predictable then I'm not going to like them very much and certainly won't bother seeing them again.  That said, I intend to watch Pandorum many more times over the coming years which is why I bought myself a copy!  The SciFi aspects were very well done and realistic without over-doing anything.  The horror was also very well done and kept you on the edge of your seat without getting campy, over-the-top gory, etc.  It was an incredibly good balance with excellent writing, acting and directing.  Really wish I had seen this in the theater!  I'd honestly drop $25 tomorrow to see it in IMAX if that were possible.
