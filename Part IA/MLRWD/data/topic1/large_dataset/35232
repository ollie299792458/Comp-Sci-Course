I kept putting off renting this DVD, but my curiosity was finally piqued by the constant comparisons to 6th Sense.  I felt 6th was the better film by far, but still thoroughly enjoyed this film.  A couple things bothered  me though:  I didn't like the lack of communication between the husband and  wife.  She converses with Neil, the black cop, in the cemetery (where was  Scatman Cruthers?), investigates on her own, saying her husband would  "never understand" - yet that was precisely what he had been  trying to do, so her failure to pass Neil's card on rang false.  The  tearing up of the backyard bugged me the same way it did in Close  Encounters when he piles the dirt in the house to recreate Devil's Tower. .  . I mean, the murder was ONLY 6 months prior . . wouldn't freshly dug dirt  be a bit obvious?  (the same with the basement floor).  In addition, like  one other reviewer stated, I've never seen areas of Chicago that consisted  of young families and people who acted like they lived on a commune . .  .Looked like fun though. . . I also agree with a prior reviewer that the  DVD was lacking in features, especially foreign language selections or  subtitles. . . there's really no reason for that anymore.
