Well kiss my grits! I just fell victim to public opinion. That's something I swore I would never do. Some people don't like to admit if they're wrong. I'm not that kind of person. Sometimes it takes a second, or in this case a  third, viewing to jog the old memory and see the true value of a movie.  That's what happened to me. Upon closer inspection, this movie isn't all  that bad. Okay, it is true that the characters could be developed a bit  more, but does anybody really concentrate on development while watching a  Disney movie? For an 80s movie, the animation style looks very 70s. The  movie also drifts into some bad moments, including the odd fantasy cliche.  If you can look beyond those elements, you'll find a movie that's quite all  right. The characters also aren't all that bad. This movie plays like The  Sword in the Stone, but without the humor. This isn't for the really young  kids, however. I wasn't kidding when I said this movie was scary. This  movie certainly is better than some of the stuff brought out in the 90s,  which seem to rely too heavily on big musical numbers and jokes.
