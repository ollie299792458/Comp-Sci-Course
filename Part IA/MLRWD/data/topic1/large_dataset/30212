Prior to buying this DVD, I had been working out with Rania's Weight Loss for Beginners:Hip Hop, Hip Drop. Her DVD is a workout that includes belly dance moves that are more basic.
 When I first tried Lucsious: Bellydancing for beginners, it was hard for me to follow some of the moves. The instructor went over each move but seemed to rush the teaching of each move a little bit. Then after each move learned there is a practice session a " mini-workout".
 I would recommend both Rania's DVD and Luscious with the caveat that you need to build up your stamina first with an easier DVD like Rania's.
 Luscious is for people that already might have some knowledge of basic moves and would like to move on to more challenging moves.
 Luscious is produced by World Dance Studios in New York and the dancers are professionals in full costume. It is a dance instructional workout.
 Whichever one you choose, realize that it takes time to build up the strength and physical skills to bellydance. Persevere, and you will learn how to bellydance.
