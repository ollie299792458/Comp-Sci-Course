I've watched this series through before (on these DVDs) in Japanese with subtitles.  I haven't watched the English dub but I'm familiar with the dub talent and I'm sure they're fine.  The Japanese voice talent comprises some famous Japanese voice actors and actresses, many of which I'm fond of.
Basically, this series is kind of old, early 90's in Japan, but it's a very solid and enjoyable series.  It's about a long-hidden race called the Aragami and their attempt to retake Japan, and a group of people called the TAC who try to prevent this.  At the center of these efforts is a young girl named Momiji who has part of an Aragami fused with her during the first episode.  At the center of the Aragami's efforts are Momiji's sister Kaede and their Lord, Susan-oh.  It also raises questions at points on whether Japan is worth saving, whether humanity is more deserving than the Aragami or not.  I thought times like that in the series were poignant.
I would advise though that the series is about a PG-13 rating in content (the first episode being a bit more risque than the rest of the series in general, though).  The Omake Theater bonus humor bits, however, should be shown to children with caution, as some of them are R-rated in content whereas the series is, as I said, PG-13ish.
I enjoyed the story of this series and the ride I went through watching through it (I didn't own it at the time), and I've been awaiting this boxed set to buy the whole series at a discount.  As of this writing, I'll be buying this collection sometime next week.  I enjoyed it, and you might as well, if any of the content description above made you curious to learn more.  Remember the content ratings I gave though, if you are considering purchasing this for children (or are a child yourself).
I hope I was able to provide some useful information to you.
