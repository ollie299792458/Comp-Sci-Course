James Stewart and director Anthony Mann made so many,excellent pictures I would not hesitate to nominate them "the best actor-director team Hollywood ever had".Over the top the opinion? Well,anyone can dispute it, and I'd love to hear the nominees from the unsatisfied ones.As for Mann,I don't share the opinion of many of his admirers that he is the most underrated director of all time. I'm a movie critic in Brasil, and one of my pastimes, God help me,is reading critics from all over the world. And I don't remember a single one of them at the time, rating his westerns anything less than "four stars". Naturally he had some "lemons, and bitter ones"(You name them yourself). But he was good or wonderful in any genre. The ancient "The Tall Target"(look for it),"El Cid"(beautiful spectacle)"The Glenn Miller Story"(among the best of bio pics)and, of course, the field in each he excelled, more than any other director: the western.Although he was good in any of them,Mann, I think, was not confortable with big budget productions. Yet, he made a fine one in MGM's "The Naked Spur", not as great as "Winchester 73" or "Bend of the River", my favorite, but always a big,action filled, and sometimes complex western in his psycological structure. And with the one traditional atraction:the suffering, bitter James Stewart, a kind of precursor of Mel Gibson's masochist and self mutilating quest for vengeance.Plus a young and beautiful Janet Leigh,Robert Ryan going over the top as the smiling psycopath and the marvelous scenery of Colorado.What else would want in a Stewart-Mann western?
