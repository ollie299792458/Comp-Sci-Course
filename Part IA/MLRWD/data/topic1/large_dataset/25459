Tales of the Black Freighter is an animated featurette voiced by Gerard Butler.  Butler is a great choice for the voice of the captain, but the feature would have been far better (and of course far more expensive, which is no doubt why it wasn't done) if it had been stylized live-action, perhaps 300-style.  Some of the new content (not in the comic books) is interesting and works well.  The environmental art is done well, but the character animation is not.

The worst part, and the least excusable, is that, at somewhere between 20 and 25 minutes, much of the story's content from the original comics is unnecessarily either left out or shortened to the point of losing its effect, including some of the best parts and dialog from the original.

It does a decent job of conveying the story and atmosphere of the original in animated form and a short span of time, but not to any extent which would make it worth the price.  Black Freighter will be woven into the DVD's "Ultimate" release, which is supposed to come out sometime around Christmas, well after the Director's Cut of Watchmen is release in July (without Freighter).  Under the Hood is good and features some of the actors from the movie, but is basically just an extra feature.
