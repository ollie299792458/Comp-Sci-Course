IT'S FUNNY...to see people write (as if THEY KNOW) that there's nothing really supernatural about the Ouija board/or think that they're equally entitled to see such happenings. Two years ago, with some friends..we constructed a basic one, and a wine glass i pulled from my kitchen cupboard levitated up into the air and across the table. It's sad most of us Americans (unlike Brazil and Europe) are too culturally immature and ignorant to know that there is more to life than food/work/sex/and sleep. Have you ever been physically attacked by an invisible entity? Wrestling and wrestling as it tried to pin you back? While wide awake/lights on/sittin on the couch? Or have you seen a knome or a fairie come to see you? Or had an object flung at you in front of your friends?  All is energy. All is real. Energy can shove and push, and form the figures of your mind {for all to see}. We create. Life is wonderous. But we're doubters, and scared little egotists... cows chewing on the cud and sitting on the toilet laying our opinions. Feed a child. Hold someone you cowards. Before you're embalmed...What a (short but great)opportunity to be beautiful, like this green and blue planet, and its dimensions. You know what I don't believe in? I don't believe in you. Most are cattle. Who ridicule, like a childish ignoramus. You probably voted for George Bush's 2nd term. Jesus! are you dumb!(Better...you don't know. Stick to your life. Eat your mashed potatoes). Try to be kind. Most people, except the poor, are too fake, and insecure to deserve anything. No wonder it's a narrow path to heaven and a wide one to hell. Be humble and open (geez, as if you need to be told!), or stay married to "stupid."
