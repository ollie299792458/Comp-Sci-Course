The ghosts in this movie have officially scarred me for life !!! It has been years and I still have repeated nightmares of the Caged Jackel almost every night, and on the nights where the Jackel is not trying to scare me to death, Freddy Kruger (not in this film), tries to kill me !!!

No, and I repeat NO, amount of therapy or medication will able help me become normal again. If I had to spend 1 minute in that house of horrors, I would have died from sheer fright. The acting

was just mediocre, and I always found Tony Shaloub to be a total idiot, however F.Murray Abraham's character Cyrus was the creepiest, weirdest relative one could ever hope for. Talk about a dude who is messed up. Some people just get a big dog to keep people off of their property, but this guy went a little overboard. What kind of nut would venture into a house with all those horrors taking up residence in it ?? Oh yes, and some security system he had for keeping each freak confined. Matthew Lillard played some kind of fool who should have been thrown into a ring with all 13 ghosts. Now that's entertainment. I was sad with regard to the ghost of Shaloubs wife, with the burnt face and all. Now that was not necessary. The children should not have to see a ghost of their mother like that - that was just in poor taste. Other than that, because of this movie, I will never be the same. BRAVO !!!
