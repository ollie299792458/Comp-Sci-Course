I have reviewed up too 50 war films and given only 3 five stars(the other  two being 'Sahara' and 'the Longest Day') This is simply a superb war film  which does not boast the star stutted casts of those movies mentioned  above. This adds to the films authenticity. This dramatic WW2 story tells  of a fanatic German Colonel who is intent on steeling famous French Art  (commonly referred too as the 'glory of France) for what seems like his own  personal gain rather than for the purposes of his army.
In the desperate  attemps to save the train, Labiche (played by Burt Lancaster) and his  comrades engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse with the enemy, which for  the most part seems unjustified as lives are continually lost and others  left in the balance.  Set on location in several Paris railroads only days  from the cities liberation, 'the train' relives the desperate struggle and  waste of an occupied people but on the other hand clearly demonstrates the  famous 'patriotic' and 'nationalist' values of the French people. If your  wanting to see an action packed film then 'the train' is not for you.  However it is a must for any serious war film enthusiast.
