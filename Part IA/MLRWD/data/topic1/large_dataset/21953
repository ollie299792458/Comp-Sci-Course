If you are looking at this dvd you most likely have already seen the film and are thrilled it is finally available on this wonderful format, or you just like Samuel Fuller's work and are interested what this may be about. I just picked the dvd up today and I am extremely excited. Criterion has done it once again. The transfer is amazing and the film looks gorgeous. I have never seen the movie look so good, and the audio mix sounds great . Well done again Criterion! This is one of Fuller's best and anyone interested in his work should definitely pick this up. I was shocked to find out this was not one of Criterion's $35 dvds. To me, the extras alone are worth the $25.99. We get a 10min doc about the opening of the film in which Fuller himself explains the technical achievements and meanings he was trying to convey. We also get a 20min doc with Sam talking about the film, the studio, his fascination with his characters, and even J. Edgar Hoover.  If you have never heard Sam speak, you are in for a real treat because he is at the top of his game here. I have Tigrero and The Typewriter, The Camera, and the Rifle and I feel these two new gems are a perfect fit into the limited collection of footage we have with Sam. Also Criterion throws in trailers for "Fixed Bayonets", "Pickup on South Street", "House of Bamboo", "China Gate", "Forty Guns", "Hell and High Water", "Hell and High Water" (teaser), "Shock Corridor", and "The Naked Kiss". This is one of Criterion's and Fuller's best. You should pick it up today. If you are interested in the plot read below or check out imdb.
