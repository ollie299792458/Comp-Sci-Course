Val Kilmer is on screen for about 15 minutes and is never seen again.  Christian Slater is on screen for about 30 minutes and is never seen again.  This allows the movie producers to claim two big-name stars are in the movie, while in reality the movie is full of amateurs.  That saves a bundle of money.

Other than misrepresenting the acting talent, this is not an FBI cop movie, either.  It is just another variation on the haunted house or house of horrors movie, filled with all sorts of tricky ways to hack and slash and dismember people.  It is pretty sick in that regard.

Can you guess who is killing all these totally unconvincing FBI agents?  Can you guess who is next to die?  Can you guess who the real killer is?  Duh, who cares?  Most of us gave up playing "Clue" when we were little kids at summer camp.

And of course we have the required stock of politically correct diversity characters: one white female, one Hispanic female, one black male, a couple white males, and just for good measure one paraplegic in a wheelchair who apparently has a speech impediment.  If you have been waiting for Hollywood to cast a movie with characters that reflect real life situations, forget this movie.
