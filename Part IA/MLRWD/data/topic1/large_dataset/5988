I am a huge fan of Christopher Guest's movies, so I anxiously awaited the release of this film and saw it the night it came out.  Wow.  What a shock.  The film was markedly unfunny and the usually inventive cast did not deliver.  
The standout performance was Catherine O'Hara's as a folkie who revives and resolves a long buried relationship and career.  The character was nuanced and bittersweet, throwing into stark relief the overacting of others in the cast.  Eugene Levy, for example, mugged and grimaced his way through the film.  And what was with the voice?  His performance in American Pie was much superior to this one.
I found the last scene in the movie to be offensive and superfluous, and I couldn't understand why it was included.  It is unlike Guest to go for the cheap laugh, but there it was, big as life.  It didn't help that the entire audience burst into nervous laughter.  
If you must see this, wait until the video release.  You'd be much better off watching the deleted scenes from Best in Show, which are hilarious!
