While I thought this movie was somewhat enjoyable, I thought that it stumbled and failed as a remake in several regards.  First of all, I didn't enjoy the characters nearly as much as in the original...of course, how could you possible replace Sir John Gielgud's performance as Hobson in the original?!  Where this film falls down to me is that while it tries to recreate the story line with some reasonable tweaks, all too often it's readily apparent when the producers run out of gas and have to rely on the original movie for even specific scripted lines (for example, when on her inital sick bed, Helen Mirren as Hobson tells Arthur about the "three books" and then feigns death, straight out of the original)...for me these shortfalls make the movie feel cobbled together...it's a remake with some twists, but it isn't.  The movie also seems a little disjointed from the original in terms of its transitions through the various scenes, feeling somewhat out of sequence with the original which had to me very logical transitions.  I don't normally provide movie reviews here, but the original Arthur is one of my favorite movies, so I just wanted to share my thoughts about this remake.  I wouldn't avoid seeing this movie, but if you love the original as do I, I don't believe this remake really does it justice.
