Okay...I read the reviews and I was skeptical of this film. People said that it was boring, weak storyline, etc.

WRONG!!!

This movie had more heart and story to it then ANY movie in 2011! The story was nothing short of magical as a young boy who loses everything will stop at nothing to fix an automaton and help a few people out along the way. He has complications due to the Station Inspection and his dog Maximillian having it out for orphaned children. The characters were so memorable and it was one of the best roles I have ever seen Ben Kingsley and Sacha Baron Cohen in. The despair and sadness in Ben Kingsley's eyes for over half the movie were unforgettable.

The visual effects were stunning!!! As well as the cinematography, you would expect nothing less from such a big name director like Martin Scorsese. The best part of this movie was the ending...course...I don't want to spoil that for you. Do yourself and your family a favor and BUY (at least rent) this movie. If they like movies full of character, heart, great story, and a visual masterpiece...they will thank you for suggesting this film.
