Nobody made better propaganda films than Howard Hawks and Warner Brothers, particularly during the early days following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. For a nation still stunned and outraged, confronting a war on two fronts, and not knowing what would come next, films like, "Air Force," served to encourage the civilian population by showing that everyday people could become military heroes. The message of, "Air Force," filmed in glorious black and white, was simple: we would win this war because our guys can overcome anything, no matter the odds stacked against them in the Pacific in 1942. With a great ensemble cast consisting of John Garfield, Harry Carey, Gig Young, George Tobias, and several WB contract players, we are taken aboard a B-17 as it flies - literally - right into the attack on Pearl. The brave boys of the U.S. Army Air Corps are then ordered to fly to Wake Island, Manilla, and Australia, and as only Hollywood could arrange, pretty much wipe out half the Japanese army and navy along the way. Although loosely based on some true incidents, this isn't a movie for those looking for historical  accuracy. Enjoy this classic for what it was, and still is, a film about love of country and patriotism. A brief side note: the B17 used to film many of the scenes was actually shot down with its entire crew over the Pacific a few months after the film was completed.
