When it comes to comic-book spin off movies; this is the worst case scenrio moment, ladies and gentlemen.

Here we have one Pateince Phillips ( This is not the same woman in BATMAN RETURNS. That secreatary was named Selina Kyle and was the love interest in BATMAN RETURNS.), a shy, awkward, intellectually misunderstood woman who uncovers a supposedly deadly secret: The cosemetics company she works for is being ambushed by someone putting poisens into the products. After witnessing the criminals talking, she follows a series of piping that eventually leads to her downfall. She is ressurected, somehow, by cats, and is on a juorney of special-ability discovering.

If you ask me, the story is all hype and style and no substance. It's a mock up to the legendary villian that is CATWOMAN. Although Halle Berry looks the part it's just too sloppy of a plot. It's good for a thought but not for a whole movie.

There's even moments of a CGI catwoman. God Help them is all I have to say.

Along with some crooked lines and too many musical cues, this makes for a music video of Catwoman, Muscial Montage, that is just too long for comfort and too silly to be a movie. They should have left it alone or tried again.

Final verdict: Curiousity didn't kill the cat . . .the movie did.
