The film takes place in 1973 in Philadelphia, PA, the city of brotherly love.  The theme of the film consists of a man with AIDS fighting for his right to work although he is disabled with debilitating disease.  
The plot of the film involves a man with AIDS being terminated from his position as Senior Associate with a prestigious law firm in the city of Philadelphia.  Shortly after he is promoted to Senior Associate of the law firm and given the most important case the law firm has ever received, he is terminated from his employment with the law firm.  The genre of the film is a drama.
I would give this film four star.  I believe the film deserves four stars because of the truth of the AIDS disease it brought forward to our society.  This was a very empowering film.  Although at the time of its release, AIDS was though of a disease you could contract by just touching a person with AIDS, this film opened up the eyes of our society by showing that AIDS is a disease just like Cancer and Heart Disease.
