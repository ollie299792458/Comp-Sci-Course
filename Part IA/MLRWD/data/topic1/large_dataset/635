Millennium Actress is the third animated film I've seen by Satoshi Kon, director of "Perfect Blue" and "Tokyo Godfathers." This falls somewhere between the other two.

Like "Perfect Blue," "Millennium Actress" explores the faceted nature of reality, in this case the fractured memory of an aging actress recalling her film career, interwoven with her lifelong obsession - the search for a political agitator she fell in love with as a young girl. It's often difficult to tell if scenes are excerpts from the actress' films, her memory, or dreams. Transitions between scenes are abrupt and very creative, adding to the dislocated quality that Satoshi Kon has mastered. He succeeds in creating a visual analogue for memory, with its elisions and unexpected leaps through time.

As in "Tokyo Godfathers," the animation is lush and detailed. Satoshi Kon uses the main character's film career as a means to cut through large swaths of Japanese history, from feudal castles to bombed-out cities in World War II. The characters, costumes, buildings, and landscape are beautifully rendered, and the film is a visual feast from beginning to end.

But "Millennium Actress" lacks the emotional heart of "Tokyo Godfathers." Though the film's subject is overwrought passion, even the director seems a little uncomfortable with the ridiculous side of this unrequited love. He frames the love story by introducing an interviewer and cameraman who follow her through her memories, providing occasional comic relief; in my opinion the device is silly, although the interviewer's real love for the actress adds some emotional depth. Ultimately, as a story, the film is about lifelong self-indulgence and unwillingness to live in the present. It is the visual structure of the film that elevates it, not the tale it tells.
