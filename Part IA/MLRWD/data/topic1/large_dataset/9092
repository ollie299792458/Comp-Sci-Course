This was the first Leslie Sansone DVD I ever bought and introduced me to the world of Walk at Home videos.  Two years later, I still pop it into the DVD player from time-to-time to incorporate particular segments into my daily workout routine (the Fast Walk and Walk Like a Runner miles being my most-used on this particular video).

It has clearly defined segments which allow for easy mixing and matching of walking routines (I like to mix up various miles with the assorted DVDs that I own, depending on my mood and my workout schedule), and even though some of the routines include the use of various exercise equipment (hand weights, walk belt, etc) you can easily perform the workouts without them.  It also put off a more "intimate" vibe for me--there is more focus on Leslie herself and less on her fellow walkers (unlike some videos like the 5 Mile Fat Burning workout where I found some of her walkers distracting).  In addition, unlike some of the other reviewers, I don't have an issue really with Leslie's chattiness--I find her friendly and more approachable than other instructors I've seen in other exercise DVDs (and you can choose to turn off the chatter and just exercise with the Music only option, which I greatly appreciated).

The only things I don't like about the DVD is that the music is a little more annoying than motivational, and Leslie misses her cues a few times (a problem I've found on other Walk at Home videos).  It also has the innate problem of any exercise DVD in that it can become repetitious after used a number of times, but if you want more complicated and advanced moves then maybe a walking DVD is not for you (as stated above, I mix up various Leslie DVDs to help keep my workout more fresh and less boring).

Overall a good basic DVD choice for Intermediate and Advanced Leslie walkers!
