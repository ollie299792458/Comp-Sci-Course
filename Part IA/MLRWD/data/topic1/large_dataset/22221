Kurt Russell plays Snake Plissken, a decorated soldier who's become disillusioned and cynical, with a disdain for authority. When he's caught robbing the Federal gold reserve he gets sentenced to incarceration in the maximum security prison of Manhatten island (that's the whole island, walled off on all sides). Just before he's shipped over, terrorists attack Airforce One, causing the President to crash land within the prison. The President is due to give a speech in 24 hours, which will prevent world war 3, so in light of his record, Plissken is offered his freedom if he goes in and rescues the President. To ensure his cooperation the police force embed explosive charges with a 24 hour timer in Snake's neck and he's thrust into the scrabbling dark hell that New York has become.
Like the best John Carpenter films, Escape from New York is vividly atmospheric and quirky, with an excellent musical score that enhances the oppressive, claustrophobic mood of the film. From the start Snake is forced into action against his will and  - unlike the classic movie heroes - really resents it, giving everyone he meets the sharp edge of his tongue (with some great moments of dry humour). His only interest is his own survival, and when the President seems to slip away from him at every turn, his world-weary bitterness slowly becomes an angry desperation. A hugely enjoyable film I first saw in the darkness of the early hours of the morning and no other time fits the sombre mood of the film better.
