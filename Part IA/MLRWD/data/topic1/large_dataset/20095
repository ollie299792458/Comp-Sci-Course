You start off suffering your way through the initial setup of divorced parents, single kid, mom remarries someone much more successful than daddy and unless daddy can be financially successful too then he hasn't got anything to offer the son and he'll lose visitation rights.  Once more we have the same tired message that financial success equates to good fathering.  Yuck.  Ok, now the cute stuff starts when Ben Stiller finally gets his job at the museum and we see all the stuff that they used to put together the previews.  Then the cute stuff is over and it is time to insert the bad guys and give daddy his moment to shine in front of his son.  Very, very tired setup and the only cute part (the museum) is actually quite short.  There are a couple chuckles and some smiles but none of the jokes stand out as anything you didn't already anticipate.  In the end I was just wanting the movie to end and when it did I put it back in its rental case and sent it back.  I don't think I'll have a desire to watch it again.
