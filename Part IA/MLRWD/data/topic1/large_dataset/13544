See the other reviews to read about how great this movie (and the show) is. This review was written to give those new to Cowboy Bebop an idea of how to go about watching the series and the movie.

Step 1: buy the perfect sessions and the movie from the new and used section of amazon.com. they cost much less and are about the same quality as their higher priced counterparts.

Step 2: When you get the DVDs, watch the perfect sessions first, starting from session one and watching them in order until session 22. You don't have to watch them all in the same day, but try to finish them within a month.

Step 3: After you have watched episode 22, turn off your tv and go do domething else. Wait until tomorrow for

Step 4: Set aside at least couple hours (its a long movie), making sure you will not be interrupted, as you will definitely want to see this movie through to the end without having to get up and do something, like say, answering the phone.

Step 5:get a drink and a snack, in case you get hungry  or thirsty. The drink preferably being coffee. Now find a nice cofortable place to sit with the bathroom nearby in case nature calls.

Step 6: put the movie in, turn the sound up, and press play. Enjoy.

Step 7:After seeing the movie, you may want to watch it again, turn the tv off and think about it, or watch the rest of the episodes. do whatever you see fit.

Step 8: go tell your friends about Bebop if they aren't already fans. then refer them to this little recipe. They'll thank you for doing so. If they are the type that don't like anime, show them episode one. it should get them hooked. if not, its their loss.

There. Now you've got a recipe for a nice, steaming bowl of Cowboy Bebop stew.Eat up. and remember that its not the meat that makes the stew, its the soup mix. (if you are haveing problems playing the Cowboy bebop the movie DVD, ie it won't get past a certain screen in the beginning, go to scene selection and select scene one. it should work perfectly.)
