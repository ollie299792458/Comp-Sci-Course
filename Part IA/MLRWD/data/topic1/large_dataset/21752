Gotta love the little surprises. This is my 3rd movie this weekend that I got on a whim during one of Amazon's little evil Blu-ray sale days. Best one of the 3. I've given up on the ratings in Amazon. They seems as much hit and miss as the news paper ones. 5 stars for Battle Royale? Cracker please.
I enjoy a movie done on a low budget that turns out well. The low budget ones depend a lot more on the actors and scripts. Gemma has a couple great scenes. Loved her as an actress in this movie much MUCH more than her other ones. To be honest, I didn't recognize her from any of her big title movies nor did I care much enough about her acting to even check. Clearly different story with this performance.
The two gents did some great stuff as well but was over shadowed by Gemma imo.

Not discussing the plot at all. The commentary does a good job of covering some misc info you might be curious about. Such as the title (and no, this isn't giving anything away - if you see the movie you'll know what I mean). Also touches on the motivation behind Danny and to what he was thinking at certain times of the story line (which I was really wondering about).

If you like a suspense story line, some intense acting and a couple good twists all the while wondering what is going to happen to which character, snag this one.
