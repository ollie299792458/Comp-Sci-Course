What this film does so well that most punk rock films cannot seem to accomplish is to give real insight into why the punk movement happened...why it HAD TO happen.  This is a film that UNDERSTANDS alienation, and why kids who were intelligent enough to see past the lies they'd been fed and the distractions intended to placate them felt so disenfranchised.  We see kids who've come from broken homes...whose parents don't understand the world their kids are living in...who are, in essence, The Rejected.  Conventional society rejects them...so they, in turn, reject conventional society.  As a punk rocker, this film has always struck a chord with me because of that very reason.  What do you do, after all, when you realize that your parents are full of (...)?  When you realize that your teachers are full of (...)?  What do you do then?  What CAN you do?  This film relates the story of a group of young people who became easy scapegoats in their community.  When something goes wrong, it's easy to blame the outsiders, isn't it?  It's so easy to point the finger at people who already DON'T FIT.  That is what this film portrays so honestly, and so plainly.  True, the acting is sub-par...but who cares?  This film's insight is enough to carry it.  And there are beautiful moments throughout, mainly fueled by Flea's performance as Razzle.  I can't count the times I've uttered the immortal line "Happy Easter, ***hole" in various convenience stores across the Midwest.  And the scene in which Chris Pederson says "Where's that house, Flea?" and Flea responds to the question...then adds, about thirty seconds later, "Hey, my name's Razzle, man" is priceless.  This film was not afraid to show off, even PARADE, its flaws.  And what makes it so perfect, so real, was Penelope Spheeris's use of real punk rock kids in this film, as opposed to actual ACTORS.  She sums it up best in her own personal philosphy..."It's easier to teach punks to be actors than it is to teach actors to be punks."
