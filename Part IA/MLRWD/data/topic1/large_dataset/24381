First... let me say I thought the movie was a 4 1/2 star movie.  My complaints are with this Combo set.  This was my first combo DVD/Blu Ray/Digital where it is an ultraviolet digital copy. I must admit that I didn't fully understand the whole "ULTRAVIOLET" thing when I purchased it, so I must admit I made some poor assumptions.  All of the past purchases (with the exception of one Sony which would only play if I had a PlayStation) have come with a digital copy I could download to my computer and place on my kid's iPods. But this one... BUYER BEWARE... it only allows you to stream the video through Flixter.  This doesn't help when you're in the car and don't have an internet connection.  I need a digital copy my kids can watch on their iPods while we are traveling in the car.  So, this combo pack is a complete waste of time.  I would have done better to purchase the DVD and burn my own digital copy to the iPods.  I will know better next time.  Also, you have to sign up for a Flixter account and select several required boxes which I did not agree with.  So, this whole marketing scheme they have going is awful!  I will never buy another combo that comes with the ultraviolet digital copy.
