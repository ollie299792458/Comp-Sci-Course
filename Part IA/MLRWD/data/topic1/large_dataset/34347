Some people think ventriloquists are cute or novel, but they would never actually want to go to a show with one. It's time to reevaluate your love of puppets, or not.

I've seen a few of Jeff's acts and he's funny on his own. Add in some interesting characters and turn Jeff into the straight man and not your talking. This DVD is full of his best stuff:

Walter - "Shut the hell up!" Funny, insulting, jerk of an old man who Jeff continually apologizes for.

Peanut - "Nnneeyroww!" The funniest part of the show. It almost seems like he's improvising the whole thing as he goes.

Jose Jalepeno - "On a steek." The banter between him and Peanut is priceless.

Bubba J - I think this guy was made to cash in on the Blue Collar Comedy hype. Funny, but not Jeff's best work.

Sweet Daddy Dee - Also meant to cash in on the Kings of comedy tour. Funny, but not to die for. He also makes commentary throughout the DVD which was entirely unnecessary.

Bloopers - I was at the second show and he picked the best of the improve stuff, but I wish he had put it all in. He never is out of character. Never.

So to sum up: Jeff is brilliantly hilarious. Walter, Peanut & Jose are funny. Bubba & Sweet are not. Bloopers are worth it. Buy, buy, buy.
