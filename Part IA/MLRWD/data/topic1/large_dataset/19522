I saw Alexander back in theaters in 2004, and I instantly thought of it as a classic. However I can understand why most people would dislike this film, this film requires the viewers to actually think. It does not spoon feed viewers like other epics. This new Revisited Cut however largely in my opinion makes the film better and more `complete'. Four hours long, the film could `battle-fatigue' most viewers, but in the end, it is worth it in my opinion especially since it is in HD now. The battle scenes are even more incredible than before. The plot in my opinion is also easier to follow filling in the gaps that were left from the theatrical and director's cut. The most important thing about this new cut is the beginning sequence which is the Battle of Gaugemela which shows the viewer first that Alexander is a king, after the battle it moves into his boyhood life and continues on. Overall, this is a great film and is a must own for HD-DVD (Also available on Blu-ray and SD-DVD) owners who would like to show off their player's capabilities. This two disc HD-DVD set is loaded with extras including a documentary by Sean Stone (Oliver Stone's son) and also splits the movie in two segments with an intermission at the two hour mark on the first disc. If you have not seen Alexander Revisited, I recommend you buy it if you like epics or rent it to be on the safe side, but overall I doubt you will be disappointed.
