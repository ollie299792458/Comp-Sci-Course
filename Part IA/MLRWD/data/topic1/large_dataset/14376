True, aspects of the plot have been 'borrowed' from 'Gaslight' and 'The Wicker Man' with explicit homage to Hitchock but give me an example of a plot line that is not derivative these days...

I suspended my critical faculties, regarded it as a romantic thriller and know what ? I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  The plot is suffused with an elegiac feel  in keeping with a sub text of loss (and ultimately, reconciliation).  Production values are very high (apart from one sequence featuring an unconvincing panorama of a  cgi lighthouse. The actual lighthouse only has one storey. Filmed in Anglesey but set in the western highlands of Scotland using an authentic Scottish cast. The celtic influenced score greatly enhances the film, adding most effectively to the the sense of mood, menace and milieu.  Demi Moore gives a convincing central performance, Hans Matheson ably teases out the facets of his complex character/s.

The plot structure is wreathed by supernatural overtones and an air of impending threat hovers over the tale as vulnerable Rachel battles  guilt over the death of her son. But whence does the threat emanate ?
Who, or what, is behind the ghostly warnings and portents ?
Her jealous ex husband ?  the local villagers ?  the wraith of her drowned son ? the mysterious lighthouse keeper Angus, with whom she enjoys some fleeting hours of comfort ? Rachel's literary agent ?
or is it all of them ?

Watch the DVD and find out!

All told, its a poignant little gem which deserved a much wider release.
