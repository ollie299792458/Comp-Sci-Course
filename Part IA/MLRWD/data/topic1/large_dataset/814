I thought this was a terrific thriller -- one of the best I've seen since "The Silence of the Lambs" 20 years ago. It gets you involved within the first five minutes and builds to a breathtaking pace. The main character, Dr. Beck, is an incredibly sympathetic guy (played wonderfully by Francois Cluzet) and I really felt his sadness and terror and shock as he worked to unravel the mystery of who killed his beloved wife. There were good plot twists, scary villains, great chase scenes, and a variety of good roles for women, which is always welcome. Some viewers have complained of plot holes and lack of characterization; it all seemed pretty clear and compelling to me. If necessary, a simple rewinding to the climactic scenes should help everyone get all the details down.

All in all, I thought "Tell No One" was stylishly done and a very satisfying entertainment. Folks who hate reading subtitles should know that the DVD features a complete English dubbed track. Taking that route, however, will deprive you of the pleasure of hearing Kristin Scott-Thomas's flawless French!
