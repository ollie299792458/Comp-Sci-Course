Once again, we the public have beeen denied a great and entertaining film.  In a time when things are so dire for so many people, we need a story that sweeps us up and delights us at every turn.  So is "The Emperor's New Clothes" such a film.  But we cannot see it now, in February of 2009.  For how long must we wait?  Must we troll the aftermarket and the used item market or, naughty-naughty, seek those who sell these films not on the up and up?  I fail to understand the sense behind a film being withdrawn.  It smacks of Big Brother no matter who does this.  Especially when it is a film as harmless but as uplifting as this one is.  If you can watch "The Emperor's New Clothes" do so.  Beg, borrow but don't steal.  And watch it.  In the end, as in life the story affirms that what is most important is what is right in front of us all along.  And that sometimes true heroic kindness comes quietly, selflessly, and humbly.  Watch this film and complain like crazy that it is not easily available. That it has been taken from us for who knows how long.  Very unfair and these days this film is better for us than many of those debuting in the last few years.
