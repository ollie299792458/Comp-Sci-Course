I liked this movie so much, I bought the DVD. The movie is hilarious with a great happy ending. It also hits home because I am an Asian lesbian with a very old fashion mother who pretty much gave me the same reaction as Ma did to Wil. Luckily for Wil, Ma has a change of heart unlike mine.

Stereotype or not, it's very real, the messages that it Alice Wu is trying to portray that is.  However, the way it was directed and acted, makes it light-hearted and easy to watch.

Most of my Asian lesbian friends are very attractive and pretty. It's refreshing to see a number of Asian lesbian movies(Butterfly, Spider Lilies, The Bontanist's Daughter, Love My Life) where the actresses are very beautiful and cute, unlike some of the American lesbian movies I've seen which sets a different tone for lesbians.

It is also nice that the ending isn't tragic. I think we've seen enough of that already.

I am very impressed with Alice Wu and all the cast in this movie.
