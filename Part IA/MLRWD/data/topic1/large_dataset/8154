If you are intelligent, you will positively find this show to be one of the most hilarious things you have ever seen. Everyone I show this to agrees (at least those with XY chromosomes). If you have not witnessed this show yet, don't be put off by the fact that it is a cartoon. It is quite simply, one of the sharpest, wittiest, funniest productions I have ever seen. Seth MacFarlane is obviously a genius, and wise beyond his years. I mean his vast wealth of cultural knowledge is unbelievable... Witticisms abound; everyone from Doystoevsky(sic), Hitler, the Kool-Aid man, Lost In Space, Broadway musicals, Jesus, and Chrales Manson, are incorporated into these episodes in a brilliant manner. If this show does not make you laugh, you are obviously a moron. I believe as humans, it is our duty to support a genius like Seth. I mean he is such a genius. In addition to doing the voices for Brian, Peter, Stewie, and most of the extras, he writes all of these razor sharp episodes. Your support of this series thus far has not been for naught- He recently recieved the go ahead to commence with 35 new episodes. Hooray! I can't wait. Buy this now, you will not be dissapointed
