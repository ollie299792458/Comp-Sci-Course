This is not only an excellent history of the Ballets Russes after Diaghilev.  It is also a touching meditation on the vibrancy and enthusiasm of youth as it is reflected by the mature personality as it stands at the threshold of the beyond.  A number of the radiant artists who were interviewed by the highly gifted film makers, Geller and Goldfine, had passed on by the time this documentary was released.  What a gift of foresight to have captured these beautiful, lively and animated artists, juices fully flowing, as they recalled the liminal era in which modern art exploded on the scene.

You only have to scan the other reviews to see with what love this film was received.  Ballets Russes is a precious document of an unforgettable era in the history of art.  If you are touched by these artists and want a wonderful little surprise, look at the DVD Black Tights/Bolshoi 67.  Like a treat in a Cracker Jack box, this otherwise dull (to me) DVD has as an afterthought a 10 minute experimental dance film called Spring Night, choreographed by David Lichine of Colonel de Basil's Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo.

If you enjoyed the beautiful and unique dancing of the artists of the Ballets Russes, you will thrill to see this gem, Spring Night, danced and envisioned in the style of the Diaghilev tradition.  Why this short is almost non-existent is a mystery.  Once you see it, you'll achieve even greater insight into this now extinct tradition.

Another treasure from this artistic era is Max Reinhardt's Midsummer Night's Dream with Nini Theilade, a Ballets Russes star.
