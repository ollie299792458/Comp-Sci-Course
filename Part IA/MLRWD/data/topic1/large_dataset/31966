No one makes a movie like Michael Mann. He's not a director who just gives you empty good guys and bad guys and likes to blow stuff up. Every character has a dimension that comes off screen. And while the characters come off screen, the master cinematography brings the audience on screen. There aren't too many directors who can orchestrate a crime thriller with such poetic justice.
  On the outside, the movie is about a team of undercover detectives trying to bring down one of the largest drug cartels in the world. The problems start when Rico, played by Colin Farrell, allows his false identity to compromise the mission.
  I really wouldn't want to give away any more of the story than that but believe me, there's an all-star cast of actors in this movie, they may not all be actors that you're familiar with but they're better than a lot of the ones you are. Forget the campy 80's crap you might have watched in that worst decade ever. Its rare that a film compliments audiences with such in your face thought provoking subject matter. Well Done.
