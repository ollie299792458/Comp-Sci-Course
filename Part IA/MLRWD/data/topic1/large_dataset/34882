I get movie tickets at a discount from the company where I am now consulting, therefore saving $12 on a family outing to the movies. For that reason, I was not too disappointed by the movie despite its leanness and lameness.  I am a sucker for the good guy gets revenge in the end types and this was one written by the book, no surprises, ending just like you knew it would.

Two things stand out: (1) The hero acted like a new actor who has just discovered that he is famous (+) and (2) there is never an explanation as to just why these particular guys have it in for him.  As for the world of the paparazzi, I learned nothing that I did not already know and since I have never bought one of those magazines (quote unquote), I fail to see the allure of viewing Brad Pitt's tail or Jennifer Lopez's boyfriend of the week.  The infuriating cameos were more cutesy than cute, adding absolutely nothing to the film.  In fact, they distracted from the "plot" in that the audience inevitably went through a "did you see whats-his-name?"  The crusty cop and the distraught female witness steal the show.
