I bought this movie for just one reason - I'd just bought a new HDTV and wanted to buy a DVD that would look good on it. I got exactly what I was looking for. This movie looks ravishing - a crisp, sumptuous, beautifully crafted feast for the eye.

Not only are the visuals gorgeous, they're imaginative. The robots and monsters that parade across the screen are fascinating. I could hardly wait to see what would pop up next. Unfortunately, in the midst of all this imagination and craft, there isn't much of a movie. The plot is pretty simple - mad doctor sets machines loose to plunder and eventually destroy the world, while plucky, brave, and handsome/beautiful pair - an adventurer and a reporter - team up to stop him. Will they succeed? You needn't lose much sleep pondering that one, and the proceedings occur without too much tension. As they escape from various perils, you aren't balanced on the edge of your seat in worried anticipation. You sit back and admire the technique of the production and figure, if they live, they live. They are, after all, only so much attractive cardboard.

I did enjoy this movie. It's fun to just watch when you want your brain to wind down. It's definitely worth the price, but only if you have a nice big HDTV screen to watch it on. If you can't rely on your TV to dazzle you, you'd do better to find a movie with fleshed-out characters and an absorbing plot.
