Army of Darkness is the third and final chapter in the classic trilogy  that begun in 1982 with the memorable shocker The Evil Dead. Sam  Raimi(director) and Bruce Campbell(lead actor) went forward to create a  hoorror-comedy sequel a few years later, after the original's commercial  success despite its extremely low budget. The trilogy ended(?) with AOD  which turned out to be a straight action movie that retained the humor but  was almost clean of the horror and gore elements of the previous two. While  the latter has been a let down for the series' many followers, the fact is  that it's a very entertaining film, mostly due to Campbell's cracking  performance and Raimi's superb direction. The story begins where the  previous one ended, with Ash (Campbell) being trapped in the middle Ages  and having to find the Book of the Dead in order to return to the present.  In the meantime, he accidentally unleashes the army of the dead which he  has to fight with the odds against him. Featuring some quite distinctive  action pieces, unforgettable one-liners and the exhilarating Ram-o-cam  shots, Army of darkness is a really cool film that you won't regret  watching.  This DVD version is the director's cut which adds 15 min. to the  theatrical cut. Also don't forget to check out the commentary track with  Raimi and Campbell and an interesting look behind the scenes.
