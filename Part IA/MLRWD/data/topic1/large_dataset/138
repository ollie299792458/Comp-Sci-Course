This movie makes no sense at all and it seemed like the writers were just pulling plot point out of their butt. First the lights can go over water then at the end they won't cross water. Glass blinds them yet they have broken glass PLENTY of times to get to their target. Metal shark cages..."just work" WTH?!? So the lights can tear down buildings made of glass and metal yet these things are weaknesses whenever the writers need an excuse to keep the main characters alive for a while longer. One of the main characters is a douche bag who for some reason is able to say just the right thing that would make total strangers risk their lives for his whims.

Example, he and his group get saved by some strangers, then they ask them to take them to the submarine that is just randomly waiting for any survivors. Of course the strangers would say no. However, he's says "What's the point in saving people if you won't see them home." LOL!! yeah he actually says that and of course the strangers are fine with risking their lives just to escort them to their way out. Then they get to the sub and the man in charge is ready to leave...naturally as the lights are coming and already destroyed another boat. The main guy begs and pleads about how *he* can't leave his girlfriend of three days and of course the NAVY soldier is okay with that and risk his sub and the lives of his crew for one girl.

Then at the end the main douchebag character is with his girlfriend of three days on the sub with their steampunk like weapons looking over military maps like they are in charge. LOL! All around stupid movie.
