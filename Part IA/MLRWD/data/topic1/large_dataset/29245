This audio book is excellently read by Robert Powell who has a wonderful gravity to his voice and does the varied accents and personalities of the crew so well. It represents a high of story telling. This audio book was abridged from the famous 1951 novel by Nicholas Monsarrat who wrote it based on his wartime experience as a corvette commander in the British Navy in W.W.II. As noted by Bernard Edwards in "The Cruel Sea Retold: The Truth Behind Monsarrat's Epic Convoy Drama," the novel is based on real events. Undoubtably, it was the best novel Monsarrat ever wrote. It became the basis for the classic war film with John Hawkins with the same name as the novel. Unfortunately, this book still is only available on cassette. Most libraries have long since lost the audio book or it has been broken by one of their patrons. One can only hope that it will be re-released as a CD sometime soon. The genre of wartime experience is a very big one, as of late, most people have been re-discovering memoirs of the Pacific War due to the new HBO Series, "The Pacific." Having read many works in this area as well as some non-fiction histories by popular historians like the late Stephen Ambrose or the late Canadian historian, Pierre Berton, I'd have to say that this novel is one of the best. It has well-drawn characters and the intimacy of a very realistically depicted war at sea. There is none of the false bravado and theatrics of the movies. Instead, the war described on this pages is frequently monotonous, and frustrating in the extreme as the corvette attempts to destroy the submarine packs attacking the convoys. There are moments of great intensity and even horror as they fail to stop the enemy or are required by their orders to abandon, or even harm shipwrecked sailors who are in between them and enemy subs that they must try to destroy. It is a wonderful story and very well-rendered in this audio-book, don't miss it!
