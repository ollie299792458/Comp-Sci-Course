First, I truely believe this movie has very little to do with comic books except as a metaphor for self-discovery.  Second, this is probably the best movie I have ever seen that deals with a man's loss sense of self (AKA mid-life crisis).  Here's our reluctant hero on the verge of a divorce, detached from everything around him (even his son)while stumbling through his life on a daily basis.  He tries to juice up his life a bit early on in the movie in a failed pick up attempt on the train he will untimately be the lone survivor of.

M. Night (as we all know by now)searches for the spirituality that binds us together.  This is a story for what happens to a man when that spirituality is lost and later refound.

I love the combination of scenes when, after our hero saves the girls, who in turn save him, and then he commits himself to action by destroying the killer in the house.  He comes home and carries his wife to bed looking to reconect with her.  The next morning, at the breakfast table, you could feel the returned intimacy in their marriage (which eventually runs to their child).

This is a great movie.
