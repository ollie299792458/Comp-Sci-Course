I first saw this seventeen years ago when i was just four years old and absolutley loved this nonsense fantasy-adventure classic. Now years later it perharps is slightly dated with its cardboard sets which seems more suited for a stage production. However it boasts some good effects (for that year anyway). 
This is very faithful to the Lewis Carroll book and also draws from Through The Looking Glass. It begins extremley well where Alice follows the white rabbit into the tunnel which leads to her falling down the rabbit hole. This particular sequence which begins with her waking up in a giant garden is made effective from its haunting, atmospheric score which remains chilling throughout, creating the dark and often frightening image Lewis Carroll intended it to be. This is one of the few filmed versions that comes close to capturing the true spirit of Wonderland. On more than one occasion its pace is a little tedious and slow moving and the vast majority of the songs don't work. Never the less i would say this is one of the best  filmed versions i've een, especially given to its cast which includes Dudley Moore as the doormouse, Spike Milligan as the caterpilla, Ralph Richardson as The Mad Hatter and Dennis Waterman as one of the cards and of course a young Fiona Fullerton as Alice who is engaging in her role. There are many sequences which work well including Alice following the rabbit down the rabbit hole and the sequence in the forest when the storm brews and a giant crow emerges from the dark sky. This is where it draws close to capturing the dark and frightening vision of Wonderland as intended by Carrol and as said before the score helps create that essential atmosphere for a film/story like this.
This live action version of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland was generally poorly received by crtics and although this indeed is not brilliant its still good and entertaining with many high points in the film. Very much recommended to fans of this story.
