I saw this autobiographical movie/documentary on cable TV early AM, May 28th, 2003. The story of Mr. Evans and his rise to become one of the top movie producers of the late 20th century is mingled with genuine introspective commentary by the narrator, Robert Evans himself, combined with a sardonic wit, a great sense of humor and irony, and the open admission of the calculated expertise necessary to wangle one's way through the corporate jungle, and above all, the film industry's ultimately most competitive one at that. His own admission of the egotism necessary to accomplish such extraordinary feats, combined with good luck, being in the right place at the right time, sheer hard work, the willingness to take chances and gamble all, based upon one's own faith and belief in the ability to achieve greatness despite the challenge of adversity posed by more conservative investors, studio executives, board members, and critics surrounding him, display the successful achievement of the ultimate challenge; through a combination of greatness, innovation, wit, and sheer balls, and is mingled with his own readiness to admit character flaws, and ultimately his sheer honesty in expressing the results of introspection after total disaster precluded by ultimate success. These can serve as an inspiration to anyone (myself included) seeking to accomplish greatness in whatever field of endeavor they choose, and record for others the testament of a living legend in the field of cinematic production. His portrayal of the ultimate conquest of the greatest human challenge, that of the loss of belief in oneself, mingled with the loss of self itself, triggered by drugs and their progressively insidious control over one's own perception and values, by overcoming these life-threatening situations and gaining back the self-respect and most cherished possessions having been previously lost, is tempered by his own willingness for brutal self-honesty in admitting and characterizing the road from ultimate success to a living hell, and the successful, slow struggle back to comparative normalcy. These all serve as an example of the strength of the human will to accomplish any task set before oneself, despite any adversity, combined with the essential ingredient of raw talent, perceptual insight and sheer drive. This film is a legacy to all who seek to achieve their own breed of greatness. An absolutely MUST SEE MOVIE!
