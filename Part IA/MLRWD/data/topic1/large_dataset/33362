Undeniably, one of the finest horror and werewolf movies ever made! The unbelievable thing is, it's 30 years old and yet Hollywood hasn't released one single werewolf movie that could challenge this great flick. There have been some fine efforts. The Howling, Dog Soldiers, and I know I'll catch grief for this one, but Bad Moon! (Yes, I like this one) But they are far behind when it comes to the classic An American Werewolf in London. I already owned the dvd of AAWIL, but with Blu-ray coming out and hitting more titles all the time, I just had to get the Blu-ray treatment of this fantastic film. I'm a special features buff and this one has some really good ones. I watched the entire movie, plus all of the special featurettes in one sitting.

The best of the bunch was the incredible "Beware the Moon" where Landis speaks about all of the negative press that the film received and how difficult it was to shoot the climax in Piccadilly Circus (considered the Times Square of London) in London's West End district. This documentary had some really great stuff here. And having learned my lesson from purchasing other older movies that received the Blu-ray treatment, my expectations were kept minimal as to how it would look. But the transfer was unexpectedly sharp! The audio was exceptional and I found this purchase a great bargain! I can watch American Werewolf in London multiple times. And David's transformation into the werewolf the first time is one of the finest transformations in cinema history without the help of computers.

This fine disc is worth the purchase. Go back to the Slaughtered Lamb and watch this again!
