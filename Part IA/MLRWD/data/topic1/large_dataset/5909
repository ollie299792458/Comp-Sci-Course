Seamlessly unraveling on multiple levels, On the Waterfront has the period splendor of New York harbor culture, strong performances and a tightly woven suspense story. There are many memorable scenes including the famous "I could have been a contenda" speech and a powerful portrayal of a worker strike. On the Waterfront seems to have a frank message in the uplifting power of friendship, belief in the common man and conscience. Religious sentiments are echoed by a preacher in the film who seeks to stir up dock workers to testify against a murderous mob leader. Marlon Brando stars in the lead role as "Terry," a dock worker with mob ties, who begins to realize that there is more to his work and friendships than simply taking orders and keeping his mouth shut. His performance here goes deeper than in A Streetcar Named Desire. A gradual awakening to the choice he must make, along with the tender way he handles the other characters was really unexpected compared to the rugged machismo of his other roles. The symbolism with the doves and the hawks was not lost on me. The colloquial exchanges and careful depictions of day to day heroism still enlighten the social conditions over fifty years ago.
