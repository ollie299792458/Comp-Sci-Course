This box set of movies captures Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff at the height of their respective careers. Both are highlighted here in 5 different films that allow them to share the spotlight and explore some fairly meaty roles. Especially in the "The Black Cat" A particularly subtle yet brutal horror tale pitting Lugosi against Karloff in a twisted psychological battle of revenge, mysticism and devil worship. Very much ahead of it's time in both subject matter and brutality. The makeup, set design, mood and lighting are quite memorable.

All 5 movies though are quite enjoyable, and while tame compared to today's horror fare, they still explore some weighty subjects with an appropriate amount of abject horror and suspense.

It's fun to review some of the details of each of these movies, and pick out small little mistakes and missed edits. A particular example is seen in "The Invisible Ray" watch closely as Walter Kingsford as he plays a murdered Sir Francis Stevens. He is lying on the bed as Lugosi shines a bright light into his face to snap a couple of photos. After Lugosi turns off the bright light, Kigsford obviously blinks his eyes, even though he's supposed to already be dead. pretty funny, and the first time I watched the movie, I could hardly believe the obvious mistake.

At any rate, all 5 movies are entertaining, well written, and provided both Lugosi and Karloff with vehicles with which to display their talent.

Highly recommended for any classic horror buffs.
