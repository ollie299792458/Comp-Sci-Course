You will not go hungry from watching this film. As you can read from the other customer reviews, there is something clever happening in every frame. It comes together in such a tidy, cohesive masterful package. Here is one  small example: throughout the film, the humans are used as a metaphor for  insects. That shows up in a multitude of ways. The costumes worn by Patty  Kensit (fabulous!), the feeding and caring of the matriarch (the queen),  the ugly dronish behavior of the son, the "house" making  decisions (as in how worker bees in a hive make big decisions such as  hatching a new queen, killing off a queen, swarming and the like), the  lectures from the patriarch on how morality used to be a black and white  issue (insect-like) and now is very gray due to scientific research,. etc.  etc. 
The cast was first rate. They deliver their lines in that way that  classicly trained actors do.
Something that was not mentioned in the  other reviews was the feel of this movie. There was a creepy undercurrent.  This was manifested in the background music, the sets and scenes dwarfing  the actors, and the sometimes stony (yet effective) way the actors moved  about. I was reminded of Peter Greenaway's typical movie enviroment.
