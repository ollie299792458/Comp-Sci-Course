Synopsis:

"Baron von Frankenstein (Boris Karloff) invites his allied monsters to his island lab, to announce his retirement and to appoint his successor, who will inherit his new, secret, destructive formula. They all show up. Only the Baron's shapely assistant Francesca (Gale Garnett) knows that mild-mannered soda jerk Felix Flankin will be the new leader of the Worldwide Organization of Monsters, and she conspires with Dracula to take him out of the picture, against opposition from The Bride of Frankenstein. But Felix and Francesca fall in love, just as the monsters close in on both of them, and King Kong appears from the haunted lagoon ..." by Glenn Erickson
