In most stories that deal with vampirism,we are usually bombarded by familiar trappings that work against us experiencing true dread. Why watch a film where it is is easy to pigeonhole the "plot" of the story,  and fall into conclusions that have been overdone since Bela Lugosi was  staked as "Dracula" in the 30's? "The Hunger", which  was directed by Tony Scott, is a far cry from the usual vampire tale. First  of all is the photography, which is beautiful in a true classical sense.  The musical score is also  attractive, mixing haunting  "classical" pieces with a brooding synth score. Add to that a  cast of international actors, and a story that is original and very bold,  and you have a film that demands attention, and repeated viewings.  "The Hunger" is disturbing, and paced a bit too liesurly for the  typical filmgoer. But, It is brave in it's mix of brutality with beauty,  and certainly worth the admiration it has recieved from filmakers and  filmgoers over the years. Buy the Letterboxed edition, and enjoy...  ((spoiler)) (one final note...I found it disturbing that many folks only  know this director from his film "Top Gun". It is a shame.For he  has created a work of art. Also, how is it that people seem more disturbed  by the brief but beatifully shot Love scene with Deneuve and Surandon, and  not with the graphic killing of a very young girl that happens midway in  the picture? One can only wonder...)
