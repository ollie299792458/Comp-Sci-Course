The other reviews contained here seem to divide into preferring Burton's original "Batman" vs the new "Batman Begins".  I have some thoughts on this.

First, let me say I much prefer Burton's film.  I find it's baroque theatricality far more interesting and entertaining than "Begins" attempt to shoehorn Bruce Wayne/Batman into something like the real world.  It always seemed to me the approach on "Batman" was to ask "what kind of world could have created these people?".  "Begins" approach is to ask "what would these people be like in the real world?".  I suspect that the "Begins" franchise may run into significant problems as it tries to reconcile some of Batman's more exotic villains into that reality.

Despite having no super powers, Batman is a mythic character.  He doesn't belong in everyday reality.  None of Burton's films are set in reality.  Like myths and fairy-tales, they exist in a parallel reality that informs our own.

The last point I'll include here is the CHARACTER of Batman himself (not the actors or their performances: they're both excellent).
By the end of "Begins" he has pretty much overcome his childhood traumas (bats & loss of parents) and the decision to become/remain Batman is a conscious, rational choice.  (What a swell guy.)
That's OK, but not nearly as interesting as what they did in "Batman". In Burton's films he is almost like a drug addict.  There is no altruism here.  He MUST be Batman to deal with his inner demons.  Repression creates perversion and 'Batman' is what has oozed out of the cracks in Bruce Wayne's psyche.  Anyone who has to create as elaborate a coping mechanism as Batman must be really screwed up.  Wayne must be Batman or go mad.  Perhaps he has done both.  Burton's version of Batman may be less "real" but it is far more human.

Oh, yeah.  Also- Danny Elfman's score rocks and the Batmobile in "Begins" sucks!
