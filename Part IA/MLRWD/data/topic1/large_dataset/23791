Bill and Ted, how do I love thee, let me count the ways.

1.  You radically traveled through time in an amusing way that taught many a stoner about history.
2.  You show us mid-westerners the love that is Circle K.
3.  Every time a fan walks by a phone booth they try to dial their way to a different time.
4.  Your philosophy is the future of human civilization.

Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure was a movie that epitomizes the 80's.  It was another movie that again I didn't manage to see in the theaters, but saw it on VHS the first time when it was still a new release.  It's a fun romp that fits in the traditional stoner comedy vein, yet ironically doesn't show them doing any drugs.  It seems they are just burn-outs.  The plot line is they have to pass a history exam otherwise Ted (Keanu Reeves) has to go off to the military academy.  In order to save the human race and keep them excellent, time travelers from the future come back and leave the boys a time machine to work on their history project.  Hilarity then ensues.

Be excellent to one another.
