I ordered "Big Miracle" (BD combo Disc) and it was so fun to watch.  I remember the actual event and it was heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.  It was nice to see it played out once again.  My whole family watched this with me.  This is a wonderful movie about three whales trapped in ice and their story of how they survived with the help of so many different people.
Drew Barrymore is truly amazing in this movie,she evokes so many different emotions from her audience. John Krasinski plays the role of the original journalist that discovered to Whales plight. He really believes that he is ambitious until he meets Kristen Bells Character. The beautiful, Kristen Bell does another great job of playing a Narcissistic journalist who seems to learn how to be a bit more human. Ted Danson is wonderful, as a greedy oil baron, who also has a heart.  He just needs a nudge from his wife,(Kathy Baker) every once in a while to remember that heart. Dermot Mulroney plays the surly National Guard Pilot very well.
This is a movie worth adding to your collection.
