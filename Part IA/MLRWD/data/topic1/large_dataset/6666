I read mixed reviews on this one and decided to give it a shot. Long story short, I bought it after seeing it.

I knew the story about what had happened in 1999 ahead of time and decided to see it put on the big screen. I loved this movie! I really felt for the kid at the end of the movie. The director really made you like him and you find yourself hoping that they let the kid go but knowing the true story it makes you queasy knowing what lies ahead for the poor kid. If you had no idea about the true story you would think Timberlake would of let the kid go at the end and then the good ole happy ending comes true.............nope!

Speakings of Justin Timberlake, I can't stand his music (makes me puke) but his acting skills are incredible! I saw him in Edison Force with Morgan Freeman and I was impressed with him then. With all these 1 dimensional actors like Tom Cruise, Owen Wilson, Keanu Reeves, and Nic Cage , I'd actually rather watch J.T. to be honest with ya.

Awesome movie, I bought it, and will watch it again and again.
