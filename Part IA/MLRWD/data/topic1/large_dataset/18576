Aight, let me break it down. I went to the mall on Friday with a bunch of friends to see Swimfan, and completely loved it. It was so awesome! There's a major Hot scene in the pool within the first 5 minutes of the movie, which was probably the second best scene in the whole thing. It's about some psycho chick who moves to New Jersey, completely falls in love with this swimmer at her school(for a good reason which you'll find out about in the end of the movie), and stops at NOTHING to get what she wants. She's crafty and bitchy while still remaining sexy and sweet, which is a real turn on and adds a ton of interest to the movie. Basically, she turns everything the swimmer has aginst him until, finally, he finds out the truth behind her unseen past.... which leads to a major climax, and just when you think the whole thing's over, it gets even better! Excitment will run through your veins while watchin' this action/adventure thriller, so make sure you don't have too much to drink while watchin' it. I rate it #2 on my list of favorite movies. Rent it, check it out, see it in theatres, whatever. I'm buyin' it as soon as it comes out on DVD...Thanx.
