I was searching Netflix for a feel good movie that was highly rated. When I ran across The Mighty Macs ... boy ... was I a happy camper.

There's lots of good news here. First, if you have Netflix, it's free. If not, pay whatever it costs to rent. Maybe even consider buying it because you will want to watch it again and again.

I am very picky when it comes to movies. If they aren't 4 stars, they better be pretty close or else I don't want to watch it. Mighty Macs is a movie that you alone or with family will love. To make it even better, it is based on a true story.

Mighty Macs is Hoosiers for girls. It's a true story of how a born-to-be basketball coach, finds a desperate girls school in need of everything, and pulls up everyone's bootstraps to victory. The movie is filled with inspiration, excitement, drama and love.

I don't want to bore with yet another review that goes into great detail about the plot and characters. Others have done it here, probably better than me. All I want to convey is that is a MUST-SEE MOVIE that will leave you feeling good after it's long over. Don't miss it. See it today!
