When I first watched this movie I thought it looked absolutely ridiculous. But I figured, since I watched it from the middle, if I watched it from the beginning, I would understand the story better, no such luck. The problem, I finally concluded, was that the story was just terrible. Dana Carvey tries and fails to construct a plot, with the main character disguising, as stated by the title, to get information on who kidnapped his father. The problem, all his disguises are completely absurd and have no impact whatsoever on the story. In fact, all his disguises do is get him into trouble. Trying to construct a chase scene resulted in a nonsensical chase between the main protaganist and the antagonists henchmen. first they chase the protaganist disguised as a disruptive partygoer and then suddenly they realize what he really looks like without actually seeing his face. The plot was very simple and it seemed like carvey was trying to sqeeuze in the disguising just to justify the title. The power the Disguises had, called energico was very terribly explained and the ending with it, the dark side, please! in fact the story makes practically no sense, is so stereotypical, and has anything short of stimulating. That in fact, is what makes it funny. The jokes and puns are so painfully bad it's hilarious. The story might not make an iota of sense but I realized I didn't mind it one bit. Dana Carvey might be a terrible writer, but one thing can be said about him: he's a comedian. The story may suck, but boy is it funny!!! Not enough to justify a sequel but a great stand alone movie!
