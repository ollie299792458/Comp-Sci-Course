The 1935 "Mutiny on the Bounty" is dramatically powerful with Laughton turning in one of his greatest performances. It is infinitely superior to the dragged-out Brando version many years later which has little to recommend it other than a fine supporting cast, a splendid musical score, and on-location footage of Pitcairn's Island. It is not fair to compare either version with "The Bounty" because the latter is not based on the extremely flawed Nordhoff-Hall trilogy that the two "Mutiny" films are. The Mel Gibson-Anthony Hopkins film is the only one of the three to hew closely to the historical facts. Some ill-informed reviewer on this page claims Laughton's Bligh is close to the actual man. This is slanderously untrue. Bligh had his share of faults, there is no doubt of that, but he was actually one of the best captains of that era. His journey in the longboat is pure heroism, and those who complain he had a few men flogged during the voyage do not realize that the average British captain of that time typically had HUNDREDS flogged; if anything Bligh was not enough of a disciplinarian, considering how it all turned out. The beauty of "The Bounty" is that it ends with his acquittal from his court martial. It's time to stop demonizing this flawed, but essentially competent naval officer.
