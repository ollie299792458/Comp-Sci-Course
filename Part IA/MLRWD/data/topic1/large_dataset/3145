Being a Cecil Beaton [My Fair Lady's costume designer] fan, I watched this to see the costumes and the settings, thinking that was going to be the best thing about the film. Turns out I was very wrong! A delightful story and wonderful songs, Lerner and Lowe truly did create another 'My Fair Lady'. 
Leslie Caron as the diamond-in-the-rough Gigi was excellent! I myself am a teenager and I thought she was very convincing as a young girl. She had the charm and vitality that a young girl has even though she was much older! Louis Jourdan plays the constantly bored and snobbish playboy perfectly. The films title song won an Oscar and Jourdan sings and acts it very well. But my favourite in the film was Maurice Chevalier. All of his songs were the best! I cannot stop listening to "Thank Heaven for Little Girls"! It's such an adorable song. Chevalier is the driving force in the film, although his character is somewhat secondary. This film stayed true to Colette in a sense that the main three actors I mention above are actually French! 
The costumes are brillaint, as always, by Beaton. I find them somewhat even more charming than My Fair Lady's. The Ascot dress in My Fair Lady has become so recogniseable as an image, it is no longer 'breath-taking' when Audrey Hepburn enters the scene. In GIG however, when Leslie Caron enters the scene in her white gown with black accents on the shoulders it is breath-taking! Her transformation from giggly young girl to enchanting woman is amazing. 
The magnetism about this film is the charcter of Gigi. She captures Gaston's heart as well as everyone's! This is a wonderfully painted picture of turn-of-the-centruy Paris with an even more beautiful story. Oh, and one really shouldn't compare this to MFL so much because GIGI stands in a class of it's own.
