There are 5 work outs in this video that you can play separately like chapters: abs, lower, upper, full, and flexibility.

About the difficulty level: I'm in reasonable shape. I've go on and off of light morning exercise routines, and I tend to be generally active (biking to work, morning walks, yoga classes ect.) but I'm not a fitness buff. I've done a little bit of pilates before. I just did 4 out of the 5 workouts (I didn't do upper body). I found all of the exercises except one (were you go up into a shoulder stand with the ball between your legs, using only your abs no arms) doable. The one I couldn't do I adjusted. I thought the level was pretty reasonable for someone who is in decent shape (not too difficult or too easy). I don't think this is an intermediate level video.

I liked the breath guide, but it could have been louder. Sometimes I wasn't sure how I was supposed to breath. The music was really quiet, and the tone was pretty low key. The pace is good. I found the breathing, and the reps matched well when I figured out what she was doing.

The timing in the flexibility was too fast. The stretches were done at a similar rate to the exercise reps. I don't think this is very effective. I had to do them at my own pace. However the choices of stretches was good.

Overall a good workout. I prefer a more up beat instructor.

Does anyone know of a similar video I could get with a really up beat peppy (even cheerleaderish) instructor? I had a video like this that I lost (but really liked). It seems like this isn't as popular these days. Maybe there is a used dvd from the 80s or 90s that someone could recommend.

thanks.
