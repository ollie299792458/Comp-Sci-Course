Not only is this movie one of the greatest 'Baseball' movies, it is also a terrific movie for even those who are not sports fans. The main character in this movie, Ray, is a farmer who has never really done anything risky in his adult life. When this changes and he takes a leap of faith of sorts, the people in his town look at him with ridicule, but for the first time in his life, he feels he is involved in something truly meaningful. As he makes this 'journey', he encounters people who not only help him reflect upon the history of Baseball, but also the importance of family and having good values and beliefs. Ray also reflects on his troubled relationship with his now deceased father. At it's heart, this movie is about the power of reconciliation in relationships. Also, about how 'miracles' can happen when you set out to do something you firmly believe in. The acting is phenomenal and is at times dramatic and at times humorous. The three things listed in my title, to me, combine to form the greatest combination of things on this Earth and this movie has each of those things in abundance.
