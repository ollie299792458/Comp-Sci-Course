What a surprise and what a pleasure.  I was persuaded to watch this film, and did so reluctantly.  I thought it would be boring and maudlin.  The story line seemed unappealing.

I am so very happy to say I was totally and completely wrong.

Unlike earlier reviewers, I did not find the story thin or questionable. I found it very human, poignant and touching.  Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are, as always, superb, and a joy to watch working together.

The entire cast was excellent.  Other reviewers have gone into the plot quite thoroughly, so perhaps better not to reiterate those details.

I can only say that I was delighted and enchanted.  If you are weary of slick, predictable formula films, too many super heroes, too much hideous violence and ugliness, and an overabundance of special effects, then perhaps you too will be charmed.  Only the British can do something of this nature successfully.

This film is also visually beautiful. It takes place in Cornwall, one of the most magical places on the face of this earth.

Bravo Charles Dance.  This film is a real treasure.  I, for one, anticipate watching this

many times over.
