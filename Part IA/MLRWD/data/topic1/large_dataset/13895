Usually I am not the type who likes dark, indeterminate, artsy movies -- I prefer to be entertained by a good story, quality comedy or satire. Had I read these reviews, I probably would have not chosen to view this film. However, not knowing what to expect, I found this one very engaging, gripping and more than a bit haunting. Increasingly repulsive, yet fascinating on a number of levels. There is less plot than in the visually-stunning "The Talented Mr. Ripley" or beautiful muscial "Sweeney Todd," (both highly recommended), but this similarly takes you deeper into the twisted psyche of a monstrous human being -- in this case, a repressed middle-aged, French classical piano teacher. Powerful images stayed with me long after viewing. It's a well-crafted, superbly-acted film on a very difficult, abstract subject. Highly recommended if you like looking into the darker layers of humanity, society and sexuality, without Hollywood's mandatory PC crap or in-your-face politicizing. The French may be pains-in-the butt in terms of international relations, but boy can they paint a twisted celluloid portrait. Excellent, but not a first-date movie!
