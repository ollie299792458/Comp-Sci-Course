George Orwell's Animal Farm has been looked upon as one of the best novels in the 20th century.  Through talking animals, the storyline cleverly introduces Orwell's bitterness towards communism under Stalin's rule.  The entire setting takes place on a European pasture accompanied with the talking farm animals and very few humans.  Due to modern technological advances in movie production, the realism of the farm animals was greatly affected.

 Director John Stephenson makes it very clear that all of the animals are mistreated and neglected by their alcoholic owner, Mr. Jones.  Since the animals were not cared for by their owner, they decided to start a revolution that would set themselves free from all human rule.  The animals rallied and soon were in complete self control and free from any higher power.  Shortly after the breakaway, there is a "government" issue in their animalism rule; the appointed leader, Snowball, is overtaken by Napoleon (Stalin).  Napoleon only cares about one thing during his communist rule, and that is being completely in control of everyone.  He violates all of the new animal rights by being cold hearted, ruthless,  and very human like in his attempts to become very powerful.  Snowball on the other hand is the reason behind all of Napoleons failures and mishaps.  He is also the main reason why the animal farm fails miserably in the end.

 By clearly expressing all of the animals emotions during the chain of events, Director John Stephenson does a great job of being very parallel with Orwell's novel.  The different intelligence levels are also depicted very well, from the quick-witted pigs all the way down to the dense but extremely strong horses and other large farm animals.  The movie is much easier to understand than the novel and it is also a great way to clarify any confusion one might have after reading the novel.
