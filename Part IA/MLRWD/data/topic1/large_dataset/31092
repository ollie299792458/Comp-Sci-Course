The subject of Deep Throat should be perfect documentary material. Above and beyond the sexual angle, there's a story here about the cultural wars in America that were and still are tearing that country apart. Yet Inside Deep Throat is such a poorly made documentary that only the vaguest hints of any of this shine through. Instead we are treated with stale cliches about how Deep Throat practically invented oral sex and gee-aren't-Americans-ignorant-in-their sexual-repression type soundbites. Stylistically, it's yet another pretentious modern outing with meaningless images appearing throughout in soft focus in a quasi-MTV style which I found thoroughly distracting and totally out of touch with the era it was supposed to be portraying.

To see a succesful modern take on where America was at politically and spiritually in the 60's/70's, I'd recommend a documentary called The Weather Underground instead. It is about the revolutionary Weathermen organisation and it's a film that really places you in that time and gives an ultra-realistic idea of what it must have been like to have been there, the mark of a true period documentary. None of this is present in Inside Deep Throat which is bland, pedestrian and ultimately predictable and utterly lacking in imagination.
