Very impressive remake.  Bravo Mr. Campiotti and production crew! I was more than skeptical about his new version of Doctor Zhivago, a remake of David Lean's Classic?  But then why not!  And thank goodness! Hans Matheson and Keira Knightly add new demensions to the characters of Zhivago and Lara.  I liked Lara much better this time around than in Lean's film and have a much better understanding of her motivation, who she is, and why Zhivago would venture into a love affair with her.  Poor Tonya! In many ways I prefer this small screen version to Lean's great epic.  My only complaint...and not much of that...is the score's musical cues...which remind this is a tv production.  I had to keep reminding myself this version was written and shot for the tv screen as opposed to a theater. But there are some lovely musical themes.  The interviews in special features with the director, writer, producer, and actors is well worth viewing.  I am going to make a concentrated effort as result to read the book.  What is extraodinary about this story is Zhivago's ability to find beauty in life, and love, in a particualry ugly time in history,a time of great suffering. To have awareness you are alive in your own liftetime, that life is both remarkable and wonderful! Zhivago's sensitivity comes across but was always aloof in David Lean's version.  Sam Neill is a great Kamarvosky.  What a delicious role!  The sex scenes are filmed with taste and are in no way sensationalized. I give this version 5 stars.  It was a difficult task bringing this concept to reality having Lean's version hanging over the production.
