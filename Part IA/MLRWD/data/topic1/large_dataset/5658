Let me start by saying that I hate cardio. But I recently broke my wrist so yoga, strength training and kickboxing are, for now, not options. The thought of doing walking workouts every day creates, for me at least, a serious dread factor. So, painted into the cardio corner, I ordered several dance workouts... and this DVD was the one that struck gold. I am terribly uncoordinated but have a passing knowledge of bellydance moves thanks to Kathy Smith's Flex Appeal. And although I still can't sidestep and umi (hip circles) at the same time, that didn't stop me from working up a moderate sweat and having a blast with this workout. Perhaps practice will one day make perfect, but the reason this DVD is a keeper is that it's just plain too much fun. Kili keeps the dance routine simple with only a few moves that are repeated and combined. She also adds in a little good old fashioned cardio like pony hops to help increase your heart rate.

Tahitian Cardio is the type of workout you look forward to, and I'm also looking forward to trying out more of Kili's DVDs.
