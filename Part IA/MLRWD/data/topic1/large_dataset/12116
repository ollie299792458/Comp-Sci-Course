I know I'm dating myself, but I saw this movie in the movie theater when I was a young boy. Science fiction has always been a favorite of mine. If it involves a mad scientist, outer space, or big bugs, I'm in for it.

THEM! is a nuclear scare flick from the early 1950's. It is in black and white, and has a cast that should be familiar to afficianados of films in this time period. If you are looking for something with a deep social message, stay away from this one. No philosophical paradoxes, no serious messages (other than the old "You never know what an atom bomb will do." message), and nothing that requires you to think too long or too hard. It is a fun film, so order the pizza, put on the popcorn, and pop open a couple of your favorite beverages and get ready for a good old fashioned adventure movie. The production is quite good for it's time, and the post Korea War military hardware is impressive. It's one you can watch a number of times without getting bored.

Enjoy! It's THEM!!!
