I think most of the people who reviewed this movie mistook it being too short for bad directing. Maybe it's just because I love retarded people and appreciate Christina Ricci's acting, but I just think this movie is great. I also think I took it a lot more serious than most people did. Most people broke it down to the simplicity of a love story between clashing stereotypes, but I think it was really about Carolyn realizing that the world isn't fair, and at the same time what it was to be in love. She found that in her almost segregated world, sometimes the simplest people are the only ones worth talking to. As far as Carolyn being ignorant, I understand why you would think that, but I would call it more along the lines of unprejudiced and blonde.

Back to why people didn't like it, the plot progression was choppy, but that was only because they didn't have enough time. if this movie were an hour longer, I predict I would have cried several times, especially the time I watched it stoned. It made me feel feelings like 'Boys Don't Cry' and 'White Oleander' and I like it when movies do that.

mmm...so overall, excellent cast, excellent soundtrack, excellent story. If you like retarded people and Christina Ricci, watch Pumpkin.
