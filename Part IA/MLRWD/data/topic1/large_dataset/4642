The only explanation I can think of for The House of Flying Daggers is that the scriptwriter died halfway through the story, and the second half was written by someone with a completely different vision.

The movie begins as a tale of intrigue and romantic comedy, with much on the line for the the Tang government and the rebelling Flying Daggers.  After the series of twists, it becomes a melodramatic story about a love triangle - the coming battle all but forgotten.

Neither characters nor director appear to care about the causes they put so much effort into earlier in the movie.  The three warriors ignore their duty and their honor in favor of their own self interest.  It's bad enough when American movies give the same message - imagine what the Chinese would think.

It is a gorgeous movie.  Also less obvious wire fu, which makes the fantastic martial arts look more believable.  But the plot and character developement were a huge disappointment.  It could have been so much better, if they had stuck with the intrigue, instead of the melodrama.
