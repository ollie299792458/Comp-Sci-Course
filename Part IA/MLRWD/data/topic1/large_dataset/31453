This film continues on with a lackluster attention to image quality that I found almost unwatchable. I actually avoided seeing this in the theater (Even though I wanted to) for this very reason. I was warned by a fellow film maker, who was excited to see this as well, just how bad much of this film looks. I have a lot of respect for Michael Mann. However, I recent films he seems to have decided that scenes don't need to be lit or the correct color balance to be acceptable. Sometimes I can see this being valid. But, not in this film. In one scene, a face will look as though they are suffering with jaundice, and then the very next scene normal again. If I wanted to see a film where the image is dark or inappropriately discolored I can go to Youtube. I'm pretty sure that they had the budget for both a light meter and a color meter. Or someone on set that could at least say " Hey this is tungsten, or this is daylight" or "Shouldn't we check our exposure?". You went to the effort to film in the accurate locations only to see every thing too dark or in a muddled greenish yellow hue that ruined it. You could have had a great film here, but instead it left me angry over what could have been. Also, for the first 20 minute or so I had to keep rewinding the film to try and understand what was being said. Two words here, and a couple there, all so clouded by additional sound mix that I never could make the words out.
