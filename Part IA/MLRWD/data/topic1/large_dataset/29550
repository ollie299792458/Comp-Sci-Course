Tekken Is a very popular video game franchise. It's had an animated film in the past which has been voted one of the worst animes of all time by animenewsnetwork.com, but of course if your a fan of Tekken you'll want to watch it. Same goes with this movie. I've been playing Tekken since I was two years old, so of course I'm going to get my hands on anything I can find that's Tekken. I know the Tekken story line inside and out and of course like most games turned into movies they ruined it! Heihachi is a good guy, Christie is white and plays Jin's love interest instead of Ling, There is a sex scene with Nina and Anna, Oh the list goes on!! Then the only fighting style the got right was Edy's! -__- the plus side is the costumes were great, the actors looked pretty much like the characters in the game. Overall I wouldn't watch it again, but to those who are Tekken fans I say at least see this once, rent it 1st! Good news is we get Tekken Blood Vengeance in July and it will make up for the bad movies we've had in the past :]
