Do these filmmakers want to make a movie about a real life serial killer or don't they? Why make a movie like GACY or DAHMER if you don't understand--or fear to really touch--the subject matter you're getting yourself involved with? This film was a tremendous disappointment for me because it bears little resemblance to the actual serial killer. You can tell that its creators didn't have their heart in it, so to speak. I think they were simply throwing something together solely for commercial gain, that's obvious. Commercial gain is fine but there must be a balance. What we see in GACY is a clumsy, sissified, and utterly moronic version of John Wayne Gacy. It seems in the movie that everyone Gacy comes across is harshly insulting him in some way or trying to beat him up! In reality, those may've been very small tidbits within the killer's life, but it wasn't the big picture. Anyone even peripherally aware of the case knows how respected Gacy was within his community. He was not an incompetent imbecile, as he was more or less portrayed in this film. He only PLAYED a clown, he wasn't ACTUALLY a clown! In my opinion, it's just obnoxious to see how this material was treated. An example of a fairly recent true-life serial killer movie that works (for me, at least), something with blood in its veins, is TED BUNDY. As for GACY, the makers missed their target by miles. Maybe someone else will get it right. Though, I won't be holding my breath.
