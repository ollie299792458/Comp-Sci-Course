"The Legend of Hell House" is one of the best and most intelligent ghost stories ever put on film. The film begins with an ominous scene featuring a dying skeptic who wants to make sure that there is life after death by sending a team of parapsychologists and psychics to an infamous haunted house to see whether the place is really beset by apparitions and spirits. From then on the film never lets go, with a hypnotic, eerie and extremely unnerving atmosphere, mesmerising dialogue about the house's history and parapsychological theories as well a prevelant sense of evil that casts its shadow over the story to a marvellous effect, while the films also ends with an amazing climax. Fans of Roddy McDowell will also see the fine actor in an atypical role which may be the underrated actor's best performance aside from the "Fright Night" films. As for the DVD, it is devoid of extras except for the trailer, but the anamorphic picture is crisp and shows director John Hough's accomplished, haunting compositions in a pristine manner.
