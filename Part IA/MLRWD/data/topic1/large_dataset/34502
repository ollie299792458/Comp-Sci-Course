First, there are several complaints about "pre-reviews" before this has come out ... but the transfer technology & choice is an important component in making your buying decision ... if they were offering a COLORIZED CASABLANCA, you don't need to see the DVD before making your opinion known. You might not agree with the pre-release opinion but it is legitimate ... in this case, here is a man who's know for wanting movies to be technically projected perfectedly and even sending teams to calibrate and certify theater speakers & placement but in this case is willing to put his name on a laserdisc transfer?

This is not a Roger Corman film release where if the reels are in order, that's "good enough," this is George Lucas who wants theaters to convert to digital but yet is willing to base a new release from a compressed digital print?

The official word is that this is "fun' and "free" as a bonus so we shouldn't expect anything more - but if you think about, wasn't EVERY SCRAP of Star Wars footage digitalized and CLEANED UP for the SE releases back in 1997 and on? So, the footage is already there digitized and cleaned - the SE containing NEW scenes but instead of basically just going back to SAVE AS version #1 ... he decides that it's better to avoid that truth and just buy some laserdiscs off eBay and hit RECORD in IMOVIE.*

so, really, this is a slap in the face ... because George isn't just saying that we're not worth the effort but that we are morons to love the original ... that it's so unworthy of his efforts, we should be glad to get any version?

Sad.
