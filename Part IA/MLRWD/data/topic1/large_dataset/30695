I do have qualms with the storyline of this film. Tiana was already a hard-working, well-rounded character with her head in the right place and a focus perfectly acceptable for her time and even moreso in our time. Yet she, according to her friends, her mother, and the wise ol' witch in the Bayou, had to stop reaching for her dream just to dally in the matters of love?? There's plenty of time for that afterward, not before, and anyone with an ounce of sense on the subject will know that when it comes to a career, love simply has to fall on the back-burner, at least for a little while. And of all the people for such a strong, driven woman fall in love with, why did it have to be such a selfish, pennyless, egotistical character like Naveen? He has nothing to offer her, lied to her, could not even protect her, and enjoys flirting with other women. Of course he'd fall in love with HER, she has everything to offer him. But her, for him? Doesn't make sense, Disney. Just doesn't make sense...

In lieu of that, this movie is excellent. I am a big fan of 2D animation, and The Princess and the Frog was a welcome sight after years of stagnancy in the pool of this apparently long-lost art. The animation itself is spot on, and I am a big fan of frogs myself. The musical numbers in this movie were also quite excellent, and I was delighted during the Friends on the Other Side scene with all the brilliant voodoo color and feel. Also, the Evangeline song scene was beautiful and enchanting, and held up splendidly to all the other classic Disney love scenes.

Definitely worth the watch, worth the buy, and worth promoting!
