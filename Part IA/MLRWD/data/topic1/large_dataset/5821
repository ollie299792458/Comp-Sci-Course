I saw the remake with John Travolta first and enjoyed it immensely. So then I decided to check out the original.

Off the top of my head, my first remark is that this is a good movie. Take into account the time it was shot and the technology afforded in those days, and you have a very suspenseful and chilling account of domestic terrorism. The bad guy played Cpt. Quint in JAWS so you know he can be scary! Walter Matthau played his role perfectly and I saw absolutely NONE of his other characters in this one. I guess I've only seen him play grumpy old men...but he was really believable in this movie as the Lt of the Transit Police.

I was amazed at how closely the remake followed this original. It made it seem familiar to me, and I did not miss all of the computerized technology (that I loved in the Travolta version). It was cool to see how they ran the subways back then!

Lastly, the subway system was full of employees who swear a lot. This is understandable, actually, but I naively thought there'd be less F-words because it was made in the 70s, but I was wrong. Oh well -- the language was appropriate for the situations!

Enjoy the movie!
