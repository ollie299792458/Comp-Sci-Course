I don't own this DVD but I did go last night and see this in the theatre and OH MY ...! I mean I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  I am a huge fan of Margaret Cho from her stand up to her "I'm the one I want" now to this.  My only problem with her in the past is that she has a tendancy to use material from her old shows but even that isn't a bad thing because she is so funny and there is no such thing as to much Margaret.  I was very surprised, a lot of new material in this show and her parents are interviewed which only makes it funnier.  I hope she comes out with a million more shows and I will own them all for when times get tough and things don't look to good in your own life, you can easily be brought to tears by laughter by the genius of comedy that is Margaret Cho.  She is as real as they come and her directness is admired.  I think one thing that makes her so funny is a lot of what she talks about is very relatable to everyone in their every day life.  She talks about occurences that everyone has gone through at least once and she says things that maybe you thought but never said yourself.  I applaud her and this paticular show is phenomenal.  She can do no wrong in my eyes and if you buy this I can only promise that your face will hurt with laughter and for the duration of the show you'll forget all your problems and step into the world of Margaret which is a rollercoaster of belly hurting, can't breath, teary eyed, bellow of laughter.  This will be one of the best purchases I'll have made all year.
