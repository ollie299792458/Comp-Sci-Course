... Just truth.

Based on a true story, The Stoning of Soraya M is a raw movie and a rude awakening to the injustices of an immoral patriarchal society, where men have complete authority over women and children, yet do not hold themselves accountable to their own belief system. A close look will reveal that the whole of that society is victimized when lies, deception and extremities are practiced.

I first saw this movie as a member of our Corporate Diversity Council, consisting of professional men and women of varying ethnic and religious backgrounds. Three persons from Iran, Turkey, and India thanked us for making this evening possible.

The story line is very well developed and easy to follow. Kudos to Academy Award Nominee Shorheh Aghdashloo (Zahra) and Mozhan Marn&ograve; (Soraya) - Their portrayals deserve a standing ovation.

The final part of the movie, portraying the actual stoning, was brutal and shocking and not for the squeamish. Some people actually got up and left - The woman seated next to me screamed after the second stone was tossed and ran out, leaving her coat behind. Some of my co-workers (men and women) had tears in their eyes. We all stayed and watched until the end. Why? Because it was unbelievable... and because we all concluded that we could not stifle Soraya's voice by walking out of that theater.

I have purchased this movie to share it with my family and to give voice to every woman who has been silenced.
