I watched The Ring with two of my friends. By the end of the first scene, my friends (college guys) were holding each other. And I was genuinely creeped out, which was a first for me. In fact, I went home that night and spent the hours until sunrise researching Ringu. Every review I read said it was scarier than The Ring. Now, considering that I was reading this at 4 AM because The Ring convinced me that closing my eyes meant certain death, scarier than that seemed pretty durn scary. So we watched Ringu. I fell asleep halfway through. 
Here's the problem: Ringu might be great for a Japanese audience that's never seen it before, but for an English speaker that's already seen The Ring, Ringu couldn't compare. 
* The Ring captured all the creepiness of Ringu but with some great effects to drive it home. I mean, the *title menu* on The Ring DVD freaked me out. And the hidden feature is probably the best use of DVD technology to date
* Setting the mood for a scary movie is hard enough when the audience and the creators speak the same language.Adding the extra layer of translation and the fact that your eyes are always constanly glued to the subtitles at the bottom of the screen really kept me out of the movie. For that matter, the American cursed video was much weirder than Japanese one. Maybe Japanese people are scared by guys with towels over their heads, but I don't think the average American is.
* The story is more involving in The Ring - you have to earn clues along with the characters. None of this "This guy is a psychic, just follow him." 
So in conclusion, anyone who tells you Ringu is better is leaning toward being an arthouse snob, the type that thinks that because a movie is made in a different country it is automatically better. Don't believe the hype. Ringu may have been the scariest movie ever made in Japan, but The Ring is the scariest movie ever made.
