Many folks seem to dismiss this animated masterpiece as simply a dated adolescent fantasy that isn't worth watching because it doesn't meet today's "high standards" of storytelling and computer animation.  (Like the Matrix trilogy or Lord of the Rings...I really think Keanu should of won that oscar...oh, nevermind)

I think that when you look at Fire and Ice in the light of the work that it represents and the audience that it was intended for, you would see that this film stands as one of the finest examples of animation in this genre.  The animation is hewn through the effort of human hands, at a FPs rate that is competitive with anything done in MAYA or Lightwave.  If you look at the true masterpieces of animation produced by studios such as Disney, WB, and H-B, you will find that nothing that has been produced in the past 20 years comes close to to fluidity and artistic beauty of Snow White, Merrie Melodies, or Fritz The Cat.  Fire and Ice was made during a period of exploration where Ralph Bakshi was attempting to use techniques that would expand the abilities of animators to reach beyond what had been done and create new avenues through which thier stories could be told.  If you don't like this film, then the chances are that you are "out of the loop" when it comes to animation and its place in society as art.  Or, perhaps, your fandom of the fantasy/scifi genre was never the target of this piece, and would be much better suited for something more passive like Moorcock or McCffery.  Maybe, someday, they'll make a cute little Elric movie or a "Wheel of Time" trilogy.
