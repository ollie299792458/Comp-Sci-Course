I have a beloved mentally retarded brother.  Not only do I love him but the whole town does!  I am sure the current leadership in Washington would rather that he were deleted though.  The first part of "The Ringer" makes you think that the producers have gone in with the Gods in Washington and are going after the handicapped.  After you stay with it, though, you get a really good idea about what life is like from these guys' perspective. This movie was a sleeper - no doubt.  If it was a different them, some gripping tale about two special needs males in love with each other or something along those lines, we would have heard about it in heartwarming tomes endlessly. This movie is a pure delight and makes you stop and think that the ones who Al Gore blithely refers to when picking on conservatives (remember "extra chromosome right wing") are people too! I'm glad that they did this because my brother and his brethren make this world a much better place with their pure happiness, positive outlook on life and friendliness toward the "extra chromosome challenged".  Go see it!  It is a hoot!
