My review makes sense only if you know the type of person I am:

Loud noises bother me, even though I'm a musician.  I'm not easily distracted by shiny objects.  Hot girls in movies do nothing for me, because they're not real---they're freaking pictures, for crying out loud.  Might as well go masturbate to a stick figure drawn in a cave 10000 years ago, for all the good it'll do you.

I'm a child of the 80s, so I grew up on GI Joe.  Still, one look at the cover, and I knew what this movie would be all about: loud explosions, jerky camera movement, and hot girls.

In that regard, this movie delivered in spades.

If you're like me, though, you won't like this movie at all.  The plot is stupid and the dialogue is very thin.  I mean, they might as well have just gotten some old GI Joe action figures and moved em around with their hands, having just 2 or 3 people saying all the dialogue.  At least this way, it would feel right: it's like this movie was written by a group of seven-year old children.

I don't remember much "canon" from the GI Joe cartoon, so it's not like I care about accuracy.  But I do remember a lot of humor from the cartoon, and that sense of humor is totally gone here.  Instead, you get BOOBS!  Oh wow, BOOBS!  I'm, like, a SIXTH GRADER!  And WOW, there's BOOBS!

Have fun.
