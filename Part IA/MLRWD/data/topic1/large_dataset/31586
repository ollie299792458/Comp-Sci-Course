I bought the dvd set when it was released because of of one thing...HE-MAN. I'm a die hard fan of HE-MAN & everything associated with it including SHE-RA. I had & still have all the action figures but not from this series cause it never aired in PUERTO RICO,but I'm getting them online step by step.
At the beginning of the series you see that HE-MAN reveals to his parents his secret identity which QUEEN MARLENA knew in the old series. Then you get to see that none of SKELETOR'S villains appeared but a new one named ANDROS. & probably this hypothesis might make sense,but in a SHE-RA episode BEAST-MAN & TRAP-JAW were captured & put away to jail in ETHERIA, though what happened to the rest of the villains? Plus the change of wardrobe on everybody including ADAM/HE-MAN & SKELETOR, both heading to the future to the defend the human race with THE POWER OF THE GOOD & THE WAY OF THE MAGIC. Even SORCERESS makes her appearances with a very different costume.
It was a complete derail story line from the old series that kinda begins slow but episode after episode it starts to get better specially when SKELETOR finally beats HE-MAN sending him to exile in the woods forming a rebellion against the MUTANTS, kinda & very SHE-RA like story. Skeletor is not a sore-puss like in the old series but a comedian. A huge change during the whole series but conniving as usual!!!!
All in all & to not bored you with details,the series is very good & entertaining to watch & the animation gets even better during the series. It still has the lesson after every episode,which keeps the old touch from the old series.
