I watched the Phantasm not with a dismissive mind, but with one expecting to enjoy this proclaimed 'horror' classic. But I didn't, in fact I fast forwarded through a lot of it, which is unusual for me, I can happily sit through campy gorefests like Zombie all night long.
 That got me thinking about exactly why this movie was popular at one point and how I couldnt like a movie that so many people obviously have fond memories of.
 Well it all boils down to this, the unpretentious nature of the film and the fact that the main character was a kid drew the late 70's generation teenage audience into the picture.
 It became their world.
 Fulci's Zombie and other horror movies wore their camp proudly, Phantasm's strength on release however was its low key setting, and its typical 70's suburbian environment.
 Now me as a twenty-something new viewer, the whole setting seemed rather stupid, the dialouge was poor and the 70's era everything seemed cheeseball. I didnt get pulled in and I cant imagine any new viewer getting pulled in, the plastic critters and bad costumes didnt help.  If this film was your first taste of terror then its probably worth buying it just to reclaim your teens, however if you've never seen it, don't feel like you have to bother adding it to your collection to have all the good horror films, stick with films that despite their age still feel vital and invite you in: Dawn of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc.
 On an upbeat note I did like the ball scene though.
