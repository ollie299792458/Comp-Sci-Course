we rented this video just recently,as i have taken a sudden interest in the unbelievable slice of history we call the third reich.the box of the cd boasted all the awards it's won,so we were dissapointed to find the whole thing done in videotape,which led me to think right away i wasnt going to see much of a movie,but perhaps a great documentary.but we sat and kept waiting for the real 'dirt"......some type of further insight into how a whole nation could be blinded and manipulated so well by a mere mortal man(perhaps subhuman being a better word)....one thing i learned......this is apparently,an intelligent woman,capable of landing an important government position,and what we get from her is a series of trivial remarks with a few little tidbits indicating perhaps she knows much more than she's willimg to discuss,so i learned what people will do for power,money and security.it's frightening to say the least,and as americans,we must realize we are not immune to having the wool pulled over our eyes for the lure of world power,plenty of oil,and a starbucks franchise in iraq.
as a documenatary....also not very good.poor editing and almost zero camera work.i am reminded of geraldo's thwarted attempt at making a tv show out of capone's vault.3 stars for getting this woman on tape,but it was a bore.
