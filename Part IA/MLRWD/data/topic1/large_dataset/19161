Started out sad (losing a kid is horrible and don't wish it on anyone.)  That said the rest of it went bacck and forth from looking like it would be good to "what in the world" to good, etc etc.  Aishas cop was annoying, basically feeling bad for the trash.  Makes you wish the Liberal lawmakers would watch this and see that the trash NEEDS to be off the street for good.  Anyway...I was hoping the ending would be happier, maybe it was, maybe he DIDN'T die?  Thought it was going to be a happy ending after he went and killed all the worthless kids.
  The people that whine about revenge films obviously either don't care about their loved ones very much and/or haven't ever been f****d by "people" before.
  Not a bad movie, MANY cheers came out of my mouth, but could have been better.  Less trying to make us feel for the scum.  I think it is a very realistic movie as in I dare you to find ANY man that has been put through even close to that that wouldn't love to do that or has even felt like doing that.
