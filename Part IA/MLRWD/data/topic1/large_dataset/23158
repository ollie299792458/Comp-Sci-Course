Beautiful. When the movie begins, the young lead character is a selfish, self-absorbed, lazy young man. He is looking for the quickest way to make money with the least effort...and like many of his peers, has an intense dislike for the refugee father and "son" who come to work with the company he is employed with. I mean, this fellow is just awful. He's so obnoxious, you keep waiting for him to do something appealing so you can stop wishing he'd fall off of the building.

And then he does. He finds out, by accident, that the "son" is really a young woman. And he is immediately drawn to her. Suddenly, instead of being the tormentor he is the protector, of her physically and of her secret.

When events transpire that lead him to search for her(well, I can't give EVERYTHING away, now can I?), we get to see the maturation process in action. Caring for someone other than himself gives him a strength and a resolve that even he did not know he had and brings him to an incredible sacrifice to help out her family.

Iranian films rarely have what we would traditionally call "happy endings". Those are rare and not sought after. But there are endings that aren't horrid, just sort of sad, in a good way. It's hard to explain, but this film supplies an excellent example. In Iran, princes don't rescue the princesses, they usually get mangled by the dragon, but it's never a dull ride(and in this case he doesn't actually get mangled...).
