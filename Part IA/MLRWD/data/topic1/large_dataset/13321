Sometimes a classic movie is too dated to hold up.  Fortunately that's not the case with Trading Places.  Exceedingly enjoyable all over again and it's refreshing to hear the lines as originally spoken (instead of coming from me, or one of my friends incessantly for the past 25 years; "I'm a karate man. I bruise on the inside.", "I'm a #@*%ing gorilla, ya clown!", etc.).

The extras are fun, too.  Most interesting was how uncomfortable Don Ameche was about doing his line when Randall falls ill on the floor of the commodities exchange (since his delivery is so outrageous).

The hardest part is deciding what the single best moment from the movie is:
- Dan Aykroyd eating salmon through a dirty Santa beard;
- Eddie Murphy looking straight at the camera after hearing the simplistic description of pork bellies ("...bacon, which you might find in a bacon and lettuce and tomato sandwich."); or
- Jamie Lee Curtis topless (well, you actually get to see that more than once).

This one is definitely a keeper!
