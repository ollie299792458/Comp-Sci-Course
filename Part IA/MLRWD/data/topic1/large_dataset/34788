After watching Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas(which I thoroughly enjoyed),I decided to also buy it's sequel(being a lover of all things Christmas and Disney).

It was only when I bought it,I realised it was computer animated...
(This was also the first time the Disney characters were seen in 3D animation).

'Oh here we go'...I thought to myself.

I usually find that when Disney uses computer animation(apart from Pixar,which is obviously brilliant),it takes the charm out,so I really dreaded seeing how awful this was probably going to be.

But...I was pleasantly surprised!
I actually thought that the computer animation added to it's appeal and made Huey, Dewey and Louie look even cuter than usual!

The short 'films' included are:

"Belles on Ice"
"Christmas: Impossible"
"Christmas Maximus"
"Donald's Gift"
"Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas"

If you are looking for a sweet,family,Christmas 'movie' then I would definitely suggest this as it is just as good,if not better than the first 'Upon A Christmas'.

It really gets you into the festive spirit,and for me Christmas just wouldn't be complete without it.
