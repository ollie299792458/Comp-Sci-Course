This is the type of glossy, superficial Hollywood production that will be pleasant and diverting for some people but will prove unsatisfying and inadequate for others.  My opinion will have to reside somewhere in the middle.

It's really amazing to me that Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, as the stars, were responsible for a movie that's set in Mexico but where nobody ever speaks Spanish. This seems to me to be an unacceptabe denial of their heritage.  Perhaps a Spanish-language version of this movie was also made.  Even if that is the case, the beautiful Spanish language ought to be found in a movie situated in a Spanish-speaking country.

My central criticism of this film is that it is too lightweight.  The characters are simpletons and the plot is too trivial to even mention.  However, both Hayek and Cruz are truly very pleasing to watch and it is hard to sneer very forcefully at a movie that features them in all their sultry loveliness.

As good as those two actresses are, it must be said that Dwight Yoakam gives the most delightful performance in the film.  He makes a clever and clownish vaudeville villain and the stringy black wig that he wears throughout the movie never ceases to amuse.  This is the best performance that I've seen Yoakam give.  He really is developing well as a comic actor.

The very best feature of this film is the natural scenery that you will catch sight of behind the actors.  It is all quite gorgeous and Mexico has never looked more magnificent.  The makers of this movie are to be praised for their efforts to portray the physical wonders of Mexico in their full quixotic splendor.
