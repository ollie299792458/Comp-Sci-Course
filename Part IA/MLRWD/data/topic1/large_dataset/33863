Let me start with the DVDs of the ShoTime TV series:

Disks 1 through 4 contain the series pilot, and the 14 episodes of season 1.
Disks 5 through 8 contain the 15 episodes of season 2 and the bonus features for the series.
Up through here I would gave it 5 stars. If I could have I would give it a 6.
Disk 9... contains the straight-to-DVD movie. This I would give maybe a 3

I Loved the the episodes on dvd they were all great! Loved the cut scenes & extras all very interesting!
The Movie .... well first it doesn't have all the cast members in it and the replacements for those cast members were not chosen at all well in fact they really did suck! Secondly the Movie won't play in my DVD player it makes a horrible noise and says dvd unable to play (perhaps my player is too old it doesn't like dual layer discs), It did play in the computer dvd drive but still made some noise but as I was using headphones it didn't bother me too much! I would hope I just got a fluke bad dvd but it's still annoying even if I didn't think the movie was very good you want to be able to play it if you want to!

All in all I would buy this set if you wanted the series it was nice to just have it all in one box set, Very Cool to be able to sit down and have a DLM marathon !!!
