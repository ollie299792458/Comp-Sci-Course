Nowhere in Africa might just be the most touching and most caring Western movie on an Africa-related theme I've seen in my life

If you were to leave the comfortable and safe environment of your upper class house, and move to a completely new place where the customs, morals, habits and the language you speak are no longer useful, what would you do? Nowhere in Africa presents the true story of a Jewish family that moves to Kenya in the late 1930s just before the beginning of the Second World War. The movie is centered on the daily life of Regina (played by Lea Kurka and Karoline Eckertz) and her parents Jettel (Juliane K&ouml;hler) and Walter (Merab Ninidze) who live in the company of the Pokot tribe somewhere in Kenya. As the mother and the daughter arrive to Kenya, where Walter was already settled in for some time (unspecified in the script) they are immediately confronted with the new more disturbing conditions in which they are supposed to live. Jettel has a very hard time in getting used to the new life (initially she thinks they will only spend a couple of months in Africa), while Regina almost instantly adapts to the new lifestyle.
