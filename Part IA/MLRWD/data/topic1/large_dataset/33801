Weeds is one of the smartest, wittiest and most intriguing television shows I have come across, and with that said, it is no wonder it could only air on a network like Showtime (the other being HBO). While most people will enjoy this show, I think only people who have "experience" with the show's overall theme will fully understand and appreciate the situations that the show deals with. This show is also that much more better while you watch it under the same influence that it is talking about :] But that doesn't undermine the show's clever writing and brilliant acting. I'm so glad Parker won the best actress Golden Globe nod over the overrated Desperate Housewives cast because she is not only a better actress but it also gave this show the publicity it very much deserves. It's one of the sharpest shows on TV, and there is never a dull moment. Again, if you've never experienced the lifestyle that this show portrays, you might find yourself wondering what all the buzz is about. But otherwise, I don't think anyone could refuse this show. Brilliant, and can't wait for season 2. (Great cliffhanger in season 1 by the way)

PS Did anyone know that Nancy's son is the same actor who provided the voice for Nemo in Finding Nemo? :]
