They kept running the trailer for this movie on TV for a while and showing times were really ridiculous... and on weekdays! Obviously I could either stay up and watch a movie and get a good talking to from my boss the next day for showing up late and half asleep, or go on my hunch and the trailer I saw and buy it on DVD... which I did!

Now, before we get into the actual movie itself... there is one issue I had with this product and that is the fact that you can't simply skip all the trailers before the movie and jump directly to the menu... you need to skip each trailer like chapters... and trust there are quite a few trailers to skip. That actually took some of the anticipation away... I got a bit tired of having to skip so many trailers!

As for the movie itself, those who've seen the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000093FLA">Snatch (Widescreen Edition)</a> will not rate this movie as high as people who have not seen it... I think that that movie has set the standard (well, at least for me) for this type of gangster movie which usually have rather surprising twist towards the end of the plot and that is why I can only go as high as a four for this movie.

The movie is full of surprises to say the least!! You will find a surprise in this movie with almost every single development! The characters are unique and quirky but nearly as much as in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000093FLA">Snatch (Widescreen Edition)</a>! (Brick Top, Boris the blade, and Bullet-tooth Tony) Bruce Willis seems to always play his usual cool and soft spoken bada%% which is kind of worn out to by honest... I think the role of Slevin was excellently casted where you really sympathize with Slevin throughout the movie. Ben Kingsley, there were scenes in the moive towards the end where he kept speaking in an exaggerated tone while he was making a weird mouth... why!? It was just an obvious case of overacting to me... I know he is a great actor but that's the way I saw it... (unless somebody can explain it to me).

Overall a nice movie to have in your collection if you are generally a Mafia / gangster movie buff... but for all of those reading this review who have not yet seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000093FLA">Snatch (Widescreen Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007ELEP">Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels (Widescreen Edition)</a>... you need to see them!! Also a good is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M4YZ90">RocknRolla (Single-Disc Edition)</a> (not as great as the first two but more than at par with this title.
