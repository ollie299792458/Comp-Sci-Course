Well, I have to say, this definately had it's good points and definately bad points.

First of all, the first season came without the first volume, which upset me very much. But when I started watching the second I could tell that I didn't miss much anyway. They started off very slow and there was nothing but screaming and confusion. No one knew what to do except Nishi, a sixth grader who committed suicide and ended up in the room with Gantz and other dead people.

The story. Gantz is a black sphere with a comatose guy in it who picks certain people who have died and copies them and brings them into an invisible world where they have to play a deadly game and defeat various alien foes. When they are in the game they have an hour to accomplish this. Kurono and his friend Kato were taken after they tried to save a bum from an oncoming train and paid with their lives. Kishimoto is a vuluptuous virgin vixen who tries to commit suicide because her mother has no faith in her abilities to go to school. There are others but, well, you'll see.

There is a lot of dialog and indecisiveness amongst the characters when they first start the game and most of the time they just stand there with their mouths open and wondering what to do. The thing that igged me was how slow they caught on. There is not much of a fight going on until the end of the season.

I purchased both seasons and in the second season...well I won't spoil it too much, but, I can tell you there is more action (sexual included) and more surprises.

One thing though make sure when you purchase anything from here check it and makesure you're not missing any disks or get repeated disks, as in my case. I got two volume threes and no volume one, I was really mad. Enjoy!
