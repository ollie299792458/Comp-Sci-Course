Comic book-to-movie adaptations generally come in two forms. The good (Spider-man, The X-Men) and the gawd-awful (The Punisher and the Fantastic Four - both pitiable versions of each).

Thanks to New Line Cinema - the wonder studio that brought us the Nightmare on Elm Street classics - the live action Spawn falls confortably into the second catagory, with crappy, on-the-cheap production values, schlocky 'B' movie direction from hack Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute;, and seemingly decent actors hamming it up while spouting cheesy dialogue. Michael Jai White (Spawn) poses and growls a lot, spending the majority of the film encased in makeup that consists of a plastic head and a dirty trench coat. Nicol Williams (Cogliostro) is oooh-so mysterious, and Martin Sheen does his best William Shatner impression as Spawn's ev-il nemesis, Jason Wynn. The only person who seems to get it at all is the always impressive John Leguizamo, the absolute perfect choice to play Violator. Lequizamo tears into his part with a vicious glee no one else here can quite muster.

I wasn't a big fan of the Spawn comic, but this mess is garbage, barely worth the one star rating, strictly for Leguizamo's performance. Maybe some day this franchise will find a creative team with the juice to get it film the treatment it deserves. Stranger things have happened.
