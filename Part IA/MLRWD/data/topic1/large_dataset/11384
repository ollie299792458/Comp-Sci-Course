I am quite pissed at Fox for this edition. I mean, up until now, there was a clear difference between standard editions and collector's editions, or so I thought... I used to believe that a collector's edition included all the extra bonus features one has the right to expect when he or she pays extra for it, especially for a movie like X-Men, no questions asked. I was obviously wrong, and I was charged with $20+ to learn that lesson.
It appears now that it has changed, with Fox at least, whose marketing guys use shameless tricks to get the cash. DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION! IT HAS ZERO BONUS FEATURE AND THE DVD IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE REGULAR CHEAPER ONE! It only contains a "exclusive" comic book that is rather crappy, and has no interest whatsoever. Either you do not care for bonuses, and in that case, get the widescreen edition, or you are an afficionado, and if so, do not make the same mistake I made: check out in details the description of the dvd before you buy anything. Again, this is NOT a collector's edition, and you can see miles away that the actual special edition or whatever they're gonna name it is coming up in no time. And remember that from now on, a collector's edition by Fox has no meaning at all! Shame on Fox! They can no longer be trusted!
