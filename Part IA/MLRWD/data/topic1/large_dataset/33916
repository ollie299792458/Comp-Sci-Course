Just been emailed by Universal,told as I'm in the UK,they won't replace my faulty disc4,charming!

I live in the UK and I've been lucky that "The Bionic Woman" has been released in the UK in various forms in the

last few years,first as a compiltaion of three episodes on a DVD,same with "The Six Million Dollar Man" and then,in

a few year ago,seasons 1 and 2 of both "The Six Million Dollar Man" and "The Bionic Woman".

The two Big Foot episodes weren't included in the region2 release so thats why I purchased this region1 version and

the special features are a joy,struggled a bit with the volume on "Kill Oscar part1",not got to the "Deadly Ringer"

episodes yet,which I've read had had some volume issues.

The region2 "Six Million Dollar man" episodes weren't remastered wheras "The Bionic Woman" episodes were,so,I

hope "The Six Million Dollar Man" region1 episodes are remastered.

Nice to see Lindsay Wagner still so happy to chat about a show,still so beloved,by so many.
