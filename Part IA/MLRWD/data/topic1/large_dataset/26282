Like the other reviewers, I have to say, this movie was a keeper.  Why?  Simply put, "...because of the music."  Even a none music lover, will enjoy this movie.  Forget the story line. The music tells the story.  Don't ask me how this happened,  but somehow I first watched this movie without the dialogue.  I could hear glasses tinkle and footsteps, and all the background stuff, but no voices...and oh my goodness...the music! Most enchanting and enthralling of all is the scene where they have decided after all these years, to finally record the main character playing his music.  As fate would have it, it happens on a day when a naturally pretty immigrant girl just happens to catch the eye of the pianist through a porthole, and what emerges from his fingers and the piano keys is one of the most poignantly romantic pieces of music to touch the hardest of hearts anyone has ever heard! You  can tell just what he must be feeling just from the sound of the music. (I replayed this part over and over several times the first time I saw this movie).  This film is one of those that you are likely to feel skeptical about at first, but will turn out to be one that you are ultimately glad you got just because of the feelings and emotions it will invoke in you through the music.  It sort of puts you in the mind of the movie, "Somewhere In Time" with Chris Reeve and Jane Seymour with the music of Rachmaninoff, but without as good a story to go with the music.  I hope my review inspires you to go out and rent/see/or buy the movie.
