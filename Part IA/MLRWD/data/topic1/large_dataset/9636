I loved the first Transporter, the music, fight scenes, storyline... and it was overall a kick ass movie.  The second one? The ONLY thing that I found enjoyable was Jason Statham fights and his driving.  The director obviously watched too many Miami Vice shows and decided to throw in as many cliches as possible.  The south american drug lord with his white suits, and shoes with no socks.  The soundtrack was all instrumental.  I'm sorry but alot of what made the first one so great to watch was the music that went along with the fight and driving scenes.  The acting in Transporter 2, everyone besides Jason was really bad....it was comical.  I bought the second one without watching it, and a group of friends who enjoyed the first one all sat around to watch.  We had a hard time watching it, so full of cliches (the bad girl walking in lingerie, jamaican cab driver, and worst of all the guy with the blonde dreds)...that after we finished it...to redeem our night, we watched Snatch.  We decided against watching the original Transporter because we knew we'd just get more pissed off at how bad the second one was.  If you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh and obviously reaches a B-movie status, then go ahead.  Transporter 2 has been added to my B-movie shelf, right beside Elvira, Mistress of the Dark (a good movie because it was meant to be funny and not taken seriously).  All I can say to those who think the 2nd one was great...we obviously have different tastes and expectations out of our movies.
