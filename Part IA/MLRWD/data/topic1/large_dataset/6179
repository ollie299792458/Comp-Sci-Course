This is the best animated movie ever that is great and watchable for the whole family and there are funny momments in this film.This is the first movie to be a CGI type of animated film in 1995(which is the year the film was released)this the best family movie ever and there are great sitcom actors who voice in this film like Tom Hanks(Bosom Buddies)and Tim Allen(Home Improvement which was still airing on television with new episodes).Tom Hanks voices as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear.What's not to like about this film when it's funny?You can never go wrong with this film.This film is rated G even though there some content like Woody call Buzz Lightyear Mr.Lightbear and there is a funny fist fight with Buzz and Woody and some frightening scenes that only occur when Sid is around.I highly recommend this film that has great technology and was made by Pixar(the company that originally worked on short films and they still make them now).This film deserved a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and it is as good as many people say it is.Parents will find this film suitable for children of all ages.
