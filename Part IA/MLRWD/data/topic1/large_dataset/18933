Drunken Master 1978
Cast: Jackie Chan, Simon Yuen Siu Tin, Hwang Jang Lee, Dean Shek Tien
Director: Yuen Woo Ping
Writer: Hsiao Lung
 This picture directed by the famed fighting choreographer  Yuen Woo Ping is one of the best kung fu comedy today. It includes Jackie Chan and one of my personal hero's in the old school martial arts Simon Yuen Siu Tin. He Is the original master in these movies for example Blind fist of Bruce. One of my favorite movies by the Bruce lee clones. This is one of Yuen first directing jobs before he  was commissioned bye American fat heads to try to liven up there garbage with his flawless fight choreography skills.

This Jackie' take on the Canton born Chinese hero Wong Fei Hong. Movies before this about legendary Wong Fei Hong who was a master in the  Hung Gar Boxing were very traditional in terms of keeping the already legendary persona of  traditional film. Cantonese entertainment depicted him sense the turn of the century. Jet Li did wonder rendition of Wong in film produce by Tsui Hark called Ounce Upon a time in China. After seeing the success of this film Jackie decided to make Drunken Master 2 to show he was the best at there depiction of Wong. This is the original and you can almost feel it. However there is only and difference he plays it for laughs. This is probable the first films which depicted Wong Fei Hong like a misfit who doesn't fit in. Beware this version is cut however as stated in the commentary this is a version brought straight from Hong Kong? (Or it could be that the tryed to Americanize it)Bastards. So to see the films in its whole entirety you will have to go else were. To next reason why you should by this is the commentary, which by itself stands alone. There's Ric Meyers, the author Great Martial Arts Movies from Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan, and Jeff Yang the co-author of I am Jackie Chan My Life in Action. I'm actually a big fan Ric Meyers and value his opinions and views.
