Okay, so Four Brothers might not teach the smartest ideals about avenging someone's death. Not to mention these guys never get locked up for their deeds. But that's missing the point.
The movie is a mediation on choosing one path over the other. I don't care how well the brothers were brought up, but they are still street kids, with a penchant for violence and they would rightfully want to avenge their mother's death in the only way they know how. This is illustrated with the wonderful talent of Andre Benjamin, who is reluctant to partake in his brothers' violent ways.
The film is incredibly entertaining, almost too much so, to the point where there are multiple nonsensical scenes merely for entertainment. But that is all okay! It wasn't supposed to win best picture, and it doesn't play to hollywood like many other films do.
The cinematography and locales are superb, and I felt right at home in the blue collar hoods, that actually look similar to what you would find in Denver. The snow really added to the film, and my favorite part was the slippery car chase in a blizzard. Having gone through blizzard after blizzard here in Colorado, I found it very welcoming. And also, many reviewers are saying it was unintentionally funny, when I believe it was intentional. This film is a send up of blaxploitation flicks, a word I have not seen mentioned on this website, and the over the top fight scenes and chase scenes set alongside funk music are meant to inject a certain level of humor.
Don't take this film TOO seriously, and you will have a great time. People are too skeptical these days of everything to begin with. I enjoyed four brothers immensely, and the music and acting was top-notch.
It's also great to see Andre 3000 act in films nowadays.
