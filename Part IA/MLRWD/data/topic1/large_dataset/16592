The first JP movie was very flamboyant, colourful and fresh. This movie feel a bit gloomy, realistic and simple. I really liked this film for it's realism, it does not have the great story the book gave us, but it's still up there with the first film. I did expect a bit more variety of dinosaurs in this film though, the only real new players are the Stegosaurusses, Compys and one brief shot of Pteranadons. I did want the movie to be even a bit more darker and would have liked more scenes at the compound and less Trex scenes. If you look at the bonus material in this dvd you get to see some great concept art that never made it to the movie. The trailer scene is one of the greatest scenes of the JP series though. The music was a bit of a let down, the drums are beautiful in some places, but overall it misses the strength of the first soundtrack. Also I'd really like to see the 2 deleted scenes added back into the movie, especially the Pete Postletwaite scene which builds a lot of character.
