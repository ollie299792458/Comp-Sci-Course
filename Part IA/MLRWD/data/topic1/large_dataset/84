I saw this movie after several notable critics gave it very favorable reviews. On first approach, I can't imagine a film sounding less appealing: a German film, bearing no English audio track, presented in black and white (the film was filmed in color and then had its palette desaturated), concerning the events in a rustic village circa 1914---not exactly Michael Bay material.

The film is so anti-establishment, in fact, that some people may recoil from its possible pretentiousness; I include myself in this latter group, having been burned a time or two too often by films buried under their own aspirations of signfiicance.

Happily, "The White Ribbon" bears no such affliction: this is a great, deeply thoughtful movie. There are many adequate discussions here about the film's plot, which I will not belabor, other then to say Michael Haneke's decision to couch his ideas in the framework of a mystery, tinged throughout by a looming sense of dread, was very wise indeed---the viewer is inevitably drawn to the film's narrator/protaganoist as he seeks to uncover the identity of those responsible for the seemingly random acts of violence that have occurred in his village.

The less said the better. There are very profound questions being considered here: e.g. how should we balance our personal freeedoms against the communal need for well-being and security---but Haneke is too smart a film maker to offer up an easy fable; there are no simple answers. People are quick to judge the motives of the murderer; the dark nature of a people swept astray by fascism; Haneke suggests the seeds of our worst evils may be sown even in the richest of soils.
