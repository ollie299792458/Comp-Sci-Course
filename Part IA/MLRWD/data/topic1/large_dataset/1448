Have you heard? Christmas has been cancelled! Santa Claus (voice of Mickey Rooney) believes that there is no Christmas spirit left in the world. Why deliver presents to children who don't even care? So old Saint Nicholas declares a sick day and decides to stay in bed. His elves Jingle Bells and Jangle Bells can't believe it. Mrs. Claus (voice of Shirley Booth), however, is determined to keep her husband's gift-giving tradition alive (whether he likes it or not!). She sends Jingle and Jangle out into the world to find an example of good will so that Santa will change his mind. The elves, along with Vixen the reindeer, head for Southtown, USA...and head right into trouble! First Vixen is snatched by the town dog catcher. When Jingle and Jangle appeal to the mayor to let her go, he laughs at them. The mayor won't release their reindeer unless they use "elf magic" to make it snow in Southtown (where it hasn't snowed in 100 years). There's only way to get it to snow, so Jingle and Jangle, Mrs. Claus, and a local boy named Iggy (who thinks believing in Santa is for "little kids") pay a visit to the Snow Miser. Sorry, Santa, I've got to cheer for the "Bad Guys" here because the scenes with the tall, cool Snow Miser fighting with his short, hot-tempered step-brother Heat Miser are the best part of the show! You can't help but sing along when the brothers introduce themselves ("I'm Mr. Heat Miser, I'm Mr. Sun...). And I love Snow Miser's chilly sense of humor...

Snow Miser: "How's your hubby, Mrs. Claus?"
Mrs. Claus: "He's got a bad cold, I'm afraid."
Snow Miser: "He should've come to me. I would've given him a good one!"

My family and I watch this show every year and it never gets old. Even viewers who think they're too old for Santa will enjoy this classic animated television special.
