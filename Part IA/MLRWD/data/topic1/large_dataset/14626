The Waterboy is a simple tale about how a simple guy goes from being a picked-on "water distribution engineer" to superstar college "foosball" player. This role is tailor-made for Adam Sandler, who makes a good living acting stupid onscreen.  OK, your opinion about this film will probably hinge entirely on whether you find Bobby Boucher (Sandler)'s voice - complete with stutter - hilarious or annoying. I think it's hilarious, but this film has so much more! Alot of the comedy is sight gags, and the football scenes are especially well done. Sorry, but EVERYONE should laugh when Bobby drop-kicks "Number 62".  The supporting cast do well too, with Henry Winkler providing a few laughs as Bobby's wimpy coach. This is the prototypical Adam Sandler movie: he plays a lovable loser who rises to the challenge and gets the girl (see Billy Madison, Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore, Little Nicky...), but if it ain't broke, why fix it? I give this 4 out of 5. Could have been 5, but a few of the jokes miss, and as usual, some of the acting is less than good.
