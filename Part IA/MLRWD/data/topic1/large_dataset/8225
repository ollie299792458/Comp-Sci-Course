Director Carroll Ballard has a gift for revealing the beauty that dwells within an individual, a wild creature, a community, a culture, and always the natural environment in which her charactors live. Her research on wolves is accurate. Superbly acted by Charles Martin Smith and all of the few actors in this film, the real stars are the wolves. I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates nature and wildlife, as well as, those who don't -- like Sarah Palin! She might learn some respect for God's creation and our human role as protectors and preserveres of it.

Never Cry Wolf is the story of a biologist who is sent to Artic terrain to study the habits of wild wolves. During the main character's scientific research, he realizes the truth about the vital role the wolf plays in the balance of this natural environment. Through his meeting with an indiginous Elder and his family, he receives a different perspective of Nature and of It's wildlife, which is threatened by our modern industrial technological complex. When he delves into his work with integrity, the wolf becomes his wayshower in a journey of self-transformation. The story evolves with little dialogue, deep drama, and stunning visual beauty!
