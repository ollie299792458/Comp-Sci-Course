THE MOVIE ITSELF
This movie is not only the best of the genre, but one of the best films ever made. 
Italian Americans may get angry with the stereotypes brought about by the making of these films as the most recognizable aspects of thier culture but such as life.
This film chronicles the life Henry Hill, based on the book "WiseGuy". His rise from neighborhood kid learning to score, to a full fledged, yet not connected mafia affilliate.
Scorsese is at the top of his game here. The use of popular music from every era that this film chronicles in each part is a high point. Also, the full frontal graphic parts make this one of the greatest experiences ever. These range from the fights between Henry and his wife, to Tommy getting shot in the back of the head. The Billy Batts beatdown. ... 
This movie has a pulse and creates a timeless time on screen all its own. I don't know why this film did not make best picture.
The acting is all on point with every character. The most realistic/convincing piece of acting I have ever seen is the scene where Liotta(hill), pistol whips the neighbor/date/preppie of his future wife. When he is walking away from the guy he has just pistol whipped, the rage in Liotta's eyes is beyond real. It is the single most convincing, space subtraction between the human eye and the screen I have ever experienced. 
This is a classic and it is only a decade old. People still hail "Little Caeser" and "Public Enemy." Goodfellas will no doubt go down in the same category.
DVD ASPECTS 
The DVD is great, but the seasoned DVD enthusiast will be a bit put off by the fact that the disc is dual sided and not dual layered. The audio should also be redone to suit the new audio formats. This is a classic film that should be presented in the latest technological advances.
