I bought this album because of the overwhelming amount of positive comments at "Filmtracks". I'm usually disappointed when albums are over-hyped, but not in this case. Although John Debney has had one other "universally" acclaimed film score- "The Passion of the Christ", it's hard to believe this is the same composer. Whereas "Passion" was an extended series of atmospheric tone poems and mood-pieces, "Cutthroat Island" is a melodic and rhythmic composition in the classic film-score style. In many ways a modern salute to Korngold, this is infectious swash-buckling adventure at its finest. I give it 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 for two very small reasons: a) there is some synthetic instrumentation early on that takes away from the overall vintage feel of the score, and b) the solo violin parts are recorded in a somewhat thin and strident way (this might have been on purpose for an effect in the film, but I can't relate simply because I haven't seen it). Much like John Williams' "Star Wars", "Superman", and "Hook", this score is simultaneously a mature work of "program music" AND an exercise in childlike escapism- a very hard thing to pull off. I look forward to some Hollywood director giving Mr. Debney the opportunity and the budget to do something of this caliber again. By the way- in addition to the stellar composition and orchestration,the London Symphony Orchestra really shines on these tracks. This is a review for the original release and not the new extended release, which I'm sure is even better...
