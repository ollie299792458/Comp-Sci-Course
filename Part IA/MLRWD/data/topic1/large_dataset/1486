 Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011, directed by Brad Bird)

What initially got me excited about this movie wasn't the fact that it's a Mission: Impossible film, though that's certainly a good starting point. Curiosity did. I like that each Mission film hand selects qualifying directors to helm continuing serials in the title series. Brad Bird is a welcome addition. Previously directing animated masterpieces The Iron Giant, Ratatouille, and The Incredibles, Bird has shown an exemplary eye for dissecting authentic human character, and by doing so, creating heartfelt drama, comedy, and perhaps most importantly, heightened peril.

Character's an imperative element to film yet often diagnosed as the necessary evil for establishing most action moneymakers, but Bird prevails. Mission not only parades these elements, it does so in a poetic framework that exemplifies and makes you thirst for each character on screen. What I like most about the script is its comedic elements in very strenuous situations. Tom Cruise barely hanging on for life from a Dubai skyscraper and angrily disposing of his broken glove only to find it sponged on a window several stories higher, as though taunting him, brings satisfactory relief to suicidal vertigo. Jump on couches all you want, Mr. Cruise, so long as you keep them coming.
