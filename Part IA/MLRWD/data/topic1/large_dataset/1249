I was excited to see this sequel production of High School Musical 2.  I am a Mom and teacher who really enjoys these "innocent-like" shows.
I actually liked it better than my 17 yr old daughter.  She said it was corny and untrue to life.  However, I really liked the resort they filmed this at, and the storyline.  It is true to life on Troy's struggle for his identity, as with all teens.  I really like Lucas, who played Sharpay's brother.  He is sooooooo talented.  I really liked him in the baseball musical number. He is an excellent singer and a wonderful dancer.  I wish him a lot more success.  I would have liked to have seen the heavy-set girl do more.  She is a very talented dancer and singer.  She was always in the background.  It is also good to have non-skinny actors in these movies, because everyone is not 104lbs.  I, also, thought that the pool song number with sharpay was very clever.  It shows a lot of work was put into it.

I ,also, like these characters and these movies because the characters of Troy and Gabriella are very much like the Beach Blanket Bingo set of the 50's & 60's with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello.  As a matter of fact, Vannessa, who plays Gabriella, is just like Annette! America needs simpler and sweeter shows like these!
