Which came first, "The Sopranos", the great HBO series hit, or this film about mobsters.  It doesn't really matter, because this is a fun film to watch. Billy Crystal does an excellent job as a reluctant  psychiatrist, alternately trying to evade and to help kingpin Mafia (there  is no such thing) guy, Robert DeNiro. Of course Deniro is having panic  attacks, which is his problem, and his mobster enemies and former friends  chase him for fear of what he might "squeal" and Crystal  frequently runs with him. Crystal's performance at the big mobster meeting  representing DeNiro is priceless. Crystal's marriage ceremony to Lisa  Kudrow is ruined several times in some hysterical scenes. Crystal's lines  are delivered in his matchless timing and comic believability. De Niro does  a great job, becoming a less than tough mobster.  Lisa Kudrow looks pretty  but a little out of place. Her lines are funny, similar to her part on the  TV sitcom "Friends", but somehow she lacks the spontaneity, which  makes her so funny on the TV show. Maybe each scene was concentrating on  someone else, because she could have been funnier in the way she can put  across a little nutty humor.  
  By the way, this is a  "spoof" and any resemblance to characters and plots on the  "Sopranos" might be intentional, but naturally the storyline is  not serious. People do get killed, but "not in a bad way."
