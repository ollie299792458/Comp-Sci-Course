I would really love to give this higher marks being as I am an avid 3d supporter/fan, However even though ghosting wasnt too frequent I got a case of tired eyes from this flick, ghosting was pronounced in a few instances as well but nothing that distracted for too long. It is hard for me to explain the issue I had with this film.. I could only describe this one as having hotspots on the outer edges of objects for quite some time. The picture was excellent in resolution and clarity with the exception of this weird effect I had from the 3d. maybe its because the strength of the 3d? I tried adjusting the 3d output strength to weaken it a bit but little help occured from this. I have noticed this effect more often in the earlier 3d bluray releases and its almost non existent in the later releases everything is crystal clear yet seems as though a haze effect is present and makes the eyes grow tired.

Dont get me wrong, the movie was still a blast and at times things came out of the screen especially the scene with the grouper fish and kelp in the kelp forest.
