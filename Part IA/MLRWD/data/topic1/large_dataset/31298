"As soon as you take the weight off your feet, down it all comes on your head..."  You'll meet Miss Otley (Carol Burnett), Miss Ashton (Nicolette Sheridan), Mr Lejeune (John Ritter), Mr Dallas (Christopher Reeves), Miss Blair (Merrilu Henner) all on stage of 'Nothing On' while the Director Lloyd Fellowes (Michael Caine), Stage Manager Tim Allgood (Mark Linn-Baker), and Asst. Stage Manager Poppy Taylor (Julie Hagerty) fret over missed entrances, cues, props, actors....

"Sardines here, sardines there..."

This play starts with the dress rehearsal before opening night (or is it the tech rehearsal?)  ;)  As they proceed to rehearse, the director begins to realize he's gotten a lot more than he bargained for.  As the show becomes more popular, dramas backstage are colliding with the performance on stage.  Skeletons begin to come out of the closet and all this leads up to a deep dark secret that involves the director himself.

With an all-star cast, this is highly recommended for anyone looking for a "good old-fashioned plate of sardines", I mean a good old-fashioned comedy.  There are some provocative undertones, so please use caution.
