After all many glowing reviews and a promising start, this movie never got moving. The only character you'll like is the bright young girl, while the rest are unsympathetic cardboard cut-outs.  What's worse are the holes in the script and the telegraphed character arcs.

SPOILERS.

Among my peeves:
- There's a monster in Han River yet a bunch of buffoons easily access the area, there are no helicopters, news crews and the rest of the city appears to carry-on as normal.
- No tanks, heavy artillery, attack helicopters patrolling?  Huh?
- The disinfectant truck alone along the river without protection?  Why?
- The family hides in their restaurant for hours yet the police don't immediately look for them there?
- The Virus angle is irrelevant, which makes the brain drilling a wasted scene. Why is the psycho coroner from the movie's beginning drilling into his head anyway?
- The father of the girl escapes TWICE?
- How does the sister get out of the sewer hole that had to be 10 feet deep?
- All the authorities act like idiots.
- At the end, how did the authorities know was at the bridge?
- Why did some people appear to die from the gas while main characters and the boy were unaffected?
- At the beginning the monster dives off the underside of the bridge and some people along the mainland think it's a harmless dolphin?
- Why is the movie called the "Host?"
