never ever did I see myself watching this movie, especially if i had heard about its plot before viewing.  But during a lonely night, no women, no food, no friends, no life, i was flicking the cable channel and i caome upon this hilarious unimaginable scene, where a man has his penis in a bucket of popcorn sitting in a movie theather (Isn't popcorn hot?).  Well that was enough to gain this lonely guys interest.  looking for something in the line of Animal house and Revenge of the Nerds, I find this heartfelt movie showing the development between friends from teenhood to adulthood.  Throughout this movie you see a difference in each character of friends, that models the average group of friends in most Amrerican movies and also in many ways reality.  You have your badboy, loser, smartguy, and shy type all indulged in various trials.
Wont ruin the movie, but the characteristics alone is very appealing in this movie, since it models so much the lives of young men today, which is one of the reasons I give this movie an A++++.
