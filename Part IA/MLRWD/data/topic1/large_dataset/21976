Like everyone else I was so excited when this movie became available, it is a great guiltly pleasure.  And it was going to be a wonderful suprise for one of my little brothers Christmas presents, I also love this movie, and when it arrived I ran to the living room and poped it into my DVD player; this is when my excitement turned into anger and it continued to get worse as I communicated with the sellers!  NO RETURNS, NO REFUNDS, NO REPLACEMENTS!!  BE SURE TO KEEP READING BELOW!  BUYER BEWARE!!!!

TO EVERYONE THINKING ABOUT BUYING FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!

BUYER BEWARE!  Only after I complained did they put on the page that it will not play in "American" DVD players.  The movie was only in German...I SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND ENGLISH...I AM AN AMERICAN, BORN AND BREAD!!  If you open the package they will not accept a return nor will they replace it with an English version!  My question is this; how will you know it is not in English or play in your player if you do not open it.  Their return policy was not listed, and they just put on the page that is not playable in "OUR" DVD players.  Amazon is great, they will fix it and make things right.  The one thing they should do is put these people under review for their selling practices, and then terminate their selling power!  I SPEAK ENGLISH, NOT GERMAN!!!!!
