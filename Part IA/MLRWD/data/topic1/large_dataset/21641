The narrative and story telling in this movie are very conventional. And even though it's underlying allegory is about genocide, it remains static and aloof. Yet, it will stay with you forever, because it is consistently compelling on a purely visual level. And not in the way  movies like Brazil or Blade runner are striking because of their cinematography or a commitment to a vision in their set design. But in a way that good ART is compelling.  What we are looking at is something akin to a Hieronymous Bosch painting, like the "Garden of Earthly Delights."  The movie is perpetually bizarre, bursting with strange ideas and an incredible array of surreal flora and fauna. The landscapes are foreign and desolate, every creature encountered is malevolent, and the mood is cold and clinical, mixed with a sense of technological dread. The sight of the floating Tragg meditation spheres, or such things as the large vacuum that sucks up the tiny humans are not easily forgotten. The music is good, too. Odd and slightly jazzy, it might sound dated to some people's ears, but trippy nontheless.  Of all the sci-fi movies I have ever seen, this is the only one I feel is TRULY ALIEN. I really feel transported when I watch it, completely submerged in its environment. I am transfixed by its imagery.
The nasty things that people say about the dvd are true. How annoying to not be able to shut off the subtitles. It's terrible to think that a movie which is so well DESIGNED could have such a terrible flaw in its packaging! The movie is still worth having, though.
