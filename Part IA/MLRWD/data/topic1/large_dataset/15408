I must complain about this STANLEY KUBRICK ESSENTIAL COLLECTION. The package itself is all right, but the cover LIES about the ratios. It begins with BARRY LYNDON and says "Widescreen Version presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original camera negative". Well, the ratio is 4x3 and NOT AT ALL a widescreen version. First lie.
About LOLITA, DR. STRANGELOVE and FULL METAL JACKET, the whole three presented in 4x3, the cover informs, once more erroneously, "Widescreen version presented in a 'matted' widescreen format preserving the aspect ratio of their original theatrical exhibitions enhanced for widescreen TVS". Second lie. Nothing is true. Only A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, THE SHINING and EYES WIDE SHUT are correctly presented in 16x9 ratio as it should be for all the others. Come on! At least since 1955 no pictures were made in the 4x3 ratio, but some in 1.66 and more of the times 1.85. How could somebody make a picture in the 4x3 ratio (or 1.33) knowing that all movie theatres around the world would not respect it and surely would chop the frame to 1.66 or 1.85?
The third lie is the worst. SPARTACUS and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, the only two of the lot filmed in 2.35 do not receive the same treatment. While 2001 is well presented in the correct aspect, SPARTACUS is a poor letterboxed version that ruins the scope and spectacle of this celebrated blockbuster. Absurd. How can we trust in the information of a DVD cover with such unaccuracies? I'll be much careful the next time. I love Kubrick's work, but I don't want to be cheated anymore!!!!
