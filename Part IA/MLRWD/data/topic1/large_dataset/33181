As others have pointed out, this is a fantastic movie. It's one of my all-time favorites, so when the DVD edition came out I had to have it. Unfortunately, it is rather disappointing. To begin with, the video quality of the opening 2 minutes and a few other dimly lit scenes come off very badly on the DVD; this is even acknowledged in a little notice included with the disc. Too bad, they should have just dubbed it from the VHS edition, which looks fine!
The added attractions of the DVD edition are a 25 minute documentary on Hammer Films Sci-Fi films and a running commentary by Nigel Kneale and Val Guest. There's also a theatrical trailer, but that's on the VHS tape too.
Well, it's too bad they waited so long to interview Guest and Kneale, because they have very few recollections of the film. Oh there's a fact or two here and there, but it's basically rather dull. Kneale still harps on how much he dislikes Brian Donlevy as Quatermass, even though it's been 45 years since the movie was made! Guest is a little more interesting, when he speaks. Overall I think they'd have done better to have a fan of the film or a movie historian do the voice over.
The Hammer Film documentary is just 25 minutes of film clips with some narration. Again, not impressive.
Overall, I'd have to say this DVD is below average. I guess I'll be keeping my VHS tape.
