Once again, Martin Scorsese pairs up with the dynamic duo of mob movies: Deniro and Pesci, and once again they've create an amazing, epic movie. Unfortunately, I must say that this movie isn't quite as good as  goodfellas, but is very close. It has superb directing, great cast(who  beats Deniro and Pesci?), and a wonderful story about the rise and fall of  a mafia owned casino.
As great as this movie is, i must say something  about the violence. This is by far the most violent movie I have ever seen.  Before i saw this one, I thought that Goodfellas was as violent as things  can get, and then Natural born killers. But this movie gets the cake when  it comes to disturbing violence. This isn't an unnecissarily violent movie  however, but rather a realisticly violent one. It depicts some of the  terrible things that really happened to people in the mafia, and Martin  Scorsese isn't afraid to show it all. I personally don't believe that this  movie should be seen by anyone under 15, and only to the most MATURE 15  year olds. As a highschooler myself who has been desensitized by violence,  I found it very hard to sit through the end baseball bat scene, and when it  was over, that part in particular left sort of a bad taste in my mouth and  kept me up at night.  However, the violence will detract from the movie  only if you are faint at heart or not use to such gruesome scenes.  First,  see goodfellas. Then see Casino.
