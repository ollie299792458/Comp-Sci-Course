This dvd is a masterpiece. Im not talking bout the camera angles n stuff (although that's good too) I mean the performance.

Christina has such an amazingly powerful voice, and anyone who doubts that should watch this dvd and they will realise it.

there is no-one else like her in the bussiness and i think with shows like this she will be around for a long time.

*The most impressive vocally is 'At Last' an Etta James cover

*the most moving is 'Beautiful'

*the best to dance to is 'what a girl wants'

*the best girlpower is 'can't hold us down'

*the best anthem is 'fighter'

I however as well as loving all of those loved the smooth vocals on 'get mine, get yours' and the change in 'come on over' 'cruz' is good live(as is the whole dvd) and 'voice within' is just meaningful 4 me.

The dvd is amazing as are the songs on it, so there is no reason for u not to buy it.

Could hav some of her pop videos on it but i wont take marks away for that. 5 stars
