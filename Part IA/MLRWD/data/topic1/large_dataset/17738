I stumbled upon this at the movie room in my gym. I have never even heard of this title so I had no idea what to expect.

The premise is interesting, although a little mind-boggling at times. The plot seems to use the 2 minute thing selectively. I was wondering, Can he turn it off? When he's exploring alternate outcomes, like he did when he was trying to pick up Jessica Biel, does that count towards his 2 minutes? There are lot of unanswered questions and holes in the plot.

Oh Nic Cage, subtlety is not your strong suit. He is so over dramatic. This performance isn't quite as bad as that in the Wicker Man, but it is laughable a times. At one point, a little kid tells Jessica Biel, "I think he likes you because of the way he looks at you." Pan over to Nic Cage, who's just standing there staring at Biel intensely. And she seems surprised by this kid pointing out the incredibly obvious!

Biel is okay, with her heaving bosom, but there is not an ounce of chemistry between her Cage. I just kept thinking, "Isn't he too old for her?"

Julianne Moore proves what a tough cop she is by screaming at everyone and being bitchy. C'mon, was it really necessary to strap Cage down and pry his eyelids open, Clockwork Orange style?

I only got about 1/2 through the movie, but I'm pretty sure Cage will save the day and millions of people won't die.
