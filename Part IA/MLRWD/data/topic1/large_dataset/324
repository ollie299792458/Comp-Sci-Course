OK, I loved the first movie. The Highlander (1986) is probably in my top 25 favorite movies of all time. Somehow the producers for Highlander 2 convinced Connery to reprise his role as Ramirez (probably the $3 million for 6 days works did the trick!).  Re-uniting Christopher Lambert and Connery had POTENTIAL.  Unfortunately, this potential was destroyed by a horrible script, ridiculous story, horrible new characters and poor acting. In short, they screwed this up BIG TIME.  In this edition of the DVD, many of the special effects have been digitally changed and remastered.  Although this pretty cool, it's still just putting lipstick on a pig.

What I hated:
* Really stupid is the plot line where Katana (Ironside) suddenly wants MacLeod dead after he's spent 500+ years in "exile" on earth. At this point in the film, MacLeod is in his 80's and at death's door anyway.  How do you expect us to believe this load of garbage?  I guess the creator's thought that if the audience were stupid enough to believe the Ramirez can come back from the dead after getting his head chopped off in the first Highlander, than the audience will believe ANYTHING.
* The movie had the look and feel of a bad comic book from the 1930's yet the year was 2024.  What the hell is that all about?
* Why did they have to show us backstory of the immortals (who they are , where they came from etc).  It ruined the mystique of the original movie!  Dumb decision on creator's part.

* Michael Ironside's character aka General Katana - Mulcahy circa 1990: "Hey Michael, this is what I want you to do to prepare for the role of the bad guy in this film.  go watch the original Highlander and pay close attention to Clancy Brown as the Kurgan.  We want you to copy that performace. Yeah, be like the new Kurgan or someting. Yeah, that's the ticket."  Ummm, didn't work fellas.  I freaking hated Michael Ironside in this movie. Bad, bad, bad.

* Virgina Madsen, as Louise Marcus, was the one who really killed this movie.  Her character was laughable at best and her acting was an embarrasement.  I was hoping that she bought the farm early in the movie.  Unfortunatley, we have to suffer from her performance to the very end.

* Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb aka the two idiots from the Planet Zeist that come to kill MacLeod.  They were hilariously bad but even worse, once MacLeod chops off their heads (and this becomes immortal again - wha wha what?) he his a little boom boom with Lousie Marcus, whom he met like 5 minutes earlier.  To the Director:  please delete this scene when you do the Super Special Director's Cut.

Final Thoughts:  I picked this DVD up in the bargain rack at Walmart for 5 bucks.  It was worth it to me becuase I laughed out loud numerous times when I viewed it.  Plus, there are tons of special features which were actually interesting.  In parting, it is true, there can be only ONE, and this is NOT the one. BUT, if you can pick it up for 5 bucks and you want a good laugh, Go for it!
