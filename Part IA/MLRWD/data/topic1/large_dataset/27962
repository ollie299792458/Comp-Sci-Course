In a word: hilarious.  In more words: surprising, fresh, raw, and of course - offensive.  The Boondocks is all these things because it is a true "insider's" show.  Many of the things said, debated, and brought to light are talked about with the same vigor, energy, and controversial language behind closed doors.  I wouldn't call it dirty laundry exactly, but it's real, genuine black comedy.  It's akin to Martin Lawrence's show (via animation of course) in that certain phrases and expressions that (many, but not all) blacks share amongst themselves are now being broadcast to a much wider net of people.  Some people will "get it" and many won't.  And of course, some people laugh with the show and its characters and others laugh at the show and its characters, but that's the risk you run when you're on a major network (cable or otherwise).  It's especially appealing to black people who grew up in predminantly black neighborhoods or households, then went outside (for work or college) and have a dual perspective.  This show is a window into a segmented, cultural mindset and you may not like what you see or disagree with its validity, but you'll definitely get an eyeful. The DVD extras include a revealing interview with Boondocks' creator which gives some valuable insight.  Bottom line: Do you have to be black to enjoy this show?  No, but it certainly helps in some of the edgier scenes.  The Boondocks doesn't shy from race and attacks internal and external issues of the black community with a vengeance.  It's outside the box - that's why it's so great.
