This film tries to be too many things at once.
It could have been a straight crime thriller
in the Pulp Fiction Tradition or a failed preacher versus
vampires flick...the film starts out VERY strong, in
good Tarantino/Rodriguez fashion.  But when the vampires
start showing up it just doesn't work for me.
...Not that it wasnt amusing/entertaining...especially the "disco ball of death" at the end---but the strength
of Keitel's character and the character development spent
on his children seem like a waste of time.
Cheech Marin provides some comic relief playing 3 separate
characters...and Salma Hayek is too much of a doll-face to be
believable as a evil character...she is drop dead beautiful but doesn't pull off the "bad girl" image at all.  She should stick to playing good-guy characters.  They could have done a lot more with the Tarantino charater's psychosis--which was very interesting/twisted; But again, it seems wasted in the movie.
It seems like this film was rushed to production before Tarantino &amp; Robert Rodriguez could come to agreement on what kind of film to do and they just made a movie out of the parts of a lot of different movies they WANTED to make.  I wish they would've taken their time and just made a separate crime thriller...this movie seems like the rough-draft of what became _The Way of the Gun_.  This movie was disappointing because it could have been so much better.  I'm not remotely interested in any of the sequels.
