While the first Tinkerbell movie was to me acceptable, this one was actually enjoyable.  Partly this could be because I am now used to thinking of Tinkerbell as not the Tinkerbell from Peter Pan, but a new Tink reinvented to make Disney some more money. However, this time around, I think they did such a good job that I was not annoyed with the makeover!  My 6 yr old daughter also thought this movie was "the greatest" (her words). Although she liked the first one, she didn't want to watch it over and over and over. This one, she says, is one she wants to watch again and again, which means it may actually be worth adding to your collection.  If you haven't seen the first movie, this movie can stand alone on it's own, which is always nice.  Both Tink 1 and this movie have messages (accepting who you are, and accepting responsibility, respectively), but I think this Tink installment did a better job of incorporating the message into the story.

Picture & Sound:
On Blu-ray, the picture is beautiful; it's one of the movies that makes me just want to stare at my screen!  The sound is 5.1 (instead of 7.1 as in some of the newer Blue-rays), and although it's not full of surround effects, it is well done, and most will enjoy the Celtic style music (brought back from the first) that accompanies most of the movie.

Extras:
The 16 mins of deleted scenes are not exciting for kids unless they are into the technical aspects of how movies are made (they are in storyboard format), but your little & tween girls will probably love the Demi Lovato song/video as mine did.

Overall:
This is a keeper and definitely worth buying as opposed to renting!
