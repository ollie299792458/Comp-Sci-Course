At first I wondered how a film starring (and executive produced) by a two-time Oscar winner could go straight to DVD. Then I watched the movie and understood completely. Even though "The Resident" runs just under 85 minutes before the ending credits, the film seemingly manages to cram in every major horror-thriller-stalker-flick clich&eacute; in the book and then some. They've got it all:

--The attractive, emotionally-vulnerable urban professional!
--The new, handsome too-good-to-be-true neighbor!
--The mysterious ex-boyfriend!
--The creepy old man down the hall!
--The heavy-breathing, faceless peeping tom!
--The supportive African American best friend!
--The clanks, the thuds, the billowing curtains, the gasps!
--The constant, cranked up eerie music!
--Not one, not two, but three partially nude bathroom scenes!
--The different-perspective flashback!
--The grainy security/home movie footage!
--The seemingly immortal "why won't he just die!" villain!

If designed and played like an homage to B-movie horror films, even with such a talented cast, this may have been enjoyable. Yet it tries too hard to be serious, with a rather sad desire to feel original and give you chills. But it fails with its over-the-top clich&eacute;s, its unresolved back-story, its unused supporting characters, its generic camera angles, and its brief (thankfully, brief) running time of less than 90 minutes. I was disappointed to find that the incredible Christopher Lee's role was little more than six lines in a sort of extended cameo. And while Hilary Swank is as charming and intense as always, I cannot help but scratch my head and wonder why she'd frequently run around semi-or-fully naked for a movie like this one.

It might actually be funny upon second viewing, knowing what to expect. Or it might be an intoxicatingly-good drinking game for every time you see Hilary's underwear. Or, most likely, I'll never ever watch it again.
