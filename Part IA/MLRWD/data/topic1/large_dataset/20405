than Ralph Nader. This statement is not just my opinion - it is backed up magnificently by "An Unreasonable Man." It is also backed up by this lone voice who only started to stand up, stand out (most painfully at times) for the sake of truth and justice that I owe to Ralph Nader's spark of hope in the heart of a female attorney at a time when one colleague in the law was jailed for contempt by a judge for violating the dress code when she wore a pants suit to court! More to the point of this small review, it would be fruitless for me to cross-reference the film itself especially when it is not only a substantive goldmine but also a nail-bitter, a thriller - truly. For example, as a retired attorney who has spent years fighting for the rights of sick and disabled kids - I learned something new from Ralph Nader in this film. I realized that The US Constitution is, literally - if not as a matter of law, the most profound instrument of an American's "identity" so to speak as a citizen-in-action. Now I've always kept the US Constitution close by in book form for easy reference. But as a result of watching one segment of this DVD that had me on the edge of my seat, I intend to carry it on my person as often as possible in an effort not to go anywhere without it! Thanks Ralph for reminding me that this precious instrument was intended to protect and defend one group - We The People - and no one has kept that spirit of truth alive especially in these times more than you...!
