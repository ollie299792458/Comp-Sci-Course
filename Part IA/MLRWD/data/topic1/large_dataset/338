The Pianist is a true story about a Jewish pianist in Poland during World War II who manages to survive the horrors of the Nazis.  The Jews are forced from their home and into a cramped Ghetto where there is starvation, few jobs, and horrors.  Nazis take delight in bullying the Jews.  Then, millions are Jews are forced into cramped wooden cars to go to concentration camps.
The pianist doesn't go to concentration camps, however.  He manages to stay behind, but his tortures don't end there.  He is forced to help the other Jews build the wall seperating the Jews from the Germans.  At night, the Jews take long marches, following the Nazis orders.  The Nazis may randomly take Jews from the march and shoot them in the head, killing them.  The pianish manages to escape this, but then he is on the run from Nazis.  Good friends help them, but then he is alone when the city is bombed.
I will not go on with the story (I left enough detail out anyway).  I will, say, however, that the story is brilliant.  The movie does an excellent job portraying the horrors, sadness, and torture the Jews had to face.  The actors do a wonderful job of making the movie seem extremely real; it is as if you are actually at the scene, back during World War II, and watching this happen.  I found each and every part of this movie horrifying, but at the same time, very moving and interesting.  This movie is definitely one of the best I've seen.
