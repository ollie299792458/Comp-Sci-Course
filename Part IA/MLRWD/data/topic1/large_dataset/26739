I don't want to build this movie up too much because I have a few friends who, unfortunately for them, do not like it or understand why other people LOVE it.  It is definitely not your average mainstream comedy.  You need to go into this movie knowing that it is not the same kind of funny as "Dumb and Dumber" or some other popular funny movie, hence the reason it was not popular upon its release.
  That being said, this is the one movie that I never get sick of watching.  Never.  The characters, and I mean ALL of the characters, are excellent here, most of all John Goodman.  I love the Coen Brothers' movies because the acting in them is almost always superb and characters act in a very realistic, life-like way. But this one takes the cake.  Like other reviewers have said, the dialogue in this movie is hilarious.  Not only that, but it is ingenious.  On multiple viewings, you start to notice the little things that the characters do that make it that much funnier (like Walter's facial expressions in the bowling alley when he and The Dude are arguing).  I can understand why not everyone would like this movie. It does get a little weird in parts.  For instance, there are some dream sequences that, as I have witnessed, make people leave and quit watching the movie.  This is not because they are gruesome or malicious, but because they are a little hallucinagenic (is this even a word?) or "out there" I guess you could say.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes great acting, very well-developed characters, and an overall great movie experience.  I would not recommend it to anyone who is offended by abundant bad language and a little nudity.  Also Recommended: Fargo, Bad Santa, This is Spinal Tap, and The Royal Tenenbaums
