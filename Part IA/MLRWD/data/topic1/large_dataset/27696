i never intended on owning this.i made a purchase of 3 bundled dvds for $10.this was one of them.MAN,what a find !!!!!

sure,its outrageous and over the top,but somehow it works.this,i believe,is the hubby/wife's first or second time they teamed up.here shes sam caine,loving housewife to hal (t almandes) and mother to caitlin (y zima).they live a hohum life in middle suburbia where townsfolk go christmas caroling and such.

problem is,sam isnt who she thinks she is.in steps det mitch henessey (s jackson).he and his hooker informant are looking for who she really is.sam gets flash backs and glimpses of this ''other person'' but cant put her finger on it.well,unfortunately for her,help is on the way.

the race to not only save her family but herself AND stop a terror organization named the CHAPTER is on.this is action packed and unexpectedly well acted/directed and paced.i guess people couldnt accept geena being so kickass.highly recommended if you dont hate the ''1 person conqueres many/007/rambo'' type scenarios.
