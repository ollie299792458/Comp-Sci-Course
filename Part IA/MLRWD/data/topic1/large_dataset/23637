After being told time and again that I should at least give this movie a chance, I finally caved.  I now own this movie.  It is beautiful, touching and (as another reviewer stated) probably best watched alone.  I admit I cried.  The performances of both Clint and Meryl are perfection.  I can't imagine anyone else portraying these characters.  Anyone who has ever wondered about the "what if" factor of love and chemistry will appreciate the story.  
With regard to some of the reviews I've read, I have to say that we tend to sometimes miss the point behind a story.  Had the settings been "more diverse", I believe the intimacy of the story would have been compromised.  The majority of the relationship between these touching characters did, after all, take place in a remote farmhouse.  The Bridges and the County were merely the subtle backdrop.  As for the film portraying adultery as being an act with "no consequence", I believe the film clearly shows that, regardless of the final decision, there is always consequence.  This is shown both in the minor subplot of the local woman who is scorned by the townspeople and in the reading of the journal.
In all, I found this movie very touching and definitely the perfect movie for viewing with a cold martini in front of a warm fire on a rainy night.  Snuggle in and open yourself up to a great love story!
