Of complete garbage.  I didn't laugh, not once, through the whole movie.  It's not funny.  Period.  My wife didn't laugh either, and we generally love Will Ferrell.  I'm a fan of comedy, and there are some classics out there.  This isn't one of them.  Will Ferrell has went from original to old hat, simply repeating the garbage someone called a script and handed to him along with a paycheck.

"Elf" was hilarious.  "Anchorman" was awesome.  "Talladega Nights" and "Blades of Glory"?  No thanks.  That's an hour and a half I'll never get back again.

I just don't understand how anyone seriously thinks this is a funny movie.  There is zero originality, the lines are pointless and uninspired, and the CGI and cable work for the ice skating scenes are garbage.  Watch "The Cutting Edge" which was made at least 10 years ago, the skating scenes are at least 10 times better.

Go rent "Office Space", or "Tommy Boy".  Those movies have character, substance, and will have you laughing out loud, and not because someone made some grade-school joke and called it humor.  Those movies had real genius, and Will Ferrell did too, once upon an Elf.  Come back Will, and ditch these movies where the main characters could be replaced by any B-list actor and be just as boring.

My honest opinion, I'd rent before you buy :(

(See, and this is my point.  The guys who click the "Review Not Helpful" button are the ones crying in the aisle when they watch movies like this, I'm guessing because they are easily entertained by garbage humor.  To each his own, I guess)
