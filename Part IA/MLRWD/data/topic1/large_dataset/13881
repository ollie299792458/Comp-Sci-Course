Gattaca is destined to be one of the all time great science fiction movies and can be placed in the same class that 2001: A Space Odyssey is in.  When I first saw this movie, I had no preconceived notions of what I was about to witness and was not even expecting to enjoy myself, but I received a ver pleasant surprise.  This is a well conceived, evenly paced, and brilliantly acted movie portraying a not too distant future.  While the sets and characters are obviously very stylized, I could not help but think about how much of this movie's depiction of the future could be possible.
  While a science fiction movie with vision of the future powerful enough to make one think - at it's core, the movie is a story about determination, heart, and mankinds overwhelming urge to succeed regardless of the odds.  In some ways, I was reminded of the movie Rocky, as both films depict individuals who overcome insurmountable odds and their lack of advantages in order to obtain a goal that is viewed as impossible.
  As for the DVD - it is terrific also.  The video and sound quality is excellent being presented in anamorphic 2.35:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 respectively.  There isn't an overwhelming collection of extras provided but the featurette and the deleted scenes are nice and provide insight into the making of the film.
All in all - Well done!  I would recommend this movie to anyone, and do so frequently.
