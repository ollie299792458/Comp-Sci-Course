There's a great deal more attention to period detail in "The Rocketeer" -- the clothing, hair styles on men, even the language used, all are more reminiscent of 1930's serials than anything Spielberg did. Not an indictment of Spielberg's work, just a partial explanation for why I enjoyed "The Rocketeer" so much. It's a love letter to Hollywood and to early aviation, and if you actually know a little about these two subjects the movie makes a lot more sense.

One reviewer stated he found the concept of Nazi spies and soldiers in Hollywood hard to believe -- yet the German Abwehr did drop several spies by parachute into the West country of England. All were ill-prepared and captured almost immediately, but clearly the idea was out there. As for soldiers, note that the Hindenberg carried Nazi soldiers regularly, and in 1938 we weren't at war.

The same reviewer also found the giant assassin unbelievable, but this movie _is_ a fantasy, after all, and the character is clearly based not only on the appearance of the real 1930's and 40's actor Rondo Hatton, but on the kind of character he frequently portrayed.

The movie also gets props for using Howard Hughes as a central character, and not only a Zeppelin, but an autogyro as well, in the climactic scenes!
