I ultimately believe that the good aspects of this movie outweigh the bad, so it's very worth checking out.

The good: acting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is obviously someone who can handle a role like this, and he's someone who can draw us in and make us feel what the character is going through. He's expressive, well spoken, and carries himself perfectly for each character he plays. Jeff Daniels has proven himself able to star in the leading role, in a movie such as The Squid And The Whale, but I also love him in supporting roles. I think the character of a blind man is so easily overacted or clich&eacute;d, but he doesn't do either of these things. Matthew Goode has never been better, I almost didn't recognize him when he first came on screen. I wish Isla Fisher had more screen time, but she was fantastic. The plot. Even if it's a common theme among movies, it was still written well and directed with ease.

I suppose my only complaints, and the only reason I withhold a fifth star, is that a few things left me confused and/or concerned. First off, Chris is a highly sympathetic character, but how can he be driving when his injuries from the incident are so well spotlighted? Sometimes it seemed like he was just fine, and other times his situation was clear and obvious. That's not too big of a deal, though. A lot of people may have seen the ending coming, so that wasn't particularly fresh, but as I said, it's still a good ending to a great movie.
