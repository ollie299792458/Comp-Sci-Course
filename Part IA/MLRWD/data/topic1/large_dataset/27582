i bought this movie because of a friend's recommendation and i'm so glad that i did.  it took me a minute or two to get used to the tone of the whole movie, but once i was in, i couldn't escape.  this classic black comedy is amazing.  from the insane colonel that shuts down a whole military base and sends planes out to drop a nuclear payload on the russians, to protect our bodily fluids, to the crew of one of the planes doing the dropping that will do anything for their country, the cast of this movie is amazing.  dr. strangelove is one of the more memorable with his crazy hair and nazi-possessed right arm, he is probably one of the best characters ever to appear on film.  peter sellers plays three roles in this movie.  the president, dr. strangelove, and some army guy (sorry, i can't remember his name).  this movie is also James Earl Jones' big screen debut.  it came out in 1964 or 65 and is in black and white.  the acting is great and the comedy is darkly superb.  one of stanley kubrick's best.  buy it if you want to laugh your ass off.  and try to keep track of how many times plan R is brought up, it's a lot.
