I have had the VHS version for years and once or twice a year I sit down and watch it with a cup of tea by my side.  It's difficult to believe it is already 25 years since it aired on television.  Amazing how time flies and history repeats itself. The acting is superb.  The actors are almost the mirror-image of the actual Edward and Wallis Simpson.  There is one scene that is worth the price of the two discs: When the Duke of Windsor's girlfriend returns from her visit to the US, is invited to the Duke's home for tea and is startled to see her best friend, Mrs. Simpson rush in with the Prince acting as if she owns the place.  There is the wink and the nod that told the world: this is serious.  I never tire of looking at that.

At the time people in certain circles couldn't get enough of the Prince and Mrs. Simpson.  Then, when they fell out of favor and were banished from England, those closest to them were banished as well.  The same thing pretty much happened after Prince Charles and Lady Diana's divorce.  Those people close to Diana were no longer welcome at certain events.  Now it's Charles and Camilla.  The people who rallied to their side after the separation are safe, for now.  For such a small island England has mesmerized the world for centuries and centuries.

While the Charles and Diana story will be around for some time, 100 years from now, people will still be reading and talking about the Duke of Windsor and the American, Mrs. Simpson.  This film gives you the entire story from beginning to the beginning of the end.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has a deep affection for England (as do I) and a love of history.  Beautifully done.
