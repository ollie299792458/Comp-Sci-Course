Hideous Kinky (1999) may sound like a porno movie, a horror movie, or a twisted combination of the two.  It is none of the above.  This is an unconventional drama set in 1972.  Kate Winslet stars in a tour de force performance as Julia, a British woman in her early thirties.
  With two young daughters in tow, she travels to exotic Morocco seeking adventure, exposure to Sufi mysticism, and a version of "Truth" more palpable and hopefully more inspiring than she has experienced in the past.  Julia is well meaning and sincere in her quest but naive and somewhat lacking in maternal instincts.  (WARNING- PARTIAL PLOT SPOILER IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH)
  Her children are a chorus of common sense.  Reluctant to go in the first place, they keep telling her they want to return to a normal life.  Small wonder, since Julia's poor choices result in a shortage of food and shelter, exposure in the desert, and the girls forced to make dolls to raise money.  You will not find out here what happens when Julia leaves her daughter, Bea, temporarily in the care  of another man.
  Siding with the children, this movie shows the flip side of the personal freedom that was thoughtlessly fetishized in the 1960's and 70's.  An extra bonus is the soundtrack which should be of interest to fans of Middle Eastern and psychedelic music.
