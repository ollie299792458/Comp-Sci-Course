When I first saw this film when I was a kid...it literally scared the bejeezus out of me! That is why i have it in my DVD collection today. Wonderfully put together and excellently written, this is THE Sci-Fi/Horror film to which others after it would pattern themselves after. It was after this film that I became a Sci-Fi fan. Made on a meager budget, as stated in the dvd's bonus commentary section, the pressure for Director Ridley Scott to complete it was extremely great, loosing his cool many times throughout the process. Excellently cast, the movie's two focal points is Sigourney Weaver's strong female character (Lt. Ripley) and the Alien. After recently viewing this phenominal film on DVD, I was reminded of why the move scared me so much- the film's brilliant ability to keep the Alien out of most of the film, keeping you in suspense, frightened and guessing, just like an old Alfred Hitchcock film, like Psycho for example. It was mostly kept out because Scott wanted to make the Alien look more convincing. It's dark, eerie, and keeps the viewer on edge for much of the film, though some of the effects look comical and outdated, compared to the CGI digital effects these days-other effects, like the surreal landscapes created by artist H.R. Geiger in Scott's film studio, and the Alien,  still stand the test of time-I wasn't laughing at all, though, when I originally saw it in 1980.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED-OUTSTANDING. A MASTERPIECE. *****stars
