Great movie about the highs and lows of Show Business.
Even though its a movie, its art imitating life.
This is a perfect movie on what people will do to make it,
and to Be careful what you wish for and also shows what goes around, comes around.
Even though this movie was made in 1950, things like in the movie have went on in show business, Hollywood, and the stage before that movie after it, and surely today.
At the end the Eve character doesn't see it coming, but a so-called fan of hers pretends to worship and idolize her, and wants to follow her around and work for her, but what she really wants is to make it as an actress. Scheming, clever Eve doesn't realize it.
I wish there could of been more to show how Eve gets done it. I would of loved to see Eve get done in and then go crazy when she does, that would of been a great 2nd half. I wish the movie could of been longer like "Gone With The Wind" it deserves it. Even though its a just a movie, the movie is great and seems very realistic, sometimes you find yourself wondering what happen to that person. The movie is sooo good it flys by, wish it could of been more. But, Hollywood back then knew how much to show and when to end, this movie will keep you wondering.
I'm not going to give a long review, the things I've said above, are juicy enough.
