I absolutely adore this movie! I am 13 and we read the book in my English-Language class, and then we watched the movie. I could never think that any other movie was better! First off it stars my favorite actor Tommy Howell! 2 words hott and great actor! I have loved him since he starred in the hi film E.T (the extra terrestrial)lol* This movie deals with teenagers living in a run down neighborhood somewhere in Tulsa Oklahoma. The Outsiders otherwise known as The Greasers are just normal teens that are living a hard life. They incude ( Thomas Howell, as Ponyboy, Ralph Maccio, as Johnny, Matt Dillon, as Dally, Patrick Swayze, as Darry, Rob Lowe, as Sodapop, Tom Cruise, as Steve, and Emilio Estevez, as Two-Bit. It also includes other actors such as Diane Lane, Leif Garret, Darren Dalton, and ichelle Meyrink. The movie as well as the book is very emotional too!I cried...lol* Well I think that teenagers should read it more often han the adults...they'll love it! lol* Well go out and rent the movie...but I do sugggest you read the book first...they are different in a lot of ways.
