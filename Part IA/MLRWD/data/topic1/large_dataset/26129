The idea of being able to start over is very intriguing.  But this portrayal of a spoiled, cocky Englishman who supposedly starts over is not.  With much apology to his family, this film shows a man who I would not have any interest in if he HADN'T lost his memory, and now that he "HAS" I STILL don't care about him.  Part of the fault lies with the filmmaker who was really only interested in having an interesting subject to boost his career with.  There was no sense of a good "documentary" eye or understanding.  Much of it relied heavily on "at the moment" footage.  There was very little processed and even less explained.  The philosophical aspect was overblown and even the new man's personality ends up being annoying.  I only felt for him during the early footage of his recovery when he seemed emotionally vulnerable, but afterwards it seems as if he goes on with very little remorse.  He continues to live in a kind of charmed existence, and no one in the film made me really care who he was now or previously.  Not compelling, not well-made, and quite possibly not even real.
