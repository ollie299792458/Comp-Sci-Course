In our English class this year, we read and watched F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.  So our teacher Mr. Yochum told us that if we wrote a review on the book and movie, then we could earn a couple more points in the class.

When I first saw the movie, every character was exactly how I had imagined him or her to look. Unfortunately, as the movie went on, I felt that some of the personalities of the characters didn't match that of the description in the book.  Daisy (Mia Farrow) seemed to be even ditsier than Fitzgerald made her out to be.  I noticed as I was reading the book that Daisy had a couple of random comments, but when I saw the movie I felt that Mia Farrow made Daisy to look like she was a complete idiot when she said some of these lines.  I also think that Bruce Dern, who played Tom Buchanan, could have had a meaner, more forceful attitude.  While reading the book, I thought that Tom was a more controlling and stern man rather than one who attended to his wife's wants every time she told him to do something.

Other than those two characters, I felt that Jordan Baker, Nick Caraway, and Jay Gatsby were portrayed very well.  They had the right attitudes, looks, and characteristics to fit their part.  The scenery was also done very well to fit Fitzgerald's descriptions and was exactly how I had imagined them to look.

Of all the books that I have had to read during high school, I would have to say that The Great Gatsby was the best one.  It is a really good classic book that doesn't have that boring, hard to understand language that books such as Macbeth by William Shakespear does.  It's also not a very long book, which is very appealing to me.  I didn't mind the movie, but I felt that the book gave you a better sense of what was going through the character's heads.  So if you have the time, I would recommend reading the book rather than watch the movie, because I think that it really would be worth your while and you would be glad that you read it.
