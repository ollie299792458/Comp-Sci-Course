I enjoyed this film very, very much i thought it was sad, romantic and happy all in 1!!
This movie really moved me and it had some very funny parts and some not so funny!
This movie starts sad then it's happy then sad again and this movie just keeps following this pattern.
The lady who played Peggotty was a great actress who really suited this part, without Peggotty in this movie it would have been pretty Boring!!
Another great actress was the lady who played Betsy Trotwood at the start we all though she was a heartless bitchy old woman but in the end her bitchiness just came from her terrible Heartbreak.
But we can't forget the Best Actor and the main actor the young boy who played David Copperfield!! He was a wonderful actor and when he was sad we all felt his hurt.
This was a great movie but sometimes i thought it was a bit much, when David gets older everyone is in trouble or dying, i think it all happened too quickly, like it was squashed in all at once!!
Is this young boy a better actor in David Copperfield or Harry Potter??!!
