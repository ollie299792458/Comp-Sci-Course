Given that Robocop is as popular as he is, it's no surprise that a quality miniseries like this was produced. Everything from the writing to
the character arcs is splendid. Understand that this is not Hollywood, so the effects are not what you'd see in a summer blockbuster.

If you understand what this series represents, then you are in a for a great treat! Fleshing out the character of Alex Murphy is one of the most highly
sought after things in the Robocop world, so you are in a for a wonderful and fulfilling ride!

All things considered, I give this 4 part series 5 stars, due to the fact that I would rather have these, than nothing at all. That statement does not
detract from the series at all. The acting, and writing is on par with the very finest movies and tv series ever produced. It's a shame that more
money could not have been spent for better fx, but in all honesty, it DOES NOT detract from the series at all. ALL fans of Robocop should be pleased
with the product you are presented with. There is no cheese.... the production was quality enough to keep this from having any cheese factor, as
you would expect from a series of this caliber. Extremely entertaining!

5 stars, a very strong recommendation.

5 stars for Robocop!!!
