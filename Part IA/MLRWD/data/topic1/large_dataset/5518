Driving Miss Daisy is one of my all-time favorites.  I bought the Special Edition widescreen DVD (ISBN 0-7907-7237-X, UPC 0-85392-33402-5) and was horribly disappointed.  It shows less picture than does my old fullscreen VHS tape (and I seem to be the only one who has noticed)!  Although the image is with a widescreen aspect ratio, the left & right sides of the picture do not extend beyond those of the VHS.  And the top & bottom letterbox black bars on the DVD image are actually covering up parts of the picture that I can see on the VHS.  In other words, THE PICTURE BETWEEN WIDESCREEN DVD AND FULLSCREEN VHS IS IDENTICAL, EXCEPT THAT THE DVD HAS BLACK BARS LITERALLY COVERING UP THE TOP & BOTTOM.  For instance, at the end of the movie, the VHS tape clearly shows Miss Daisy's hand fumbling with the fork, and her slice of pie sitting there on the table.  On the widescreen DVD, this is all covered up by the bottom black bar, so all you see of the pie is the few bites that Hoke raises (out of the void) to Miss Daisy's mouth.  The touching scene is completely ruined.  I'm not exactly sure what's up with this pseudo-widescreen version, but it stinks.
