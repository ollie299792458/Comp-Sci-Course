This is an odd duck of a movie.  It's not really a comedy; Steve Carell's character is more pathetic and maudlin then funny; Juliane Moore's character is well played but she is just not very likable; it's difficult to believe that she and Steve are a match made for life.

There are a few gems here: Ryan Gosling is perfect as a cool narcissist with a thin veneer covering a vulnerable human being and there is a genuinely touching scene with his new found love when he begins to open that shell.

Marisa Tomei is just over the top one-step-away-from-Fatal-Attraction-but-funny.  Liza Lapira is fantastic but under-utilized as the candid and raunchy-mouthed friend of Hannah, the soon-to-be attorney.

The side plots are kind of Malcolm in the Middle uncomfortable, Cal's son having a meant-to-be-funny but kind of disturbing obsession with his babysitter, the babysitter having an equally disturbing obsession with Cal. And did I mention that an affable KEVIN BACON is in the movie for no particular reason I think except that it's another way to tie Kevin Bacon to everything in the universe.

Bottom line, this is a movie that is meant to be funny, but doesn't ring true for the main plot (true love between Cal and his wife) and with a number of itchy subplots that are just shy of having the police and a SWAT team of psychologists being called in to take the characters away.  That being said, there are Great, and I mean Really Great performances by Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei and Liza Lapira.  See it, but it's a mixture of laughs and "eeuuws"
