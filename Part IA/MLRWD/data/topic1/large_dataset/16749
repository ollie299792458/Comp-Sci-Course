Although Lamberto Bava isn't quite as effective a director as his father Mario Bava, DEMONS nonetheless does entertain and contain some "cartoonish" but effective special effects. The gore is over the top, and one of the more memorable scenes is the mini-demon that pops out of the girl's back.

DEMONS takes place in Germany with two women meeting up. One of them, who slightly reminds me of Neve Campbell (the hottie she is!), is on a train and has a slightly disturbing experience when she is followed by a masked man, but he only wants to offer her a ticket to a free movie (but he's not what you think towards the end). They proceed to go to a cathedral-like theater where we are introduced to the other audience members (Urbano is the man in his role!) who are mostly doomed to a grim fate that starts when of the ladies with Urbano's character is scratched by a mask, ultimately leading to her turning into a hideous demon. From there, the demon plague spreads like wildfire and, in turn, many of the non-demons are left to fight against the horde of demons in the theater. The movie is downright disturbing but very campy and kinda silly, but it adds to the movie-within-a-movie premise. The ending did leave the film open, but DEMONS 2 would take the same premise in a different setting with just as gory results and some kind of neat special effects.

While very derivative of its time (Dawn of the Dead is better), DEMONS nonetheless is a good Italian horror film, very entertaining, sometimes scary, and downright gory. Don't let this movie infect you...
