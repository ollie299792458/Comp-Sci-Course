Hayao Miyazaki's 1988 film surely broadened the fans of his animation style from avid anime fans to wide range of ordinary audience. Also it is well-made marriage of his adventure-oriented animation and real-life oriented vivid one probably influenced by his long-time friend Isao Takahata.

The drama setting seems to be during 50s when the landscape like Totoro's home was pretty unhurt. Satsuki and Mei(both meaning the fifth month of the year) moved from the city to suburban Kanto Area somewhere near Tokorozawa where Seibu Stadium(home to Seibu Lions a newbie Major league player Daisuke Matsuzaka formerly belonged) is located. Until the mid stage the drama turns bitter twist. Their mother's illness seems really bad. Little Mei tries to meet her mother in the hospital mountains away but gets lost. Then Totoro finds amazing way to search for Satsuki's stranded sister. Totoro must have come from legendary ghost but don't bother. Totoro is too cute to be a goblin.

Miyazaki's work has well-made balance to avoid the drama turning so unreal. And the place used for the drama is almost intact and totoro fans now try hard in their National Trust Movement to preserve the home of Tororo.

Verdict: Probably the nice introduction to Miyazaki/Ghibli works.
