I could easily hold this show up as the reason I love anime: a wonderful story in a beautiful package.  I'm no anime snob; I don't think every show that comes out of Japan is made of solid gold; but when it is done right, there is almost nothing better.  This show has visual appeal: great, fluid animation with bright colors, well realized settings and engaging character designs.  It has a good plot: hidden conspiracies with world altering consequences must be discovered and foiled, but above all, Al and Ed must get their bodies back.  Great characterization: emotions are almost always genuine, the bond between the two brothers feels as real as if they were actual people, and even the secondary characters and villains have real motivation, real development, and you can see them changing more and more as the series progresses.  Great action, a fast pace, surprising thematic depth and pretty much no filler rounds out what makes this series stand head and shoulders above almost everything else out there, animated or otherwise.
