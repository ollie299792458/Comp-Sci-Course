Sadly I must add to the complaints about SHOUT using the old, poorly transfered, 1980's filmchain transfers that Columbia Pictures Television made for syndicating the shows. Columbia hacked off 4 minutes as well as the original Screen Gems logo at the end.

Then the old reel-to-reel 1" video tapes were copied & sent over to SFM who was going to synduicate the shows for FREE to TV stations in exchange for commercial time (called barter in the industry).  Now SFM replaced the Columbia Television logo with their tacky computer graphic SFM logo, replacing the original music as well.

Now that Sony owns Columbia Pictures, they retrieved the old edited 1" reel-to-reel video tapes from SFM & converted them over to more modern Beta SP cartridge tape, complete with all of the 20 year old video tape glitches.  Now they tagger their new Sony Television logo to the end, often after the SFM logo.

With the copyright owners not interested in releasing this show to home video, SHOUT Factory contracted the rights to do so.  Unfortunetaly SHOUT does not own the show & releases only what they are given & Sony gave them the 3rd generation dubs of the 20+ year old video tape film transfers.  SHOUT also removed all evidence of the previous TV syndicators logos (abruptly cutting the end credits) in hopes that we would not notice they are the cut syndication versions.

Based on the very good bonus material in this DVD, some effort was put into this release. But nobody wanted to invest the money to re-master the original fim negatives for this release, or the posterity of preserving the show.

It would have been nice if Sony had accessed Columbia's oroginal transfers before the edits were made, but it is possible they were erased.
