TROMA fans unite!!  Toxie 4 has arrived.
Just when you thought Kauffman and TROMA couldn't possibly top themselves with offensive, yet hysterical, material... they prove you wrong.  This is probably the MOST offensive TROMA film yet... but it's also the most "laugh-out-loud" offering from this risk-taking independent studio.  It's all here... killing "special" children, lynching black men, homosexual and lesbian sex, Nazis, extreme gore, and even God (played by Hank The Angry Dwarf from The Howard Stern Show).  But that's only a minor sampling of the outrageous content Toxie gets himself involved with in this (mis)adventure.  Throw in other great characters from previous TROMA hits (such as Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD) and you have a perfect indie studio signature piece.
This 2-disc set is also LOADED with extras (out-takes, deleted scenes, interviews, auditions, and more)!  The "making of" documentary is worth the price of the disc, itself!
If you love TROMA or if you're not afraid to laugh at extremely politically incorrect humor, this is a "must have" for your collection!
