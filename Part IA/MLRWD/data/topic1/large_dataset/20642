What a fantasia of French Filming!  Not being too familiar with the actresses, I went into this movie with an open mind.  No preconceived notions.  It took just a few moments to get used to reading the subtitles and watching the faces for the reactions and subtlety that makes the film what it is.  It is what I would call kitsch or campy, but that is not a terrible thing!  The sheer unexpectedness of suddenly bursting into song during a heated scene is magical.  The women are all beautiful in there way, and are able to reveal the facets of their character in such an intriguing way, that you are crying for more by the film's end.  The only thing that I personally found a little off about the movie is the overwhelming lesbian influences.  Don't get me wrong, I am not a judge on any form of sexuality or other supposed social morays or taboos, and certain character's sexuality is integral to the plot. It is just that this film seemed to be overflowing with it.  Which to me, distracted from the plot, rather than adding to it.  All in all, an excellent choice that has become a permanent part of my film collection.
