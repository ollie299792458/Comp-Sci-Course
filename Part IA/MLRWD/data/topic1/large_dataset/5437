John Hughes was behind some of the most revered teen movies of the 1980s and beyond. Several of his films (i.e. The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off) have achieved pop culture immortality, so it's a bit surprising that one of his best contributions to the genre remains relatively unknown. He supposedly made Some Kind of Wonderful because he was unsatisfied with the ending to his previous film with director Howard Deutch, Pretty in Pink. The similarities between the two movies are numerous and occasionally glaring, but this time the characters are more tangible and their situations are less contrived. Some Kind of Wonderful centers on Keith Nelson (Eric Stoltz), an artsy misfit from a blue-collar family who pines for Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson), the most popular girl in school. Like Keith, Amanda is from the "wrong side of the tracks," but she uses her good looks to elevate her status. Keith's best friend Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) is an angsty social outcast.  She's falling hard for Keith, but he remains frustratingly oblivious. The plot may sound like a typical high school soap opera, but this is a story of redemption. The sheer amount of hard work, humor, and sensitivity contributed by the cast and crew elevates this film above the clich&eacute;.  The lead actors, particularly Masterson, offer pitch-perfect performances. Sidekicks like Duncan the Skinhead (Elias Koteas) and Keith's younger sisters (played by Maddie Corman and a pre-Full House Candace Cameron) deliver hilarious one-liners. Combine all of that with one of the best soundtracks of the 80s, and you have the recipe for a Hughes classic. 4 Stars.
