Since it's release, King Kong has remained one of the greatest, most influential adventure/monster films ever made.
The direction is atmospheric but quite typical for this time period and for a film of this sort.
Edgar Wallace and Merian C. Cooper's use of a `Beauty and the Beast'-type storyline is quite interesting. The film provides a unique take on the classic tale.
The acting is very melodramatic, as it is in many films released during this time period, but in a way that makes the film fun. Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot are so hammy that they are, at times, comical to watch. Frank Reicher is quite convincing as Captain Englehorn. Fay Wray is good at playing the damsel in distress. 
Max Steiner's grand musical score suits the magnitude of the film nicely.
Ted Cheesman's editing is great. Though the film has a short running time of only 100 minutes, it does stay interesting throughout.
The legendary special effects are clearly dated by today's standards but it's easy to see how believable they would have been in 1933.
King Kong is not the groundbreaking film it was when it was released but it still manages to be a wonderfully enjoyable movie.
