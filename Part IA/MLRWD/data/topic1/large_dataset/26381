This is a true classic, the film came out in October 1981; and I remember watching it with my parents. I was around 10 years old; and it scared the S**T out of me. It has a great cast and the storyline is terrific. It's about a mentally challenged man who is wrongfully convicted of murder, when a group of viganties find out the take matters into their own hands. They track him down at his home where he is hiding in as a scarecrow. The leader of the pack is Otis Hazelrig, Charles During, he finds out that Bubba is hiding as the scarecrow and tells his buddies to open fire. The next thing U see is Hocker, Lane Smith on a CB, talking one of the guys in town. The truth comes out that Bubba didn't kill Marylee, he saved her from a dog jumping her. Once the truth comes out they couldn't believe what they were hearing. The case then goes to trial and as usual they get off; and think everything is fine and dandy.  Then each of those men resposible for the murder of Bubba,start getting killed off. It is time for the justice to be served which should have been done in the courts, but failed. This is a great revenge movie and it teaches people never take the law into your own hands; and to respect others regardless of disability.
