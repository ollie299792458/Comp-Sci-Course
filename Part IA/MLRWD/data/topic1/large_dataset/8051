Steven Spielberg and Debbie Allen's exercise of poetic license through this docudrama frames another awesome revelation of the historic, bitter Slavery roots of noble America, a nation of immigrants. It lends a new appreciation for the term "African American", just as elsewhere we have come to better understand "Native American". It is "a story about mankind... the very nature of man".
The epic human struggle combined with the historic realities of effects like Jefferson-Hennings descendants and an American President's recent symbolic pilgrimage to the "point of no return" on Coreo Island off the coast of West Africa are instructive of the noble spirits of American liberty springing in part from the tortured roots of Slavery, and provides this old white guy with a far better insight into the imperatives for an African American (Smithsonian) Museum.
Those great cultures forcibly contributed much of the basic values of our America; and these, our roots in splendid diversity, allow a far more robust and spiritual human ecology that we know as America, compared to the centuries of virulently tribal isolationism elsewhere now so obviously center stage in world affairs.
