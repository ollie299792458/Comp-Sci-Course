Im a huge comic book fan (just started reading them again recently) and especially love movies based on them. Ive only read one Iron man comic in my life and read other comics that include him with other heroes. But I knew I had to see this movie. Some doubted Downy JR as Tony Stark aka Iron Man because of his past. But he prooved everyone why he was perfect for the role.

This is on my list of the 5 best superhero movies of all time which includes Spiderman, Spiderman 2, Incredible Hulk and Blade.

I bought the 2 disc edition at Target which came in a different package. You get the box but the dvds itself come in a cool case that is shaped and looks like Iron Man's mask. Its the same price as this edition with the same special features but the only difference is the case.

The dvd is loaded with special features that include:

Deleted and Extended scenes (comes with the 1 disc edition as well but thats what it only has)
Behind the scenes
Still Galaries
and so much more

This dvd is perfect for any fan of comics, especially of Iron Man, or if you just love super hero movies or just a fan of movies with tons of action and special effects. This dvd is perfect for anyone.
