I've read the Tintin comic books (have all the hardcover sets they sell here on Amazon), and have seen the Nelvana cartoon series (which is pretty much completely lifted from the comic books).  Love them all!  So many times I have been disappointed when Hollywood takes something I love, adapts it to the big screen, and completely ruins it so that any resemblance between the movie and the original is pure coincidence.  With Spielberg and Jackson at the helm, I expected a high quality production, but what about the actual story?

This movie takes elements from three Tintin books - "The Crab with the Golden Claws", "The Secret of the Unicorn", and "Red Rackham's Treasure".  Most of "The Crab..." that's in the movie is about how Tintin and Captain Haddock met.  In "Unicorn", the flea market scenes actually took place AFTER Tintin and Haddock met, as Tintin had bought the model ship as a gift for his friend.  But in the movie, he bought the ship before he met Haddock.

But unless you are that much of a stickler for details, this shouldn't matter.  With the exception of these few details, the story was very true to the books and the Nelvana animated series.  What was even better was how the characters were written; I am sure Herge would have approved, as they were just as he intended them to be.  All the personality quirks of Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, Thomson & Thompson, etc - all there as we remember them.  I thought they did a great job with the casting, as well.

I was afraid they'd ruin this movie by doing something dumb like bringing on a love interest for Tintin (something that never happened in the books, but Hollywood often can't leave stuff alone).  This is an adventure story, not a romance, and it was wise of Spielberg/Jackson to treat it as such.

The ending of the movie left me begging for a sequel.  I hope they do make one, and it's to the same standards as this one.  This Tintin fan loved it!
