The movie 'Uncle Buck' is one of my daughter's favorites...
A big fan of John Candy, she has been asking for this one for a long time, so I finally purchased it for a Christmas gift for her.
I love this movie, myself, having been a fan also from way back, and this movie does not disappoint.
From start to finish, with the entire cast, the story is endearing and human...
In the beginning, when Uncle Buck first comes to stay, one is given the impression that he is a ne'er do well, down on his luck and on the verge of losing his life's love, due to a lack of wanting to commit to her.
When he gets the call from his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their three children, as the two of them have to go out of town, he agrees to come for a few days, much to the dismay of the kids...and what follows is a series of events, escalating in both hilarity and warmth.
By the end, he has become both the hero to his girlfriend and the legendary 'favorite Uncle' to his nephew and nieces.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a fun ride in John Candy fashion...I promise you will not regret it!
