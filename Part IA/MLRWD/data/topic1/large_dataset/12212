To start off this movie has to have the best cinemetography of recent movies. The lighting and camera work by Conrad Hall is the some of the best I have seen in the neo-noir genre. When watching this film it looks like it was shot back in the day as classic noir movies such as "Out of the Past". This along with a great musical score by Thomas Newman who also did the music for the neo-noir Shawshank Redemption is brilliant here with its dramatic poise along with upbeat tempos. Listening to just the soundtrack gives the audience the impression of what is happening throughout the film. The acting is beautiful as far as Jude Law, Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are concerned. One of the only roles that Tom Hanks has played a bad guy and he plays it with much depth. With being this cold blooder killer he also has a heart. Sam Mendes, the director of American Beauty succeeds again with a brilliant direction of going through this tragedy from beginning to end. At the end you feel for the characters with its bittersweet ending as in American Beauty. If you are a fan of old film-noir movies this will take you back to the place when they first started in the 40's and will amaze you how lighting and camera work alone can make a film that much more beautiful than the drama and tragedy happening on the screen.
