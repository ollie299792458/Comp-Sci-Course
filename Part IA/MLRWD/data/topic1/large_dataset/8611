This is an excellent movie for kids over the age of 8-10; it's so scary to little people, (My own grandchildren freaked out @ 6 and 7! I thought it would be OK because I was explaining how they were just puppets, blah, blah.  Perhaps your own children/grandkids are not as naive, but, none-the-less a word of warning, now they love it, but it's years later and they appreciate the work that went into the making of it.)  I was dissappointed in the grainy, less than great color of the VHS version.  I was told not to buy the DVD before Christmas, so I may get it as a gift.  The DVD customer reviews sound like the color and sound are much more detailed and clear.  I'll wait.
Enjoy the faces and places that came from Jim Henson and Frank Oz' imagination, we won't get to enjoy Jim's anymore.  The movie itself can be a tad bit slow in parts, but the overall effects with the great puppetry-awsome.  The story is a little predictable, but I don't watch everything expecting to have a brainstorm from it. This is a kick-back, check it out movie for a dark, rainy day.
