...and aren't you glad? Really? A remake of the original would be a travesty!

Kidman is luminous as always and very funny in moments as a witch who wasn't allowed to watch Bewitched when she was growing up.

Caine is fab. Farrell is bearable. There are some great supporting actors.

This ISN'T an especially clever movie, but it has some wonderful moments (the scene where, in her reading, Kidman's character abandons the script and comes out which such classics as needing a licence for a poisoned apple, is great fun, and Kidman discovering things like ring-pull cans etc is thoroughly charming).

The weak point IMO is that Farrel is essentially rather unlikable and irritating, and really not very funny at all. Some great supporting actors and the fabulous Kidman make it a bearable little romcom which will bring back good memories of Montgomery and co in the original (and best).

It isn't the greatest movie out there, but for a night in with the girls and some harmless fun, I've seen a LOT worse! Some good giggles, some interesting extras... I wouldn't recommend paying much for it, but it's a little bit of fluffy fun that's not nearly as bad as it's made out to be. PLUS - it will make you want to see the originals again :)
