Of all the characters in the film that no one has mentioned or remember is Willi Cicci (Joe Spinell), who was a very comical and cold character. If you remember the "Baptism in Blood" scene in the first Godfather, you will remember a man getting a shave before he is sent out to "push a button" on a guy. That is Cicci, later he shoots down the man passing through the revolving door three times. In the Godfather part II, we first see Cicci was Frankie's bodyguard at the Communion. With his rock n' roll shades and a lit cig, he demonstrates his cool attitude. Although Cicci has only two more scenes (the scene where Frankie is nearly killed and the Hearings on the Corleone Family.) It is sad that he is forgotten, but we can assume his character goes to jail or meets his fate with a bullet. Al Neri, Rocco, Tom and Fredo steal the show in the end. Yes Micheal is a tremendous character and in my opinion did the best he could (except for trusting Roth to do business with.) Some of the best lines to me are: "Difficult, but not impossible." "Why do you hurt me Micheal, I've always been loyal to you?" "I'm your older bother and I got stepped over, IT AIN'T THE WAY I WANTED IT!" Some of my friends debate whether Fredo should have been killed or not. Yes it was sad in the end because he was such a loveable character at times. But it goes back to the time of Machiavelli, in that those weakest in your family must be destoryed or controlled. It could have been only a matter of time until Fredo became jealous once again and tried to put the Family in danger. Reading these past reviews there are a few things I have read that have made me question Coppola. The biggest is the fact that Micheal seemed to distrust or dislike Tom Hagen. In the book they quickly get over any hard feelings, yet the jealousy of Tom still lingers but only briefly. Oh and just for the curious types it was Roth "who enginered it all along."
