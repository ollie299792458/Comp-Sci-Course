"A Dirty Shame" is a mediocore film at best. I'm a big fan of John Waters. I respect what he has done over the years and have found many of his films absolutely hilarious. Unfortunately, that was not the case with "A Dirty Shame".

While the performances are quite good, the script itself is not. The idea of the movie is pretty fun, but the actual dialogue and scenes aren't that great.

Tracy Ullman plays Sylvia Stickles, an uptight housewife with a oversexed stripper daughter (Selma Blair), and a horny husband (Chris Isaac). When Sylvia injures her head in a car accident and receives some immediate oral gratification afterwards- she becomes an over the top sex addict looking for anyone....just anyone to go down South on her.

She subsequently realizes that there is a whole underground group of sex addicts out there, all with previous head injuries (her own daughter included) who are running amok- and eventually looking to find some sort of new sexual position that will apparently start up a sexual revolution of some sort.

At the same time, there small little town is suddenly becoming over run with sexual perversion, and its up to Sylvia's mother Big Ethel (a very funny Suzanne Shepherd) and neighbors (most notably Marge the Neuter played by none other than Mink Stole) to restore their peaceful little community to the way it once was.

Johnny Knoxville plays Ray Ray, a tow truck driver and leader of this sexual underground revolution- and his performance is by far the best and most entertaining that the film has to offer.

This reviewer doesn't want to say too much about the film, only that if you're a John Waters fan, its certainly worth a viewing. However, in the end- this film is just not one of Waters best- and after years of shocking his audiences- it's possible......just possible that John Waters has run out of ideas to shock us with and has lost the majority of the "edge" that has made him such a classic cult filmmaker.

For fans only.....
