"Exploding Heads, Creepy Crawlies and Date for the formal". It was 1986 or 1987 when I was on vacation in Santa Cruz. I saw this film with my brother and have loved it ever since. It is the best blend of comedy, horror and campiness that has ever been filmed. The cast is lead by Tom Atkins. He will always bring a smile to my face whenever I see his face because of his character in this film. He has some of the greatest one-liners in cult film history. "Thrill Me" "No Bullwinkle Moose" I've got good news and bad news girls, the good news is your dates are here, ("what's the bad news"), "They're dead". "Get the 12 Gauge outta my car, Now". "Well well well, if it isn't spanky and alfalfa". I could go on all night long with this. The rest of the cast is perfect. Jason Lively plays Chris. He is in love with Cynthia played by the most beautiful girl you will ever see, Jill Whitlow. Also there is J.C. who is his best friend. Those four dominate the movie along with the Bradster. He plays the boyfriend of Cynthia until he shows what a rotten person he is. All of them are dodging little slugs that enter thru your mouth and incubate in your brain, making you a mindless zombie. Sounds good, it's better when you watch it. Finally the music is very special to any movie and this movie has one of the best soundtrtacks I can think of. It has a lot of 50's music, because the first part takes place in the 50's. Do not miss this opportunity to buy the DVD. It is packed with the best best extras I have seen since Battlestar Galactica(The original series) was released. 10 out of 10!!!!
