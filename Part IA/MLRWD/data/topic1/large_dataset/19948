well, I can start it off and say "this aint the best movie I've ever seen". it doesnt have this remarkable plot, nor this remarkable choose of cast. it didnt made me laugh at all. well, maybe just one time.
so here I go and give this movie four stars. lets make it clear: I know that this scale is from 1 to 5, with 5 stars being the best. yeh, I still give it a 4, and not despite of what I said, but in spite.
every 5 minutes the main character, played by ashley judd changes her perspective about life, men and whatnot. she even comes up with that theory, bonding men and cows into one strange web. strange huh?. "she's gone wayyyyy out far with that one" some will say, and I'll have to partly agree with it. 
but come to think about our normal lives, we all do it, especially with our love lives!. we always try to rationalize everything in life, and give explains to everything, and truth is, sometimes you just gotta play this game, without asking yourself "why am I doing this, or that", and just enjoy yourself.
thats the whole essence of that movie! thats why its not extremely catchy, sticky and everything. it avoids from being pretentious, or delivering this never-been-seen-before plot. thats your avarage life, right there!!. it convies you with a sweet feeling in the end, which being passed throughout bitterness, sharpness and with just a bit of sticky sweet love. just like in real life, where buying a guitar for some girl wont make it up to the fact that you've been paid for asking her to the prom. those stories do accour in life.
