This movie gives excruciatingly bad new meaning altogether. Just when I thought The Road and Blue couldn't be topped in presenting a bleak, depressingly drawn out film along comes Never Let Me Go and makes me rethink how bad cinema can get. We are presented with three children in this movie who are told of the fate that awaits them as organ donors yet although given nearly every opportunty refuse to try and live a normal life. Instead, they gleefully just hand over their organs one by one, ostensibly for.. the good of a society that treats them like cattle and doesn't even acknowledge the idea of them having souls? Somehow, I think they just might rebel against such a fate. Yet no, they do not. They are all too eager to fulfill the destiny set before them and leave it at that. This film is a study in complete and total mindless subservience to a system for which the lead characters should feel no sense of loyalty or duty to whatsoever yet we are meant to feel empathy for their condition? I'm sorry, but I felt none for them since they couldn't be bothered to even respect themselves in the slightest.
