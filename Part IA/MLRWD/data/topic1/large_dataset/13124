Well here we go again. It's very insulting that Hollywood feels they must continue this pathetic quest to remake good films and turn them into garbage. What gets me is how anyone can agree to finance these ridiculous screenplays. Why bother remaking films that have already made their mark? You might as well match up four young slobs with cute faces and call them the Beatles. Then again, if that could be done, some jerk would back it! I have often run into people who have no clue that these films are remakes. Sad indeed. The recent rehashing of "King Kong", "The War Of The Worlds", "Dawn Of The Dead" and many others have the knack of preying on a person's nerves. If the rotten acting isn't bad enough then the political correctness seals their fate. This new remake of "The Fog" gives us yet more proof that originality is no longer a part of film making. The original is a classy, effective film with a creepy atmosphere, great storyline and good acting. In other words, something a fan of horror flicks can watch and never grow tired of. As is the case with 99.9% of these remakes, this piece of junk should be cleaned and burned. Give it a rest already. It's stale.
