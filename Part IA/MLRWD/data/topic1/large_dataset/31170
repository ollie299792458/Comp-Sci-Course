I remember seeing a trailer for SHAUN OF THE DEAD as a preview to another movie I was seeing at the 'insert name of major theater chain' Cineplex 16.  I made an immediate mental note NOT to miss this one, as the concept was totally original.  More on that in a moment.

As it turns out, I never got to see it. So once the DVD was available, I raced to the video store to pick up a copy. What a wise investment it turned out to be.

Unlike the completly regrettable so-called 'horror comedies' in the 'Scary Movie-esque' style, SHAUN is for all intents a legitimate horror flick. The film does not attempt to sacrifice macabre for laughs; rather, it weaves the humour into the horror.

One of the creepiest aspects of apocalyptic horror movies is that critical first day, when we first get a glimpse of the collapse of society, in this case brought on by the zombi-fication of, well, everybody.  How does our pal Shaun process this?  By completely overlooking the bloody handprints on the cooler door at his favorite convenience store.  What a stud!

And not to give away the ending, but the film actually comes up with a cure for death.

SHAUN OF THE DEAD is an ingenious blend of comedy and gore, and makes a genuine stab--if you will--at layering its characters (my favorite scene is the argument among Shaun, Ed, and the other flat-mate at 4:00a).  It's a movie I'll be watching many more times, at least before sunset.
