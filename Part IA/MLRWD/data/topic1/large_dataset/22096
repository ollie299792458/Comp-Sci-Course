I've been a loyal fan of ZZ Top since the days of ZZ Top's First Album and Rio Grande Mud. I even saw them sans beards back in 1973 at the Commodore in Vancouver (about the size of the Fillmore), with Bachman Turner Overdrive as the opening act. During the 70s when I was in my 20s, I played drums in my own 3-piece rock band, and of course played many ZZ Top covers, like La Grange, Nasty Dogs & Funky Kings etc. Followed their progress for years, and never failed to enjoy their music, even during the synthesizer era.

Fast forward to 2009, when I purchased their live DVD, "Live From Texas". As a longtime supporter, my reaction is nothing less than "what a treat", considering the audio is so in-your-face and the video is crystal-clear. There's nothing disappointing or crappy to offend my ancient ears AT ALL! I love it all! Sure, the band are legal seniors now, but their brilliant rockin' show only serves to demonstrate just how rock and roll is performed properly by old craftsmen and masters of their art. Highly recommended for dedicated ZZ Top enthusiasts.
