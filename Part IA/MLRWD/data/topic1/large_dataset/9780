When Robbie (a young Tom Hanks) returns to college after being thrown out of another school for playing too much "Mazes & Monsters," his new friends Kate, Daniel, and Jay Jay convince him to take up the fantasy role-playing game once more. Unfortunately for Robbie, the line between fantasy and reality blurs with tragic results.

So bad that its good, this is one film that Tom Hanks probably wishes he could expunge from his career. In fact, if it weren't for Tom Hanks in the cast, this movie would have languished permanently in a film vault somewhere. Those that remember the film "Meatballs" fondly should note Chris Makepeace in the role of Jay Jay.

Made during the 1980s anti-Dungeons & Dragons hysteria, this is one film you wish the Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew would have lambasted; An overly sentimental and hastily made B-movie (based on an overly sentimental hastily written B-grade novel), this is best watched with a group of friends, a six-pack of beer, and a huge bowl of popcorn. However, without Tom Servo or Crow T. Robot, you'll have to supply your own heckling.

Great fun !
