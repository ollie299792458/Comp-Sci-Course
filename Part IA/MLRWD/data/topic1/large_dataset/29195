I've put off buying this movie for years.  I always loved the movie, but since I had already recorded it off tv, I had no real reason to.  But when I saw the Dvd version, I just had to get it.  It was excellent!  Not just the quality of the movie--it looked brand new--but the extras also.  For one, the movie is uncut.  For those who have seen this movie on broadcast tv, there are several seens cut out.  The is an extended scene where Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson are driving down a road on their way to Wayne Manor.  This is at the begining of the movie just before Batman and Robin try to board a mysterious yaht.  Then there is a scene where Batman calls the navy to ask them about a submarine they sold to the Penguin.

Also included, is the original trailer for the film, a teaser and a French trailor.  But the gem of the package is the commentary by Adam West and Burt Ward.  The commentary is just as entertaining as the movie is.  They go into great detail how the scenes were shot, who came up with what idea, the in-jokes, and even the television show itself.  They laugh at the campy scenes just as any of us would.  They don't take themselves seriously which ads to the charm.

There is also a in depth interview with the creater of the Batmobile.  He has some humorous tales about the show as well and explains everything about the Batmobile down to what kind of engine it had and how they got the flame to shoot out the back.  If you are a fan of Batman, you need to buy this, you will love it.
