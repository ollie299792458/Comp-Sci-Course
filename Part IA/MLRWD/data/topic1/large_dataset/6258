Ok, all the ex-military viewers who have been in similar (very rare) situations have chimed in about how the dialogue did not fit the situation.  Or else that was just a bunch of movie watchers that object to things being said differently than Rambo would have said it.  Either way, consider the possibility that it takes a pretty cool customer to survive that type of situation. 
This movie combined many of the new directing techniques that have been evolving in the last few years. They contribute to the energy and (I'm assuming) the realism of some action scenes, which are pretty spectacular in this movie.  The plot had enough twists to make it unique and interesting compared to many of the past "find the lost soldier" films over the years.  It added some depth to the story.
Granted the bad guys couldn't shoot straight, but they didn't have too many clear opportunities (until the end), and John Wayne got famous battling gunmen who apparently lost all motor skills upon drawing their weapons.  The ending belonged in a James Bond film, all we needed was a babe pulling him into the helicopter.  I was pleased enough with the rest of the movie to overlook that.
