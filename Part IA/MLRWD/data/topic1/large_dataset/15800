Wow. Pulp Fiction amazed me in a way I didn't think was possible in a movie of it's kind.
John Travolta plays Vincent Vega, a somewhat dimwitted hitman who is works with a fellow hitman, a somewhat smarter assassin named Jules Winfield. They have snappy conversations back and forth, ones just like I have with my brother so often. Bruce Willis is Butch Coolidge, a down on his luck boxer who is on the run from Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), a violent crime boss. Uma Thurman is his wife, Mia, and Harvey Keitel is the problem-solving Winston Wolfe. Christopher Walken has a hilarious cameo as a former POW who delivers a special watch to Butch, and Quentin Tarantino portrays the only non-tough guy in the film, Jimmy, with amazing authenticity.
Jackson is thunderingly powerful when he quotes Ezekiel 25.17, and Travolta generates laughter with his bumbling mistakes and volatile attitude. Thurman is oddly sterile in her conversations for reasons I can't figure out, and Rhames always talks annoyingly slowly, but the rest of the actors, expecially Keitel, shine brightly. The redeeming of Jackson's character at the end of Pulp Fiction is almost heart warming.
If there is a downside, it is the part of the movie centering around Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames. It is really boring, and is also the most adult part of Pulp Fiction. I wouldn't mind if it was all cut out.
The realism in Pulp Fiction is just wonderful. This is a very adult movie, only for the mature. It isn't particularly graphic (at least, the version I saw wasn't) but it has tons of f-word vulgarities. It portrays the underworld with surprising gritty realism.
