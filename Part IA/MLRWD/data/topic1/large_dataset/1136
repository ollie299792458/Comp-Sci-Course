Right off the bat in the first episode you can see that the series took its first huge change of direction. We see a new girl to replace Sabrina Duncan (Kate Jackson)- Tiffany Welles (Shelley Hack), more color, faster pace in plots and dialogue, and a more girly kind of vibe. The plots seem the same (I think), but they just cut to the chase quite faster and don't leave room for you to think too much. Shelley Hack does a good job I feel and she ups the anty in the beauty and fashion areas, and I don't believe that she killed the ratings it was the writers fault. Saying that Kate Jackson made the show is giving her too much credit. My favorite Angel, Kris Munroe (Cheryl Ladd), is still here and Jaclyn Smith too; they were the true angels because they stayed the longest. Overall season 4 is very different than season's 1-3 and I feel it was changed to give the show something more to look at visually that exudes girliness, fashion, fun, and less to think about because everything is served to you quickly. As are most complaints in Charlies Angels episodes in all the season's, the recipes for the episodes don't really change much. They should have made this season darker and dangerous to combat the girliness and colorfulness that this season brought, oh well. Finally, whether you are a new, casual, or die-hare fan, I feel that season 4 is worth buying just like all the rest.
