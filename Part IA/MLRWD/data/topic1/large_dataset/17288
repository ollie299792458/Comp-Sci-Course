The story takes place in ancient Japan. A mysterious outbreak occurs in a nearby village and a team of ninja warriors are sent out to investigate. As the entire group is killed, except for one woman survivor it is then realized that there are evil forces at work. Jubei, our traveling hero finds himself trapped in the middle of this confrontation and must face the 7 demons of the dark.
What can I say Ninja Scroll was off da hook!!! For all those that didn't like NS pick up your toys and go back to watching your Pokemon. This is a real man's anime!
I loved every minute of NS. The animation, fight scenes, and the characters were awesome!! There wasn't a thing that I didn't like about the movie. Everything in NS flows smoothly. Near the end a lot of things are made clear. For example you learn why the ninja woman's beauty is considered a curse and why fate has pulled Jubei into this war. This movie is something that the hardcore adult anime fan can enjoy. If you like gore, a little nudity, and excellent fight scenes in your anime then this is the title for you!
I suggest Ninja Scroll for 17+ due to all the nudity and violence it contains. Ninja Scroll will be a classic throughout the ages and it's safe to say that it's one that I'll NEVER get tired of!!!
