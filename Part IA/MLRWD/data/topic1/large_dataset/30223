This movie was hilarious and educational and sad.  I'm a Latina, the minority, in a mostly African American work environment.  Almost daily I listen as my African American female coworkers (the men could care less) talk about the hair of customers and coworkers. . . very negative.  "She looks like a poodle"  "Her tracks are showing."  "She needs to pull that lace front back up."  I myself can't tell the difference from weave, a lace front or a wig .  I rented this movie because my daughter is Hispanic/African American. Everyone LOVES her hair, except for her so I wanted her to see what other women go through to "feel beautiful."  We were both shocked at the amount of money women spend on hair treatments.  More shocking was how much damage the chemical in perm solution can cause.  I was also glad to see that Chris interviewed people from ALL walks of life (celebrity to school teacher) and went to various salons from the high end to the salon around the corner in a strip mall.  I also enjoyed the short expose on the Bronner Brothers hair show held annually in Atlanta, where I live.  The movie not only highlighted the impact hair has on the African American culture but also the economic impact on the African American culture and the business world.
