I felt deeply ambivalent right after I started watching this documentary, wondering why a man would expose his parents' marriage to public scrutiny. It seemed almost rude, what some might call "unseemly"..and I'm betting there are viewers who will feel uncomfortable and stop watching this film. .

But my discomfort faded as I realized that the film captured universal hopes and fears about parents, children, marriage, and family dynamics. Do we really know our parents? How do we perceive them- and how accurate are our perceptions? What if we discover family secrets after one parent dies? And how do we integrate that info into our grief?

I found these themes to be reason enough to watch this movie. As I did I couldn't help but reflect on my own parents as well as wondering more about how my children, now adults, see me...and what they will remember when I am gone.

Doug  Block, the filmmaker, was already creating documentaries when he turned the camera on his own family. Even before his mother died, he had been filming her, his father, and siblings. Then, in only a few short weeks, she went from illness to death.

Still reeling, Block watches his father make some surprising decisions and changes in his life. From then on I was hooked.

Then Block discovers his mother's journals and learns about aspects of her life he'd never imagined. He also gains new insight about his father . The journals compel him to revisit his childhood and to examine the "reality" of his parents' marriage ...as well as marriage in general.

Rather than capturing "reality" Block actually shares his own views and perceptions about his parents and siblings. It is fascinating to watch as he grapples with the ethics of digging into the past. He asks a rabbi and others  for guidance, clearly conflicted and struggling with guilt.

Ultimately the film stands as an open and honest look at one family as well as  potential challenges faced by all couples.
