The Beach, although cliche filled, is in my opinion a fantastic eye opener. After veiwing the film i could not help but watch it over and over for the next month. The sense of adventure captured in the film had my brain racing. A journey, a search for something new and different, somewhere that takes us away from the comforts and also annoyances/distractions of home. Something so many of us can relate to, the want to escape normal life by exploring our world.
I did not see this film as just something to watch, yet found myself feeling the journey as though it were my own. The pristine beach takes you away to a whole new world, my own imagination running wild.
The charcters are well portrayed, and although some of Richards voice-overs are extremely cliche, most actually make you think and understand what is really going on. Not just voice-overs, yet an inner-monolouge helping us to feel the film as such, and not just veiw it.
Life for Richard,his two French friends and somewhat relations thanks to the Beach,and the rest of the 'villagers' seems to be getting better and better. Suddenly things take a down-hill turn when Richard bravely conquers a shark. From here on it feels like you are watching a crazy dream develop before your eyes. Death and insanity are what leads this plummeting life-stlye and it seems like everything will never be resovled.
The movie ends on a some what uplifting note yet makes you feel a surreal sense of loss. In a way you cannot really believe that this crazy adventure you have just viewed is simply a film and it really leaves you wanting more of its beauty and challenging adventure.
