So I went to see this movie not expecting much of anything at all.  And I left the theater in awe- on the verge of seriously damaged, introspective and with much to think about. Not only was this film asthetically breathtaking, it was one that made you question a lot.  It pains me to hear it passed off as "just another one of those 'drug movies'" because it  was so much more than that.  It was a commentary on The American Dream.  The dream that has been glamorized in this society, was bashed and proven self-destructive and unrealistic in under three hours.  Yes, addiction did play a major role in this film but so did the idea that life is giving rather than getting (to loosely borrow the phrase from Selby) And it was the characters obsession with recieval that led to their downfall.  Asthetically- the movie was mesmerizing, haunting, addictive... the colors, the angles, the music- every frame a beautiful picture (in the begining anyways).  Basically, it saturated me and invaded my thoughts (even still, months after the fact)  And thus my need to purge my feelings on this amazing film.
