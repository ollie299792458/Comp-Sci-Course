Eugene Levy and Christopher Guest have pulled off another great "mockumentary" surrounding the owners of show-dogs as they compete in what appears to be the superbowl of Dog Shows.

Following a series off characters, all of whom are odd in some way, makes for great entertainment.  The low-budget nature of the film adds to its realistic hilarity, though at times the humour is a bit over-the-top.  I found myself laughing frequently at this film, enjoying the strange and eccentric people that continually parade across the screen - and that doesn't even take into account the dogs!  Which reminds me - if you love dogs, as I do, then you will enjoy the many and varied canines that are on display here.

I particularly commend Levy as an awkward, sensitive man with two left feet - literally.  His constant demeanor of confusion and caring is hilarious and highlights Levy's comedic abilities that have made me laugh for 15 years since SCTV reruns where on TV.

I was also surprised and delighted by Fred Willard's absolutely hilarious role as the half-witted, over-talkative and misinformed announcer for the dog show.  His antics were brilliantly pulled off and were the source of a great deal of my laughter.

This movie in style, comedy and even characters is little different from Waiting for Guffman (I have not seen This is Spinal Tap), so if you did not like Guffman's brand of humour, you will want to avoid this.

Otherwise, sit back and enjoy!
