You know what I hate people that put reviews up even before the item is out and the prior review gave it 3 stars what are you smokin sir.  This will be the best picture release of these films (until paramount re-releases again like they normally do).

Generations:
-Good starting point the story is slow at times but it is worth it to see Kirk one final time in action.

First Contact:
-Best of the 4 movies excellent story and fast paced action.  If you love the borg you cannot miss this film.

Insurrection:
-A lot of people hated this film I really liked it because it reminded me of Star Trek 4 in it had a lot of humor and didnt take itself too seriously.  It is just a really long episode, but some funny parts in it.

Nemesis:
-I really wanted to like this movie, the whole clone of Captain Picard is an awesome story that way more should have been done.  There really isnt any suspense and John Myers is an excellent actor but I didnt like him as the villian.  But having Ron Pearlman as his right hand and one of the female Rolumans played by the actor who was Dizzy in Starship Troopers are the bright points in the film.

Bonus:
-I cannot wait to check out the disc the one in the Original bluray set the Captains Summitt was excellent and very informative.

If you are a Trek fan there is no doubt you need to pick these up.  I will still keep my DVD discs anyways but this is going to be the best picture you will have for these movies so far.  Also Amazons Preorder price is damn good.
