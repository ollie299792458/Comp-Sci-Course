They used to air this on t.v., probably annually, and I miss those days. It's one of the better musicals in my opinion, and one of my mother's favorites so that's what prompted the purchase.
I guess the 5 dollar movie clearance bin has spoiled me because I balk at $20 movies when they aren't new releases. I suppose I have to say it was worth it though, not to mention, even the non anniversary version is nearly the same high price. It was nice to see once again, it's as charming and timeless as you would expect from something so widely loved. The theme addresses slavery and racism, where the civil war is being fought on one side of the globe and the Europeans are practicing expansion for the prevention of barbarianism. If I had something negative to say it would be that with as much independence or as the king says, "difficulty" as Anna exhibits she puts herself in as much of a derogatory position as the other women are forced into. I guess her love for the king is special, because no matter how many wives he has, she's worth just a bit more to him. I didn't find it as touching when I thought about that.
On the whole it's flawless, and beautifully decorated, performed and sung. The extras which we haven't finished are a nice touch (once again, disappointed that there is not closed captioning available for the extras like commentary - I guess it never occurred to these people that it's old people that like musicals; the kids are either at the rock concerts or the boy band concerts preparing their ears for closed captioning in the future). It was surprising to learn a lot of the songs were dubbed. Anna's voice was provided by Marni Nixon who also sang for Eliza in My Fair Lady. I should have known Audrey Hepburn couldn't sing like that!
