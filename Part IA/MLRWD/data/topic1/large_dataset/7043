I decided to rent season 1 from Blockbuster and I fell in love with this crazy group of doctors. I then preordered season 2 and when I was done I loved it even more. This is not your generic comedy, for one thing it has no laugh track which makes it better and they can do just about anything, there have been heads melting, limbs cut off, talking babies (all in fantasies of course). Zach Braff as Dr. JD Dorian is a comic genius, just about everything he says makes you wanna roll off your couch. My favorite is the janitor, played by Neil Flynn who improves nearly every line and when he shows up you know something good is coming. There are also tender and sad moments, which occasionally give it some depth.

Now to the season itself. As of this moment I have seen 1,2, and 5 so I don't know how it compares to the others but this has some of best moments in the show's history. The special features are great, with deleted scenes, outtakes, and interivews. And I urge EVERYONE to watch the audio commentaries by Bill Lawrence, the creator, and the actors, it's so entertaining to learn about the small things, like they ramble on for a few minutes about the background doctors.

Season 5 is my favorite right now, but if you are a Scrubs fan, this is a must-own and even if you are new, you will fall in love right away.
