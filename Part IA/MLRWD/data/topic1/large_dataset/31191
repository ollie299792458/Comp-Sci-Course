The Horse Whisperer, a 1998 production by Touchstone Pictures and directed by Robert Redford runs for 169 minutes.  Starring in this romance drama are Robert Redford and Kristin Scott Thomas.  As the movie takes us from New York City across country to the open skies of Montana we see scenery unsurpassed by any other film of the year.  You can almost spell the mountain air as we travel through the rolling hills of a working Montana cattle ranch.  The Academy award nominated sound track adds the finishing touch.
 We share in Annie MacLean's (Thomas) heartbreak when her daughter is involved in a tragic horseback riding accident.  Thomas now has to overcome a stressed marriage and rebuild a relationship with her daughter.  To do this, Thomas must help her daughter and her horse that was equally traumatized by the accident heal.  Showing her domineering attitude Thomas decides against everyone's wishes to travel across country with her daughter and the horse to find the "Horse Whisperer".
 Once there, not only does Thomas find help for her daughter and horse, she also finds love.  We see Tom Booker's (Redford) caring touch reach everyone around him.  As the daughter and horse heal we see Thomas's situation become more difficult.  As the feelings between Redford and Thomas deepen we see her struggle to choose between her family and a Montana life she has grown to love.  This is a drama to see, especially for the horse enthusiast.  I give it four out of five stars.
