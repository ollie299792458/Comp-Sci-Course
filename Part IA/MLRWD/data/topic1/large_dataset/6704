my question is is their a few added episode that we didn't see on televion? the series finished on episode 276 right?

what i've figured out. correct me if i'm wrong.

season 1 television saiyan saga 26 episodes
season 1 dvd set saiyan saga 39 episodes
season 1 television / episode 26: the batte ends
season 1 dvd set / episode 39:friends or foes?
but episode 39 on the television series is actually season 2: stay away from frieza.

season 2 television namek & ginyu sagas 27 episodes
season 2 dvd set namek & ginyu saga 35 episodes
episode 60 on television: captain ginyu the frog
episode 60 on dvd set: bulma's big day
but episode 74 on television is actually season 4: frieza's boost & frieza's boost on dvd set is episode 89

season 3 on dvd set 33 episodes that adds up to 107 episodes
on television series episode 107 is ( mysterious youth )of the trunks saga
on dvd set episode 107 is ( goku's alive ) from the frieza saga

season 4 on dvd set 32 episodes that adds up to 139 episodes
on television series episode 139 ( saiyans emerge ) from the cell saga
on dvd set episode 139 is ( unwelcome discovery ) the beginning of the cell saga which is season 8 on television.

so are we getting the full 291 episodes? of the series
or is the series 294? 294 is what i added up for the dvd sets vs. television.
