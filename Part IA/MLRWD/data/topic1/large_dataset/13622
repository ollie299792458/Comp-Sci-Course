One reviewer noted - quite rightly - that this is not a product for converting those who don't like the music of U2. The observation is spot on. Neverheless, those who love this music - despite of (or indeed because of!) political ambitions and humourless self-righteous role that Bono carved out for himself, will admire this DVD. 
The best thing is the sheer visual quality: none of the amateurish "this-will-do" half-baked rubbish that you can see so often in "tour movies". In fact, I have not seen camera work so visually accomplished for a long, long time. Large part of the film is black-and-white, and monochromatic picture is never used as a quick way for the film to appear "arty". Black-and-white is a powerful tool, but only in capable hands; and thank God in this case they managed to hire people who knew what they were doing. 
Color shots are good too - never descending into Nevada-style predictable "spectacular of colors and lights" but rather sparingly using color as a tool.
The cameraman, it is obvious, enjoys close-up and aggressive light portrait work and this produces a large number of images which would make a very good still photographer proud. Again, this adds to visual enjoyment.
Interviews with band members are so-so, but mercifully they are few and far between. Overall, the film captures very well the powerful and very positive fascination with America that the band had (or still has?), and the choice of southern and west coast venues puts and extra "oomph" into this raw sense of spiritual power in the home of rock'n'roll. And the episode of rehearsal with BB King is a joy to behold: you can sense the awe of U2 artists - not exactly low-profile start-ups themselves - who play with the biggest living legend of R&amp;B.
Definitely worth your money.
