This is absolutely one of the most brilliant & funny films, ever!

Why this was not a bigger hit at the box office, I have no idea.
Not only is the script sharp & well written, but it was wonderfully acted.
Every character is wonderful.  Russell Brand portrays  the barely lucid rock star Aldous Snow with such style & humor, I find myself repeating this movie over & over.  Sean "Puffy" Combs as "Sergio" the CEO of Pinnacle Records is perfect in his  hard-assed & abrupt style, and is a perfect counterpoint to goodnatured doofus A&R rep Aaron Green.  Russell Brand really does chew up the screen whether he's being comically wasted, or onstage with his band "Infant Sorrow".  And the music, even though written for comic effect, is as good as any real band out there. And Aldous's pop-tart super sexy superstar girlfriend "Jacquie Q" is an amazing talent also, and quite easy to look at!

This BluRay edition is crammed full of bonus footage, alternate endings, concert scenes , and other parts not used in the movie... This is a Bonus Package done RIGHT!  Pet The Furry Wall!
