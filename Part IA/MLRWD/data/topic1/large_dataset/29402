The Wild Bunch is in the top four westerns of all time, the first being High Noon, the second being Shane, and then The Wild Bunch and last being Silverado. All four had a positive message in each of them even though The Wild Bunch had the most violence. I saw this movie when it first came out and being in my late teens early twenties it had a major impact on me it was just before going into the service with the war raging in Vietnam and the protests going on here in the United States, my generation never saw that kind of violence while we were growing up the actors got shot at and just fell down there was never any blood or bullet holes in the bad guy.
The message that I took from this movie and I still live by it today is best summed up by Pike and that is you do what is right no matter what, and you stick by your friends to the end.
Sadly in this day and age the younger generations that have followed don't it is all about them and what is in it for them.
The DVD looked great and there were a couple of scenes put back in that you don't see on TV.
