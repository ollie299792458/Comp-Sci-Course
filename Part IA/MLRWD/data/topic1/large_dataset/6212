Parts of this movie are okay (particularly the first 15 or so minutes), but other parts are just embarrassing.  I think that just about any person on the planet who saw the old Scooby cartoons when they were still actually broadcast on television should see this movie, but try not to get too worked up about it because....
There is almost no attention paid to the power of the old Scooby "franchise".  Old fans will not quite recognize what they liked so much about the cartoon, new fans will not be able to make the connection to what the old fans were raving about in the first place, etc.
No attempt was made to exploit any of the "subversive" subtext of the cartoon (i.e., that Shaggy is always hungry because he's something of a pothead and has the munchies on a regular basis).  There was ample opportunity to dress everyone in this movie in the dreckiest 70's outfits imaginable, which would have been kind of funny.  My guess is that Daphne/Buffy said "no way, I'm not wearing that thing".  Daphne/Buffy also got her boyfriend onto the set (news flash...Freddie Prinz, Jr. is not convincing as a blond).  It turns out she's responsible for more evil-doing than the vampires give her credit for.
Scooby is not an exact duplicate of the cartoon character, even though he is a cartoon.  Scooby's eyes are too big (and too black...maybe Scoob is the one with the recreational drug problem).  Something there is about a live-action film that does not love a cartoon.  Maybe there was a test run performed with a "small-eyed" computer-generated Scooby, and it just didn't look right.  But when millions of people know exactly what Scooby did look like, messing with the formula may not always be the wisest move.
But anyhow, it's worth seeing just to be able to talk about it later.  The "protoplasmic heads" are also cool.
