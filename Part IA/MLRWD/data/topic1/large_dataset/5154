Its a story of a guy, who works as a carpenter (Ashtun Kutcher) for his father, who also got fired by his father for being such a poor performer. At the same time a girl (Cameroon Diaz) who is engaged to a busy businessman, gets dumped by him on the day she made him a surprise birthday party. Ashtun and Cameroon decide to travel to Las Vegas to enjoy their time and throw away their misery.

In Vegas they both meet up and get very drunk that night. They get married in Vegas and wake up the next day surprised of what they did. The guy gambles with his new "wife's" coin and wins $ 3,000,000. He claims this money is his and she claims its hers. They go to court to decide, while the court refuses to make a decision or even allow for an anolement until they prove they tried hard to make the marriage work for a period of six months. And there is where the fun starts.

Excellent film, quite funny. I was laughing in the plane like a maniac at that movie, but that's ok the movie was worth it.

The only thing I thought was cheap was that they kind of stole from "Friends" the idea of getting married while being drunk in Las Vegas. They didn't even change the city! However, I couldn't criticize anything else in the movie.
