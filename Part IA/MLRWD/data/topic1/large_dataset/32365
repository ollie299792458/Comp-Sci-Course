I am a big horror fan, and have recently been trying to take in as many 'classic horror' movies as I can find. After seeing Rosemary's Baby years ago and not being too impressed with it, I didn't have very high hopes for Repulsion, but as it is highly regarded I decided to buy it. I didn't buy the more expensive Criterion version. Instead I opted for this cheaper version.

I settled down with some KFC in a dark room and was surprisingly impressed. While it wasn't particularly scary, it was still gripping. The main character seems a bit of a space cadet from the start, so it is no big surprise when she starts to lose her sanity. There are a few good frights in the movie, as well as a couple of illogical actions by the apparently sane characters, (Colin went a bit overboard, knocking the door down because Carol was avoiding him). There was an added pleasant suprise when I saw a young Bodybags from Bad Girls, (actress Helen Fraser) among the cast. The image of all the arms coming from the walls I find genuinely terrifying for some reason. There were one or two instances where I wasn't sure if what happened was one of Carol's hallucinations or not, but I guess thats the point.

Anyway, I enjoyed it, and it has earned permanent membership in my dvd collection.
