This movie was [poor]. Play the game if you want if you want street fiehter excitement.  This movies plot was nothing like the games. The cartoon movie Street Fighter 2 was way better than this. The special moves like "Hadu-ken" and "Sonic boom" aren't even featured in the movie. Basically the made up the game along with the characters. They base the story on Guile not Ken and Ryu, now thats where they went wrong.  Sure I liked to play as Guile in the game, but his story was boring.  His friend Charlie was killed by Bison in the game. In the movie he is kidnapped and turned in to Blanka. What?! No, No, No, that was all wrong.  Also Guile is an American, but in the movie they get Jean Claude "who gives a" Damme to play his role. Guile wouldn't have an accent, he would be a tuff guy that thought he could take on anyone. Most of the bad guys in the game are good guys in the movie. Chun li is a news women, E Honda her camera man, I think Barlog works with them too. Ralph Julia plays as Bison. Yeah the Addams Family father. What a movie to do before he dies.  Bison was a buffed up, scary, evil guy.  Ralph was skinny and no where near scary or evil. The screen writer who wrote this needs to put his pen and pad down and never write again.  A dogs bark is more intresting then what he came up with.  If you looking for a fun strret fighter time play any of the games or watch the Animated movie (both of them) or watch the japanese cartoon series.  Hey we can be thankful that Mortal Kombat was awesome even though there weren't fatalities.
