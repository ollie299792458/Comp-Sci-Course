I watched the movies before reading the books. They came to my attention in 2008 when my Step-daughter asked me to pick up one of the books for her. I forget which one. I heard all the hype as everyone has and decided to rent Twilight, I enjoyed the movie as a rental. I thought the coloring to the film was low level. They absolutely did not take the care in creating the actors for the part as they have in New Moon but overall  it was average. New Moon was less interesting as a movie although they dressed the actors up better and the actual filming was fantastic. I enjoyed watching this but again as a rental. I did buy the series of books and after reading them, THE BOOKS ARE MUCH MORE FANTASTIC!!!! I see how a person can wish to live in that world and submerge themelves in the adventure. Stephanie took every girls most intimate desire, real love and made it alive." Five Stars all the way for Stephanie Meyer. She is perfection as a writer!
I have watched Eclipse and felt the movie was so much better quality than the first two. It seemed more inline with the book. The filming was better and the characters were created better. Breaking Dawn I is well done and closer to the origional story. Again the film work and creation of the actors was also well done. Changing between the dark eyes and the gold was a good addition to eclipse. Overall, the actors have grown with the movies in their acting as they develop into better actors. Actors work with what they are given in a script and these actors, as young stars have made it their own. I can see into Stephanie Meyers world of Twilight when watching them act and I think they all do a fantastic job. I will pay to see Breaking Dawn II in theaters as an end to my experience. I also now follow Stephanie Meyers' website for other books like The Host!
