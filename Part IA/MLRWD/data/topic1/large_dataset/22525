I'd heard of Buck Branagan and the documentary he'd made.  Then I read two critics rave reviews of that movie which made me even more anxious to see it.  While waiting impatiently for it to come to a theatre, Amazon offered the video & I snapped it up.  Was so glad I did!  I thoroughly enjoyed it!

This fine documentary evolves from Buck's childhood with an abusive father, the death of his loving Mother, followed by his wonderful foster parents who gave him love & confidence & helped him put his life all together.  In time, he became the kind, patient, & experienced horse whisperer who now travels throughout our country & in turn helps to train both owners & their horses to communicate.  Buck shows how to make the needed close connection with a horse through some unique training with some amazing results.  This is NOT a action filled western, nor is it purported to be.  Instead it quietly shows what a man who deeply loves, respects, & understands horses, can accomplish...and shares that knowledge with others & so enriches the lives of horses and their owners everywhere.

I've never had a horse (wish I did) but I love them & for me, this video viewing was time so well spent. I'd highly recommend it to others animal lovers.
