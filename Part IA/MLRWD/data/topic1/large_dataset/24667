When I read the review about all the problems this DVD could have I got a bit worried that I'd get very angry when I recived this. But when I inserted it into my PC-DVD it worked perfectly. I'm not doubting that many  of the DVD's might be defect. I don't know anything about that. It worked  just fine on mine at least.
When it comes to the movie I don't think I'll  say anything. I'm sure you know what it's about and so on (if not, just  look above before the reviews) I don't think this is a bad movie. OK, it's  not the best of the bunch, but it's a good movie that holds many memorable  scenes.
When it comes to the quality of the DVD I have to say: Excelent!  The image quality is very very good. It's sharp and shows few signs of dust  or other faults. And when it comes to the audio, the movie has never  sounded so good. The Dolby Digital 5.1 track sucks you into the movie, and  makes the experiance better than ever. The sound is clear and with good use  of the back speakers.
With the everlasing lack of extras on the Star Trek  disc, you get what you see, the movie and some trailers. I'd had loved to  have more extras, but this is what we get, and what we do get, seems to be  presented like it should be.
