This is the movie that started me off on a lifetime passion for fantasy tales.  I was in third grade when Disney released this film.  Our school had a good citizenship program where once a month we would be allowed to go with some teachers to the local theater for a matinee.  Usually, they were old black and whites starring talking mules and Our Gang cartoons.  The matinees never quite held the same thrill as that day we were treated to a tale of magical kingdoms with fairies and witches where good conquered evil.  I was instantly hooked and spent hours in the library searching for volumes of fairy tale books.  When my daughter was born, I began collecting Disney videos and now I am starting a new collection of DVDs for my granddaughter.  I hope that she will find them as exciting as I did.  It is much harder to instill that magical experience now when the market is flooded with cheap imitations starring Barbie and smart mouthed zebras.  It says much about the quality of the old Disney films in that they are still able to hold a young child spellbound after 50 years.
