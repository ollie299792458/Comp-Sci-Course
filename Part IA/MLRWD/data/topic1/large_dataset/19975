Save your money and instead borrow this set from your local public library.  There is nothing about any of these DVDs that you'd want in your permanent collection.  I guess I was hoping for more of a well organized documentary and less "filler".  I mean, how many shots of BB King staring quietly out of his bus window do we need to see?  This whole series is a collection of disconnected, rambling pieces that could have been better organized.  All the parts are probably there, but it's like handing the viewer a pile of jigsaw puzzle pieces and saying "here's a nice oil painting".

This mess has Scorsese's name on it for marketing reasons only.  It's clear that, other than the single DVD that he directed, the only message the other directors got was "put something together about the blues".

Out of the 900+ minutes of video here, I'd estimate that there are about 240 minutes worth of interesting material for the blues aficionado (I'm not talking just music here; for example the thread about Rosco Gordon was touching and worthwhile).  The majority is senseless filler.  Who cares about a rap musician's interpretation of a blues classic?  Who cares about Clint Eastwood playing his piano?

A much better approach to this would have been to start with the roots of this wonderful music, and then highlight notable musicians and performances in chronological order.  Connections of "who influenced whom" and "who worked with whom" would help tie it together.  Sometimes presenting something in a simple, organized manner is the answer, rather than lathering every trick in the director's book on top of the project.
