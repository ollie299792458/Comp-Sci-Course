I only started to watch the WWF in 2001.  I started to watch it when the Alliance was in the WWF.  
  Vince McMahon bought in the nWo as an leathal dose of poison to the WWF, but Hollywood Hulk Hogan was poison to the nWo.  After WrestleManiam, Hulk Hogan resigned from the nWo.  

  Possibly the best WrestleMania ever!  The Matches were:
  Intercontinental Championship
  William Regal Vs. RVD  (4/10) A great way to start WrestleMania!
  European Championship
  DDP vs. Christian  (2/10) Get that crybaby Christian a diaper!
  Hardcore Championship
  Maven Vs. Goldust  (5/10)  Unique Championship.  The Hardcore Belt was passed to 4 people during the show.
  Edge Vs. Booker T  (5/10) 
  Kane Vs. Kurt Angle (6/10)  Great Match, but the big red machine didn't win.
  Ric Flair Vs. Undertaker (7/10)  Ric Flair gave it all in this match-up, but the deadman won.  
  Stone Cold Steve Austin Vs. Scott Hall (4/10) Scott Hall had Kevin Nash down at ringside to help him beat Austin, but to no avail. 
  WWF Tag Team Championship
  Billy and Chuck Vs. Dudley Boyz Vs. Hardy Boyz vs. APA
  (6/10)

  Hollywood Hulk Hogan vs. The Rock  (10/10) Truly, The match of the year!  
  Triple Threat Match for the Women's Championship
  Jazz Vs. Lita Vs.  Trish Stratus (7/10)
  Undisputed WWF Championship
  Chris Jericho (w/ Stephanie McMahon) vs. Triple H (9/10)
  Chris Jericho didn't deserve to be the undisputed champion in the first place.  And that story with Stephanie and Triple H was annoying the hell out of me.  
All in All, a good pay-per-view!
