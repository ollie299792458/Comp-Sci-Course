The Iron Giant is easily my favorite movie of 1999.  Unfortunately lost amid a sea of big budget flash movies, this beautiful film was never destined to be a box office success.  Be that as it may, it stands firm as  a shining example of the limitless potential of animated  storytelling.
Full of nostalgic nuance and attention to detail, The Iron  Giant tells the story of a young boy, Hogarth Hughes, and his adventures  with a new and unlikely best friend- a giant robot from outer space.  As  the giant struggles to understand who he is and Hogarth struggles to  conceal the giant, both end up learning more than a little bit about true  friendship.  In short, this is a film that shouldn't be missed, by  children, adults, and giant robots alike.  When an animated feature packs  ten times the emotional punch of its live action contemporaries, you owe it  to yourself not to miss out.
If this movie lights a fire under you, try  looking into Ted Hughes' original book The Iron Man, a narratively if not  allegorically different telling of the tale featured in the film.
