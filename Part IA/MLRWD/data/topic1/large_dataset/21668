I'm sure Laura Dern touts this as her finest work, har har...

If you've seen any of "Twin Peaks" you're going to recognize some folks here.
I guess there are performers who really believe either in Lynch's appeal (financial gain) or just enjoy his outlook (They're just as twisted)...either way, it's interesting on a lot of levels.

For instance, if you enjoy quoting dialogue you're in Heaven here.

"My dog...barks some."

"Mentally, you picture my dog...but I have not TOLD you the TYPE of dog which I have...you might even picture Toto, from 'The Wizard of Oz'!"

"But let me tell you...MY DOG IS ALWAYS WITH ME..."
 - 00 Spool, described by another character as: "This man's a rocket scientist!"

"...the way your mind works is God's own mystery."
 - "Sailor" Ripley (Cage)to Lula Fortune (Dern)
That might just be a Lynch self analysis.

If you think Laura Dern has no depth you're also served.

If you enjoy slimy malevolence, Willem Dafoe straps it on. (What they did with his teeth...I'm stll scratching my head here...)

It's an interesting roller coaster ride of rebellion, blunt force trauma, lunacy and disaster. With a recurring "Oz" theme and a really beautiful vintage Thunderbird, hey!

I do think Lynch wrapped it up in a half - assed and lame fashion, but there's plenty of entertainment before you come to that.
