This Blu-ray does not, repeat NOT, contain the extended 10th Anniversary Cut of the film, which was released around 2003 and integrated the fully-completed song, "If I Never Knew You," into the film, along with a short reprise of the song as the last lines of the film. The scene is included on this Blu-ray release, but as a separate feature. This is an absolute shame, and while so-called animation purists prefer the original release of the film, I have seen both versions multiple times. So much is lost in character development without the deleted song in the film. Finally, unlike the Special Editions of "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Lion King," the extended version is the intended version. The song was cut from the film not long before release because it was "boring to children" in pre-screenings (It did, however, perform best among teenagers and adults who saw it then).
Whether purists held it back or (more likely) Disney wanted more space on the Blu-ray for the waste of seraph called "Pocahontas II," much has been lost in this release, and I will not put up my money for an inferior edition.
