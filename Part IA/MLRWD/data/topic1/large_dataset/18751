If creating the feeling of death is vacous, then everything else must be vacuos as well. The style is the substance.

The death slowly picking away at these people.

The sense of isolation as time passes.

The desperate need to survive, even at the expense of youth.

The sexual ownership, to escape the nothingness.

This film is not the most profound ever, but it does have points to make and certainly is not vacous.

Try to view it like music, like Barber's Adagio for strings. it is the feeling, the atmosphere, the picture that is the substance.

this is what the modern film should be like, and I don't care what anyone says, Tony Scott you are a genius, even if you sold out (but considering that even now they still knock this film as insignificant, I don't blame you).

This is perhaps the most important modern film (anything I guess made after 1977), it's use of technique, as in image (the killing of dead space is as good as Von Sterneberg), it's use of montage (the start is a sublime sequence, one that Eisenstein would have loved), it's use of sound is startling (the synthesised score is perfectly melded to the image, and the repeated scream at the end I will never forget).
