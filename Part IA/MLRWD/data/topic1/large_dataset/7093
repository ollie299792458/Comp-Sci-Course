Homicide: Life on the Street chose to be different from the word go. The gritty, almost black and white photography in the first few seasons, the zooming camera effects, the way the actors didn't wear make-up separated it from other cop shows. The quality of the actors, especially Andre Braugher, also made a done-to-death genre that much more interesting.
Homicide did a lot of things incredibly well: arc stories (such as Luther Mahoney and the Kellerman storyline), drug abuse and dealt with racial issues brilliantly. It was also set in Baltimore, not New York, Boston, LA or Chicago which was refreshing.
What we're left with here is 90 minutes of a weak story reuniting characters that only have a couple of minutes of airtime. Perhaps the most frustrating is the reliance on Giardello's son who rarely featured in the original series. Pembleton and Bayliss get their fair share but Lewis for example hardly gets a look in. What this should really have been is something as epic as the Sniper storyline from the 3rd or 4th season which spanned 3 episodes not a bittersweet reuniting of characters to find the shooter of Al Giardello. The identity of the shooter is nothing special, and in the last 15 minutes the real drama actually happens (and it's worth waiting for).
If NBC want to really impress Homicide fans a DVD box-set of the best episodes including the pilot would be much more welcome, the show's best storylines were in the first 4 years of the show.
