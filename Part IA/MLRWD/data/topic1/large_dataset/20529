First - I have to point out how ironic it is to 'write a review' of a movie that is about imposed/forced reviews!
This DVD is very interesting!! - Especailly the 1st half - and worth it just for that.  At 49:02 minutes a woman comic flashed her self (topless) I don't need to see nudity to understand heckling.
The language starts off bad and gets much worse. (I'm tried of swearing and vulgarity).
There are many short interviews - with many well known celebrities - and it seems Everyone gets dumped on and heckled at some point in their careers.
I read some of the other reviews here on Amazon - and now that I have seen this documentary - I'm thinking - well Duh!! - Of course it highlights Jamie Kennedy - He Made this video!! - Do you expect him to make a video and Not highlight himself!
This video shows highlights (or should I say lowlights?)
Early in the film - it shows Jamie being pelted by like water balloons or drinks - and there is NO explaination as to what is going on. I'm still curious.
Louie Anderson has a great line in here, and I can only paraphrase it at the moment:
"Resentment is the only product - that consumes it's own container." I love that.
Again, the swearing and vulgarity - and brief nudity - are what brouht this film down from a 5 star to a 4 star. And I would give the swearing a Minus 5 star.
I do stand-up and over all I highly recommend this DVD to all performers and would be interesting to non-performers as well. Sincerely, Scott MacNeil.
