When you view Raging Bull in TRUE WIDESCREEN you see Scorsese's cameo in the final shot of the film when DeNiro performs his monologue in front of the mirror.
I own a copy of Raging Bull on VHS, but it isn't widescreen.  So, I bought a copy of it on DVD because MGM advertises that Raging Bull is  WIDESCREEN on the DVD case. 
The widescreen on Raging Bull DVD is phony.  IT IS NOT THE WIDESCREEN version of the film. 
MGM tries to TRICK you  into thinking you have widescreen Raging Bull by adding black bars to the  standard television format. 
So, instead of gaining up to 50% more image  on the left and right of the screen, you actually LOSE a good percentage of  the image at both the top and bottom. This is not widescreen. 
It is  false advertising done by MGM. 
The True widescreen version of Raging  Bull shows  director Martin Scorsese. The DVD version of Raging Bull which  is supposed to be WIDESCREEN does not. 
If you want to see for your self,  select a scene from Raging Bull "widescreen" and examine the  composition. Memorize the top, bottom, left and right of the screen.  
After you have done so, view the exact image on standard format. You  will notice the difference.  MGM has cropped off the top and bottom of the  picture in the widescreen format hoping to trick us into thinking with have  the real thing. 
I am very disappointed with MGM and encourage you to  refrain from purchasing Raging Bull DVD until  a TRUE widescreen version is  released.
