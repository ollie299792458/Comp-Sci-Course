I really do not watch too much TV anymore because of lack of quality and/or story telling. Certain series however are the exception and Stargate is that exception for me.  I have always had a liking for good Sci-fi, but that's rare for me also.  I think a LOT of Sci-fi is as worthless as much of the other nonsense that is on TV.

I didn't start watching any of the Stargate series because I thought that the original movie "STUNK".  But many years later I caught an episode of Stargate Atlantis and began watching the series from that point on the Sci-Fi channel.  Needless to say that I began to really enjoy the Atlantis series (Rodney Mac - really takes time to endure his annoying character!).  Seasons 4 and 5 were outstanding.  Sooooo, I watched the entire five seasons and was not disappointed!

Soooooo, I started to watch the Stargate SG-1, just to see what all of the references, terminologies, etc, were that I did not understand in Atlantis.  I began with season 1 and I am now in season 3.  I'm truly enjoying the Stargate world.  My brother, if he were alive, would really enjoy SG. He really loved sci-fi and turned me on to it many years ago.

enjoy!
