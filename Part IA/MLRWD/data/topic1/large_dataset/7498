I agree with the Mr. Thomann's review.

This DVD was originally supposed to have a new anamorphic widescreen version on it, but I guess they changed their minds.  I have a feeling they intended to release a good version of this movie (anamorphic, etc.), but then decided not to for some reason.  Instead of cancelling the release (which is what they should have done), I guess they said "Hey, we have tons of old stock in inventory.  Maybe we can repackage it with some gimmick like a Mother's Day card."

Honestly, I don't even think they make snap cases anymore.  I haven't seen a new release with a snap case in 2-3 years.  I also haven't seen any movie releases that don't have an anamorphic version in a couple years either.  This has to be old stock.

Sometimes I really hate Warner Brothers.  I initially hated them because of the snap cases that they littered our collections with, now they sell old stock to fans that have been waiting years for an anamorphic version of this movie.

The movie is great.  Maybe someday they will do it justice with a decent DVD release.

Message to Warner Brothers:  We already purchased your crappy release of this great movie years ago.  Now you just stuck us with the same exact DVD, but with an unwanted Mother's Day card.  After this, how can we trust you for future re-releases of other classics.
