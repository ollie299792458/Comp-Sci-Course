Quirky, but with lessons learned, this movie says so much behind the ruse of dark comedy.
First, love knows not age - it looks beyond the surface to the heart. 2. Be who you are, not who others think or want you to be. This is just 2 of the many points this movie makes.
My favorite scenes:
Serious scene - When you notice the "number" tattooed on Maude's arm and realize, despite being in a concentration camp, this woman knows how to LIVE and values life - and the importance of living to the limit. She has had much sadness in her life, but is the very essence of the term "free spirit". She teaches a struggling young boy, who is attempting to find himself and find someone who cares about him, how to savor life and drink in the joy that surrounds all of us, even in the most unusual places, if only we take the time to look.
Without giving her plan away I will add this, she wants to bow out before life no longer has any "quality" left - something that would kill this brave woman slowly. This is the tragedy of the whole plot - almost like a hit and run for Harold, just when he learned how to love and really live.
Comedic scene - Apart from all the wacky suicide scenes, I love the scene when Harold has the gun and is going to kill himself - he points the gun at his head - then at Mom, trying to "decide" which would actually be best - his demise or hers. This movie says SO much if you really watch - and every time I watch, I notice more and learn more lessons about humility and how to live.
