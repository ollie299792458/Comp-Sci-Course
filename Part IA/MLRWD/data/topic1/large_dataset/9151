I have just recently began using the kettlebell and love the workout it gave me but I ordered this DVD when I got "bored" with the DVD that came with my kettlebell. I was so excited to receive my new DVD and completed the entire workout that night.  I thought I was in pretty decent shape but let me tell you, I felt it later that night and for the next couple days.  I like a pretty long workout and this one comes with about 10 segements that are 10 minutes or so long.  You can do as little or as many segements as you'd like.  The only negative thing I can say about this is that Angie doesn't go into much detail about the correct way to use the kettlebell so make sure you know how to use it.  She is a little dry and boring but the great workout makes up for that.  All in all I think this is a wonderful workout for anyone wanting great toning and cardio.  I think it's appropriate for all fitness levels. Even if you have never worked out I think you could take this slow and work your way up to more segements.  The kettlebell is a wonderful workout and this DVD will give you great results.
