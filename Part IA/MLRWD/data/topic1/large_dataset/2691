Cop Out had to be the worst movie I have seen in years !!!  I bought it "on faith" as usually a Bruce Willis movie, even a bad one, has a fair amount of humor.  This movie was a complete waste of several talented actors.  Tracy Morgan was nothing short of revoltingly nauseating throughout the ENTIRE movie and Seann William Scott was even MORE irritating in this movie than he was in Rundown with Dwayne Johnson (The Rock), if that is possible.  The only good scene in the entire movie comes at the end of the movie and surprisingly it is Morgan who delivers it although it does NOT make up for his pathetic performance throughout the rest of the movie.  The only other humorous line in the entire movie was when Bruce Willis says he never saw the movie where the line, "Yippee Ki-Yay,  . . . ." is said which, of course is a reference to Willis' infamous John McLean character in the Die Hard series.  As a guy with over 1,800 movies in my collection, take my advice - DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE !!!!!!  If you really, absolutely have to see it, RENT IT !!!!!!  Or, better yet, find someone like me that was dumb enough to buy it and go over to their house and watch it.  This movie is NOT worth the disc it is recorded on !!!  The ONLY reason I gave it "one star" is because Amazon requires you to indicate a rating.  If I could give it ZERO, I would and I am a guy who really enjoys Bruce Willis movies.
