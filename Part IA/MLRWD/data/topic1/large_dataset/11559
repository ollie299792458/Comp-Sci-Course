My wife and I have seen the IMAX 3D version twice which was the finest 3D experience ever.

I knew of the problems with the 3D Anaglyph process on the DVDs.  There are 2 ways to minimize the problems.  You need the sharpest, brightest, and clearest images to make it work.  I bought the blue ray version and bought two pairs of optical quality 3D Anaglyph glasses (we bought the ones with the blue and red lenses) from an internet 3D specialty shop (Amazon might also sell them).  The glasses run about seven dollars each and will also fit over most eye glasses.  They will work with some other 3D DVDs but not all (they will not work with Journey to the Center of the Earth, for example).  The websites will tell you which movies the glasses will work with.

My wife and I find that the 3D effect from these glasses is much much stronger than with the cardboard glasses that come with the DVD. The image also is not blurry due to the optical quality of the glasses, at least with blue ray DVD.  I also turned up the brightness on the TV which is recommended.

There are two faults with the Anaglyph process that cannot be avoided.  The colors tend to be washed out and you will see ghosting (double images) sometimes.  When we watch the DVD, we don't concentrate on the ghosting, and after a while, you are so wrapped up in the 3D, that you don't notice it as much.

For us, it was worth it to buy the optical quality 3D glasses as they were so cheap.  However, I do not think that these glasses will help if you get headaches and may not work well for everybody.

One thing that we noticed was how much better the characters' expressions look in 3D than in 2D.

So for us, the blue ray 3D DVD was worth the cost.  It is not as good as IMAX 3D, but it works for us.
