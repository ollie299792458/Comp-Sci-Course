At first I was hesistant when I saw they were making this into a movie because the movie never, ever lives up to the book. This one, however, was fabulous. One of the better adaptations I have seen. I cannot wait to buy this movie. Everybody look for Jennifer Weiner in the market place scene! Toni Collette is very good as Rose, and Cameron Diaz, who I was solely worried about shines as Maggie. I didn't think she could handle drama, but kudos to her. Shirley McClaine is absolutely perfect for Ella, she does the role well. My favorite character is Mrs. Lefkowitz, unfortunately I do not know the actress' name, but she could not have done a better job. If you love Jen's novels this is a must own, and if you've never read her books, you must read one immediately if not sooner. Weiner has a great talent, I only wish she produced her novels faster because I cannot get enough of them. My biggest complaint is that this movie is not coming out in time for Christmas. Otherwise, it's a great movie to watch with your girlfriends.
