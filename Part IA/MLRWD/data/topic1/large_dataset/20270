Apparently, the screenwriter for this was gunned down by triad gunmen, and John Woo, the films director was furious about it, it shows. For those of you who thought the killer was overly sentimental, this could be a welcome change, or then again maybe not. while the style for this is much more low key, with less slow motion shots of people's expressions, and a much less invasive soundtrack, John Woo went absolutely crazy on the gunfights, in the opening scene, a dozen bystanders are mown down,as the combatants seem more intent on wiping them out than each other. in the director commentary, John Woo states, and i quote, i was very angry. the film progresses at a frantic pace, and its two hour length flys by,with the shootouts getting inreasingly wild. Chow-Yun Fat plays the maverick cop on the trail for vengeance tor perfection, while Tony Leung is outstanding in the mytery triad brother role, oh and look-out for a cameo by phillip kwok who plays a henchman called mad dog, kwok was also one of the action coordinators. overall, this is definately not a film for the kids, but if you prefer shootouts to symbolism, then this could be the film for you
