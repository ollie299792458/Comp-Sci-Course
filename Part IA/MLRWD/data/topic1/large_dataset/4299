"We Were Soldiers" is one of the best vietnam movies I have ever seen. I congratulate all the cast and crew who participated in this film, Mel Gibson did a fantastic job, as usual. Sam Elliot was an excellent choice for Plumley. Ryan Hurst, awesome performance as Sgt. Savage, outstanding and such realism, "Remember the Titans" is also one of my favorites. I really enjoy your movies, you portray your character with such feeling, a unique quality. I was grateful to see that the wives and families of the soldiers were given so much attention, an important aspect to include, not only were these men soldiers they were husbands, fathers, and brothers. The wives who lose their husbands and the children who lose their fathers are very crucial to the true understanding of this particular war. Forget the negative comments made by those who do not understand that concept, war is terrifying to imagine let alone live through. I remember as a teenager when my brother left to fight in Vietnam, my mother and I would make up care packages for him; and I witnessed first hand my mother's courage. I have seen the vietnam wall with my brother recently and he still gets teary. The things these soldiers had to do to survive is unthinkable, and then to come home to protesters calling them horrible names and not even appreciateing the fact that they put their lives at stake for someone else. It is the soldier who gave with his life; gave you the freedom to protest. The movie is based on a true story, and it is an outstanding account of what really happened in Vietnam. The bayonet charge was outstanding I have only seen that done in two movies, "Gettysburg" and "We Were Soldiers" both based on true accounts. DEFINITELY NUMBER ONE, applause, encore.
