I just finished watching this entire season tonight. The first time I've seen it, I lost interest in DALLAS after the 7th season when it originally aired in the 80s. I've bought every season that has been released on DVD and have been very satisfied with seasons 8 & 9. I just ordered season 10. Season Nine is excellent. Although "Bobby" is absent from the dream, the storylines are fresh and exciting. The characters of Ray, Donna and Sue Ellen especially had an interesting year. It's a shame they couldn't pick up where they left off when season 10 begins. I highly recommend watching all of this season. I think the show did just fine without Bobby. After Bobby comes back I'm sure the show really went downhill, from reading some other reviews. Overall this is one of the best seasons of Dallas I've seen. It wasn't a nightmare to watch--I'm looking forward to season 10 just to see exactly lost I am in the characters that I grew to love in season 9. It's a shame all the character development from this year was a dream! I bet some of the actors felt the same way. I grew to respect Sue Ellen a lot this year. I guess she'll still be a confused drunk when season 10 begins.
