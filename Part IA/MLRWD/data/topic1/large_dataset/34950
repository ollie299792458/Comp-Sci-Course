I like all movies at a price.  It's the price paid that makes a value.  You don't pay the same price for a Porsche as you do for a KIA.  
Robert Redford delivers a stunning performance in a poorly written movie.  If you think too much about the reality of the situation, you'll definitely lose any enjoyment of the movie.  But the movie does have interesting moments.  Just don't try to analyze the consequences of the actions.
A lot depends upon whether or not the warden is viewed as unnecessarily brutal.  There is no indication that he thinks anyone is in his prison falsely convicted.  He is the administrator of a prison whose inmates are trained warriors.  He can't allow them to organize or demean his authority.
Quite frankly, the warden seemed to me as someone who wanted to give some measure of respect to the Redford character until Redford wanted to exert his own authority!
This is a movie for people who've never been in the military.  If you believe military prisoners should have better conditions that active servicemen and women, then you'll enjoy this movie.  Really, prisoners are required to have larger quarters than officers aboard ship!
