To be honest I came away from this movie wondering what it was that I had just seen. "Paris Je t'aime" is a string of eighteen separate vignettes, an average of 5 minutes long, peaking into the "window" of someone's life. The stories take place in different areas of Paris, with some in English and others in French, a veritable montage of acting cameos. The first thing you want to do afterwards is try to remember each story.

The vignettes range from the utterly bizarre to the absolutely heart stirring. My favorite two happen to occur near the beginning and at the end of the film. One of the earliest stories explores the oddly wonderful bloom of attraction between a wisecracking teenage guy and a devout young Muslim girl on a street. The other story at the end sort of sums it up for me. A single woman vacationer from Denver falls in love with Paris. She realizes how alone she is at that moment and as well as in her life, and yet at the same time concludes that it is going to be alright after all.
Her epiphany in the park in Paris will melt your heart.

Rather than tossing around cliches or fishing for trends and themes in this remarkable film, let me end simply by saying that this is not a movie to miss! If the stories present a Paris and it's people as bizarre, sad, unfair, romantic, and yes, sometimes ugly and violent, well.......c'est la vie.
