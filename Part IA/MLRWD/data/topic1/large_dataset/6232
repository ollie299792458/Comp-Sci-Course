First my heart goes out to John Cusack.  He's about as typecast as Meg Ryan when it comes to Chick Flicks.  In fact, I think those two should do their next chick flick movie together.  Then the circle of life will be complete.  As far a Must love Dogs-it's interesting when you consider neither party own their own dog. Diane Lane, for some reason, didn't come across as believable in her character-which is amazing when you consider she played the character the same exact way as her character in Under the Tucan Sun.  She just didn't up and buy a house in Italy.  But the character arc is the same.  At the end of this film I didn't quite believe that she believed that she was in love with Cusack character.  More like it was just a process of elimination.  All the canned ingredients are here-the nosey and needling family.  The perfect romantic gentleman--who loves Dr. Shavigo (I don't even like that movie) who just can't find the right woman.  (Let's not talk about how this man is supporting himself in a trade where he has NEVER sold anything.)

Still the film manages to hold your attention on an HBO night when you have nothing else to do.  But if you have the option of watching this or Dr. Shavigo-then I would watch this film.
