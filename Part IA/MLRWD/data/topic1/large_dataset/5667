This is a very humane, well-crafted documentary on the effect of predatory capitalism.  While people may argue over whether or not the title is accurate or whether corporatism and not capitalism is to blame, Moore does an excellent job exposing how rigged the system is.  For those who find this documentary compelling and want to go down the rabbit hole even further, any of Alex Jones' more recent documentaries would be a great place to start.  Moore hasn't quite come around to transcending the left-right paradigm that the Powers that Be use to keep people distracted, but he comes very close.  There are a few things Moore could have explored in more detail. For example, Moore didn't address the issue of corporations versus charters.  He didn't tackle treating corporations as persons, nor did he attack usury, what may be the single most important element in the whole system.  While it's nice to see Moore embrace his Catholicism, too bad he apparently hasn't read Chesteron or Belloc on distributivism -- it may have given him more food for thought.
