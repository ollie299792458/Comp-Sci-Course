Now there are some serious fans of Robin Williams that will give some biased answers but I will look at the good and the bad both.

First this film was not to seem extremely realistic but funny with good morales being taught. The plot is about divorce and how children cope through an event. Now as a film for entertainment it is very good because of the comedic side (that's if you like comedy). As a film just to waste time on and do nothing it's not the film for you because there is lots of morale taught here and role modeling. As a film to help children I would say it is very good for Child psychology because Divorce for children is very difficult for them to understand and this film is good role modeling about the feelings children have.

Let's look at the Pro's and Con's

Pro's (Goods)

1. It is a movie with lots of good morales taught.

2. Is movie that raises hope for children

3. Comedy is done very well with much satire on the old idea of cross dressing.

4. The Actors are very good and experienced so their skill is brought into the film

Con's (Bad)

1. There are a few slip ups on the camera but if you haven't watched it time and time again you won't notice it.

2. Somewhat demonizes the female or single mother. But this depends on point of view. Single mothers are just as good as single fathers

Now this depends on your own personal point of view. Overall if you want a good comedy with some emotions and morals thrown in then this is a very fullfilling movie. If you want only comedy and no meaning and no lessons to be learned then this may not satisfy you.

Personally this is a very good comedy and would be considered a family movie. I give it 5 stars but again this depends on what you want.
