I was lucky enough to catch "Metropolis" playing at a theater relatively near me, and I can't recommend seeing this on the big screen enough. The sound of the film and the huge layout of the CGI Metropolis were both breathtaking. The character designs were a bit cartoony for my tastes, kinda like anime versions of the old black-and-white Popeye toons (of course, what else would you expect from the director who brought us "Astro Boy"?), but I quickly got over that. Thankfully, "Metropolis" is being released in theaters in its original Japanese with English subtitles. I shudder to think what kind of dub voices would have been used to go along with the characters' already goofy looks.
The story follows a young detective named Kenichi and his uncle, who travel to the futuristic Metropolis to apprehend a scientist wanted for illegal genetic experiments. Along the way they run into such characters as the robot detective Perro (like a dog), the revolutionary Atlas, the savage and severely unbalanced bouty hunter Rock (who not only shares Mega Man's name but LOOKS like him as well), and a beautiful, enigmatic young girl named Tima. 
Despite the ultra cartoonish look of the film, it definetly gets dark, and quite often. Heck, every so often it gets downright morose. But unlike the terminally gloomy feel of movies like "Akira" and "Ghost in the Shell", "Metropolis" maintains a air of friendliness and hope throughout. Think of a Disney movie where you're never exactly sure how many of the characters are going to die before it's over. Or better yet, think of a cyber-punk flick as directed by Miyazaki (of "Princess Mononoke"). Or best of all, stop wasting your time reading my stupid attempts at analogies and go see "Metropolis". You'll be glad you did.
