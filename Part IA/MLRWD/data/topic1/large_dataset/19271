This version of _Persuasion_ looks pretty and manages to clarify certain aspects of the plot early on better than the Root film. Unfortunately, that's about all it does. The actors are probably fine (if a bit too polished), but they are given nothing to work with.

Watching this film is like substituting your freshman English notes for the actual novel. It hits the highlights but doesn't slow down enough to make anything dramatic or memorable. If you liked the Keira Knightley version of _Pride & Prejudice_, you might like this film, too, since the two share similar strengths and weaknesses.

You will sense something is "off" even if you've never read the book. The film doesn't go far enough in originality to compensate for its shoddy treatment of the source. Things move quickly but, at the same time, lack suspense.

A good adaptation needed to be longer. A good interpretation needed to be better plotted. At the end, the film is just empty calories. Watch it, if you've never seen the Root film or read the book. But expect to feel kind of "meh" afterwards.
