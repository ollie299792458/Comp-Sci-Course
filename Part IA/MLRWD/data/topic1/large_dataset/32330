I rented JCVD from Blockbuster Online - they have the blu-ray already, I don't know why Amazon is taking so long. Great movie, and the U.S. blu-ray version looks great, but the audio options are a mess. In the disc setup menu you get 3 options, all Theatrical versions:

1- French Audio: Dolby Digital 2.0 only, with no subtitles available, except forced French subtitles during the scenes with English dialog.

2- English Audio: Dolby Digital 5.1 - a horrible dubbed version (as dubbed movies usually are), but at least better audio. But the dubbed voice for Jean Claude sounds like it was made by a eunuch.

3- English SDH Subtitles: I didn't try this version until the last, as the other 2 versions are so unsatisfactory. French Dolby Digital 5.1, the best audio option of all, but with the annoying sub-titles with text sound effects [car backfires]throughout (well, annoying if you're not hearing impaired).

So, I'm going with the U.K. version with DolbyTrueHD French 5.1 audio and forced English subtitles during French dialog scenes. Only around $18 from Amazon.co.uk - sign in with your Amazon.com username & password and you're good to go.
