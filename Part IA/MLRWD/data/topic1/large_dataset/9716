The DVD of Joesph is as far as I am concerned one of the best transfers of a stage show to film and even better than the video of CATS.  Watching Joseph is almost like watching a live action cartoon with all the  characters beautifully and humorously defined.  Donny Osmond as Jospeh is  stunning, he sings well and looks good in the role, however Maria Friedman  is a revelation - I have seen her in numerous things on stage in London,  and was unsure as to how she would come across on film, but she captures  your attention as soon as she appears and doesn't let go until the end.  Cameo appearances from Richard Attenborough and Joan Collins are superb, if  brief! The supporting cast are also excellent, hamming up there roles to  full effect.  It is beautifully filmed, in vivid colours and the director  keeps the pace throughout the film.  The 30 minute documentary on the DVD  about various school productions is fun, tho it would have been nice to  have 30 mins of The Making of the Film instead. This is a pacy,fun  filled,colourful 100 minutes of unchallenging nonsense and if your in 2  minds as to whether or not to get this DVD, BUY IT - you won't be  disappointed!
