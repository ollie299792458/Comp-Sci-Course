What can i say about a movie that i watched 5 times in a three day period! It was just so good. i recently became an x phile following all the episodes on fox and fx but when i saw this movie i was blown away. i began  to fit all the pieces together from the past episodes and relate them to  things in the movie. i must say i was a little disappointed about the  little ALMOST kiss but i do agree that it would spoil the whole show if the  Mulder and Scully were together. My favorite scene was the cornfield. it  was just an adrenaline rush to watch parts of this movie and i even  screamed a couple of times out of surprise. One of the best monsters in the  history of x files is in this movie. The scene that tells about Mulder's  sister is definetely a turning point in movie. it was not in the theatre  version so if you only went to the theatre then you must see this scene. it  tells you basically what happened to Samantha. Another great scene is at  the end when the ship is flying away Mulder asks scully if she saw it and  in a barely audible whisper she says yes even though she probably didn't  since her face was in the snow. Superb acting to David Duchovny and Gillian  Anderson. They do a great job with the roles. JUST AN ALL AROUND GREAT  MOVIE!
