Patience is the virtue through the first half hour of this movie.  If you can hang tight until the ball starts rolling, you will too. 
 Robert DeNiro plays a serious and straight forward detective (Mitch), while Eddie Murphy portrays a small time cop (Trey) who has more interest in an acting career.  When Murphy becomes involved in DeNiro's undercover operation, DeNiro gets hot under the collar and breaks a news camera.  DeNiro and Murphy are then forced to team up in a TV police series in order to avoid a law suit from the television station.  Renee Russo (Grace) plays the station's producer who tries to change DeNiro's decor and lifestyle to coincide with public opinion for rating purposes, and DeNiro and Murphy become the rage of the viewing population.
 The satire of William Shattner's 1980's TV show "T.J. Hooker" also shows up in a small part of the movie which consists of a little slapstick humor.  As usual, Eddie Murphy steals the show with his off the wall comedy act, but DeNiro is equally funny playing his straight faced and dry humored character.  Renee Russo and William Shattner are just plain silly.  Although this movie does start out slow, when it picks up it will leave you laughing.
