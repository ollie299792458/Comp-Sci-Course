I was very excited to see this movie.  I feel like it was a sad closure to a great series.  I saw more character development and reaping action/reaction in half the time (an episode) than I did in the movie.  I felt that the loss of Rube was difficult but explained.  I did not feel however that this movie was in the spirit of the series.  I don't believe many loose ends were tied up and I feel that they changed too many of the "rules" set into place, like what happens when you try to communicate with your former life or consequences of killing or not reaping.  There were rules (that were suppose to be unbreakable) that were established in the show that were completely ignored.  I did like the effects and I enjoyed seeing what happened when Roxy forced the man to live.  The actors that could return did a good job with their characters.  The actress playing Daisy, I would not envy her.  She had huge shoes to fill and I just could not accept her during this movie.  I felt that the former actress did a much better job of acting condescending and elitist.  The new actress just seemed childlike and not pained from her lack of love.
