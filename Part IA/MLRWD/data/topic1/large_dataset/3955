Sarcasm is not something I deal in.  No I never joke around or kid... no sir!  What I'm saying is that though you may doubt that with all the hokey actors and the shoody script and... who am I kidding?  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, it is almost worst than the Hot Chick.  Wow, I didn't know people could be so dumb.  How do they come up with movies like this?  Who needs this?  This is high school dramatics put into movie form and the little shower scene is just that incticing little carrot on a string that lures young frat boys and high school sophmores into renting this.  I'm actually disgusted by this piece of garbage.  How on God's green Earth can we be humans capable of producing some of the worst art and entertainment ever?  As a human race we should be horribly ashamed that the thought of making this movie was even concived let alone that this movie was created.  Somebody kill me, if I have to see another movie like this it will be the last movie I ever see I'll go and find an abandon forest and live my life as a hermit never to see a television commercial or worthless pile of excrement that is passed off as a movie.  I curse this whole planet for putting me through such excruciating stupidity every day of my life.  Through god awful reality tv shows to insipid commercials, media is the bane of my life.  And don't even get me started on commercial radio, MTV and so-called youth culture (that consist of Quioxite politcal dreams and mall going, gag me!).
