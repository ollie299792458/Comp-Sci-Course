"Goodfellas" was a fantastic start for the cinema of the 1990s, and has not dated itself in any way. It's a quasi-documentary about the social life of a Brooklyn branch of the mafia, and is packed with facts and observations which are seamlessly intertwined with the narrative (and in a non-gratuitous manner, too, unlike "Gangs of New York," where the historical information seemed shoehorned in lieu of the story). The voice-over narration which Nicholas Pileggi and Scorsese hammered out of Henry Hill's memoir is humorous and observant, and Ray Liotta's reading of it utterly natural-sounding. To me, watching actors entirely inhabit their roles makes the most spectacular CGI-saturated movies pale in comparison, and with a script as good as this one, it becomes a magic experience. Especially impressive is Paul Sorvino's Paulie Cicero, whose subtle expressions and mannerisms are amusing as hell all throughout the film. All the major cast are fantastic, but even those in the secondary roles are vivid, like Frank Vincent as a paroled mobster who gets done in by a senseless and spectacular act of petty revenge, or Chuck Low as Morrie the Wigmaker, whose constant nagging of master criminal Jimmy Conway (de Niro) for his cut of a big score grinds the latter down (not a person you want to bug even once). "Goodfellas" contains scene after scene of brilliant acting, perfect period music choices, a narrative which is both illuminating and suspenseful (even though the film has a very loose, episodic feel).
