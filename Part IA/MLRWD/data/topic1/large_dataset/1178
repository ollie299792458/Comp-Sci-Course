I love these tapes, even though as a beginner it took me a while to adjust to them. I do each tape about 3 times a week (am trying to do more!) and I definitely feel more relaxed and less stressed on those days. Although the  p.m. tape is very difficult for beginners, it is by far my favorite. When I  first watched the tape, I was *very* intimidated by the moves; however, I  realized that I would never become more flexible if I didn't try. Once I  accepted that, I really began to enjoy the exercise. I do the best I can  and it's definitely paying off! I can literally feel the stress leaving my  body; this practice is the first thing I do when I get home from  work! 
Although the a.m. tape is a nice way to center oneself before  beginning another hectic day, the pace of the exercises is poorly done. The  instructor speeds up at the end, so although I've been doing this one for  months, I am caught off guard every time. It's a poor transition when all  moves to that point have been slow and relaxing.
The main problem I have  with these videos, however, is that there is no instruction on breathing,  which is an important part of yoga. Every once in a while, the instructors  will say 'exhale' or 'inhale', but it's not very helpful. I had to pick up  some books on yoga for instruction on breathing. Yet overall, these tapes  are great for stress-relief, meditation, and flexibility!
