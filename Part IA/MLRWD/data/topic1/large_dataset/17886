Our last Musical movie was the Phantom of the Opera.That one was spectacular, but this one will absolutely take your breath away. It's wide open sets, and absolutely lush voices will have you dancing in your underwear.
Henry Kreiger's amazing musical about three, well four girls, who have a dream is heartbreaking, and moving. The plot is not very rich on the surface, but like an ice cream cake. THe heart of the story is what really matters most.
Jennifer Hudson, Beyonce Knowles, and Anikki Nonni Rose Are astouding. They lay thier notes out better than anyone in the odern world of Motown. And as Jennifer said "Simon, YOU WERE WRONG." and actually,(and almost eriely) Her (Jennifer's) storie mirror's her character very well. And so does Beyonce's caracter.
Jamie Fox, and Eddie Murphie are both astounding. And the man who plays James Thunder Early's  Producer (and later Effie's Helper) is wonderful and fatherly. The Language is abounding, but it is not overbearing, like in Black Hawk Down.
So I give a 857345793453 stars out of 5.
