will be required.  This is a very funny highly enjoyable movie.  You cannot watch it just once to fully appreciate the whole thing.  To get all that is in this movie you need to own it.  The first viewing will just whet your appetite, if it doesn't trust me and watch it again.  You enjoyment will grow with each viewing.  The story centers around Everett McGill (Clooney) trying to get back to his wife and some buried treasure.  To accomplish this he brings his prison buddies who are shackled to him (Turtorro and Nelson).  This trio finds adventure and humor in the Klan, Bad politicians, loose women, backstabbing family, Bible salesmen, and all manner of quirky characters on their journey.  The characters are wonderful. The performances by the entire cast are fantastic.  This is not a George Clooney movie you have come to expect.  He is so different and fresh and funny you won't expect the performance you are seeing.  His costars are equally perfect. You will find yourself reciting lines from the movie that are bound to become classics.  On top of all this is the music.  This is bluegrass and oldtimey sounds.  I realize that most people are probably not fans of this type stuff and honestly neither was I, but the Coen brothers make it work.  The music is half the fun.  I find myself singing the songs around the house.  It is a movie that can be watched by the family.  There area  few bits of profanity, not too much but the story and the humor and especially the music can be enjoyed by everyone.
