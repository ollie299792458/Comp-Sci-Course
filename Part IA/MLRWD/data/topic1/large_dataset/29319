I saw this film when HBO first aired it, years ago, and I still have the homemade tape we recorded it on.  I'm glad to see that it's available commercially, and I'll happily recommend it.  It's certainly good enough to be remembered, not simply washed under "Silence of the Lambs."
This is a thriller that *means* something, showing us the life-ruining indifference, the villainy of blindness, that defined a really screwed-up, sick culture and period in history.  You learn a thing or two about responsibility, justice, and intelligence from this sadly true story.
And it's a fine thriller, besides, with the interesting wrinkle of showing how to get jsutice done in an unjust culture.  The way the killer is finally nabbed is something that we could never do here in America.  Meanwhile, it more than adequately scares the pants off of you, being far more openly violent than "Silence of the Lambs," or its ilk, while at the same time being less exploitative in the way it *handles* the violence.  That's quite an accomplishment, however unsettling.
This film will scare you. Not jsut because it's that kind of story, but because it really happened, and more importantly, because of WHY it happened.  To my mind, those facts make the sicko stylings of ordinary celluloid killers seem rather pale and silly.
