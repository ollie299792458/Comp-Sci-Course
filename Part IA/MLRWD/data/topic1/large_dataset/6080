As I approach my 60th birthday, I have been reflecting on how life has changed, from my point of view at least, in America.  Particularly since President Kennedy was murdered in Dallas Texas in 1963.  I saw him get murdered, and even at a young age I knew there was more that one gun firing at him.  As I grew up, I was continually amazed at how the media seemingly did not report the truth and how my country, America, seemed to start to fall from the shinning light on the hill status, into what is now a corporate Facist state of corruption and greed.  Michael Moore, and a few like him in the United States; like John Pilger in England, are trying to bring accurate information to the People to help those people who take the time to watch and learn become informed. Capitalism: A love Story, by Michael Moore is, in my considered opinion, even better than Mr. Moores' movie, SICKO, with-which he won many of American film making highest awards.  If you consider yourself to be an American, or informed, this movie is a must see.
