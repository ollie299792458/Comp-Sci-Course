Sometimes, living in Europe pays! I am a proud owner of this DVD for sometime, having it ordered from Sweden, along with their DVD release of "Chess" the musical.
Director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m and his crew did a real feat with this movie, which was shot on a real tour with real troubles all that jazz brings with it. In an interview on the disc two, ABBA guys claim that they didn't know that there is going to be a movie, while they were on tour. They suspected something seeing all the big cameras, but only afterward, when they had to shoot some additional things did they become aware of the seriousness of the project. The crew weren't allowed in their Hotel rooms, so what you see in the film was shot in a hotel in Stockholm. But it all seems so real in the movie... The story isn't that much engaging, but it is a wonder they pulled that much, given the circumstances. On the other side, we get real ABBA performances, shot in glorious panavision and with at least five cameras and in beautiful DTS sound. I am really delighted to have this!
BTW, ABBA's "Waterloo" won as the best song in 50 years of Eurovision song Contest history in an event held in Copenhagen last saturday (October 22. 2005.), wich really proves that ABBA is forever!
Benny Anderson commented: I personally voted for "Volare", but I am glad so many people voted for us :)
