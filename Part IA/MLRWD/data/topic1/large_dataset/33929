I am quite disappointed in Fox's decision to DNR the crap out of Predator. I know a lot of you probably don't care, but Predator was never supposed to look as crystal clear as Avatar or a Pixar film. The problem with using DNR like this is that all of the fine detail of film is scrubbed away along with the film grain, which is why the actors and sets look like they are made of wax. One of the greatest aspects of the Blu-Ray format is it allows you to view films for the first time as they were intended to look: like films! What this release does is attempt to make Predator look as if it was shot on digital video yesterday, but of course a modern digital film wouldn't have the detail of the picture removed like Predator has.
Now, the original Blu-Ray wasn't great either, as it was an early effort from Fox that was delayed from release a long time, which is why it was poorly compressed on a single-layer disc with MPEG 2. However, I would still recommend that disc over this new one. What Fox should have done is create a new master going back to the original negatives, and perhaps SPARINGLY applied some DNR by people who knew what they were doing to sort out the inconsistencies of the grain in the first release.
The bottom line is I don't support releases like this and I hope FOX or any other studio doesn't continue to alter older films like this. I give this disc 2 stars instead of 1 because they included all the extras that should have been on the original disc, but for anyone that cares about film and the artistic intent of the filmmakers, stay away from this one!
