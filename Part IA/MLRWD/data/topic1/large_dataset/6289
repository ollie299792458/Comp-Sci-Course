After reading "A Long Day's Journey into Night" by Eugene O'Neill, and later watching the movie, I got a good idea of what I expected, but the movie went beyond my expectations. Katherine Hepburn portayed Mary Tyrone, cursed with a morphine addiction. Hepburn was the perfect choice for this movie, as she did a stupendous job of displaying random emotions as if she were actually on morphine. The believability is amazing. Although Mary's role was played extremely well, the others are not too deserving of praise. James Tyrone, the miserly Irish-Catholic who cries poor house to everyone, is portrayed by an unfit actor who needed much improvement. Tyrone (Ralph Richardson) needed to have been a little more extreme with his temper, which I interpreted from the play to be as a short fuse. Although I found the movie and the play to be extremely boring and morbid, it does an excellent job of showing, in American literature, the best display of acting, realism, and (ironically) truth behind Eugene O'Neill.
