I was surprised that the editorial reviews of this film treat it like just another film, which it most definitely IS NOT. I would describe it in various ways: as the film John Waters would give his left HAND to make; as a terrific NEAR-sendup of intense, tear-drenched dramatic dance films like Red Shoes, that doffs its hat to the concept of "camp" without throwing the whole experience away just to stay consistent with the attitude; as a comedy that, if you get the joke, will knock you silly with laughter at times. 
There are moments when I wasn't sure which film I was in, as the plot listed toward Flashdance and then Cinderella. But this is the kind of film it is; it embraces operatic emotion and high melodrama, and while it acknowledges the ordinary, it never becomes so. And it communicates beautifully the essential wackiness of all in-bred, inclusive subcultures. (The old guard's constant exhortations to the hero not to give himself over to "crowd-pleasing moves" is hilariously absurd, and at the same time wholly typical of such subcultures, where the most sensible question is always "Who on earth made these up these rules?!")
It is an odd and intense film, one that contantly keeps you off balance, and asking yourself whether to take it seriously or as an elaborate sort of filmed comedy dream (think of Rocky Horror Picture Show). The cool thing is, you never have to decide; you can enjoy new aspects of it on multiple viewings. See it.
