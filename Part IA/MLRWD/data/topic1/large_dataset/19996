For the amount of hype this movie is receiving, it doesn't really deliver to expectations. First off, the movie is not particularly funny, even melancholy at some points. If you are looking for for a laugh get Chapelle's stand-up instead. While this movie is about Chappelle going back to his roots, it really doesn't capture the attention of, or have any sort of impact on, the viewer. This documentary resembles a home video, made with a nice camera, which is mostly interesting for the people in it, not to others. Dave talks about some of his philosophies and cracks a few jokes, but the entire thing is like a drawn out music video featuring some "ok" artists, with less than great performances. The ironic moment of the movie comes when Dead Prez perform, bashing mainstream music, shortly following... Kanye West? A little strange to be sure. If you are ok with all that, then this is a movie you would like. If not, stay away from this one and stick with classic Chappelle, the master of stand-up comedy.
