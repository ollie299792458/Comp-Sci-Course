The point I think most critics seem to be missing about 'Scream 3' is that it IS the third movie of the trilogy, and so it is almost impossible to keep up the same level of freshness and originality. So that's a given. And  yet, at the same time, the final installment managed to be laugh-out-loud  funny and built up to a really suspenseful, and well-crafted finale. Yes,  Sidney's role was nothing more than basically a cameo appearance but the  new character of Parker Posey carried the movie all on her own with such an  amazingly witty, over-the-top performance. The script was as fresh as they  could have made it considering that this is their third effort, and while I  found the revelation of the killer somewhat disappointing (I had so hoped  it would have been one of the returning members from either of the first  two movies - notably Sidney's father - which would have made more sense) it  was still a well-made ending, and the final "epilogue", with  Sidney leaving an 'open door', literally, was the perfect final image, and  Wes Craven gave such brilliant irony - and a fitting conclusion - with this  final shot. Supporting players were nothing more than cardboard cutouts  (and what is up with Deon Richmond's character? totally expendable) yet at  the same time the death scenes (except for that of Jenny McCarthy) were  suspenseful and had just enough energy to keep us on the edge of our seats.  
Oh, and yeah, the 'voice changer' was a cool little device that added  some creative edge to the killer's techniques this time around.
