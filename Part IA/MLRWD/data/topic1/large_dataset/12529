Awesome movie, i loved this movie as a kid and finally decided to check it out on blu ray. It had two extra shots of gore, when the yes man is being shot by the ed 209 in the conference room and when murphy's hand is draining in blood. Well written, the story does not lag or speed or do you feel as if you've missed something, truly well written. Also well acted everybody did their characters justice. Well directed, the action sequences do not disappoint. This movie gives you that "real" feeling, just like the new action hero movies do. They are dark, deep ...they're not cartoonish or gay. In a way this movie was ahead of its time during an era of real gay movies and even then swept into the nineties of gay movies. Finally in the last 5 years or do hollywood if FINALLY giving those "real feeling" movie such as dark knight or ironman. As far as i remember robocop has been the only film of the era with those elements. Action, "real", dark, entertaining (not gay it was the eighties or nineties remember?)

As far as the blu ray goes, eh. Quality was terrible, but the best your gonna get from the original footage. Very grainy. Looks like you can get same quality as the dvd but on a blu ray disc. Still, its blu ray and id rather own blu ray than dvd any day.
