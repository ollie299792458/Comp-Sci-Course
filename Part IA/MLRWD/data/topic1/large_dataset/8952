As I do in all my reviews, I won't say much about the film, and keep focused on the product.
It is certainly one of the greatest movies of all times, and it goes beyond the western genre.
This film was photographed in VistaVision, a process that used a large negative area, resulting in high definition register. For this transfer, technicians turned to the black and white color separation records, since the original camera negatives had long faded and lost their colors.
Those separations preserve the same image area as the original negative, therefore much of it's original quality.
This blu-ray brings the best possible image quality, extracted from the best surviving elements. Picture has good sharpness and good overall contrast (despite of some high peaks of white, specially in the sky, here and there).
I am quite sure there won't be nothing better available for a long time. And this transfer is as close as we can get from the original theatrical presentation of this classic.
As a collector, I would hope for blu-ray release with a gift set edition, full of collectible items, similar to the DVD Ultimate Collector's Edition.
Unfortunatelly nobody seems to have thought of that.
For now, this blu-ray is a necessary item on any film collection.
Go for it.
