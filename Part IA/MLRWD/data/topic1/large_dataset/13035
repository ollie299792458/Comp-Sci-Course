Anthony Edwards (ER)plays a musician and romantic who finds the love of his life on the same day that he finds out the world is coming to an end. That is the basic premise of this quirky and eccentric film. When he misses his big date with his dreamgirl he accidentially intercepts a phone call from someone in the military who reveals that the world we know will end in 1 hour. He then shares this strange and prophetic message with the oddball characters at an all night diner. Everything gets crazy when instead of immediately leaving the LA basin area he decides to detour in order to save his new love.

This enjoyable movie was made in the late 1980s when the anxiety and worry about a possible superpower nuclear showdown, USA vs USSR, was still a real concern. There are some interesting performances here. Denise Crosby's(Star Trek Next Generation) character takes this information right to heart and pulls out all the stops to get out of town fast. Myleti T. Williamson (Heat, Forrest Gump)plays a petty criminal who gets caught up in the hysteria.

There are other fine performances by actors you will immediately recognize. And it's fun to take notice of the things that seemed to change right after this movie was made. By the early 90s the threat of the USSR-gone. People walking around restaurants and other public places with a cigarette in tow- (thankfully)gone. Pay phones on every corner- gone. Brick sized mobile phones-gone. Filmed in LA and mostly at night this low budget movie is accompanied by a fantastic musical score from Tangerine Dream. This surreal movie stays interesting and fun from start to finish.
