After watching this last season I was unsure as to what the writers were going to do?Also if this series was going to make it to a new season?Well in both cases it's good news,first about season 6.I was really interested in the way this season got started.How Dean was living with a life that down deep inside he wanted,a life with a women at his side an a young boy that Dean loved.So "never say never,as Dean's brother Sam shows up from the Dead?And so it begins the Winchester's Boys are back together again to hunt the strange things of the night.But something isn't right as the series unfolds,Dean is thruster into a situation where it's not only his brother,but his so call dead grandfather is back an leader of the Campbell's family hunters ?Now things are really looking stranger?Now Dean really isn't sure what to do,stay with his new life with women an son and give up living the hunters life,or stay with his new found family of brother Sam and the Campbell's?It not a debate,when Dean finds out that some Jines are pursuing him,he's brought back to the life in a spit second,as his women and boy are in danger.Dean rushes head first into the hands of the Jines?This goes without saying one of the best episode I've watched,and this opened the rest of the 6th season to all kinds of dangerous beings some we have seen before an new ones?The only thing I can say as to the whole 6th season is three episode are not as good as I would have liked.but I am looking forward to this January 28th @9:00pm on Channel 11 when the new season started.I always loved this series,and hope that it can go on to be even greater.
