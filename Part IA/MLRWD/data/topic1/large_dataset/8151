This movie was an ok movie. It was good at some parts but at others it was realy boring. The begging was realy godd and it was drawing me into da movie but like 30 minutes into it it was really having to much talking but at the last 10 minutes was realy good again. I have 2 admit this movie is realy diffrent from the modern movies i watch evry friday. It is diffrent in a bad way it was to long, it has to much talking , and has a story line dat changes evry 15 minutes. It was a good story if u get da main picture of da whole movie , wich most teenagers like me dont , the things the same about this movie like the movies i watch , would have to be the gun fights, hot chicks and all the vilence. This movie is a typical western do to its shootouts, gunfights, saloons, horses, and cowboys. The peaple who made this movie made a mistake by making it to predictable because from evry scene you watch you know whats gona happen in the next scene. The little scenes kill the movies in some ways but help it in many others. Like it makes the movie to long but it links all the main stories together. if there is one quote i would remember it would be " give me a shot of the good stuff ". if u watch da movie youll get it eaven though i dont recomend you to. If you realy want to watch it buy it if u dont realy want to trust me dont buy it. i give this movie 2 stars thanks for reading my review. = )
