I have always trusted DVD products from Eagle Vision and in my collection of 300+ DVD concerts their label dominates my shelf. I have been anxiously awaiting the release of this product for a couple of months and upon picking up a copy a couple of days ago and  was thrilled to see the DTS logo on the back of the DVD case AND on the DVD disc within...after reading the line up of artists I looked forward to loading this disc up and enjoying the show in DTS! I cannot fault the venue, artists, camera work or video and sound of Dolby Digital 5.1, but THERE IS NO DTS SOUNDTRACK AS CLEARLY STATED ON THE DVD CASE OR DISC...if there is a DTS SOUNDTRACK there is no way to access same, what a pity, what a shame! While I will keep my DTS lacking copy of this concert as it is excellant in every aspect IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT MUCH SWEETER IN DTS (as advertised)! The availability of DTS certainly would have earned this Eagle Vision product a 5 Star rating in my eyes. I personally feel that Eagle Vision needs to issue an apology for such a bungle as well as sending duped purchasers a true DTS encoded version. [...] In future, I will be very wary of purchasing future Eagle Vision products that sport the DTS logo.
