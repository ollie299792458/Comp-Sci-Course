Reese Witherspoon proves herself a talented actress in what could be a sequel to Clueless.  The film is satirical and bubbly with stereotypes about West meeting East (Coasts, that is).  While the movie is a silly and enjoyable film for young adults, it does have more than just pretty people and slightly unrealistic situations.  The great messages the film manages to get across for young women are very important.  
1. You shouldn't give up on something because other people tell you you can't do it.  
2. What you think you want is not always what's best for you.
3. If you promise to keep a secret, you should keep it.
4. If you believe in yourself then anything is possible.
Aside from the "feel-good" messages, the film is just a lot of fun.  You'll find yourself laughing out loud no matter your age.  This is a movie you should be happy for your kids to see.  This is also a wonderful film for mothers to enjoy with their daughters.  There is no sex, no drugs, and no violence.  It's great that such a positive film has made it to number one.
