wen i saw this film i wasn't expectin anythin good because recent Eddie Murphy fims haven't been as good as his old films due to his most recent films being for little kids n most little kids even laugh at them.

Anyway this film is suprisingly good with a good plot, the actors used well and some great comedy such as Bowfinger (steve Martin) making Jiff Ramsey (eddie murphy) a soon to be a star geek and brother of action superstar kit ramsey ( also played by murphy) run across a main road of heavy traffic and speading cars with no safety helmet on just to get a scene in his low budget fim chubby rain, of course jiff thinks the drivers in these cars are stunt men no there not there just peaple driving.

The film plot is about bowfinger the worst director of all time trying to make a film with kit ramsey the greatest action star of all time. Of corse kit being the nice man he is says no n chucks him out of his car.So how can you get kit in the film? you dont need to when he has a twin brother jiff who is willing to be a star. Funny plot great character and of corse heather graham make this film class.

We all will like this film and when i say we i mean me.
