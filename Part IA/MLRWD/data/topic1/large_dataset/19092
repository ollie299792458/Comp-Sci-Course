This is by far what I consider to be the BEST series HBO has ever produced. While some say the first season moved too slow, the second season took off and your feet would never touch the ground again. By now everyone knows the plot. The great depression, battle of good versus evil in a supernatural battle for world domination, all set around a traveling group of rag-tag carnies going from city to city just to exist. Each member with a secret and each fitting into a perfect 3D puzzle. Thrust into this, the great satan of Brother Justin and the reluctant Ben Hawkins who does not want to face up to his destiny. Even the final battle was not the end. Season three would have been just as mind blowing if not for the rocket scientists who run HBO.

Despite the huge campaign, those same people have ignored the great hue and cry to resurrect the series. Much in the same mind frame as NBC executives in 1968 when Star Trek was cancelled. Personally, I cancelled my subscription to HBO and have never looked back. For anyone into Stephen King, see this and realize just how inadequate the "master" is when compared to a really great gothic horror series. Hopefully, another network will pick this up and allow the cast and crew to once again put some quality back on the small screen.
