My intention for many years was to read Matheson's 'I Am Legend' and 'Hell House'.  Since I have read none of them (as I can't find a copy anywhere), I decided to watch The Legend of Hell House before I do.  To my surprise TLOHH is a really good haunted house film and an enjoyable horror flick.  I found it to be an actually creepy film with a great use of audio, lighting, and camera work to create an uneasy atmosphere that gives Hell House a convincing evil.  The acting is great in this film, with impressive perfomances from Roddy McDowell and Pamela Franklin.  Impressive and effective scenes are also included.  Scenes such as the 'seance' scene, the 'possession' scene, the 'cat attack' scene and many more.

The Legend of Hell House is a great haunted house film, with a creepy atmosphere and great performances, this has got to be one of my favourites.  I will still intentivly read the book as soon as I find it.  This is a horror film that I will add to my horror list and will treasure for a long time.
