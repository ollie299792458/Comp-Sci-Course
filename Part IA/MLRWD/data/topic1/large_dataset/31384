This has to be one of Ellen DeGeneres's favorite movies as she loves to dance at random.  It is the best movie with so much pantomime that I have ever seen.  People that try to copy a lot of pantomime really go over the top as in movies like Justin and Kelly, and as I've heard a lot of Indian movies as well.

This movie is a bit cheesy when the portion of everyone just telling you to dance occurs, and the movie is left hanging for Lena as apparently it's not important how her life ends up.  In terms of a storyline, to not mention Lena's end to her part of the story is good.  It does leave the impression of how people that talk funny can't do well now that sound has come out.  Since they don't even show Lena in a good light throughout, it makes it seem even moreso that life is so unfair for her.  You have to feel a bit sorry for her character in the movie.  There are a few people that talk really funny and do pretty well in show business, but it is a rare sight, that is for sure.

All the coordination for the tapping styles to the right beat and rhythm, with all the bends and twists of both Kelly and O'Connor.  O'Connor is known for his backflips in the movie, insane!  The performances in this movie are all top-notch.
