This movie was a great viewing experience, based on a true story.  It is about how childhood abuse and abandonment affects the life and career of a Navy enlisted man, especially in the area of anger.  It is a little painful to watch at times, because as Antwone Fisher (beautifully played by Derek Luke) remembers his pain, you also experience it in a way.  Ultimately, however, the effect is not dark but inspirational.  The movie is about how Antwone struggles to be strong and to overcome his past---this struggle, to one degree or another, is one we all can identify with.

The acting was wonderful and the writing was also.  The special features that came on the DVD version I bought (widescreen version) included information and a feature about the real Antwone Fisher.  After he left the Navy, he was a security guard.  A producer discovered his background, believed in him, and supported him in writing the screenplay himself.  So the film is especially poignant in that it was written by the man who experienced it, one who does not have a writing background or college degree, yet who writes movingly, realistically, and wonderfully.

Although the subject is serious, the film does not leave you with a depressing feeling, but encouraged and uplifted about the human experience.  I would have given it five starts, but I save that rating for "great" movies; although this movie was not great, it was moving and very worthwhile to watch and own.
