I bought the set based on reviews claiming the series is on par with "Fawlty Towers" and the "Yes Minister" series. Another reviewer compared it to "Everybody Loves Raymond". Good Neighbors was described as a 1970s show about an upper-middle-class couple, Tom and Barbara, leaving the rat race to become self-sufficient farmers. Since I lived through the 70s "revolution" I envisioned great potential for comedy.
Alas, none of the above is accurate.
The rat race Tom was leaving was a well paying, low pressure, comfortable job as a designer, to convert his London suburb house into a farm with a noisy tractor, pigs, a goat and even a horse, to which the neighborhood, and the government did not seem to object. On one hand the show aims to express the 70s ideology of back to nature, self-sufficiency, etc., on the other the couple still enjoys the trappings of upper-middle-class life, like a fancy restaurant and jewelry. Tom even has no problem taking illegal size fish, or shooting rabbits with a shotgun on a public golfcourse. Barbara takes the hard work and impoverished life with a somewhat fake perkiness and glee.
Their neighbors, played by Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington, are much more fun to watch. Without them the show would be quite flat.
It is interesting that the show was a favorite of the Queen of England.
I could overlook the improbable and contrived situations if the show was funnier. Good Neighbors is not on par with comedy masterpieces like Fawlty Towers and Yes Minister/Yes Prime Minister, nor with Everybody Loves Raymond.
I received the set in one day from the seller "Ships Today". Amazon gets 5 stars for the purchase experience.
