Clearly one of the Great American films of the 1970's, an era which has recently been labled the 'Second Golden Era' of filmmaking. Not so much a sequel to 'Night' as it is a thematic continuation, DAWN OF THE DEAD  retains it's power to shock and surprise you with a tension-filled story of  futuristic madness, as humans battle for survival in a landscape filled  with horrific canabalism and human emotional meltdowns. Anchor Bay has  really outdone itself with a beautiful transfer here, and this package is  tops in terms of sound and color. NOTE to DOTD fans: There are actually  THREE current Anchor Bay versions out there now available -- all different,  ALL with extras, and ALL by Anchor Bay. Make sure to find the letterboxed  VHS copy from Columbia House -- it'll bring tears to your eyes! (This is a  copy so clean that spiderwebs are visible on the dove statue seen at the  end!) Overall, Romero is to be commended for a contemporary nightmare that  has YET to be topped.  For more detals, check out website called 'Zombie  Farm'!
