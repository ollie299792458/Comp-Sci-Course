Okay I understand this doesn't delve into the science how some people might like. Somebody mentioned something like "The Privileged Planet" for a better experience. I watched that movie after his recommendation, and while cognitively very intriguing, these two films have completely different aims. I watched Journey to the Edge of The Universe when it first came out on Nat Geo, and loved it then. Yes everything is CGI, but it is some amazing CGI. Of course we don't know what the surface of Venus, the Sun, and distant celestial bodies actually looks like, but the imagination and depth in the visuals is stunning. Absolutely stunning. I watched it on Blu-ray on a 61" TV with surround sound and was completely immersed. Rich colors, great movements, some general, yet humbling narrative. This movie isn't meant to teach you about how the universe works per se, but it lets you see in an amazing way the different type of bodies that are out there. The narration isn't excellent by any means, but I typically get lost in the visuals until Alec Baldwin drops a gem every now and then.

Overall, I think this is the pinnacle of visualizing our universe to date. Amazing quality and detail in the Blu-Ray, which your friends will love watching on a relaxing night. If an astrophysics lesson is what you want, there are plenty of options out there. Still get this though for the ride.
