I just purchased this after missing getting them on VHS many years ago.  They came and went just like other Universal releases ("Rich Man, Poor Man" comes to mind).

I'm almost finished watching the second season and I think the digital transfer is great considering what I've seen in reruns.  This is one series I'd love to get all of the episodes.  What we've seen on A&E and Hallmark Channels are very poor hatchet jobs.  At least I've finally gotten to see the pilot episode in its entirety.  On cable, it is cut down to one hour including commercials and you miss the part where the cops faint as well as other critical sequences.

It would be nice if Universal didn't have to put their updated logo at the beginning of each episode.  It's already at the beginning of each disc.  I'd prefer if they just left in the original one at the end of each episode.  A minor inconvenience, but this is overkill.

This is one great series that deserves to be released in its entirety.
