Just writing that this has become one of my favorite animes ever for a variety of reasons. First of all the story is wonderfully paced and the action is always constant with the storyline and its characters sucking you in. The story is a bit darker compared to other gundams, but it easily stands the test of time maybe not the  animation mind you, but easily everything else does. To get a good idea of what's going on it's best to view "First Gundam" (Mobile Suit Gundam) which is also outstanding despite it's age (the movie pack suffices for this need). Bottomline, this anime is worth your time and money (I sprung for the expensive set and haven't looked back :) I watched this series 3 times in the first 3 months that I owned it because it is so outstanding this series and it would difinately get my vote for best Gundam ever and easily top 3 best animes ever.

  For those wishing to continue the story though please check out anime-direct.com in order to be able to download the original japanese version of ZZ Gundam (which hasn't been released in the States)which follows immediately after Zeta Gundam this one is more lighthearted but not quite as good as Zeta Gundam although it is a really solid series. Anyways if you call yourself a scifi or even an anime fan Zeta Gundam will NOT disappoint you.
