Let's get real: just WHAT so disturbed 1944-era critics about the "lurid" and "eccentric" nature of this flick? The obsession of the Glueman, natch.

They were, basically, correct in their misgivings: Michael Powell, even more than Hitchcock, was THE master of weaving his sexual frustrations and obsessions into his flix narratives. Perhaps even more than Bunuel, who had a better sense of humor.

Colpeper wants enthusiastic fellatio instead of the very occasional frosty sexual coupling with his frosty, barely-seen wife. If they've consummated their marriage at all: they seem to be childless. His frustration shoots forth in the form of the glue attacks, oozing over the hair and, most likely, the faces of the bitches, who really should be dunked in the chair hanging in his office. His blatherings about tradition and saving the virtue of the local girls are a Hitchcockian Macguffin: again, let's get real.

Poor Colpeper speaks eloquently about blessings but never gets his: fellatio from either the handsome, homosexual Dennis Price nor the buck-toothed, full-lipped, Sheila Sim: the mere woman with a sense of history!

It's fitting that he simply disappears when the miracles start happening.
