...hence the 3 stars.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was one of my two favorite books as a single-digit kid back in the late '60s. (James and the Giant Peach was the other.) I had high expectations of the film when I saw it in a theater at the age of 12. I was rather disappointed for several reasons.

The first flaw is that they changed it too much from the book. As an adult, I can understand using geese instead of squirrels because live geese were probable easier to deal with than live squirrels back before CG. But having Charlie and Grandpa Joe drink the bubbly against the rules is inexcusable. My best guess as to why is that self-indulgent, moral-relativist Hollywood types could not abide a child who would actually behave well all through a visit to a candy factory.

The other thing that I really hated though was Gen Wilder's over-the-top screaming temper tantrum over the issue. It really stunned and traumatized me at the age of 11, having read the book at least ten times and knowing that Willy Wonka would never do such a thing.

5 stars for production values, 1 star for the egregious intentional flaws = 3 stars overall.
