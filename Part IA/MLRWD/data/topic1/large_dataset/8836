This movie was to the point of "unbelievable" that it was uncomfortable to watch. I tried desperately to forget years of classes in physics and engineering in order to enjoy it. But I could not forget common sense and thus the movie was unbelievable to the point I did not enjoy it.

Parts of the movie (Including the beginning) are some sort of take off of the Matrix - jumping through glass window to 'fly' across to another building's roof top, and "tricks" with bullets. "Bend the bullet" - Really? flint lock "sniper" rifles hitting something more than 25 yards away, let alone over a mile? Preposterous. And the movie attempts to pass off blatant bizarre fiction as the truth which offends me. I prefer my science fiction to be obvious science fiction, with aliens and spaceships and ray guns when the laws of physics are going to be trampled.

For the viewers that want a special limited edition collector's gift set, more power to you. But you are not buying a clever movie, a movie with an interesting plot, or a movie with good writing. You are buying the giftset of a movie with mediocre special effects, laughable acting, and Angelina Jolie (the only thing on the screen worth paying attention to). If you "enjoyed" this movie, you'd be better off buying "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" - similar action and theme, and "believable" enough for a person to watch and enjoy.
