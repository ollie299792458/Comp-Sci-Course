Since my formative years, I've hated cartoons. All the kids were watching Looney Toons and Fantasia, which I couldn't stand! But the Triplets is a fantastic movie! It's fun, it's touching, it's visually beautiful and fascinating. I wish Belleville was real so I could vacation there. I wish I could meet the grandmother and have her by my side. I wish I was a Triplet with the benefits of their comraderie and their spryness despite their age. And the soundtrack is WONDERFUL!! Buy it! I hope this movie and this soundtrack both win Oscars not only because I think they're better than Finding Nemo (which was definitely a good movie), but also because Triplets is truly artistic rather than commercialized...a product of 15 years of work. Belleville is like Gotham (from Batman) combined with Nice (France). It's an action adventure, romance, comedy, and drama combined. Again, the visuals are stunning. When the movie was over I looked at disdain at the real world around me, preferring to look at the beauty of this artist's drawings.
