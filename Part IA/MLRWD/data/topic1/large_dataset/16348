Someone said that Mighty Aphrodite is a not an excellent production as it attempts to put in the ancient Greek elements, but fails to follow the formula of tragedy. But, what I can't disagree more is that Woody Allen did not intend to produce a tragedy. What I believe is that the director transforms the
genre of ancient Greek tragedy by making it humourous and comical. Remember what the ending of the movie tells us? "Keep smiling because the whole world will smile with you".
There is no dull scene in the movie. Every line is elaborately and carefully written - with wit. If you simply read the script, you can already tell the mentality of different characters. The usually neurotic (again!)Lenny (Woody Allen), the high-pitched, low-IQed Linda Ash (or Judy CUM!) (Miro Sorvino). There can't be a theatre in the world filled with silence when this movie is shown. Laughters and gigglings should be overwhelming the house. 
I personally like the Greek chorus scenes and the ending, which is so ironic that Linda and Lenny got each other's child, but still knew nothing about it. 
Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love and pleasure, and watching Mighty Aphrodite is absolutely a pleasurable experience.
