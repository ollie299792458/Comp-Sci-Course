I originally heard pretty bad stuff about this movie -- Roger Ebert, for instance, said it was exciting yet plotless.  After renting and seeing this the other night (which incidentally, prompted me to buy it) I have to  disagree heartily.
What does the movie have?  First, it has good  character development.  Most of the characters that matter (Buliwyf, Ahmed,  etc.) are shown in detail and have growth and development.  It is very well  acted for the kind of movie it is.  It is very interesting for it's  portrayal of the Germanic heroic culture, and the values that infused it.  I think this is where many critics fail to see the shine in the movie.  Because they are unable to get themselves out of their modern cultural  frame of reference, the actions of the characters sometimes seem  unmotivated and the plot seems to suffer.  As a student of ancient heroic  societies and their literature, I understood right away what was going on  with the characters.
For some flaws with the movie, some of the more  interesting potential plot lines were alluded to but not followed through  with.  Banderas' romance, the intrigue with the son of the king, the  possibility of the wendol as Neanderthals, as hinted in the book -- all  would have made the movie *more* interesting than it already is, and would  have, perhaps, given it a plot that had a little more relevance to modern  audiences.
