I watched this movie last night ( my 3rd time seeing it) And everytime I see it I love it more and more. When I first saw the movie I thought that Carlos would be the person that skips class and gets in trouble, but it was flipped and I was very suprised. A lot of times in the movie I said to myself "She's saying or doing something a guy would." Overall I loved this movie, but would it be so hard to get her a bra, brush her hair and not make it look like she rolled outta bed and just went to school (again seemed like something a guy would do.) This movie made me laugh and cry, and all the parts were believable. In part of the movie I felt like I wanted to slap her step-mom when she said "But it's her first swimming lesson!!" I'm glad that the father finally gave Nicole some time to actually talk to him instead of brushing her off. Jay did a very good job in this movie and I'm happy that they had his mother and relatives speaking in spanish to make it more believable.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Kirsten Dunst or love stories.
