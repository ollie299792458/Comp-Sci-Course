This movie was a lot of fun to watch, I've seen it twice now and I'll definately be having friends over to watch it again with me now that I know all the secrets of Blackwood's magic.  With the character of Holmes in mind I think R.D.Jr is a good fit for him, it's believable that if there was a modern day sherlock holmes his personality might be something down the Robert Downey roles.  Watson's skinnier than I remember him from the old books/movies, but just as composed and seemingly fed up with Holme's social skills as everyone else in the movie is.  Watson wants a life and wife of his own but can't just leave his friend to do all the crime fighting by himself.

There's enough explosions, shooting, and fist-fighting that encompass the adventure to make it a worthy action flick, but with the name Sherlock Holmes you know you'll be "on the case" just as much as the characters are with a mystery that ties most of the movie together.  I found the dialouge hard to understand at first, Holmes and Watson exchange words quickly when you are introduced to them, so put subtitles on until you think you've got what they're saying down.  After that watch them solve a sphinx riddle and narrowly escape a trap that reminded me of a "Saw" scene based on how it was designed.

I waited for the price to go down a bit, new blu ray movies are all really expensive, and the good ones taken even longer, so finally a year later after it came out I find it a great looking blu ray movie and a welcome addition to my collection.  Whether you like the actors or not it's worth a view or two! Digital copy always a plus!
