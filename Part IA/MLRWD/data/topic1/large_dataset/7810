A friend of mine brought this one over and got me to watch it, and I really have to thank him for it.  I didn't see this one in the movie theater, and probably would never have thought to actually see it on my  own, considering that I left the high school scene a decade ago.  Perhaps  because I had so few expectations for this movie, I found myself being  pleasantly surprised by this fun, upbeat film.  Ethan Embrey is perfectly  cast as Preston, the guy who believes that he has found his perfect mate in  Amanda, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt, and finally tries to get the nerve  to tell her how he feels at the all-night graduation keg party.  What  really makes this admittedly well-used plot work is the rest of the cast  that make up the party goers.  Anyone who went to an American high school  in the last 30 years will recognize these people from their own school.  True, the story isn't deep, and perhaps it relies too heavily on high  school stereotypes, but there is a real charm to be found here.  Frankly,  it's nice to see that the movie doesn't preach or fall back upon teen angst  and turmoil to keep the story going, and that's probably why I really  enjoyed it.  It's fun, light, witty, and has heart.  If you can't sit  through this without laughing and enjoying yourself, then you probably  hated high school (or really need to stop being so serious).  For the rest  of us, you'll find it to be a fun diversion.
