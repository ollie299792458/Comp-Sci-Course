I have not see the dvd version of this film, but watched the video recently. I have enjoyed many de palma films, and heard good things about this one.  The movie was allright until the sean connery death scene, and it was all downhill from there.  he recieved about 7 rounds in the chest/stomach area and still lived long enough to give costner the case winning clue.  yeah right! capone was featured in all of about five scenes, which was disapointing. dialouge was repeated over and over, for instance, "it's nice being married huh?" and "we can get capone for tax evasion!" were both repeated about five times throughout the movie, which totally grated on my nerves.  the shot of the guy being falling off the roof screaming with the sky behind him was so cheesy.  also, elliot ness makes a point of saying if they are going to uphold the law than they first have to do it by example, then you see sean connery pouring himself a shot and beating up other cops! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! I don't even know why i sat thourgh the whole thing!
