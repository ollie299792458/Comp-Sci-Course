All I can say is "WATCH THIS" and you will find out you didn't know as much as you thought you did about online predators.  Really good movie.  NO, there is no shoot'em ups or guns, or anything that goes BOOM, but it is an eye-opener and a MUST SEE.  The actors in this movie are outstanding and the direction is superb.

WATCH THIS!  You won't regret it, especially parents of teen-aged young adults.

First of all, the PC and any other techie hardware in the house is the property of the parents and therefore the parents should oversee all chat and online activities by either key-logging, or other means.  That doesn't mean you will snoop every time.  BUT, when there are reasonable questions to be asked, then snoop.

In my house, I am the Administrator of all computers.  I regularly look at files and sessions for security purposes, but if I had young children, which mine are now grown, I WOULD SIT THEM DOWN and explain to them the security issues of naming names, addresses, and any other personal information to unknown shadows on the other side of their screens.

KNOW WHAT YOUR CHILDREN ARE DOING AND POLICE THEM (not like a dictator), but look for the signs and act accordingly.  If they are way too secretive, then something is up.  If they don't confide in you, then legally, you have the right to ensure the safety of your kids.
