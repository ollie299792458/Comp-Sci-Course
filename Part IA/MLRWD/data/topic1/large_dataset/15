I am eagerly awaiting this collection. It is not without flaws, but an improvement over the "KLINGON" collection which I feel was incomplete.
 I would have given '5 Stars'  but for the "fan choice'(?) of "THESE ARE THE VOYAGES". This series ending episode almost single handedly destroyed the great work of Manny Coto in seasons 3 and especially season 4. I personally believe it was a deliberate atempt to destroy his efforts by jealous people (we know who you are). The story lines were bogus and unnecessary esp. the Riker/ Troi involvement from the 24th century.
 I am in anticipation of having at last "FLASHBACK" from the Voyager series. I was not a big SULU fan until this episode. A great tie-in to UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY.
 All the other selections range from very good to excellent-a fine effort.
 Where the "BLEEP" do we go from here? How about a "RO LAREN FAN COLLECTION" with interviews and comments by Michelle Forbes? You can even throw in the DS9/ KIRA NERYS connection!
