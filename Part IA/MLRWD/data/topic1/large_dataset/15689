The early 80's are known for their hokey-yet-classic teen movies. Of these, "Risky Business" has the most original plot and the most accurate representation of teenagers yet it still falls flat.
Known more for pre-scrubby Tom Cruise dancing in his ... than for its plot, the story revolves around a dorky high schooler (Cruise) who becomes a lot more "worldly" due to his week with a prostitute (eventually turning his own home into a ...). The point of this film should be enjoyment, except it's really not all that much fun to watch Cruise make mistake after mistake. More humor would have done this film some good because it shouldn't expect to be an Oscar-winner. In addition, the movie is rather gratuitous, becoming a tame ... at parts.
But still the film does have its strongpoints. Watching a pre-cool Cruise is amusing (How old was he in this film?). The film does move briskly along with an interesting plotline. It's not your typical gross-out teen movie either, a teen movie that actually has depth. But perhaps this depth is a little too much and the fun a little too light because "Risky Business" still comes in as a very average (and forgettable) film indeed.
