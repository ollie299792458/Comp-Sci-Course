Hard-Boiled would be the last film John Woo and Chow Yun-Fat would work on.  It's also the last film that Woo made before leaving Hong Kong for America.  The end of the "Herioc Bloodshed" era of Hong Kong Cinema.

I first saw this film sometime in the earlier 90's via my grandparent's neighbors.  Their dad was from Hong Kong and in addition to good home down Chinese cooking, an added bonus was watching cool HK flicks.  Not just Woo's stuff, but those groovy HK horror films, in addition to Jackie and Samo gung-fu action comdies.

Hard-Boiled stayed with me for days after first seeing it.  It was my first John Woo movie and it was the most out of this world action gun-fu fest that I had ever seen.  There's not much I can saw about this film that has not been written up often over the years.

If you are a fan of HK Cinema/Herioc Blooshed, chances are you have seen this.  If new to the genre this is an excellent entry point.

As far as the Dragon Dynasty release is concerned; this release is much better than Woo's The Killer.  The extras are slim but have a lot of information via interviews on the background and production of the film.  The picture and sound is a four out of five.  The film itself is a five.  A must see of the genre.
