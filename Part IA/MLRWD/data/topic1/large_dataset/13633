I have purchased this Special Edition about two weeks ago, at the time, I only saw two commercials for the thing and decided to buy it off of what was seen.  I figured, hey I might as well buy the Special Edition, if it turns out good then at least I wouldn't have to purchase it later (I am like that).  But after I purchased it, I looked around at different Anime boards, apparently people weren't digging it, many complaints were about the animation, none whatsoever were about the plot.  My personal opinion on it is that it truly is a good flick.  After all it did have the potential, I mean the directors of both Akira and Ghost in the Shell working together on the same project!  How could you go wrong?  
After, seeing top-notch animation from Vampire Hunter D: BloodLust, I was expecting a little more than what this one had to offer.  The plot is more of a drama than an action; many people don't like to animated dramas, if you're like this, skip this one, rent it instead...
The Special Edition DVD comes with the Feature on one DVD, Special Features on another, and the Soundtrack from the movie on a CD.  Making a total of 3 discs, the collection is completed with a booklet.
