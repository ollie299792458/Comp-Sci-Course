This show is wonderful there are no words to describe how great it is from the story line, to the characters, special effects, the beautiful scenery, and much much more. Season one was amazing, but season two took it to a whole different level with the addition of a new character it made the show that more entertaining. There hasn't been a show this good in a long time this is the only show i actually make sure to take time out of my busy schedule to see. Everyone I have shown legend of the seeker to has become a fan of the show instantly there is yet to be one person who says the show is not good because that would be a lie. Terry Goodkind's book has come to life in an amazing way the lush lands in New Zealand helped to create this world of magic and wizards. I sincerely hope this show is saved for a third season because it sure is deserving of it and i'm doing the best i can to help this show through saveourseeker.com it the first show in a long time that has a moral to it. it is not like everyday shows now that have no point, all they talk about is whose boyfriend is whose, who's cheating on you, who's pregnant with who's baby and the rest are csi's. legend of the seeker is the total opposite it has moral and meaning in every episode that helps us go on throughout the day teaching you to always put one foot after the other. I sincerely hope ABC decides to continue this show the reason its not known to many is through its lack in advertisement the same people who make this show make Spartacus blood and sand and i've seen so many advertisement for it, but not legend of the seeker this show is continuously gaining more and more fans everyday there are millions out there who are fighting for this show. Please help to save it its a show worth every penny and effort.
