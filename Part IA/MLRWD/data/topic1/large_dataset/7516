Better than Ben Hur, Spartacus didn't rack up as many Oscars as its 1959 predecessor did.  But it's a more fluid film with a stronger story line and more interesting characters. The performances are wonderful starting with Kirk Douglas as the leader of the slave revolt.  Laurence Olivier is the insatiable Crassus who would possess Rome as if it were a woman.  Charles Loughton and Peter Ustinov provide wit and humanity.  Ustinov's character starts out as an opportunistic slave trade who demonstrates real growth by the film's end.  Tony Curtis teaches "da classics".  Spartacus was started by the great Anthony Mann (Winchester '73) who Douglas fired early in the filming, replacing him with Kubrick.  Even Kubrick complained of not having complete directorial control over the movie - it was Douglas' baby.  Still it's a great film with terrific action sequences, great dialogue ("Do you like oysters or snails, Antoninus?) and a moving narrative.  If you get a chance, see it on the big screen.
