This is Kurosawa's fist use of widescreen, and it looks glorious.  While he managed to simulate wider shots in his past films with an academy aspect ratio, this, rife with innumerable extras and an epic landscape, is just awesome spectacle.  Like all good Kurosawa though, the story is simple, elemental, yet definitive.  The two peasants/thieves are an absolute riot, and Mifune comes across with amazing presence... as fantastically usual.

Criterion does the film justice with an excellent transfer, but with little in the way of supplementary material, especially when compared to recent releases --the introduction by George Lucas on this disk is great though.  For the price of this disk, the lack of audio commentary, etc... is unfortunate.

Truly a character driven story, the film boasts of people that are crass, yet lovable.  Not concerned with the apocalypse like Kurosawa is in some previous and later works, Hidden fortress offers a rousing adventure, which encapsulates classic story telling at its stylistic best.  As such, this is one of the favorites in my personal Kurosawa collection.
