When this came out, I had no intention of seeing it in the theatre, and waited for video. I had sworn I would go ahead and watch whatever Tom Hanks did after Saving Private Ryan, but I just had no interest in this one. The first time I watched it, I really didn't like it. Every since then, it kind of stuck, until I watched it again, and then I sensed what I had missed. The story is very basic, there are no real thrills, and everything unfolds as expected. This one plays on your expectations, by making you watch all the things you would really rather not have to see. It was very emotional for me to watch, I definitely did not want to see some of the things he would have to face, and the emotional rollercoaster he was going through. Any other actor and director would have over done this, and Hanks has that bland look for the whole second half of the movie, which forced me to actually think about what he was experiencing. It kills you at the end, by not coming through with the goods, and kind of leaving you stranded on your own island with all the endless possibilities ahead. This is one that I can watch a few times, and probably never plumb the depths of what it means. Or else it meant nothing, and was just a slow paced movie, that kind of trails off at the end. My suggestion is to let yourself get into the movie, and go with the emotions. It's most notable for what isn't said, and the most intense parts of the movie where there's no dialogue. It definitely took guts to make this movie, and I don't think it will ever be fully appreciated.
