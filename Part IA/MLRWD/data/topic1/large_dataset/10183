Worth it just for seeing Ricky Jay's film debut. He's the cleverest magician out there, putting the likes of the overblown David Copperfield to shame. This is a subtly acted and directed film, worthy of multiple  viewings. There is so much going on and there are so many layers of  metaphor, it's a veritable chinese puzzle. There are very few movies, or  books for that matter, that reward repeated exposure. This is one that  does. Joe Mantegana, who might as well be labeled a protege of Mamet's,  delivers his most complex and fully realized characterization to date. His  timing is perfectly in tune with Mamet's cadences, which become  spellbinding. Crouse is understandably confused, but by no means  unintelligent or unaware, which makes for a complex interpretation. She  buys into the con, but holds onto her integrity in the process. This is one  of those films where the audience, if they are paying attention, shift  allegiances about fifteen times. The nearest approximation in Cinema  history is "Diobolique," starring Simone Signoret (remade as  "Games"). Like that great film, the audience doesn't have any  idea who to side with until the end, and even then we are left with  questions. This is a great film for anyone interested in the intricacies of  con games, the cinema directorial debut of an important American  playwright, or anyone else who just enjoys grand entertainment.
