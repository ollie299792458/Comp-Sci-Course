I keep hearing that GITS is one of the best, deepest, and most thought provoking animes of all time, and everytime I hear it, I keep wondering why.
  The series does have its good points, but I've seen both this movie and the "2nd Gig" and they both feel like something is missing.
  Just what makes GITS so appealing anyway?  Is it good as a military series? Is it he Action? The characters? The themes and philosophical points behind it?
If that's what you're looking for, you should check out Full Metal Panic, especially The Second Raid; It will SMOKE Ghost in the Shell in all the aspects mentioned above, but most notably in the "characters" department -the characters from Full Metal Panic actually have charisma.
  People keep talking about the depth and philosophical meaning behind Ghost in the Shell, but what does Solid State Society have to offer in these aspects?  Mainly, it brings up the role that the elderly play in society, as well as the problem of child abuse...Okay.
Sounds more like political and social than philosophical.
That is precisely where I think Ghost in the Shell fails: It's supposed to be a military anime, but it doesn't feel like one.
