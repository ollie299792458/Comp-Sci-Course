The DVD arrived today and I unwrapped it faster than you can say, "I thought I was Dale."  I have to admit, I bought this primarily because it contains the MST3K treatment of "Time Chasers" which I taped way back in 1998 and have somehow lost.  I remembered it to be one of Mike and the bots best romps and on DVD, I was not disappointed.  So nice to have a clear copy of this and the other films featured without my clumsy editing of commercials (back in the late 90s, the Sci-Fi Channel was really pushing those psychic 1-800 numbers really hard, almost as much as the channel advertised "Highlander" gear).  Buy it for just "Time Chasers."  It's one of the best things ever to come out of the Satellite Of Love.  The whole 2041 glimpse at a future in which "men wear long leather coats and there are junior colleges" and "kids have become gay agents" and Mike's most hilarious comment of all time about sending Bob Saget to meet Charlemagne-worth the price in kings, queens and jacks-a "Full House", if you will.
