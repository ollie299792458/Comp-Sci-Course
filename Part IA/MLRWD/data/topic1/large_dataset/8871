This product has helped my 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter learn their sight words almost immediately.  I bought meet the sight words 1 by itself and my kids watched it 3 times in a row (start to finish is about 35 minutes).  The video loops by itself so all you have to do is sit back and watch it work. As a follow up me and my kids read the easy reader book that came with the DVD (strangely, only meet the sight words 1 came with a book and no books came with meet the sight words 2 or 3) and review sight word flashcards daily.  As an extension we created our own book using construction paper, pictures, and sight words printed from our laptop.  We also played classic concentration using the sight words.  With all of this it took them about 1 week to memorize all the sight words.

I bought meet the sight words 2 and 3 and here it is 4 days later and they have memorized most of the words from meet the sight words 2.  Now it's time for the extension activities. I still do the sight word flashcards daily, but the video does most of the work.

Another great feature of the videos is the video flashcards. The kids get about 10 seconds to guess the word before the video says it.  Best of all, this is an endless loop as well so all you have to do is put it on and watch.  It's perfect for when you have a couple of minutes when you need to distract your kid (combing my daughter's hair, getting them dressed in the morning, etc.)  The only downside is that each video has only about 15 words for a total of 45 sight words in total.  I believe there are about 200 sight words in total so I am going to have to figure out an interesting way to teach the other words.

FYI the leapfrog letter factory worked just as well.  It's the same kind of concept.  The videos seem silly to me and a little dumb, but the kids love them and they WORK.
