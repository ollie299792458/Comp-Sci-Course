Like other reviews here I love this movie as a matter of fact it is my ALL TIME FAVORITE but this dvd release is misleading to us fans I DID buy this movie just for the "DELETED SCENE" That is just not here!!! Nowhere to be found I went through it several times to make sure because another reviewer said it was here (I hope you actually watched this version) and didn't AS I DID rely on it being what I thought was the Plane scene as seen on TV because they certainly don't show it on my copy of the movie! It's a tradition of mine to watch this movie every year at this time (Thanksgiving) so I know the movie well enough to know when something has changed in it and guess what in this "I LOVE THE 80'S" version of the movie has nothing new to offer but AGGRAVATION!!! and DISSAPOINTMENT!!!  SAVE YOUR CASH!!! Hopefully someone will get it right on this movie SOON and give us ALL the extras that were ever made so we can truly enjoy this movie in a new way as never before experienced! PARAMOUNT QUIT MISLEADING AND RIPPING US OFF WITH THESE INFERIOR RELEASES AND GIVE US WHAT WE REALLY WANT!!!!!  Cybersquatch
