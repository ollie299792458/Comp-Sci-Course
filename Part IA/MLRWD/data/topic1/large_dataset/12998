This is the second installment into the Evil Dead trilogy. This is not a sequel but really a slapstick Three Stooges inspired remake of the first film. The first film was a grainy horror movie with unintentional humor. This film is the most hillarious piece of work i've seen in forever. I saw this movie for the first time when it was released when I was 8 years old and couldnt stop laughing at it's cornball cheescore humor. The "plot" returns Ash to the cabin with his girlfriend , plays the tape that invokes the spirits , his girlfriend becomes a monster , he hacks her head off only to find her naked corpse dancing the ballet.The first half of the film is nothing more than Ash taking a severe beating from his severed possessed hand and going on the brink of insanity. Then a couple related to the people who occupied the cabin before show up only to find out they became demons. Then a hick couple tags along. Yeah thats basically the plot right there. The rest of the movie is each person becoming possessed or eaten by a demon. We get gallons of blood , eye ball eating , walking severed hands , green gore , cheesy animated demons , giant trees , and of course Ash ."groovy"
