It's pretty obvious during the five minute conversation between the wanna-be Charlie's Angels (Tes, Kyla, and Dawn) that this movie desperately wants to be a Quentin Tarantino film.  Which was bad news for me because I don't really like Tarantino's films.  "Reservoir Dogs" is pretty good.  That's what this seems to aspire to, though it doesn't quite make it.

This is the kind of movie where a lot of it is told in flashback, but I'll give it to you in chronological order, without trying to spoil too many surprises.  As I said at the outset there are three young women Tes, Kyla, and Dawn.  The latter two we can forget about because they die in the first ten minutes of the movie.  Tes (Malin Ackerman) is a former strip club waitress/pickpocket who works for crime boss Mel (Bruce Willis) around the New Orleans area.  She and her crew are assigned to go to a diner in the middle of nowhere to intercept a drug shipment (or something).  The drugs/cash are the film's MacGuffin, the thing everyone is fighting over and yet they don't really matter.

But as we see early on things go wrong and Tes's underlings are killed.  There's a double-cross and then another double-cross and then another double-cross.  It'd take too long and spoil too much to say who all is double-crossing who.

Anyway, like the earlier "Smokin' Aces" this is a film by a Tarantino disciple that tries to mimic the master's work, but never quite gets there.  It's got a lot of the same pieces, but feels too derivative.  (Which is maybe why I never heard of it before it showed up on the Vine newsletter and was released on DVD.)  If you're a fan of double-crosses and gore then this is a good rental, but I wouldn't buy it.

BTW, like the earlier "13" I got from Vine the DVD includes no extras.  I don't know if the actual sale version does or not.  If it does I can't evaluate them since I couldn't see them.

That is all.
