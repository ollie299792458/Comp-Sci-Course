This movie is great for all ages, especially if you have a 3D television. I own a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NZEP2M">Samsung UN40D6400 40-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D LED HDTV (Black)</a>and and the picture was incredible! So far I have only watched this movie in 3D, but the colors and animation are so beautiful I would imagine it is just as much of a visual thrill in 2D. The story is lovable, which seem pretty rare now of days in visually pleasing 3D movies. Kids and adults alike can enjoy this funny colorful adventure. I would recommend this movie to anybody who enjoys films along the lines of Pixar material (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030IIYWA">Toy Story (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVZ6G6">Up (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UFEJXK">Wall-E (Three-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I654WQ">Cars (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)</a> etc.)
Overall I broke down my scores:
***STORY LINE: 4.5/5 (Comical and whimsical yet overall solid with strong characters)
***VISUALS: 5/5 (Amazing colors and detailed animation)
***3D: 5/5 (Great dimension and some moments when things fly off the screen right into your home)

This is surely a movie any family with kids must pick up, the film is a pleasure for the whole family.
