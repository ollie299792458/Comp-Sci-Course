If you're a stickler for historical accuracy, a lot of things about A Knights Tale will annoy you.  I am normally one of those people - but I really liked this film.  It's major redeeming feature is the jousting.  The jousting action is worth the watch and then some.  This film takes you further into the sport of the joust than any other period piece.  It lets you in and opens your eyes to the fact there was more to jousting than most people ever thought.  
The 70's rock soundtrack at first may seem silly.  But surprisingly, after a while, it works - and it even seems to fit with the story - like the knights arriving back in London to Thin Lizzy's "The Boys Are Back In Town".  You will even find yourself thinking its not that out-of-place after all.
Some of the "modern touches" are over the top, though, and don't seem to belong at all (airhorns and Nike swooshes are only the beginning).  Foremost of these is the wardrobe of the herione, Jocelyn.  All other characters are dressed to fit the period, which makes her outrageous medieval/Versace creations and punk hairdos harder to accept.  In one scene, the hair makes her look more like a papillon dog than a woman.  Her costumes go from mildly modern in the beginning scenes, and get more and more outlandish as the movie progresses.  
Heath Ledger, for a young up-and-comer, is marvelous in the lead role of William.  He fits the role perfectly.  I can't think of another young actor who could have done this with the same flair and style, yet with a serious,historical bent. A first-rate performance.
Some of the more incongruous modern touches notwithstanding, this movie, as its tag line proclaims, will rock you.
