Really good British drama set in a 1973 Manchester police station where the main character has found himself after a car accident in 2006 - is he crazy? Dead? In a coma? A Dream?

Characters are really good, stories are well written, the dialogue believable (and sometimes funny, the things Gene Hunt says...) and all in all an intelligent show that is enjoyable to watch. Not a cop show in the true sense, more about the interactions of the people who just happen to be police, and a very interesting look back at the 70s and how things have changed. (The cars! The music! The complete lack of technology!)

Like most British tv I find that watching it with the subtitles on helps a whole lot, the accents can be thick at times.

Watched the 1st episode of the US remake (available online on Amazon) and didn't think those actors fit the roles or that the story translated well from UK to US - too heavy handed, the UK original just feels "right" and believable.

Looking forward to the second series - Ashes to Ashes.
