While sometimes verging on caricature, the film comes through with an exciting story , well told. I wouldn't call it realistic; rather as Raymond Chandler said of his "gritty" stories of  Bay City, California, and environs, they are romances, not sociology.  From its earliest moments, one knows that this kid is in trouble, the question is what happens to him once the law and the killers know he has information helpful to the first, damning to the second.  Tommy Lee Jones, as the ambitious U.S. Attorney is directed to give an over the top performance but the last, more human scenes, save the film from falling into the pit of farce. Susan Sarandon does a fine job  as the kid's attorney and Renfro, as the kid with dangerous knowledge, does a fine job of being a pain in the neck without losing the special qualities of an eleven year old.
I note from the product information that the film has been around a while but, since there is nothing timely in the story,  it is as good as new, so to speak.  It will hold your interest .
