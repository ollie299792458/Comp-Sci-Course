I waited patiently for"The Woman" to be released and received it as soon as it was released. Bemused, I had watched the disturbed, angry individuals who were so incensed at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and could not wait to have a truly horrifying, experience. I loved this film. The actors are all excellent. Sean Bridgers was right on the mark as a genuinely "normal" looking monster. Pollyanna McIntosh is truly amazing with her uncanny ability to capture "untamed animal" eyes. It does have a "Who is the monster" and "Battle of the Sexes" theme and if you think real hard you can find a few more. But this is a horror movie. The genre is supposed to horrify. That is the point and the goal. Most people will not like this movie. Or they will say they don't like it because they are the type who don't want to admit they rubberneck at accidents and are drawn to the dark side. Because that's what it's like. You are watching this horrible, nasty, gory accident and you can't take your eyes away from it. In fact, you're sorry when it ends. After all, it's happening to "those" people. It could never happen to you. Wrapped in a cocoon of false security you pompously talk about how "sick" it was to everyone who will listen. Why were you there in the first place? Was I scared or horrified? Not really. I think I am immune to horror because I've read it and watched it for so many years yet I still relish the genre. However, if you are an aficionado, you will like this movie. It has some funny moments,(like Bridger's Chris Creek character's nonchalance about his severed finger) some gore, and some nudity. Lucky McKee and Jack Ketchum do not disappoint with "The Woman". It's grotesque, dark, and bizarre. I believe another horror classic is born.
