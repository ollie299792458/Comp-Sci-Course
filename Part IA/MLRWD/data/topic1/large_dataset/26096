The "Green Mile" is a triumph as an incredible story and an incredible movie that tells that story.  The actors all share equally in the strength and emotional impact of the storytelling.  Tom Hanks is ostensibly the lead character, but you feel that all of the characters are critical to the story; even one tiny mouse.  I won't go into the plot or setting of the story because the movie needs to be seen to do either of them justice.  I will say that I have seen this movie in the theater, on VHS several times and now on DVD.  Each time it has delivered a deep and emotional experience.  I originally read the serial presentation of the "Green Mile" in the six little mini-books that Stephen King decided to write.  They were outstanding and the movie is just as good.  This cannot be said for most of Stephen King's book to movie translations.  (Exceptions;  "Shawshank Redemption", "Hearts in Atlantis" and "Stand By Me")

This DVD is a worthy purchase because of the great picture, sound and extra features the VHS never had.
