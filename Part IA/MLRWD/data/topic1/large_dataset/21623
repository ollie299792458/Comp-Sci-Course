I don't know about you, but I'm only 18 years old, and I grew up watching this show.  As far as I'm concerened, there will never, EVER, be a show quite like Seinfeld.  The people at "The Simpsons" try, but Jerry is a genius.
Moreover, just take a second and do the math.  Lets see...9 seasons, that makes 9 DVD sets, and even taking the low side of DVD sets prices today, that's (multiply the 5, carry the 1, add the three...ah who knows!) THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY!!! Jerry can cha-ching all the way to the bank, and he doesn't even need to do anything.  Not releasing this DVD would not only disappoint fans, but any network executive who passes up that much money should be fired or shot.
Anyways, I may be young, but I know what I'm talking about; and I may be wrong, but I highly doubt it.  If you like Seinfeld, good for you, and if you don't, you should watch the show again, and again, and again, and again, until you understand the genius of the writing.
RELEASE THIS DVD OR THERE WILL BE A HOLE IN THE LIFE OF A BRIGHT YOUNG MAN WHO, WITHOUT THIS COLLECTION, CANNOT HAVE A SUCCESSFUL FUTURE!
