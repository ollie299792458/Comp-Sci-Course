When I was growing up, Summer used to be a time for reruns, so you could play outside all night and not miss anything good.  It's nice that that has changed with the advent of cable.  Burn Notice is the best of all the Summer cable series I've seen, with Rescue Me being a close second.  This show is so smart, funny and original!  The actors are all perfectly cast and they have great chemistry together.  Jeffrey Donovan, as the lead Michael Westen, really stands out.  He's the perfect action star, very fit and great looking.  He is a black belt, so he really knows how to fight and make it look believable.  And he's really good with the comedic scenes.  He and Bruce Campbell, Sam, are so funny together.  Michael's voiceover narratives are always perfect.  His scenes with Gabrielle Anwar as Fiona heat up the screen.  And it's great that the show didn't drag out the will-they-or-won't-they have sex question.  They did have sex already and they didn't sacrifice any of the chemistry.
This video set is a must-have for true fans, and my favorite part is the commentary with the four main actors and the writer/creator.
My only complaint with Burn Notice is that the season is too short!  I want a full 26 episode season!
