As a horror movie enthusiast, I can appreciate the value and entertainment of campy horror and even get a few giggles out of a really awful horror film. However, after viewing this one, I wish to say to any Hills Have Eyes fans and like-minded horror fans out there that this movie is a complete waste of your time.

The essential plot is a poorly hacked-together story of a bunch of rookie army kids are sent out in the desert and attacked by a band of mutants, supposedly the survivors of the mutant clan from the first movie. Through a series of silly mix-ups and extremely poor decision making on the part of our "heros" (shooting wildly and wasting ammo, splitting up in hostile territory, and other such blunders that no decently trained soldier would do), they manage to get picked off easily by the supernatural-seeming mutants.

I really liked the first movie because although it did stretch the boundaries of what's plausible, there was a decent film there. The mutations the mutants sported were "based" off of actual medical science, for example, and in this movie we have a mutant with camouflage skin and a long tongue. And another with an extraordinary sense of smell, like a dog. It really just gets ridiculous.

Of course, the first movie was also actually /frightening/ and had a point. This one is essentially just a showcase for the rape scene that horrified people in the first one, made even more blatant in this time around. That scene may have been disturbing in #1, but it was not the point of the movie as it is in the sequel.

This movie is essentially a complete waste of your time. You can spend a more fulfilling two hours staring at a wall for what I'm concerned. At least this activity won't annoy, insult and bore you nearly as much.
