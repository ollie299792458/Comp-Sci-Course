The movie and its actors portray and excellent cinematographic account of the recreation of the battle of Baclava. In my opinion Trevor Howard does a terrific job in portraying the pompous and pedantic Lord Cardigan, who was mainly responsible for the carnage... altough some spread the blame among Lord Raglan (his superior) and Cardigan brother in law. That is from a movie perspective.
On the historical perspective tough, I found that some of the details of the real engagement were missing and I found the affair that  developed betweent Lord Cardigan and the wife of one of it's officers was innecesary on the movie, it was well portraiyed in the film that Cardigan was a womanizer with no need to dwelve on the subject more. Finally, too much attention is given to Cap. Nolan, who besides delivering the fateful message and creating the confusion of the attack order or not to attack order, did not contribute much to the campaing. But then, if that had been the case the movie would have been a documentary because we had no hero...
Overall I recommend the film, the wardrobe details and the recreated Crimean landscape is stunning, but on the historical aspects of the film wich could have been included without altering the storyline, my recomendation is less than enthusiastic.
