I won't go into the details of this DVD as the other reviewers have done a fine job already.  What I do want to make sure everyone knows is that this "new" Special Edition released on October 14, 2003 is simply a reissue of the same DVD put out in 1998 with a spiffy new slipcover!  It's not even anamorphic!  The transfer is actually inferior to the old Elite Laserdisc version as they failed to use the final product eventually issued by Elite.  They used a work in progress that had not had almost 200 minute horizontal lines removed (even though they thank the folks that did the removal!) that were the end result of poor storage of the original negative.  While I did enjoy the extras, I kept thinking "Where is the almost feature length Making Of, or the interviews with cast and crew or cool booklet that you get with the Region 2 DVD?"  It's a shame, really, that Pioneer didn't put forth a little more effort into this Horror Classic.  If you already own the 1998 DVD then save your money.  If you don't, well I can't really recommend this as I'm sure someone will issue a proper updated Special Edition with a new anamorphic transfer (Blue Underground? Anchor Bay? Hello?).  Disappointed.
