After reading the surprising number of negative (one star) reviews, I realized most were written by viewers who are not familiar with Apatow's style of comedy and/or don't understand the connotations/allusions and graphic images in the comedy style now popular with younger audiences.  Most of those dissenting reviewers probably only saw the movie because it has such a strong buzz among the college crowds and is one of the few comedies with glowing reviews among the more 'intellectual' film critics.  I'm sure they were suspecting more of the subtle, dry humour popular in most of the (often pseudo-intellectual) indie/art house movies.

'Knocked-Up' is a classic Apatow comedy.  Youthful in its approach, it has both the graphic, cutting (sometimes gross) humor and the innocent, self-conscious, honest heart of adolesence.

If you are a fan of 'Undeclared', 'Heavy weights', 'Anchorman', 'Freaks and Geeks' or 'Forty Year old Virgin' (and think a well-placed, perfectly timed f-word can be comedic gold), then you'll enjoy this one.
