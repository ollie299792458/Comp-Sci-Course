Branagh follows his first film "Henry V" with a fun tribute to classic cinema thrillers.  When you look at the cliched elements of "Dead Again" by themselves (film noir, private detective,  hypnosis, past lives/reincanation, lost lovers, etc) this film could have  been a big flop.  Instead, it uses them as an homage to those styles.
The  DVD includes the trailler (which is great fun), commentary from the  producer and screenwriter, as well as a separate commentary by  actor/director Kenneth Branagh.  He seems to really enjoy doing this  commentary, and I hope he does more commentary tracks for his other films.  It seems his "Henry V" DVD has no such directorial analysis...  which is such a pity as his insights into "Dead Again" are great  to jog the memory and provide a few laughs.
If you haven't seen this  film, give it a shot... but temper the great reviews with a grain of salt,  otherwise you'll expect too much.  Just make some popcorn, turn the lights  down, and bring a date... you should get a kick out of it.
