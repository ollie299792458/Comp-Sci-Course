I've noticed my reviews are, for the most part, either 1 or 5 star reviews. Once again, I have encountered a product that cannot logically be given anything higher than 1 star. I rented Boa vs. Python expecting to witness the most juvenile and sophomoric movie ever. What I witnessed was the most juvenile and sophomoric movie ever, and it wasn't even fun to watch in some prehistoric level of my brain. It was painful and damaging, like trudging through infected syringes.

Okay, this is a total B movie. Plot holes are expected. (Like someone half-way opening the cage that's holding a giant snake to tranquilize it with a tiny pistol. Who could have ever expected a snakes' tail to fit through an enormous opening?) Bad special effects are expected. (The snakes seem to glow in dark, subterranean environments. Excellent.) Archetypical characters are expected. (Silent Indian guy with arrows? Check. Rambo guy with a flamethrower? Check. Nondescript female lead? Check.)

... But this movie is a grand new level of DIRKA DIRKA. This is a film that promises two giant snakes fighting in a city, with exploding helicopters; as proudly displayed on the cover. What we have is a movie featuring a girl getting orally pleasured by a giant snake, a snake that later fights another giant snake in some dark tunnel for less than a minute. What the hell is this? It's not funny or the least bit entertaining. Recommended if you want to see how low the bar can go.
