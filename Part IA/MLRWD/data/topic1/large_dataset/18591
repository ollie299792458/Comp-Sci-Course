Every now and again Disney pinches off a movie, shines it up with fancy dressings to lure you in like "from the people that brought you Pirates of the Caribbean" etc. but as we all know one lesson in life which we should all remember, especially members of the US Congress, no mater how much you polish a turd....at the end of the day....it's still a turd.

The action was fine, lots of jumping, lots of sword play, a decent likable protagonist, but the writing failed in this movie. The story telling deviated from the video game series it was based on just enough that what could have been a great film was reduced to a mediocre film. Jake Gyllenhaal does a very respectable job in his buffed up state and doing his own stunts, his acting and presence is far and above much better than that "Donnie Darko" waste of film he did awhile back but the poor writing hamstrings his potential to become the "Jack Sparrow" of Persia and imbue his character as an icon on American Pop Culture.

Fault the writers for not wanting to bring in the ghouls and beasts transformed by the sands of time in the video game series. A decent rental for a night but just nothing to get excited over.
