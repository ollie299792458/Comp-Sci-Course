This post is misplaced,for that I am sorry,but I dont know where else to turn.I am from New Jersey,and I worked in a video store in the late 80's early 90's(not blockbuster ,but sort of a "big choice" if your a kevin smith fan).When I worked there our cult movie section was extensive(we had 2 copies of the talking  "frankenhooker" VHS package that said "want a date" in a shrill voice whenever it was touched),and it contained a version of this romero film I have been unable to locate for years.The chain is out of buisness or I would have bought the copy they had.

Its title was roughly "The Night of, the day of, the dawn  of, the  return of, the revenge of , the bloodsucking mutant monster freaks" and it was essentially the black and white film version of night of the living dead with a mystery science theatre 3000 style audio track.The box claimed that george did not copyright the black and white print becuase of his plans to reshoot in color ,but he did copyright the dialoge.I dont know if I buy that line,but this movie is B-O-S(buy on sight)to me.I would even buy a VCR just to watch this on tape(went digital 400 dvds ago)I hope someone here has some information on this ultra rare cult classic.I will even take a vhs version(I cant get quickchange starring bill murray on DVD so I am not going to hope for a digital version of this under viewed classic)
