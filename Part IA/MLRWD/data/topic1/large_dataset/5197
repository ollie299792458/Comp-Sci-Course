"Singin' in the Rain" is one of my favorite films, and I am in good company with that opinion -- everyone from Roger Ebert to Francois Truffaut has rated the film in their top ten.  So why such shoddy treatment in this "Special Edition"??  95% of the "commentary" is audio cribbed from the documentaries on Disk 2 (did they think we wouldn't watch both?) and the other 5% is Baz Lurhmann promoting his own films.  While brilliance is floating across the screen, the commentary treats us to such prescient details as the flower preference of the producer (orchids) and how one of the minor actors in the film felt about Clark Gable (loved him very much).  Since neither orchids nor Clark Gable have anything to do with this extremely influential film classic, couldn't we have given those comments a miss?  As a huge fan of this film, I bought the edition knowing a fair amount about the making of and history surrounding it --  if it is possible, I left this viewing of the film with "commentary" actually knowing less.  Give this edition a miss and buy a cheaper one.  (Added note: another person has complained about the aspect ratio being altered -- in fact, Singin' in the Rain was NOT shot in "Cinemascope" and has been transferred with the full picture intact.  See?  Now THAT'S the sort of stuff they should have mentioned in the commentary!)
