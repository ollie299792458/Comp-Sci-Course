Well lets start with the movie before we get to the DVD format.  The movie itself is good.  The action and story move along nicely and the movie certainly entertains despite a somewhat lackluster performance by Costner as Robin Hood.  The supporting roles, especially by Freeman, are superb and make up for Coster's sub par performance.
Now for why I gave this DVD 2 stars.  Everything about this DVD is atrocious.  First it is recorded on both sides with no identifiable marks to tell which side is A or B (there is in really TINY print on the center part of the disk an A and a B on the other side but you have to put it to your nose to see them)and there is no 5:1 surround or DTS to take advantage of the terrific sound effects in the movie.  Then there really isn't any good add ons for the movie except a somewhat shoddy but interesting historical background on Robin Hood.
Overall I would recommend saving your money and buy the VHS edition or hope they release a special edition DVD that fixes these shoddy oversights that really take away from the DVD edition of the movie.
