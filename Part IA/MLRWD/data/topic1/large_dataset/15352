I often find myself craving this movie when I have to make a difficult decision about something in my life.  I know, I know, some people read philosophy or go to therapy.  Me, I watch Sliding Doors.  It's like curling up with tea and a blanket on a cold rainy day.  It's a good "comfort" movie.

Helen (Paltrow) catches a train, comes home and finds her boyfriend in bed with Lydia (Tripplehorn, who is excellent in this).  Or, she misses the train and doesn't find out.  The movie shows us both scenarios.

What's  interesting to me is that I can find sympathy for all the main characters.  Obviously we're supposed to sympathize with Paltrow, but it seems like the director made an effort for us to feel for everyone.  Though there's a lot to dislike about Jerry (her old boyfriend), he does seem caught between the two women (there's a scene with his mate in the bar where his friend says, "you've told me you're not cut out for infidelity and you wish you hadn't started up again with Lydia,").  He seems trapped by indecision.  And Tripplehorn, while totally over the top (and more than a little crazy in her actions), really wants Jerry to commit to her.  She seems more frustrated than anything else, and keeps trying to push him to make a decision.  But the movie is absolutely stolen by John Hannah, who plays Paltrow's new love interest.  He's just utterly fantastic and I smile every time he's on screen.
