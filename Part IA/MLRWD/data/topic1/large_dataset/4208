I give this movie 4 stars.  Looking over some of the other reviews, one might wonder why?

The beginning of the movie provides and immediate suspense, three men researching something in a very very cold place: Antarctica.  The ice begins to crack - and action ensues.

Then the only real issue with this movie becomes apparant.  And while it's only one real issue, it's a whopper.  Time is *never* given.  The day, is *never* given.  The best we can work with are the rare cues of "a few days ago" or "yesterday" or "it'll take x hours"... in which case, was that really a few days ago?  I mean.. perhaps the speaker forgot? (trust me, when you hear this line, you will understand).

Aside from time passing at a pace that is never provided, this is a good movie.  The story itself is perhaps a bit... well, overdone - but the ending makes up for it.  I will not spoil it, but at the very least it's not the same cliche ending.

Also, the special effects were pretty spectacular at times.  Even the ravenous wolves looked real now and again.

I haven't read the book, but I believe it will likely be far better.  The movie seemed like it had so much to say, and didn't have a lot of time to say it.  Things like, as I mentioned, time itself.  Also the fleshing out of characters (like the homeless guy) wasn't all done very well in the movie.

If you really want to be entertained with this particular story of doom, I would advise you to read the book - it likely fills in what the movie felt as if it lacked.  Oddly, half of this movie is set in a library...

However, for those with schedules that do not allow the reading of a book, this movie is worth the price.
