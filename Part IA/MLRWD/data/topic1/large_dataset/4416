"Beverly Hills Cop" is beyond a doubt one of the most entertaining movies of the 80's, and I'd have to say one of my Top 10 of all time.  The acting is first rate, the music even better and plot not altogether that far fetched. I won't belabour the storyline here as others have, but what I will say is that the quality of this DVD is superb considering the age of the film (18 years) as is the soundtrack presentation on home theatre systems. (5.1 Dolby Digital) Previous editions of this film on VHS and laserdisc were much too grainy and hardly worthy of purchase, however with this DVD Paramount has pulled out all the stops. Colour quality is excellent and one will find that even the song "Axel F" has a sort of additional beat to it on this disc thanks in large part to their new method of digital transfer bringing the soundtrack even closer to the ear.  I definitely recommend this DVD for your collection and Paramount is to be commended for an excellent effort worth every cent of your money.
