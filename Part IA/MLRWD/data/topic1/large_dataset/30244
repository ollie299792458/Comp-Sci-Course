A.E.W. Mason's classic novel of the cowardice and redemption of a British soldier in the Sudan in the 1880s has been filmed several times, the best of which is Zoltan Korda's magnificent 1939 production starring John Clements, Ralph Richardson, C. Aubrey Smith and June Duprez.  This latest version directed by Shekar Kapur ("Elizabeth") is certainly lavish and spectacular:  Robert Richardson's awesome cinematography captures the sweeping vistas of the sandy desert of the Sahara and the green meadows of England, the dazzling interiors of the Victorian age and the claustraphobic horrors of the Omdurman prison, with Ruth Meyers' magnificent costumes as icing.  
But the script (by Hossein Amini and Michael Schiffer) fails to capture the spirit and verve of the Mason or Korda works.  It doesn't want to fully embrace the imperialism of the source, but can't fully condemn it either because the story hinges so strongly on this element.  As a result, there's a thread of ambiguity throughout.  The leads are unable to draw the audience fully in, though Kate Hudson looks ravishing and Wes Bentley tries hard.  The supporting players come off better:  Djimon Hounsou is magnetic as a slave that assists the hero, Michael Sheen provides much-needed comic relief, and Kris Marshall is quietly moving as a devout Christian.
Kapur's direction is a bit too lethargic, with a final coda that goes on too long.  He reaches his peak midway through with a battle that is genuinely spellbinding, realizing the spectacle but in no way de-emphasizing the heartbreak and folly of the situation.
For the widescreen vistas alone, it's worth seeing on the big screen, but for the whole impact of the great story, read Mason's book or watch Korda's great film.
