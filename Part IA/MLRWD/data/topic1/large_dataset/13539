The new Mind Bending Edition has arrived and I've given it a view - fantastic transfer.

The Blu-Ray starts and there's no top menu so you have to fast forward through all the trailers (annoying, not a good start), I wish the director kept that out.  You start the movie and you see the Tri-Star pictures Pegasus animation and its grainy and awful and you're thinking, oh my gosh is this transfer just as bad or worse than the previous ones, but after that (probably done on purpose) it changes to the new transfer from there on out and looks fantastic, really.

Sound is good for the most part as well, there are some momentary issues, like the very first moment Quaid meets the Recall guy the sound (for about 4 seconds) seems very tinny, but overall that it sounds very good.  There are a good amount of extras as well.

Add it all up, a great transfer, finally, good sound overall and a good helping of Extra's and you have a great Blu-Ray - totally worth the $10 even if they didn't put a top menu feature on the Blu-Ray.  Five stars easy.
