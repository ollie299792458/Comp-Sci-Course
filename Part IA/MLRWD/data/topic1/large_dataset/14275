I watched this DVD and really enjoyed the outstanding video and audio production but when it was over I had a strange feeling that something was missing? I went back and watched it again and then it struck me, there was no passion in the playing! It was as if the band was going through the motions for the cameras and were just putting in the time. This is my fourth DVD Yes Video and while I recommend it for the outstanding production qualities, 5* Video and Audio, I would have to give it a 1* for passion of performance hence the 3* rating. 
If you are looking for an outstanding DVD video of Yes in their glory go to e-bay and try to grab a copy of Yes "Live at the QPR".
This is a legit Asian only release (no region coding!) of Yes during the 1975 Relayer tour. It is a complete show and truly shows Yes at the height of their power and glory. The Video (5* camera work for the era) and Audio (3* in Dolby 5.1!) quality is very solid. The only down side is there is no Rick Wakeman but it is interesting to see Patrick Moraz and he gives a very good performmance.
As I said this video is recommended for the excellent production values and a chance to see Yes perform live but don't expect to come away feeling you have seen Yes at there best.....
Now we can only hope a decent video from the upcoming Classic Yes tour will be released some day..............
