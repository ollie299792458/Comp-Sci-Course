There is something about this show that reaches you on a physical, emotional, and spiritual level like nothing else currently on television ... or even, for that matter, modern literature. When I watch Northern Exposure, I think of what the poet Terrence said - "I am a man. Nothing human is alien to me". Well that is the show.

It's all about this experience we are all going through. What it means to be human. Mankind in its diverse shades co-existing on this all too large blue marble in the sky.

Northern Exposure gave me so many moments of pause, of joy, of smiling sadness, of deep thought, that I know and feel that I am a better person because of it. It both enriches and entertains. And that is powerful!

In this age where it seems everything conspires to tear us all apart, to isolate us, to scare us, where small town community is portrayed in post-apocalyptic shows like Jericho (highly recommended viewing by the way), and Mother Nature has us all on the run, that somewhere beyond the sea, and over the rainbow, North to Alaska, is Cicely, waiting to be found, visited, explored, and loved over and over again.

If any of the writers and creators of Northern Exposure ever read this, I want to tell you that you did good. You did really good.

Now if you'll excuse me. I'm going to hit the Brick.

Adam is cooking. Holling is pouring. The beer is flowing like wine and the music is just right.

Cheers to you all and long live Jessie the Bear!
