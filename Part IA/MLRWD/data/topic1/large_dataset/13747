No one reading this needs to be persuaded that Rory Gallagher is one of the greatest rock musicians of the 70's, so I won't go there.  You are reading because you want to know if this DVD is worth the $. The footage of Gallagher playing live is a beautiful gift from Tony Palmer.  How much Gallagher footage have you seen?  I have read complaints that the camera doesn't focus enough on the musicians' hands, but this is not an instructional video.  Working with limited camera budget, Palmer chooses instead to create a sense of what it was like to be at the shows.  He also splices in footage of Ireland in ways that beautifully fit the themes of the lyrics and melodies. It almost lost one star in my rating because there are two or three scenes where the music and footage are from disparate sources.  While this seemed to work in the `80s, we contemporary viewers can tell when a drummer is playing on the beat.  Don't let this dissuade you, though. This is an incredible and much needed document, which I expect to watch repeatedly.  (I've already seen it twice-and I bought it today).
