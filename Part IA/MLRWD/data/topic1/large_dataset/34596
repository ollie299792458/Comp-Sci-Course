Stargate SG-1 is a great series (at least until Rick Anderson got bored in the later seasons) and would be a welcome addition to any science fiction aficionado's collection. Therefore, I eagerly ordered the first three seasons in the "Thinpak" edition from Amazon only to find that each of the seasons included episodes that pixelated and or were otherwise unwatchable (e.g., no sound for one of the characters or, in one case, a disk that would not even load). I reported the situation to Amazon and they promptly sent me replacements for all three seasons. Unfortunately, the same disks had the same problems in the replacement sets. I reported the situation to Amazon again, and received (in part) the following reply:

"As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement. We are returning the defective items to our suppliers. We will get new stock into our fulfillment centers with in few days. Hence I request you to place the order after few days for this item so that you may not face this inconvenience in future."

Caveat emptor.
