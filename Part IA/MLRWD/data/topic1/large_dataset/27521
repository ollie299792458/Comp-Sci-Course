If anyone says that this film is boring, dull, or anything else like that, I ORDER you to shut them up. Scream plays with you like 'I know what you did last summer' or 'Halloween' never could. This movie IS the original teen slasher, a mix of humour and suspense, that will leave you terrified all night. Although it is not as good as its sequel, Scream 2, I feel that Scream is much funnier, and more clever.
The movie is about a group of teenagers, and one by one people in their high school are being brutally murdered. Neve Campbell plays the starring role as Sidney Prescott, a teenage girl who is being stalked by the killer that murdered her mother. The movie also includes Countney Cox, as annoying and persistent News reporter Gale Weathers, and David Arquette as the dim-witted cop, Dewey. The film also features a cameo performance from Drew Barrymore, who's appearance made the film a smash hit, even if she was only in it for 10 minutes!
All in all, this film is a masterpiece from horror director, Wes Craven. You HAVE to see this film. I INSIST!
