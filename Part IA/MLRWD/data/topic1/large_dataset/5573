Everybody made a big deal about Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers", calling it brilliant. But I thought it was ... One of the worst movies ever,too over the top and condecending. "The Doom Generation" gets it right with a mixture of satire,music,and a punk attitude.
The movie stars Rose McGowan as Amy Blue.Both she and her boyfriend Jordan (James Duval) are sitting in their car sharing a moment when Xavier (Jonathon Schaech)leaps into their car and thay have to get out of there to avoid the goons chasing Xavier.
After that, they embark on a road trip around L.A. They get involved in a bloody holdup,killings,and are being chased by homophobic maniacs,the FBI,and people who constantly mistake Amy Blue for someone else. The movie has a tongue in cheek quality that I felt accurately mirrored the teen angst rebels on-the-run scenario. Rose McGowan makes the movie with her witty one-liners and her attitude driven performance. It's wild and outrageous and has an ending that definitely caught me off guard. I also think the soundtrack,which I bought,is pretty good. With gore, nudity, ...undertones, and enough metaphors ... , this one's not for the kids.
