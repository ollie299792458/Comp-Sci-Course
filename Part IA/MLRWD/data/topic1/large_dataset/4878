this DVD set is GREAT! ALL the episodes are shown complete and uncut, with scenes that haven't been shown in years, since they've, unfortunately, been cut from the show whenever it's shown on TV to make room for commercials. As a result, all the episodes are shown in their original length of 24-25 minutes. And, the audio and video is so clear, it almost knocks you over! Columbia House realeased the episodes on VHS in the 90s, also uncut, but they were released out of order, unlike these. Also, these have the option to play them with, or without the laugh track-a REALLY nice touch that I wish all TV DVDs had. I'm just hoping that when they're done realasing the entire series, they'll release the spin-offs-"AFTER MASH", "TRAPPER JOHN, M.D." (although, that was considered a spin-off of Trapper John in the movie "M*A*S*H"), and the unsold plot "WALTER"-it had Radar as a cop, in the post-Korean war midwest. It was only shown once, and only in a couple areas of the country.

It would have been nice, though, to see some "extras" included on the discs.
