WOW! I recently saw this movie on a hotel pay per view deal.
I was blown away. The trailer hinted that it might be a good film but this movie really delivers. it is somewhat like a new take on a John Hughes formula but with more believable less stereotyped and more complex character development. It is an amazing script that captures its time period perfectly.
Having once had the opportunity to have worked in the film industry, a film as great as this makes me sorry that I ever left it and is one of those films that if you are very lucky you have the opportunity to work on.
Greg Mottola's directing and writing is top notch. he does a amazing job with his actors and they all shine.
The cinematography is also amazing as is the edit. It feels like the director has actually caught all of those fleeting moments in life in your early 20's in the late 80's just as they happened and almost has a documentary look to it without being overt or overly stylish.
The edit is also amazing and the whole film comes off as very stylish but none of its artistic elements ever get in the way of the characters or the narrative.
This is the best movie of its type I have ever seen and is a must see.
Finally the soundtrack is epic with the best mix of songs from 80's era music in any film ever.
Greg Mottola is a genius and I would quit my career to work with him as an assistant.
