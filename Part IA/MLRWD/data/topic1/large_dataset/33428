Great storyline and fine acting. The way the story twists and turns through-out and gradually changes track from a political scandal to catching a ruthlessly evil old man is extremely well intertwined.

** Spoilers:
I had trouble getting into JN's character. He toned down the overacting to such an extent that I found his character rather bland. Brilliant that he spends half the movie wearing a stupid looking bandage on his nose, and still gets the girl.

The ending:
So RP sets us up to believe that they are going to escape to Mexico, but in reality she heroine gets shot and probably dies, her father wins ... Ok, that's a nice unexpected cruel twist to the end, but what did happen to their ride to Mexico? Why were they riding in their car knowing that anyone could find them (and of course everyone did)? Why would a police officer fire live ammunition at a car containing an innocent young girl in the middle of a crowded street in Chinatown? Did he go to prison? The end, (nicely unexpected as it was) was too inconsistent.

Once everyone arrives at Chinatown, you can skip the end .. you're not going to like it anyway.
