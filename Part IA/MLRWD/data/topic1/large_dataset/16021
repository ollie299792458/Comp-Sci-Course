This film starts off in a troubling way.  You look down from the clouds at the town of Ithaca, CA. You get a voice-over narration from a character you  soon learn is the dead father of the family you're about to meet.  This is  just the beginning of a relentless artillery barrage of syrupy  sentimentality. The story focuses on the character of Homer, played by  Mickey Rooney.  His older brother Marcus, played by Van Johnson, is a  soldier fighting in WWII.  Another important character is his younger  brother Ulysses, played by Butch Jenkins.  Aside from male characters all  named after Greek or Roman figures, there is a cast of underdeveloped  female characters whose primary purpose seems to be acting saintly.  Indeed, the whole family is too saintly.  The film is a series of contrived  scenes all designed to tug your hearstrings, most of which leave you  embarrassed.  Perhaps the most ridiculous element of the plot concerns the  character of Tobey, soldier-friend of older brother Marcus.  Tobey is an  orphan who hangs on Marcus's stories of family life as avidly as a hungry  dog might chew a soup bone. The movie culminates with a strange and, in my  view, twisted homecoming which is even more unbelievable than the rest of  the plot.  The best one can say about this film is that at least MGM spared  us from author William Saroyan's original vision, which would have  delivered four hours of this mawkish nonsense.  The novel Saroyan wrote,  based on this screenplay, is, alas, as disturbingly awful as the film  itself.
