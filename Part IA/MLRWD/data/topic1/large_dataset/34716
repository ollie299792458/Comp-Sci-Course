I bought this complete series; am a 50 yr old man who remembered this vaguely growing uo as a teenager...I have studied Southern Hung Gar in my thirties and forties and still do open forms outside in the park. This series is very well done, I am so glad I bought it. Most of the episodes I haven't seen or don't remember. The kung fu is mild by todays standards; but that is part of what makes it so tasteful and exceptional in my humble estimation. David Carradine is truly excellent in this role; but all the other supporting actors and actreses, incluiding children by the way, are so professional....as fine a screeen or stage character actors as you are likely to ever see. Makes you realize how TV is such garbage anymore...they could not or would not create and produce such a quality program today, it just wouldn't happen. Kudos to Jerry Thorpe. I find his directed episodes to be the most authentic and awesome. This is highly recommended if you are a fan of any Chinese Martial Arts, in this case northern Tibetan Black Crane, but also as a statment for its time..this series was far out ahead of anything else and stands up quite well on it's own merit today in 2009.
