Taras Bulba is the entertaining, 1962 film adaption of Nikolai Gogol's short novel. The film is based on the revolts of the Zaporozhian Cossacks against their Polish overlords, which began in the early 17th century.

Yul Brynner is simply outstanding as the Cossack hetman. He was born for the part. Tony Curtis is a bit stiff as the son who turns against his father and his people for a Polish damsel. A Ukrainian Cossack with a Brooklyn accent? Ridiculous. German actress, Christine Kaufmann, plays the love interest, Polish noblewoman, Natalia Dubrov. What a beautiful girl! In real life, 37-year-old Curtis divorced actress Janet Leigh to marry his 17-year-old co-star.

Director J. Lee Thompson does a decent job on this film, one of those Hollywood blockbuster historical epics of the late-50's and early 60's. The scene where Brynner breaks into song is a bit annoying but par for the course for Hollywood films at that time. Another scene, where Curtis and a rival Cossack jump their horses over a narrow chasm in an equestrian duel, is an absolute hoot.

This movie was one of my favorites growing up in the 60's. I wouldn't miss it whenever it came on television. But, being Polish American, I was bit annoyed that the Poles were cast as the bad guys.

Like most films based on historical events, Taras Bulba takes some liberties. The Ukrainian conquerers enter the Polish city of Dubno at the end of the movie promising a reign of magnanimity and liberty for all. However, history records that the Zaporozhian Cossacks slaughtered 100,000 Jews during the most famous of the revolts,  the Chmielnicki Uprising, which began in 1648. A number of Jews worked as agents of the Polish magnates and were deeply resented by the Ukrainian peasantry.

For the Polish perspective on the Chmielnicki Uprising, read "With Fire and Sword" by Henryk Sienkiewicz or see the same-titled Polish film, available on DVD and starring drop-dead gorgeous Polish actress, Izabella Scorupco.
