Compulsive Behaviour Disorder is another one of those sadly misunderstood forms of mental illness which can affect anyone at any time during their life. It can range from the repeated washing of hands to the complete opposite end of the scale, in other words self harm or self mutilation. It takes a special kind of Sicko to make a very nasty film like this and to actually attempt to pass it off as a piece of high brow cinematic art!!! This DVD was given to me on someones, recommendation !!  The portrayal of what this character goes through during the film came across as voyeuristic and vomit inducing!! And it constantly pretends to be highly creative and artistic!!! We are never once given a deep look into the unfortunate victims mind, instead, we are just pushed along from one piece of gore to the next!! And trust me when I say that this IS NOT the sort of film you should be leaving lying around for children to see!!! Let alone anyone actually suffering from this nasty illness! It should be hoped that Marina De Van quietly vanishes into a very dark corner somewhere never to be heard of again!!!
