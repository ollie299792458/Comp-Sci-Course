First off the movies look great, no complaints whatsoever with that. The Sound is amazing! you can choose either surround sound or Mono. The point is that the movies look and sound great ! The packaging is also great, nice and firm and the book is pretty sweet too. My only complaint, along with a few other people, is the rubber DVD holders. I got annoyed real quick with those things but I found a pretty simple solution to that. Buy DVD Hubs. Those hubs are the DVD teeth that hold them in place like a regular DVD or CD case. I bought a set of 25 DVD Hubs right here on amazon for like 5 bucks, I took the rubber pads off and replaced them with the hubs and BAM !!! now the discs stay firmly in place. I loved the box the discs came in so I hated the idea of them getting scratched in there, get these hubs and you should be set :-)

here is the link in case you are interested. I have no affiliation with this company or product by the way, I jut thought it worked really well.
