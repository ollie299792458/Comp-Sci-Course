Brad Pitt sums it up best in the DVD edition of Legends of the Fall. It's the way a movie should be made, and it was made superbly. Set in Montana and thereabouts, Legends is about a family on the verge of WW1, who are very passionate and genuine, living in a seemingly distant far away world, somewhere in the vast country, in an era of discontent, because of wars, and rumors of wars. The musical score by James Horner really captures the whole surrounding and emotion that Legends brings. I'm sure many others have gotten the plot down.
( Originally a novella by Jim Harrison.)
So I will talk about the DVD. The DVD is a great buy, I just purchased it the other day. For the money, it is worth it, though I was a little disappointed at the length of the Featruette.
