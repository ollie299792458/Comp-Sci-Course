So I finaly saw the runaways the other night, I wanted to see this movie so bad and waited so long for it! It is about time they made this movie I fell in love with all the band members from the moment I saw and heard them as a youngster. I have been getting tired of all the hip hop based movies and sorry role models that are out now adays Im not saying runaways where good rol models though. I am saddened that there are not many rocker bands like when I grew up or all female bands like the Runaways. So now on to the movie, I can't say I was disappointed I don't have complaints but I have things I wish they would have done in this movie but it comes nowhere near portraying the emotions and feelings that the documentary can make you feel by hearing it directly from the band members mouths. The documentary makes my eyes water and chokes me up everytime I watch it. I'm glad I saw Edge play 1st because I would have been lost in the movie with out it. I wish they would have showed more from the beautiful and gorgeous Scout Taylor Compton who played Lita and more about Sandy West the now diciest drummer. The movie focused mainly on Cherie Curry and Joan Jet, which is not a bad thing, It seemed like a lot of chaos and just not enough time to put everything in the movie. I am really glad they finally made a movie about them and will by this movie day one when it comes out on blu ray. If you like and appreciate great rock bands you will like this movie, I highly highly recommend watching the documentary 1st. I wrote an extensive review on Edge Play the documentary for the Runaways if you go to my reviews.
