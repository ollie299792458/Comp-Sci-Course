I'm a HUGE fan of the Pirate series of movies...can tell you the next line before they say it kind of fan.  (yeah I know...get a life :P)

First time I saw this movie I was disappointed. (Over the top expectations?)  Seemed to me the returning characters were more like secondary characters.  Not enough Jack/Barbossa or Gibbs.  I also missed Will/Elizabeth.

Found myself on a rainy day with nothing to do so took my daughter to see it again.  Second time around I enjoyed it much more!  It is different than the first 3 but not so much in a bad way.  I think that was my disappointment the first time I saw it.  Was expecting (hoping?) for the same type of movie as the first 3.  After I got over that part I was able to enjoy this movie for what is is.  An entertaining movie that does follow (to a point) the other 3 but just hmmmm different?  I also found that while not as much as the first 3 the other characters were a big part of the movie (well...maybe not Gibbs so much?)

That said I do with they had filled in a few more blanks between 3 and 4.  They did a little but not enough that really told what everyone was doing since 3.  Also not one mention of Will/Elizabeth.  Those 2 things would have really helped bring the stories together.

There are some inside jokes that if you haven't seen the first 3 you won't get.  That said it is also a movie that could stand on it's own although not recommended! Watch the others in order before this one.

Hoping when it comes to 5 (and from what I hear there will be a 5) they try to add a little more of 1,2 and 3 in with 4 to make another 5 start rated movie!

Recommended.
