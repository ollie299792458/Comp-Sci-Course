Sisters is a psycological thriller that maintains your interest with its deliberate pacing, eerie imagery, and excellant camera work. Most notable is the unique split screen shot that shows the murder victim spell help with his blood from his vantage point as well as the lady's vantage point in the adjacent building.  Other interesting camera work abounds.  Margot Kidder is alluring, but average.  Charles Durning is a goofball who adds comedic touches where they are needed (note the ending).  The guy who plays the doctor/husband looks like Doc on Loveboat after a few drinks (scary).  The Grace Collier character is interesting as well.  Ultimately we follow her as she tries to solve the mystery (Hitchcock technique). The soundtrack is terrific even tough it could have come from the Psycho sessions (from Pyscho's Herrmann).  This film has a certain charm in that it takes time to tell the story.  Modern films often rely on slick editing but ultimately lacks substance.  This film does have some substance as it probes the relationship between siamese twin sisters and their physical not psychological splitting..  The film is only predictable in that it was made almost 30 years ago and we are jaded.  The dream/hypnotic sequences are perhaps the most interesting because they propel the story, disclose important information, and places the antgonist literally in the protagonist' skin.  As always Criterion has put out a superb DVD with a good looking transfer.  It is a little lean on the extras though.  This film truly is disturbIng, even shockingly violent.  But if you like Hitchcock, De Palma, or even Margot Kidder I recommend this movie.  This makes up for mission impossible.
