Alien invasion by altering the DNA of the world's inhabitants. Wonderful concept! This series was too soon cancelled but the originators were thoughtful enough to give us a final episode that provides some closure.

The acting is well done and it was fun to see Brent Spiner in a role where he was not an artificial being (ST:TNG) or a doomed (mad?)scientist (Independence Day). Carla Gugino, Brian Van Holt and Rob Benedict were fine in their roles but I was pleasantly surprised to see Peter Dinklage in a role where he plays a substance abusing linguist/mathematician, and not a short person who has problems and evokes sympathy because of his height. Peter is excellant.

I did notice that this series has echoes of the X-Files but from what I saw in the 13 episodes it had a chance to be superior to the Duchovny vehicle. Or maybe I just got tired of the X-Files as it went on. The three scientists (Spiner, Dinklage, Benedict) were a darker, less humorous Lone Gunman.

Was it the best alien invasion tale? As someone who grew up on 1950's science-fiction movies and science-fiction paperbacks and the Science-Fiction Book Club, I would probably say no. Kevin McCarthy's Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the remake with Donald Sutherland are superior as is the TV series Invasion. But that is very good company to be around.

Buy this set. You won't regret it.
