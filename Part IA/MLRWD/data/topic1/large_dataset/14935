Musician-for-musician, I think the Who was the greatest band in the history of rock and roll. I can't think of a better guitar player/writer than Pete Townshend, Roger Daltry is unbeatable as a lead singer, John Entwhistle was absolutely without peer as a bass player and Keith Moon's wacko explosive drumming style made everyone else sound uptight.

That said, I never much cared for Tommy.

God knows, I tried. I saw it in a high-end theater when it came out in 1975, but I walked out feeling less than enthusiastic. Why? The story is just a stone downer, even if Tommy does achieve transcendence in the end.

Granted, it has its moments: Ann-Margret in her skin-tight white jumpsuit writhing in a soup of baked beans and chocolate syrup; Tina Turner at the height of her voluptuousness; Jack Nicholson being, well, Jack Nicholson.

But Cousin Kevin and Uncle Ernie and the smarmy greasiness of Oliver Reed (who drank himself to death in 1999) still make me want to turn away.

The movie is eye candy of the highest order, the music is classic Who, but the story is just plain ugly.

From a technical standpoint, however, the video and audio on the new Superbit special edition are fabulous. The wonks at Sony have given us a surround sound experience far superior to what we geezers got in the best of theaters 30 years ago.

If you have a home theater/surround sound setup and like Tommy, this DVD is a must-have. It'll blow your mind.

As far as I'm concerned, I'd much rather have a similarly tweaked Superbit version of Quadrophenia.
