Comparing the Haunted Mansion to Pirates of the Caribbean is pointless, Pirates was easily the superior film.  Coming out of the theatre at a screening the week before it's release, I knew that Haunted Mansion wouldn't reach the large numbers that Pirates pulled in.  In know that Eddie Murphey's fan base isn't necessarily spilling over, but I don't really believe that this is the reason for this.
I really enjoyed the Haunted Mansion, and I will definately be buying this movie on DVD, but that's because the movie literally was tailored to people like me:  a huge fan of the ride.
Pirates was successful because the movie stands alone as a film.  While the movie was based on the ride, the film only made nods to the ride here and there.  The film had it's own story, it's own characters, and didn't try to make a story out of an attraction with no real story.  In know several people who have never been on the ride, and they absolutely loved this movie (yeah, Johnny Depp helped out a little.)
The Haunted Mansion did the opposite.  The movie is literally a translation of the ride to the big screen.  While this is good for fans of the ride, it isn't so good for those who have never been on the ride.  While I really enjoyed watching for the nods to the ride, I also recognize that someone who didn't see the novelty of the film would merely think it was a mediocre rip-off of the 1999 version of The Haunting.
I guess what I'm saying is that unlike Pirates, if you haven't been on the ride before, you may not enjoy the movie as much as someone who knows the ride.
