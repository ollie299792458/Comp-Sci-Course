To Kill a Mockingbird rates my highest rating possible on at least three levels.

1. The film and screenplay are superbly adapted from the Harper Lee Novel. Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch. The child actors Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are natural and very believable. Robert Duvall almost steals the show without even one word of dialoge.

2. The disc and it contents are unbelievable and add true value to a already GREAT FILM. There is just a bit of redundancy in some of the documentary materail but this can be forgiven. The "A Conversation with Gregory Peck" is highly recommended to all who love and respect Gregory Peck.

3. To Kill a Mockingbird in either book and film form provides us true examples of the best and the worst tendencies of mankind.

Atticus Finch for instant is what every Father should be and is the lawyer we would want defending us if we were in trouble. On the other hand Mr. Ewell is the devil himself.

This is a movie that should be viewed many times if for no other reason than to remind us of what fine filmaking can be.
