The Final Destination Series is a successful horror series. It is one of those series that will probably continue making sequels (FD5 is supposed to release in Summer 2011). Well, I love the Final Destination series, they are entertaining - not very scary, but the deaths are very interesting. I personally favor the 3rd and 1st movie, while 2 and 4 are my least favorite - but I still like them! Well, I was shopping in this DVD store that is closing down and they had "Final Destination 1" on Blu-Ray for $12.99 with an 80% off discount. The Blu-Ray was only $2.50 in the end. The Blu-Ray is the Canadian edition, but it's exactly the same as the USA Blu-Ray release - same special features, ect. The only difference is that it has 18A instead of an R-Rating.

DVD review:
The quality is excellent (for an older DVD release). The movie is enjoyable and fun to watch. There's two different kinds of packaging. One is a Snapper (I believe it includes both Widescreen & Fullscreen), the other is a Widescreen Standard DVD case. In the end, it's a great movie - with lots of special features.

Blu-Ray Review:
The quality is pretty good (better than the DVD). The Blu-Ray has grain as well.
