Mary Fiore is the wedding planner extraordinaire.  Since she has always been unlucky in love, she decides that those that can't wed - they plan!  While crossing the street, her heel becomes lodged in the street grate.  As she tries to free it, a dumpster comes loose heading her way.  In the nick of time, she is pushed out of the way, but hits her head on the pavement and looses consciousness.  When Mary comes to, she finds out that handsome Dr. Steve Edison saved her.  Her assistant sets up a date for them that works out very well except when he begins to kiss her it starts to rain.  The next time that she sees Dr. Steve is when - surprise surprise - she meets the groom of the current wedding she is planning.  Mary vows to remain distant and to plan the best wedding for Fran and Steve, but the heart wants what the heart wants.

This is a very entertaining and heartfelt movie.  Jennifer Lopez is wonderful and Matthew McConaughey is sexy and charming.  What great chemistry they have on screen!
