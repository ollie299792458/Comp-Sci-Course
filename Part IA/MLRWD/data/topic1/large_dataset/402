As a long time fan of the series, I ordered this with great anticipation.  I was very disappointed with the result.  As with many of the reviewers, I'm stunned at how much the shows have been butchered beyond recognition.  I started with the John Wayne episode (I believe the second one ever telecast) and just about fell out of my chair when it ended a scant 20 minutes later.  Songs are gone, performances are gone, only bits and pieces of this classic show remains.  What shocks me most is that the Official Dean Martin Fan Center is actually endorsing this collection and claiming to be involved.  Really?  You guys are actually proud of this set?  And you're thankful you were involved?  Which parts are your proudest of?  Guests mentioned in the closing credits that never appear in the body of the program?  Or the vast amounts of Dean comedy and songs that have been removed from the shows?  For completists only; Buyer Beware.  It's always nice to see Dean... what little of him you can see in this collection...
