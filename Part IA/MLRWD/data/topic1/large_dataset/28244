I'll save space and say that I agree with the other posts that laud the show for it's quality and usefulness.

Unfortunately, the DVD set is seriously flawed. Amazon lists the aspect ratio as 1.33:1 and technically that is correct. But the DVDs are actually letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame. Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery. Even cheap, direct-to-video DVD releases are in anamorphic format. I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.

If you have an older home theater system, this set being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.

Come on, History Channel, move your DVD releases into the 21st Century.

I would give the show five stars, but to balance all the five star reviews of the show that ignore the quality of the DVDs, I'm giving it one star.
