The Sentinel is one of my top 10 favorite horror films of all time.  It has a very simple plot:  woman lives in an apartment that's haunted by past tenants who happen to be murderers, and she's next in line to serve as the Gatekeeper to Hell.  Simple, and it works!  There's also a generous amount of blood and gore, too.  The cast is fantastic:  Chris Sarandon (from Fright Night fame), Beverly D'Angelo (National Lampoon's Vacation...and you see her breasts!), Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum, and Burgess Meredith (Penguin from the classic Batman series).

I've actually visited the area in Brooklyn on Montague St. where the apartment complex seen in the movie is located.  It's still there!!  Definitely is an awesome sight after having seen this movie.

Also, towards the end of the movie when Chris Sarandon chokes Father Halloran on the floor, they zoom in on a portrait of St. Rita.  I have that EXACT same portrait hanging in my house!  In fact, I got it at a garage sale a few years ago...Some woman down the block from me was just giving it away.  And I first saw this movie AFTER I got the portrait!  You have no idea how creepy it felt to see that same picture in the movie!  I'm not sure if there are any replicas out there, but to the best of my knowledge, the portrait I have in my possession right now is the SAME one that was used in the movie!!!

I constantly paused that part in the movie just to compare the two portraits, and they're identical. On the bottom of my portrait is a gold plaque with "Saint Rita" engraved on it.  It's slightly off-center, so I tried to see if the off-center plaque was also visible on the portrait in the movie.  Unfortunately, the entire bottom of the painting is blacked out, so I couldn't tell if it had the plaque or not!  Very weird...

If anybody else has that same portrait, please let me know.  If not, then I absolutely have a prop from the film!
