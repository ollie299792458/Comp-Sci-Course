I didn't really "get" the movie until afterwards when I started reading some of the IMDb reviews and board comments. I had heard that the film was done "backwards" but it didn't really click for me until I read a bit more. The movie is engaging and it makes you wonder what's going to happen next. In terms of the climax, lots of things cleared up by the time the black-n-white (forward) and the color (backwards) met up. That's when the movie really started making sense.

There were some gross moments that turned my stomach, but other than that, the violence was tolerable. It wasn't as bad as I was expecting.

Oh,since I did mark it spoiler, I believe that the cop was telling the truth about everything. For a few reasons, one of which was Lenny's memory of giving his wife an insulin shot. By the end, it seemed to me that he made up the story about Jenkins in order to "deal" with his role in his wife's death. And then his monologue at the end where he pretty much set up the cop so that he would be the one he went after was creepy. Lenny was pretty dangerous, and if this were real life, it would be scary for someone like him to actually be on the loose.
