This was such a good, bright, intriguing, magical movie. However I couldn't give it the full 5 stars for two reasons. First, it is terribly sad. I generally don't mind "bittersweet" movies, but this one just drug me too far down that even the joyful ending couldn't erase the sad feeling from earlier in the film. Mahoney's distress was just too real!

The second reason is the manner in which Magorium dies. I love that the movie somewhat "demystifies" death, reinforcing that a life well lived is not a cause for sadness but of celebration and honor. But the fact that they made his death so ordinarily human with the funeral and everyone lined up at his graveside dressed in black, really disappointed me. I was so hoping as they showed his feet on the night he "departed" that somehow they would just disappear as a fitting end to his magical life. Instead I was left with the terrible question, "What did he do to himself?" and "Who found his body?" etc. I am relatively certain that kids over a certain age are savvy enough to ask the same questions. And the way the movie portrays it, I don't think there are satisfactory answers.

This portrayal of death with the questions it raises take away from the main message of the movie that, "Your life is an occasion... rise to it," and that we do that by believing in ourselves and by faith in the seemingly impossible. "Wonder Emporium" is a beautifully crafted movie with only this one dark spot in my mind.

This is the kind of movie that seems like it must have been a well-loved book first with it's classic kid-lit characters... what a joy to find that there are people in Hollywood with the talent and imagination to create a story like this in present times! I look forward to more.
