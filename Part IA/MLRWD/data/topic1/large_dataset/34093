Who couldn't love Ferris? He is popular, creative and gets away with everything. Ferris takes a day off from school and travels to nearby Chicago to spend a day with his friends and see the sights. He is faced with obstacles but remarkably can always overcome them. No one really knows a Ferris but we wish we could be like him. Ferris is played by the extremely talented and handsome Matthew Broderick (other work has included Glory, War Games, Election, You can Count on Me, and is currently starring in The Producers on Broadway) The movie also offers good performances from Alan Ruck (currently on Spin City) and Mia Sara. Jeffrey Jones is the pathetic principal who wants to catch Ferris breaking his rules by proving Ferris wasn't sick and instead skipping school. His bad luck and misfortune is completely opposite to Ferris's luck and confidence. The story is great and the cast is perfect. Overall this movie is entertaining and funny, mostly it deals with lighthearted themes but it does entertain some bigger ideas like living life in the present ("Life goes pretty Fast, if you don't look around once in a while, you could miss it.") and the relationships of teenagedom (Cameron and his parents, the love between Sloane and Ferris, Ferris and his sister) The only criticism I have is the DVD doesn't include any interesting extras except for a commentary by John Hughes, the director. The VHS is just as good unless you are interested in John Hughes's inside information on the shooting of the film. But I still give it 5 stars because it is a funny and timeless movie that makes us remember high school and what its like to be a kid.
