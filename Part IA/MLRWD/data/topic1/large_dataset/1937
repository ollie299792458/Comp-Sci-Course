After watching the trailer for this movie, I was very excited to watch this movie.  I almost bought it, as I like to collect these types of things but decided to rent it first.  I am glad I did that.

The movie trailer offers lots of promise, and I say starting the movie, the introduction shows lots of cut scenes from 70's and older exploitation films.  Unfortunately, this film does not live up to the b-movie hype.

The women are wonderful to look at, but I found this movie has a bit too much of the time cut scene method of story telling.  Much of the story is explained in small segments of video clips of events that supposedly happened before the beginning of the story.  It works in movies when done sporadically, and carefully thought out, but I found this technique was used way too much in this film.  It is very distracting.  What the movie offers is small segments of eye candy and explosions, but that is all it is.  A rather interesting collection of eye candy bits, thrown all together, which turns out in the end to be a bloody mess.

Don't mistake me for a reviewer that is grading harshly, or I don't understand these kind of films.  I love b-movies and the genre.  I'm giving this movie a pretty generous rating of two stars, and that is for some of the unique scenes.  I had to watch this film in two sittings, as the first time I had to turn it off.  It is that bad of a movie.  If you do decide to watch, don't be surprised if you just fast forward to the scenes with the naughty action.
