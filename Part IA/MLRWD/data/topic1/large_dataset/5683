What was John Gulager thinking when he directed this mess? I know he's already given an interview where he basically tells people if they don't like it -tough! And there's talk of a 4th film coming out. Don't get me wrong "Feast" was a great movie. Something new and held your attention throughout. "Feast II" started out good but started going downhill rapidly. "Feast III" was just a train wreck coming out of the station. It was like they made it up as they went along. When I saw Gulager's first film, I thought he was going to be a director to contend with. Somewhere along the way, he fell asleep at the wheel. Don't waste your time. Even if you were a fan of "Feast" you won't like this film. And Wow! The ending stunk bad! Can I get my money back on this? Well, John, I know you don't care what I think, but this is just another lousy movie that went straight to DVD to make money off the title. If this had been at a theatre I would have asked for my admission back. Dimension is starting to put some really bad movies out under their 'Dimension Extreme' label.
