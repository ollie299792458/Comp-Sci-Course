Each Hellraiser is very different than the other, this can't be denied. Not being directed by Clive Barker, you can obviously tell because of the way the story is told.
In the original Hellraiser, the Cenobites were there to collect what they came for. In the second, they still were, but were more evident in the movie and seen more. In Hell on Earth, they were more bringers of chaos and had more of a "monster" role, with the exception of Pinhead- you knew he was still just plain evil, but with a slightly different role. Killing those who DIDNT open the box, but still a good movie.
Bloodline.. different style again, just like the third movie, but not bad. It brings an explanation of the actual origin of the "puzzle box", and how the relative of an ancestor was determined to finish another box to destroy what the original box unleashed.

The Sci-fi twist was a little unexpected with the laser guns/rifles and what not, but once you look past all the hackey sci-fi effects and actually take the movie in as an explanation of how it all began, it definitely lends itself as a great sequel. The later movies generally depicted Pinhead and the Cenobites as background figures and didn't have a lot to do with the original storyline.

You should definitely give this movie a shot.
