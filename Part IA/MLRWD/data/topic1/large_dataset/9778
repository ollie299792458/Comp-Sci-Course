The combination of elements in this movie (alien invaders, the supernatural, cranky but brilliant scientists) are the reason DR. WHO and THE X-FILES became such wonderful successes. Indeed, the plot resembles (and probably inspired) any of several DR. WHO plots from the early 70s. The issues explored in the film are fascinating and relevant, and the acting and script are terrific. Without dissing Andrew Keir, Barbara Shelley, or Julian Glover (who are all fantastic--and damned attractive, in Shelley's case), this movie was probably the best showcase for the underrated James Donald, who had important if glum roles in THE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI and THE GREAT ESCAPE. Here, the director lets him cut loose and be one of those great scientific yet moral figures that are littered throughout British literature and history. Also, I, too, found the contrasting trailers at the end (with the American emphasis on "Mars Needs Women!") gutwrenchingly hilarious. Having heard of the TV series, and reading the other reviews, I'm extremely anxious to check out the original 50s version of the story. Still, as far as feature films go, this is one of the best possible "midnight movies" ever.
