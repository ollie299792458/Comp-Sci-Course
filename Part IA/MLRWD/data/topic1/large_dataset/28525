Somersault is a very special film. This is what I called an art film because it is not a big Hollywood movie or a Cinderella Story. It is a very sensitive story about self discovering of two people through their experiences and their choices. Abbie Cornish and Sam Worthington give such strong and amazing performances in their respective roles, they can be moving, disturbing and at the same time makes you think about what it means to grow as a person. Heidi (played by Abbie) is a young disturbed teenage girl of 16 years old that has a self destructive path, the way I see it, she is trying so bad to find someone that will love and care for her that she keeps making bad choices and so she keeps collecting broken hearts and despair. She falls in love with Joe (played by Sam Worthington) but he seems in a point in his life where he doesn't quite know who he is and what he wants in life. That's where comes the most interesting point in this movie it is their relationnship. Through each other and their experiences together they will learn valuable lessons about themselves. It is a very sensitive and poignant story. If you are looking for something different about what it means to be human and trying to find yourself, this is an excellent story with very good talented actors!
