There are 4 discs in this set.
I've been watching Three's Company ever since I was a kid and to this day it is still one of my favorite shows, if not THE favorite. I still always have to catch the reruns on TVLand. I, like so many others, always preferred the Chrissy or Terri episodes over the Cindy ones, that is until I recently re-watched this one episode on TVLand where Cindy moves in and it made me laugh out loud. So to Amazon I came to buy this DVD set for this specific reason. For that one episode where Cindy moves in -- It has got to be one of John Ritter's funniest episodes because Cindy ends up putting Jack through so much, and there is Jack tripping over things and being knocked everywhere by Cindy's clutziness... Showing John Ritter for what he was awesome at - physical comedy.
Not to mention Joyce Dewitt (Janet) is funny in these episodes too.

So why do so many people knock it? It's hilarious! But then again when is Three's Company not funny. Still makes you laugh after all these years!!

*(Just as a sidenote, in my opinion the other of John's funniest episodes ever would have to be when Jack takes tranqs for a plane ride but that is found on another dvd set not this one.)
