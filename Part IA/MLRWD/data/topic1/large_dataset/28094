I have bad news and good news. The bad news: this movie will frustrate you and leave you depressed and hopeless. The good news is that if you buy a used copy, it will probably only have been viewed once. For me, once was one time too many. The story line is awful, there are no likable characters, and no meaningful answers (which is exactly the point of the movie). Contrary to the reviews, there are no funny moments. The lead character is not "serious", he is a victim of mediocrity with no direction.

If a non-Jew produced this movie, he would be hung in effigy as slimy racist. The feeling you will have after the movie is that the typical American Jew is superstitious, stupid, cheap, and a perpetual victim of his/her own self-destructive insanity. (As opposed to my clearer picture of a typical Israeli Jew who takes responsibility for his/her own destiny to solve any problem to achieve greatness.)

Save your money. This movie is not entertainment. It is not uplifting. It is a devastating slog through the worst that man experiences. It will bring you down to the lowest of lows. Both my wife and I are trying to recover a day later. Run away!
