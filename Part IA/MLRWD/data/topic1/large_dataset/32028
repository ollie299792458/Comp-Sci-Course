Shrek is a hilariously funny love story that would be enjoyed by anyone age 1 to 100.  The movie combines life-like animation for the children, and wild humor for adults.  Known for their riotously funny and naughty humor, it's incredible how Mike Myers, star of Austin Powers and Eddie Murphy, star of 48 hours pulled off a movie for kids.  Murphy really delivers the donkey character.
  I laughed through the whole movie.  I'm not one to watch a movie over and over again, but each time the kids wanted to see it again, I was right there with them holding my side from the laughter.  The cast includes the voices of Mike Myers (Shrek), Eddie Murphy (Donkey), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), and John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad).
  The action really starts when Lord Farquaad decides to rid the kingdom of all the fairy tale creatures by dumping them into a swamp area belonging to a fearsome orge, Shrek, who just wants to live peaceably and ALONE. 
  In an effort to reclaim his swamp, the orge agrees to go on a quest for Lord Farquaad to rescue the princess and slay the dragon that guards her.  Farquaad would then marry the princess and become king.  Tagging along side of him is the sweet but chattery donkey.  Piece of cake!  This action pack movie never has a dull moment!
  Parents will enjoy the trip down memory lane with all the favorite fairy tale characters like Cinderella, Snow White, the seven dwarfs, Robin Hood, the gingerbread man, Pinocchio, the three blind mice, the three little pigs, and many, many more.  
  I would definitely recommend buying this movie on DVD.  The game and music video is a must see.  For those looking for morality, it sends a wonderful message that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that God has a special someone for everybody.
