Let me start this off by saying that I would pay a ridiculous sum of money to Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds live. I've seen Dave Matthews Band play several times, but this act has eluded me. With their previous release, "Live at Luther College," being one of my favorite albums, I was very excited to see a new release come from the acoustic duo. Needless to say, I am very pleased and satisfied with this release. It is a good combination of old DMB favorites, "Some Devil" songs, and new songs that I hope will be on the new studio album (particularly "Eh Hee" and "Cornbread.") My only complaint is the plugs about the war in Iraq. Everyone is entitled to their opinions and Dave Matthews can say whatever the hell he wants in concert, however just don't put it on the live release. Not that I am not interested in the fate of U.S. soldiers injured in Iraq because they are truly our finest, but there is a time and a place for everything. When I am listening to "Live at Radio City," I want to unwind and only think about the incredible music Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds can make, not hear about all the doom and gloom that is going on in our world today. So, that's my rant, and thank you Dave for putting out this release. I hope there is more to come from you, Tim Reynolds, and DMB.
