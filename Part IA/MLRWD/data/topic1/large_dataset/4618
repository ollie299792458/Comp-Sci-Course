It has always seemed one of the odder facts of pop culture that a Martin Scorsese film actually inspired a sitcom starring Linda Lavin. (Does that mean we had Scorsese to thank, or blame, for the whole "Kiss my  grits" thing and the spin-off "Flo"?) Anyway, this early  Scorsese feature is atypical - no pulsating urban life, not much in the way  of brutality - but extremely entertaining, with a classic Oscar-winning  performance by Ellen Burstyn as Alice, the widow who packs up her  belongings and son (the impressive Alfred Lutter) and takes off for parts  unknown, hoping to make it as a singer but settling for a waitressing gig  at Mel's Diner. For a while, this was seen as something of an anomaly in  the Scorsese portfolio, and as of this writing it's still unique among his  films in that it's woman-centered. In an odd way, this film is an  interesting companion piece to "Kundun" as both movies follow a  character very unlike the usual Scorsese protagonist on a journey Scorsese  can't really relate to personally but is willing to explore anyway. The  good cast includes Harvey Keitel, Kris Kristofferson, and a very very young  Jodie Foster.
