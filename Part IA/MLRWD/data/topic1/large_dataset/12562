There's a bunch of people saying that this is just the Americanized version of the film, but this is completely false.  The Japanese version of the film is included on one disc.  The original 98 minute Japanese version without Raymond Burr.  Everything from Classic Media's 2006 2 DVD release is being included on one disc here, except for the disappointing omission of the American version and the great commentary that went with it.

If I have on disappointment with this release it's that the disc appears like it won't feature any upgrades from the 2006 DVD version.  So you will get two documentary's, the creation of the Godzilla suit and story development, one audio commentary (which is outstanding), and the original trailer.  These are good extras, particularly the commentary, which is one of the best for any DVD, or Blu-Ray release that I have ever heard, but if you own the DVD you already have this plus the American version of the film and a commentary to go along with it.

Personally I was hoping that Classic media would wait until they could get Toho's brand new remastered print for this film.  That print is being released along with the rest of the Godzilla catalog starting now in Japan for about 68$ apiece.  In fact Japan's release of this film comes out this month as well.  The print used here is the same one that was used for the DVD release.  Which means it is serviceable, but there is a lot of print damage throughout.  Perhaps Classic Media is planning on re releasing this film in the future with the new remastered print.  We'll have to see what they do.

Regardless, if you already have the 2006 release all that your getting here is the same print with the same extras minus the American version of the film and the commentary that went with it, which seems like a waste of money to me.  If you don't own the DVD release or this Blu-Ray yet then I recommend sticking with the 2006 DVD release for now.
