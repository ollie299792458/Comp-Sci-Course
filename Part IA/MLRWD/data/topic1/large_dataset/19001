A stabbing breath of fresh air after centuries of entombed suffocating sand lung - the forgotten rustic tin man Sphinx snout, freshly oiled, yawns awake aloud and beckons that gnosis fall intelligibly upon illuminated mind-ears of the children of the Earth.  The time has come for human history and understanding to be completely readdressed. Here the fishers for Egyptian truth compare catches on mathematics, computer science and philosophical logic to collectively slap the face of conventional Egyptology with the stinking rotten "Red Herring" of its own historically fishy fabri-creation. In the immortal words of the great Dr. Morbius - "Prepare your minds for a new scale of physical scientific values gentlemen."  We have only just begun to unlock the Krell wonders........just hope Zahi Hawass doesn't stucco over it all in the lamename of "Histerical Restoration". One of the most important video series on The Pyramids, Sphinx and Egyptian Science and Spiritual Cosmology ****** Highest Possible Rating.
