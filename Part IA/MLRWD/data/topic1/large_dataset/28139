OK. I loved the 6th Sense. I also loved Unbreakable because of the payoff at the end ("They called me Mr. Glass"). I found Signs creepy and suspenseful, and the scene with the first alien sighting in Brazil will be forever tattooed in my brain as a GASP moment. I even liked The Village, though less than the others mentioned. For Lady in the Water you can read the reviews yourself (I agree with them). Now we have "The Happening," which is so unbelievably bad as to engender questions of sanity regarding all who played a part in bringing it to the big screen. The premise is actually pretty harrowing: plants go crazy, release toxins, people kill themselves. You'd think that M.N.Shymalan could really go to town with that one and bring back the scary. Nope, he decides to send us some messages instead: love is great, even with Zooey Deschanel as the least interesting heroine this side of a wooden plank; we're killing the planet, but only in the NE!; and kids are cute and innocent (but still get shot in the face in this movie). then, mercifully, it's over. the least suspenseful film and some of the worst acting I've seen since...well, possibly ever. Yes, it really is that bad. The only good thing about is is the fact that it was only 90 minutes long. I think this spells the end of the ever expanding ego that is M. Night Shymalan (who, thank goodness, at least only appeared as a voice actor in this one).
