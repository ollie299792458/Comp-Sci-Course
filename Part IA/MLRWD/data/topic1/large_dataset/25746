I first got hooked on the series when it first aired on Showtime years ago unedited (later on the scifi channel edited for content which kinda bothered me lol) - I have the entire series, seasons 1-4.

A wild romp through-out the known and unknown universe with a cast of characters escaping the evil forces of the "Shadow" by stealing the organic, living starcraft known as "Lexx", also the most powerful weapon in the universe.  The unlikely Stanley Tweedle basically a very low-level type in the society of his planet (more or less a janitor) obtains the bio-electric code which allows him to control Lexx - the code is transferred to his hand and he activates Lexx by placing his hand onto a control panel and the living craft responds to his commands (one of my favorite characters is the ship itself, Lexx).

Tweedle's shipmates include Kai a undead assasin, Zev a former very obese woman transmuted into a svelte pleasure slave with amazingly violent tendicies and a robot head which remains enamored of her, and of course, Lexx the sentient craft.

During the series various planets are visited as they flee the forces of the "Shadow" with some zany escapades as they land on planet after planet.  The series is full of cameos by various actors.  There is quite a lot of "tongue-in-cheek" humor to many of the episodes and the ever present dangers they encounter.  Tweedle is a very unlikely hero filled with human character flaws, Zev is gorgeous and hungry for sex with Kai who rejects her advances while the robot head is infatuated with her and constantly remarks and attempts to act on his obsession for her.

I thoroughly enjoy the series and take exception to comparisons to a poor copy of Star Trek - I just don't see it.  In my opinion FarScape is a copy of this series to a large extent.

Not a long-winded reviewer but for what it is worth I put this series as one of my favorites if not the favorite in the gendre.
