The Return of Zoro brings back the wonderful chemistry between Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones along with all of the swashbuckling adventure as before. This Zoro adventure is a bit darker however. Zoro must now not only battle against those that wish to oppress and destroy the lives of the "Californian's" but now he must battle against the heartache of losing his beloved Elena to divorce.

The nobleman Alejandro (Zoro) fights back his feelings of being betrayed and instead clings to the hope that Elena still loves him despite her irrational actions and that he will one day win her back. In the meantime after an embarrassing encounter with the new French aristocrat who aims to swoon the recently available Elena, Alejandro stumbles into an explosive incident that peaks his curiosity.

Now Zoro must find out what caused this unexplained and terrible incident and who is behind it bringing both Zoro and Elena back together once again to fight against those who would do evil against the people striving to be "Americans".

This movie also shows all of us that call ourselves Americans that a great part of this great nations history was carved out of the lives of our Spanish-speaking brethren and it also fills those who watch with hope that good does triumph over evil and in the end makes us all proud to be called Americans.
