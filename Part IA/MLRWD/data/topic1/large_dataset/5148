I have a soft spot for custom dramas.  I enjoy all the lavish customs, the meticulously researched sets and the witty and elegant banter unachievable in non-celloid life.  
With that said, I didn't like Vatel, which had all of the above qualities.  This is due to a lack of remotely serviceable story.  
Louis the 14th is visiting the estate of Prince de Conde, who hopes to wrangle an army commande from the king to pay off his heavy debts. His faithful steward, Vatel, is charged with ensuring that the King's visit will be memorable one.  Vatel is a genius in all the arts of housekeeping and entertaining, a veritable 17th century Martha Stewart.  Of course, when the House of Bourbon come a calling, the word "entertaining" acquire a whole new level of meaning.  Throughout the movie we are treated to one dazzling set piece after another of Vatel's epic efforts.  
Unfortunately, the highlights are overshadowed by very underwhelming story and characters.  The central romance between Vatel and the lady-in-waiting generate less electricity than a AAA battery, and is implausible to boot.  Bobbing along in the movie is a theme of a decent man standing up to a world of corruption.  But with most of the filmmaker's effort focused on the lavish parties, it quickly gets lost amidst all the fireworks, ice-sculptures and food-preparation.
Of course, all that is pretty enjoyable to watch. Your eyes will have a feast, but it's mostly empty calories.
