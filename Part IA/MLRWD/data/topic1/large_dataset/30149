First off, I'm not the biggest fan of Nightwish. Speaking in general, I can do without all of the "operatic approach" to their music. I'm much more of a METALHEAD so to speak, and I don't usually listen to bands that base their music around that "welcome to the opera" feel like Nightwish...

That being said, it was very difficult for me to get into Nightwish upon first listen a couple of years back. I was already a very big Lacuna Coil fan at the tinme, but these are two totally different bands, with different sounds / styles / and all around talents. You simply can't / shouldn't compare the two. Needless to say, I found Nightwish to be too opera oriented for my everyday listening....

Now onto this review....

I was completely blown away with this live performance. Nightwish is without question one of the tightest, most impressive live acts I've seen on DVD in quite some time. These are extremely complex songs to perform, and I couldn't have been more impressed with this purchace....

I was never a big Nightwish fan, but after seeing this incredible live performance, I have a lot more respect for this band. They are truly something special in a live setting, and even if you're like me and don't care for the opera feel to the music, I'm sure you'll still embrace "End Of An Era" with open arms after watching it for yourself....

5 STAR PERFORMANCE / BUY WITH CONFIDENCE!!!!
