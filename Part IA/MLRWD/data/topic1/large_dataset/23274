"Secondhand Lions" was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It ranks, in my opinion, up there with "Forrest Gump" which is my all time favorite. The cinematography was awesome, especially the part where Jasmine, the lion, attacked the buzzard who was beating up Haley Joel Osment's character. This child knows how to act and, if you'll notice, he was little Forrest in "Forrest Gump." So a big thumb's up for this young man who makes me laugh and cry in every movie I've ever seen him in.

 Michael Caine and Robert Duvall have always been two of my favorite actors. The stories Caine told about the heroic Duvall character seemed so far-fetched, but wound up being true as gold at the end of the picture when the sheik's grandson lands on the farm property in his helicopter.

 It is true what they say about buzzards flocking to the kill. Relatives knew these two old uncles had a lot of money, so they hovered around them like eagles after their prey. I'm so grateful I had a wonderful mom and dad, because Osment's mom was one I would never have wanted. I'm glad he decided to stay with his uncles and because of his love for the two old coots, he was left everything when they were both killed at the ripe old age of 90+.

 This is a movie I plan to buy, both in VHS and widescreen DVD, because I plan to watch it over and over again until I can say the dialogue by heart.
