The first time I ever saw an add for "Komodo" was when I was watching "Lake Placid" with my family.After that,I waited for it to come out in the theaters for about six months.It never did. Then one day while I was at the Blockbuster,the movie jacket caught my eye.I rented it and went home and watched it immediately.I loved it. Not only was the star of it a TOTAL hottie (Kevin Zegers),but it was a good movie itself.Ok I do have to admit that there were some parts of it that weren't explained,but the overall movie in general was great and I would personally recommened it to any movie lover.Oh and for the other people who saw and rated this film,and had nothing but bad things to say about it,I have but what thing to say to you: If you were a true movie lover,you would have some respect for how much hard work and dedication went into this film,as stated in the "Making of Komodo" at the end.I now rent Komodo 2-3 times and month and have a party sitting around watching it with all of my gal pals!!!Go rent Komodo tonight!!!
