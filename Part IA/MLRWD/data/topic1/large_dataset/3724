In short, this special edition DVD is what the fans of this film have been waiting for. Criterion put obvious effort into a great package of extras, especially for a film of this age. Of particular note is a fairly extensive selection of production art, ranging from quick concept sketches to expertly rendered storyboards, even a bit of tantalizing art from a sadly-unrealized sequel-of-sorts, "Columbus of the Stars."

The commentaries from stars Paul Mantee and Victor Lundin, writer Ib Melchior, designer Al Nozaki and historian Robert Skotak (all recorded separately but interwoven effectively into a single track) are also very good. There's even some archival tape recordings of director Byron Haskin sprinkled in (hard to hear, but interesting). Mantee's commentary is probably the most engaging as he recounts his experiences as a young Method actor coming up against old-school Hollywood philosophy, his fond recollections of his Wooly Monkey co-star, on-set anecdotes and much more.

The "Destination Mars" featurette, while not about the production itself, is surprisingly interesting as it looks at how the film fits with the realities of what we now know about Mars and the potential for getting there. The trailer is in good shape, and the "music video" from Victor Lundin -- well, you'll definitely want to watch it -- once.

For those like myself who've only experienced this movie in its usual pan-and-scan TV broadcasts, you're in for a real treat with the full widescreen treatment here. The print is immaculate, the sound is clear and robust even though it's in its original monaural format. There's also a nice booklet (no photos unfortunately, but lots of them on the disc itself). The menus are also nicely designed and easy to navigate. Special mention should be made of the beautiful new cover art created by the great illustrator Bill Sienkiewicz. Basically there's not much to dislike about this fine edition!
