This was a pretty good movie. It had action, drama, and romance. Kevin Costner plays a lone man in the year 2013. There has been a nuclear war and the U.S. does not exist anymore. There is no more trchnology and the  remaining survivors live in small communities. Eventually Costner becomes a  postman and tries to restore order to the bleak future. There is more to  the plot, but i dont want to explain. The one thing that dissapoited me was  the fact that we didnt see any of this apoclyptic war. I wanted to see the  war that broke down society. We dont know too much about this war either.  We figure its a nuclear war. We know about the plague that struck and a 3  year winter. I would have liked to see this though. I like this movie for  one reason because its a future lesson on what could happed to society.  More movies should be made about this. A pretty good movie. People who cant  sit through 3 hours of a movie probably wont like it. Costner came up with  a good idea! Rated R for violence, language, a sex scene, and nudity. Oh  and Tom Petty's short role as himself in the future is cool.
