This is a fun flick, plain and simple. The "undemanding" types (you know, the folks who like to be entertained and not preached to) will know why this movie is a classic upon one viewing, for it has all of the ingredients: timeless story, action for action's sake alone, beautiful women, a creepy demon, and non-stop glorious violence. No boring (and insincere) Hollywood commentaries on the unfairness of the modern class system, no politically correct BS, no attempts to be hip, just good cheesy fun. I could never understand why people who hate these kind of movies still insist upon watching them and then drone on and on about how much they hate it, ad nauseum, ad infinitum, etc. (they must all be critics who like fey "art films" and are paid by the word...). Low budget, perhaps...sometimes cheap looking, perhaps...but just keep in mind that twenty years from now all of the "cutting edge" contemporary films about "virtual reality" and hip-hop culture and computer generated monsters will look incredibly stupid. What's wrong with smashing skulls for just causes? What's wrong with fairy tales if it makes you feel good? Think for yourself, feel for yourself, and ROCK ON!
