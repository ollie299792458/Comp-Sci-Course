This film seems very well researched, seeing as a former Directorate of Operations operative now public relations employee Chase Brandon, whom usually consults on authentic CIA portrals in hollywood movies such as Bad Company, Bourne Identity, Bourne Supremacy, etc.  Although Chase has said in a DVD feature about certain aspects of the CIA not being acknowledged or not true, I would bet the techniques of combat that are brief in the film are authentic as well as disguising NOC agents through deceptive methods and the plot is mostly made up since I would suspect that the senior and / or higher ranking officers of the CIA would know of conflicting missions, even though to lower employees, the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.  This is the suspense in the movie that I will not spoil.

I loved the movie, even though I didn't really like Al Pacino's character, Walter Burke.  However, I felt that this should have been a movie that introduced us to the main characters like the first X-Men movie and felt it needed to continue with sequels.  It almost like they were setting up James Clayton, Colin Farrell's character, as one recruit that was destined to do great things after this movie's plot was done.  Plus, James Clayton has to be paired with Layla Moore, Bridget Moynahan's character, to help in these great tasks.  Zack, Gabriel Macht's character, I loved and wished that his character continues on.  I also loved Karl Pruner's character, Dennis Slayne, which I thought all the more hinted at a sequel by his character being James Clayton's new mentor.

If those who produced the movie are reading this, PLEASE do the sequel if there is one.  What is it called, "The Agent"?  "The Operative?"  "The NOC?"
