Thought I'd put in my two cents. Unlike his father, Reitman is rapidly becoming a genuine American auteur. No one working in Hollywood today gets the incipient loneliness and social malaise of post-modern America, "How we live today," as it were. His last two films, this one and Up in the Air, totally nail all the odd comic elements of a society going joylessly through the motions - the sterility and formlessness of airport culture, the soulless vapidity of small town life, the weird highway ramp hotel non-culture, successful people trapped in their own self-made defensive cocoons, not to mention the perverse enjoyment of misery and depression fueled by endless booze and empty sex..Reitman is basically aiming his films at people who read things other that Twilight. He is drawn to writers like Walter Kirn and Diablo Cody because they seem to have something to say about the sad Way We Live Now that is not driven by research and age demos. The irony of Mavis, the ultimate "hip" urban creature, confessing that what she really wanted was to be a "square", and the defenses she erected to combat that failure, is the sort of irony that would make people walk out, I suppose. Give it up for Charlize, totally fearless, who gets something about the world we live in that should be explored. Like Carlin once said, "What, are you gonna eat at Wendy's and read USA Today till the end of time???" I also was the only one laughing at lots of the lines. So what? These folks are playing to those select move goers who are too hip for the room. Don't those moviegoers deserve a few annual gifts in a world of creeping meatballism? But don't expect too many of these types of films a year..Just be thankful when they come along...
