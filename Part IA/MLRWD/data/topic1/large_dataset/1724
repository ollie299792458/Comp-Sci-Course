This movie only gets a 3 star out of respect of alien and predator. Other wise it would have been a 2 stars.

  All therer is that they added the deleted scenes original version disc from the year before and they put it in the urated version. And the other thing they added (which I was eagered to see was alot of gore) turned out to be just digital blood put in the scene where the explorers were killed in the outer surface by predators. Paul Anderson has a stupid problem by telling people that he thinks "Less is more and that's fantastic". You know what in an R-rated franchise less is not more, think about it all you got now are pg-13 movies because the studio wants a bigger fan base. Guess what Fox studios In turning it in to a pg-13 movie you lost the respect of many Alien and Predator fans out there and you know less fans is not more money it's less. Next time do it right the way fans wanted it to be not the way you want it to be because you guys seem to not know what we want and you only want it your way. Don't get this movie at all and if you do buy this and you get scared by a pg-13 movie you are hopeless and you might end up having a heart attack watchin a true R-rated horror movie.
