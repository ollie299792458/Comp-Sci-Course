So, my first viewing of Star Trek V was in the theaters when it came out.  At the time, the film felt rushed and incongruent.  It left a feeling of "lack of resolution" and "a waste of time."
So, when it came out on DVD, I decided to give it another shot...maybe I missed something?
Well, needless to say, the second time, it was worse than I remembered.  The film's tone reflects Shatner's acting style.  I much prefer it in the actor, not the directorial persona.
There were a few saving graces for the film, specifically the camping scene, the McCory flashback and Kirk questioning G-d.  The peeks into the three main characters' history was a good effort.
But, beware, the opening scene is so unbelievable, it impacts a viewer's perception for the rest of the film.  Not that Star Trek itself is particularly believable at times, but it rarely appears "staged" in the films, at least.
The concept was nice, but the introduction of a Vulcan character (trying not to spoil it) that had never before been mentioned in the live shows (animated series doesn't count) seems to fray my Star Trek historical perspective.
I tend to write this film off as "not counting."  Star Trek VI is their "do over" and they do it with great success.  
As is well known, the "evens" tend to be much better than the "odds."  The best of the "odds" however, is Star Trek III.  Very well done film, but it's a much different tone than the others.
I would recommend the films in this order: II, IV, First Contact/VIII, VI, Nemesis/X, III, Insurrection/IX, Generations/VII, I, V
