I've been a sort of fan of Metropolis since the 80s, when I first saw the re-soundtracked version of the movie.  I was overjoyed to be able to see a clean, as-complete-as-possible version with the original, moving soundtrack.  It made me feel like I was missing less than I had with other versions.  Additionally, I appreciated the fact that title card interstitials stood alone, and weren't superimposed over the action.  
As for my feelings about Metropolis itself, I love this film.  The heart mediation theme is touching and hopeful, and the characters of Freder and Maria are adorable.  Additionally, the visuals are stunningly relevant to our postmodern sensibilities - the robot is chillingly beautiful...Yoshiwara is mysteriously exquisite...and the new Tower of Babel is simply gorgeous in an overdone, overbuilt urban way.  The city visuals are very compelling, influencing our future-notions even today (remember Horizons at Walt Disney World?  The future home of the 1920s?  VERY Metropolis-looking!).  
Particular scenes I love include Maria's flight throught the catacombs, with Rotwang's flashlight of evil (tm).  The darkness, the shadows, the movement...everything conspired to make the scene undeniably frightening.
