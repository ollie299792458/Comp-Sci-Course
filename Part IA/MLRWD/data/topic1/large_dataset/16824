I knew this movie was going to rock right when it started when I saw this movie at the theater back in 1987 - the cast of bad hombres (including Jesse Ventura and Carl Weathers) as they stepped out of the helicopter, that great music, the creature created by Stan Winston and then directed by John MacTiernan...

The action is fairly non-stop as Arnold's rescue team is assigned to retrieve some diplomats (or so they think) from straying across a border. They end up finding the remains of a previous team that went in but didn't come out. The team ends up taking out a small army of revolutionaries (sound effects are top-notch but after several viewings, the editing and quick-cuts are exposed as needing some improvement) all the while being monitored by the Predator who eventually starts hunting Arnie's team for sport. The action is intense and well-choreographed.

The Predator himself was just too cool - loved that Rastafarian hair... one of my favorite scenes is when the Predator comes out of the water after chasing Arnold... oh yeah..

As an aside, Kevin Peter Hall who played the Predator does have a cameo at the very end of the film as the African-American crewmember on the helicopter.

Language and crude jokes aside (if such is offensive to you, you may want to catch the movie on cable TV where it's fairly sanitized), this is one movie you want to have a large, widescreen TV with surround sound and crank it!!
