If you are a fan of the Austin Powers franchise, especially part 3, you will think at times that you have seen Myers do this type of character portrayal before. Well, and you have! Myers has played very similar wacky, crazy, strange, crude, characters for sure. Some have complained of these similarities and wrote bad reviews semi-based on this fact.
For being a "Love Guru" whom is out to make the world a better place, he is very perverted and crude at times... well, most of the time! He is mega-rude to the coach of the Maple Leafs, played by Verne Troyer. The chemistry between the two is piss-your-pants funny as the coach tries to even the score with the Guru he literally cannot stand the sight of, which you can't blame him for!
The announcers at the hockey arena, Justin Timberlake's character, Jessica Alba (yeah, that freak show of a guru would have a chance with her), and an unusually funny Ben Kingsley all help add some flair to this ruckus tale of a Love Guru and his quest to cleanse the world with joy and peace. I didn't realize Love Gurus were such rude, demented, perverts! I watch this when I need a good laugh and hopefully you will at least give it a shot!

Until then my fellow amazon.com junkies!!!
