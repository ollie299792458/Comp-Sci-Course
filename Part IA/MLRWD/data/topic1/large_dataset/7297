Got this to help myself with the French and Indian war for visualization purposes. And I must say in all aspects it stinks. Last of the Mohicans is much much very much better when it comes to story and plot and set designs. Indeed it reminds me of GODS AND GENERALS in which the lost cause was the South's Defeat in the American Civil War except it is a better film and unlike the French Candians the South had better leaders and a great deal of style. Certainly Gods and Generals is a better bit of work in all counts. But these things are History and unfortunatley there really is not much here to work with for anyone seeking to glorify the Lost Cause of New France.  Bigot was a money grubbing crooked official He's featured here). Vaudreult was the master of State Sponsored Terrorism; he payed the native warriors to slaughter english settlers women and children and all and bring him their scalps. The average French canadian's warfare was basically back shooting and terrorism alongside the savages. Except for Montcalm and his french soldiers there really was nobody worthy of honour among them.

This thing has poor sets. Inferior acting. Inferior costuming. Little  in the way of plot or story to see. No Character. Would have been nice if everybody french actually spoke the language or had the accents. The english are a drab lot but the guys here aren't that colorful. This film is even worse than drab.

Not worth buying.
