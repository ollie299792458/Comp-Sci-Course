I am only 23 years old.  I am not enough to have been around in the Hollywood Heyday where the stars were bigger than life and the studios ran like well oiled machines, cranking out one star after another.  That is why I love movies like this because it allows the younger generation a glimpse into the past where the stars were relatively well behaved and free from addictions.  Perhaps this is a romanticized view that Hollywood wants my generation to believe, but I believe it to be true.
In North by Northwest, Cary Grant is a blatant stud.  He has the nice clothes, gets all of the pretty girls and has that smooth talking manner about him.  Lets not forget about Eva Marie Saint.  In my opinion she must have embodied the definition of "Blonde Bombshell."  Both give great performances as Roger Thornhill and Eve Kendall, their respective characters.
The plot revolves around Thornhill, an advertising executive who encounters a case of mistaken identity.  It becomes clear that he is being used as some sort of pawn in a game of chess between US and foreign agents.  Thornhill is mistaken for George Kaplan and then framed for murder.  This series of events leads him to try to escape the whole situation.  Along the way he encounters a beautiful Eve Kendell and we are not sure what her motives are.
Again, I was not around in Hitchcock's time, but he is known as a master of suspense and North by Northwest does not disappoint.  This movie was listed in the top 25 of the greatest movies of the 20th century by the American Film Institute and rightfully so.  North by Northwest is an exciting thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie.  It has more ups and downs than a San Francisco avenue.  I would highly recommend it for any avid movie buff, but especially for those Gen. Xers who have no idea what the `50's were like.
