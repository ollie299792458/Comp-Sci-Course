A long, drawn out melodrama used as a vehicle to showcase Elizabeth Taylor in various, ravishing costumes of dress, each more extravagant than the next is the main ingredient of "Elephant Walk". Oh that, and thousands of natives thrown in doing exotic dances for good measure. Thus, you get an incredibly over the top, but still fairly watchable movie that hasn't stood the test of time well. It's in Technicolor (what else is new?) and follows the story of a young bride taken to her husband's tea plantation in India, where she discovers a different side of her husband than she expected. What is most intriguing (although at times rather humorous) is the idol worship of the husband's deceased father, founder of the plantation. At one point, the natives all bring presents and place them at the grave of the father. And then there's Appuhamy, the creepy little Indian servant, who prays to the grave as if it were a temple. Creepy. Of course, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying "Elephant Walk" is a complete farce. It's interesting, and the viewer is left wanting to know if Ruth will hook up with Carver or stay trapped on Elephant Walk forever. What really killed it for me though, was the incredibly over the top ending. The elephants are made to look like a bunch of violent beasts which is so far from the truth, it's ridiculous. Ruth's husband John comes to save her in the end, and in an overly symbolic scene that slaps its viewer on the head, turns his back on the burning portrait of his father. Thus, the viewer is left to believe that John will suddenly change his selfish ways and love Ruth after all. So watch this movie with your own disbelief suspended. Oh yeah, and beware of those violent elephants.
