Yes it is!
"What is it with this Tapping thingy?".. I asked myself a while back, yet I knew that some friends that had tried it, some how had changed on a profound level.
One of them deeply stressed about everything, suddenly was much more relaxed. Another, who as always getting sick specially under stress stopped that behavior. So I asked them what they had done.  They gave me a DVD to watch,.. "Try it on everything"  I learned about the body's energy system, the meridians, acupuncture with out needles,. and then followed the lives of a few people who lived through the EFT tapping 'transformation'

Riveting, is all I can say,.

I had read a lot of books on stress management, on self help, they always told me where I needed to be. Never was I clear how to get there, how to address my inner resistance, real or perceived.  Here is the key,..
The production is well done, all the masters of self help give their powerful comments, it kept me at the edge of the sofa instead of laid back.
There is so much information here that I watched it 5 times, only to get the basic concept down.  I made sure to get the Book as soon as it came out and have read it cover to cover.
This is hands down practical, direct how to information. A must for everyone that wants to learn to cope in our seriously stressed out world.
I am grateful for its production.
