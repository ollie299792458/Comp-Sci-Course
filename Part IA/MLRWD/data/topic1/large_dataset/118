I had never seen 'Oklahoma' before ordering the DVD recently.  I have since watched it many times.  Even though it was made about 10 years before 'The Sound of Music', Oklahoma is slightly more oriented towards an adult audience.  The music in Oklahoma is great and gets better to me the more I watch it.  I also liked it visually.  The acting and dancing do not disappoint.  A positive mood is definitely created and sustained.
The story is fair enough.  It primarily revolves around the rivalry Curly and Jud have for Laurey.  It is set in Oklahoma just before Oklahoma joined the Union.  The character of Jud Fry adds a more somber tone to the movie though it is dealt with alternatively both humorously and darkly.  Curly mocking Jud (and Jud unwittingly joining him) by singing 'Jud Fry is Dead' is classic.  Themes such as pornography, sexual promiscuity, and murder are subtley touched on giving it more of an adult air.  I consider it a kid friendly movie just not as innocent as some might suspect.
I wish the DVD had more 'extra' material (more background, etc.) in it but this is still a good one for people who like Rodgers and Hammerstein.
