All of the reviews that I've read of Angela's Ashes use words such as "depressing","somber" and "cold".I won't say that there are no merits in these descriptions but I do feel that at least as much notice should be given to the overall warmth of the movie.  Despite a severely alcoholic father and an uneducated, mostly passive, and sick in spirit mother, and a seemingly bitter childhood,Frank McCourt manages to tell his story with tenderness and love for his people.  The photography is excellent, managing to be beautiful even though the sets speak largly of decay. The dialog seems somewhat flattened and "americanized" compared to the book, but is still quite colorfull and wonderfully close to real.  Robert Carlyle portrays McCourts father, a terminally unemployed alcoholic, with some tenderness for the character and I think captures the mirror image of McCourts' understandingly ambivalent memories of his father.  At first Emily Watson's performance seemed to me to exibit a coldness that I saw as without motivation and distant, but as I began to truly understand the implications of the story I have come to think that an accurate rendition of McCourt's mother.  Director Alan Parker handles this film in a straight forward manner.It is dark without being evil, it is touching without subjecting the audience to schmaltzy devices designed to influence emotion.  As for redemption, the fact that McCourt could write his story with so much compassion, humor,and dignity, and have it accepted with so much goodwill around the world, seems like a victory to me.
