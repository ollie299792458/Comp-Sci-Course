I begin by asking your forgiveness should my insights of this movie offend; that truly is not my intention.

Reading other reviews one gets the impression a recent and great archaeological discovery has revealed an old prophecy.  In truth this just another inspirational work of fiction, embraced by most who wrote here as factual; their bible if you will.

I too found it an inspirational story, one of a many such stories that speak of hope for a better society.  A society where we all escape our own self interest and live in peace and harmony -- heaven on Earth. With different words and settings, it conveys the wisdom contained within "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," 1989 -- "Be excellent to each other."

The story line, however, is not new.  Rather it is just the newest portrayal of a millenniums old truth passed down by many iconic people throughout human history.  In many ways it brought back to me memories of the sixties; no small feat I assure you.

In keeping with this movie, I would also recommend "Stigmata," 1999, from which comes a truth I learned as a young teenager, many decades ago now.  "Split a piece of wood, and I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there."

However my very favorite and most precious wisdom is "Love one another as I have loved you."  This latter sums up the message of this movie best.

We keep coming full circle, some day we shall all escape the Wheel.

God Bless,
