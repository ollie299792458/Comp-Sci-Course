I have seen the TV miniseries "Pearl" and the disastrous "Pearl Harbor" and I still say "Tora, Tora, Tora" is the finest telling of the story of Pearl Harbor I have ever seen.  The battle sequences were state-of-the-art for it's day, and even the model work is superb. There is very little of the hammy drama that the other versions had, and more of the straight truth that was the disaster and tragedy of the Day of Infamy.  What makes it so special is that it viewed the battle from both sides, with American and Japanese directors.  I can't say I forgive the Japanese for the attack, but as a result of the film, I came to understand more of the reasons the attack happened.  The film shows that mistakes made by the American commanders were compounded by the fact that the United States was just not ready for war.  Unfortuantely, both General Short (Jason Robards) and Admiral Kimmel (Martin Balsam)were made into scapegoats for our lack of preparedness, but each in his way tried to prevent the attack with what resources and knowledge they had, but it just wasn't enough. The individual heroism of both the Americans and the Japanese as soldiers reflected honor on the part of both adversaries.  Even Yamamoto argued against the attack, but when he was overruled, he did his duty.  And while Japanese naval officers celebrated their success, Yamamoto said "I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant and fill it with a terrible resolve."

By the way, USAF General Ken Taylor, one of the two young Army Air Corps pilots who got off the ground in a P-40 Warhawk that day visited the set while it was being made and undoubtedly contributed his expertise.

I rate this film as 5 + stars, with bravura performances by the entire cast and crew.
