As always, Pixar delivered a breath taking experience when they brought us A Bug's Life.  While not overly realistic, the animation is bright and rich and incredibly detailed.  The colours and textures suck you into their world.
The movie features a nice mix of humor and excitement.  Some moments are full of suspense and tension.
The voice actors do a great job, particularly Kevin Spacey as the villain Hopper.  He's truly menacing!  When the voice talents are combined with Pixar's fabulous job of giving natural movements and mannerisms to each different species of insect the mix creates very believable characters.
As per usual Disney style there is a great moral to be learned through the story, about the importance of standing up for yourself, and how one small person truly can change the world.
The only drawback of the movie is that the characters are relatively shallow and underdeveloped when compared to Disney's usual level of complexity.  However, when you consider that this film is based off of the fable "The Ant and the Grasshopper" it puts things into perspective and you appreciate how much imagination and creativity actually went into this project.  The end result is highly entertaining and sure to be a classic in generations to come.
