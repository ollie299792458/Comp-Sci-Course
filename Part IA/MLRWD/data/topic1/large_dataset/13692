I've only seen it on dvd but I really can't imagine this would've been a satisfying theater-going experience for me. It's right up my alley, viruses or zombies or post-apoclyptic nightmare, etc. But it's also really another genre I love, emotional dramas. I didn't know much about it when I bought it but I'm glad I wasn't expecting a zombie horor film, it's a more personal drama about the four main characters.

No plague set-up or explanation, we're dropped right into the middle of the aftermath in the beginning of the film. There's a lot of cliched behavior from other post-apoc movies. The reckless driving, the drinking and who gives a s*** attitude towards life, the gas rationing and (my least favorite part), the golf course montage.

Would I behave that way? I never can decide. I might be like a kid in a candy store, or paranoid hyper-vigilant beyond my wits. The characters seem to let their guard down too often, another cliche. The diving board scene for instance.

But the actors and the characters rise above the cliches, a great performance by Chris Meloni as well. I still had questions throughout about the disease and especially the spreadability of it, but oh well. Re: my title, it does work well as a small screen drama. It's more low-key than a Resident Evil, or The Crazies or 28 Days Later. As long as you're ready for that, and maybe like my sister you can't stand the "Dawn of the Dead" guts-eating(!) then this may be for you too.
