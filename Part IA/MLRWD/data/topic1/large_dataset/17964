when i saw the film in theaters this past Feb. i wasn't expecting Oscar
material(which obviously a lot of people were considering their mixed to
negative comments) so i wasn't disappointed when what i got was a entertaining
popcorn movie. i found John(Alex Pettyfer) a quite likable character) and
the fact Pettyfer is decidedly easy on the eyes didn't hurt. so when i received
the blu-ray disc last week i found it entertaining again. after all seeing Alex
P. in 1080p high definition defines the term "eye candy".

so my mixed reaction is of the blu-ray extras which are a mixed bag. so i ask
director J.D. Caruso what the ****** happened with the extras???

1.Alex Pettyfer is the star of the film and the title of the film is
  I AM NUMBER FOUR. so why is the only making of short BECOMING NUMBER
  6? i can't believe there was no behind the scenes stuff shot with with Alex
  Pettyfer the star of the film but there is with a supporting character? i
  remember seeing making of stuff on Youtube so why isn't it on the
  bl-ray disc?

2.also i'm betting there were way more deleted scenes that centered on Alex's
  character.
