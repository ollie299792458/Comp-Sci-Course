One thing not mentioned by other reviewers is that this film, and Peter Sellers' character of Inspector Jacques Clouseau (sounds like someone else, right?), had been meant as a one-off.  My understanding is that Sellers was contracted to play a featured part, but not steal the film!  Nor was his character slated to develop into a whole film series, resurrecting the physical comedy of the silent masters and emulating the deadpan of the Monseur Hurlot films.  Instead, Blake Edwards' hip 60s comedy exploded with Sellers' incarnation of Clouseau, and an even more wacky "Shot In The Dark" (co-written by the Exorcist's William Peter Blatty) was the immediate follow-up.  In American TV, we know about "spin-off" series, and that's really what the Clouseau films are: a spin-off of this first classic.  The Pink Panther is a must for fans of the swinging 60s comedies like its sequels, like "Casino Royale", "Under The Yum-Yum Tree",  "The Graduate", the Flint movies, and others.  Favourite scene?  The bedroom scene, with David Niven (later of "Casino Royale") and Robert Wagner (of recent "Austin Powers" fame) hiding from the inept investigator.  In fact, you can't watch my favourite Blake Edward movie, "Victor/Victoria", without seeing similar classic sight gags and situations from just that bedroom scene!  Buy this movie!
