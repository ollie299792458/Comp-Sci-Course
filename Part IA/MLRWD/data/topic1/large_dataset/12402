The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly can easily be considered one of the best westerns ever made because, like the other two "Man with No Name" movies, it broke all the rules. The wide open composition of Sergio Leone's cinematography, the harsh landscapes, the excellent characters, and Ennio Morricone's masterpiece score all make this add up to far more than just some spaghetti western. This expanded DVD edition proves interesting. The extra footage intergrates into the movie nicely, although you can easily tell that a lot of the dubwork was redone, because Eli Wallach does NOT sound like the Tuco of old in the several scenes he redubs. The extras on the second disc are interesting, but nothing really special. The extra commentary is nice, especially the commentary about Morricone's score. The ability to listen to the original Italian audio is also interesting. The package is handsomely presented with a booklet and several movie poster reproductions in various languages. Overall, this is a fitting tribute to one of the more excellent westerns ever made.
