Thought I'd take a moment to share my experience of this re-packaged DVD entitled "Bram Stoker's Dracula" directed by F.F. Coppola. First of all, if you've been sitting on a fence about getting a DVD copy of this film, this is the ONE to buy!
 I remember passing this up in the theater and watching about the first 30 minutes on TBS and thinking "Glad I didn't pay money to see that . . ." Now I've been slowly building a collection of DVD's seeings how vhs tape has been declared obsolete and just started getting some classic horror flicks together like Frankenstein, Wolfie, and the gang but one of my big deals is that I'll usually skip a DVD if it does not include Special Features like how they made the movie and this is the first standard DVD of this flick that includes that and MUCH more.
 Not sure if these features were pre-existing or put together for this release, but they clearly explain how these types of old monster movies were originally constructed and specifically this one. Once I watched those and then the movie(or visa versa)I had a totally new found respect for this film(in widescreen of course)!
 The transfer is flawless and a real treat. The movie is just over 2hrs 07min but goes much quicker without the commercials and bad editing! It may be a tad pricey for a '92 film but, if you really love classic horror movies AND how they made 'em, this is actually worth the money! I'll be watching this every Halloween along with repackaged versions of Frankie and the Wolfman from now on, thank you.
