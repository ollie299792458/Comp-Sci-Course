My post contains spoilers.....FYI

The movie starts out great.  A crazy man waiting to kill three people as they come out of an ATM.  Great...I'm hooked already!  Sadly, the movie goes a bit downhill from there.  We see where damn near every other character is wearing the same coat as the killer; which results in a couple of mistaken identity scenes.  Putting that aside, you still root for the good guys to stick together and kick the killer's butt.  No such luck!  Heck...we don't even get to see the killer's face.  Nothing at all was revealed about him except that he's a killer who somehow knows the layouts, camera range, etc. of every place he hits.  When the movie tried to "come together" in the end, attempting to give viewers a "twist," it failed, and will surely make you say, "Wait a minute...how'd he know they would do this or that, etc.?  Not a well thought out movie, BUT, I will recommend you check it out.  It will hold your interest with all the suspense, but tick you off in the end.  Also....be on the look out for a part two.  I believe one might be coming.
