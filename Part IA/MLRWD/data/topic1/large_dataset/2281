I always loved the saw series no matter how many films it has released!  I know we are nearing close to saw 7 soon and I cant hardly wait.  The series continues because the story just has not ended yet.  Many have given up on the series because they were sick of the blood and gore and torture that innocent people endure for our entertainment.  I purchasing saw 6 because I have purchased all the other 5 movies and I deeply love the saw films.  It has substance.  Despite the over abundance of blood and gruesome nature, I deeply loved the films, that was the very reason i loved them.

Jigsaw and his murderous helpers, created unique traps that you had to really want to survive to make it through.  this was the one film I had to watch in theatres on its release date or on halloween night.  If you have seen me I was the short girl covered in blood sitting in the theatre screaming (not in fear but joy!) when watching this movie.

cant wait for saw 7! October 22 2010!  oh yeah!
