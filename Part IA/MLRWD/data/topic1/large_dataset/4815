One of the 80's most wonderful popcorn epics,  'Flash Gordon' explodes with colour and energy in HD.

This gem wasn't the blockbuster the producers hoped for at the time, but over the years has become a cult classic. And rightly so, it's great fun all the way.

It's main weaknesses are the in the unknown leads cast (Sam Jones fails to really cut it as Flash) and some dodgy special effects that were ropey even for the time.

But these are minor carps thanks to the powerhouse supporting cast who lavish their roles with tremendous charisma, gusto and wit. None more so than Max Von Sydow as Ming, he's simply sensational, given mellifluous support by Peter Wyngarde, wonderfully funny and menacing as Ming's creepy henchman Klytus.

And has there ever been a sexier space vixen than Ornella Muti as Ming's daughter? Roaringly hot!!

For the good guys, the wonderfully kinetic Topol is fantastic as Dr Hans Zarkov, and boisterously charismatic Brian Blessed was born to play Vultan, Prince of the Hawkmen. And it's hard not to think of Errol Flynn while watching the younger Timothy Dalton in action as Prince Baron, he's a perfectly assured swashbuckler.

The design of the movie is eye popping. Then of course there's Queen's rousing score to add to the elation of this soaring piece of 80's feel good cinema. 'Flash Gordon' entertains in grandly absurdist style.
