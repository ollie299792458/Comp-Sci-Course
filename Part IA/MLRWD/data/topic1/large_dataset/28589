I keep reading from time to time people saying oh it's not realistic because of the different races in the movies.  Samantha (the previous post) even said that she doesn't know how to explain this to her kids.  Is this a joke?

First, there are millions of families out there that ARE like this!  There are tons of families where the father could be white, the mother could be black, and they could have adopted an asian kid.  Families these days are not standard, you can find every type of families.  So it would be the perfect opportunity to explain that reality to your children and tell them that yeah people of different races can fall in love and that people sometimes adopt children.

Also, this movie has such a positive message because its goal is to show that different races can live together and that we shouldn't even look at races because we are all humans and equal.  For some people who are complaining and can't watch this movie because of the color, you have to look inside yourselves and ask yourselves why?  I personally watch it and I love it, I don't even notice the different races, I see them all as humans.

Also, another way of explaining this would be that this is a fairy tale, a fantasy.  In the movie, there is magic, flying, tons of unrealistic things.  Anything can happen in a fantasy movie including families from different races.  So there are two different ways of explain it:  1. It's a fantasy anything can happen in it, 2. Adoption.

Whitney Houston was behind this project as a producer and she should be applauded for this new refreshing take on this classic.  It's nice for kids of all races wether white or black or asian to see themselves on the screen.  The movie itself is very well done, the sets and visuals are stunning, all the actors did great, and the music is great.  This is highly recommended!
