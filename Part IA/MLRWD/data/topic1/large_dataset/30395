Finally, after all this time, Warner Brothers have come to their senses.  On October 7th, we will be treated to a heftly helping of one of the greatest Christmas films to ever grace the silver screen............in WIDESCREEN.
I was extremely disappointed with the previous DVD release of this film which contained a pan & scan presentation and nothing more than a theatrical trailer in the extras department.
What we have here is a special edition of this great movie, which will contain audio commentary from both Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase, a "making of" featurette, as well as other stocking stuffers which have yet to be disclosed at this present time.  
Being a huge fan of this movie, I honestly can't wait for this release.  "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" has become a holiday tradition in my home, and to be able to see it the way it was intended to be seen is truly a treat for me.
Aside from the features of the disk, the film itself is the true gift.  One of the funniest movies today which still withstands the test of time even 15 years later.  The premise is simple.  Clark W. Griswold (Chevy Chase) is hell bent on having an old-fashioned family Christmas in his home, relatives and all.  Of course, the hilarity kicks in when things start to go awry.  There are so many hilarious scenes in this movie, it would be difficult to list them all.  You have everything from an electrocuted cat, to a house with the brightest Christmas light display known to man.  Let's not forget the dried up turkey, the saucer sled and the dog/squirrel chase!  There's so much more I could say to praise this movie, but if you haven't already seen it, [I won't say more]
