I was appalled to see that this great classic has garnered but a single review. This movie is at the very top of the league, right along with Saving Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now. By modern standards it is overacted, but I am willing to accept that as part of the standards of the day. I was stunned by the accuracy of the battle scenes -- given the limitations of moviemaking in those days, this movie was unblinkingly honest about the mechanics of warfare in World War One.

I cannot in good conscience recommend this movie to a viewer just looking for thrills. This is, by modern standards, a slow movie. Think of it as an exotic piece to be savored by the aficionado whose tastes have been refined by watching a broad range of movies.

The movie is loaded with iconic moments that stick to your emotional ribs long after seeing it: the desperation with which the French girls tear into the food given them in exchange for their favors; the callousness of the orderly who tells Paul that Kat is dead; the desperate ferocity of hand-to-hand fighting in the trenches; the boots moving from owner to owner. But the final scene, almost maudlin by cynical modern standards, can still bring a lump to my throat.
