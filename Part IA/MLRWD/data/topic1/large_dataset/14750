Really like this movie, especially with the presence of Washington, Shalhoub and Willis in it. Really a good all around depiction of what might happen in a huge metropolitan city if a string of terrorist attacks took place in a short period. While showing that racial profiling would be the most common sense way to find the terrorists, it also illustrates the facts that blindly herding a whole race into a statium is not the way to stop terrorists. Also good at showing the extremes on either side; islamo fascism as the reality faced in the real world, they are muslims, they take is seriously, and to them, they are VERY MUCH following the teaching of the koran. And the opposite extreme; that as great as the U.S. Military is, and there would be no country and no freedom without them, unleashing an Army Division with tanks and helicopters and thousands of armed soldiers in an American city is NOT the way to go. Unleash thousands more FBI agents from other cities, NOT a Light Infantry Division.

The only negatives I'd have about this movie is the very close to frontal male nudity between the last terrorist and the CIA agent, taking it right to the edge. Not necessary. And of course the language is horrible in several places, but hollywood couldn't make a movie without the F word every five minutes if their lives depeneded on it. That's just hollywood, cause of course it's not artistic or interesting or entertaining if it's not as vulger as you can get several times. Except that we'd watch it more often if not for the language and little ears in our home.

Side note, Anthony Shalhoub REALLY makes this movie. Considering of course the normal greatness of Washinton, Shalhoub is really brilliant, so versitile, as shown in his character of Monk and his character in MIB II, Galaxy Quest and other movies, this movie shows what a great dramatic actor he is also, and he's perfect at illustrating that not all muslims are the enemy, OR are terrorists. He's REALLY excellent.
