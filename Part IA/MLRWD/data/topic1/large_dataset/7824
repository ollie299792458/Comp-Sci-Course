The 3rd in this Evangelical Christian Sci-Fi Thriller Series is even better than the 1st 2 ( I've reviewd those as well, if you are interested. ).

I have several reasons for saying so, and none have to do with the similarity, or lack thereof, with the books.

I've never read the books.

This film is an out, and out, Action film with a mission.

It is bringing home, in a very strong fashion, that whatever comes next in the series ain't gonna be a walk in the park.

While Buck, and the other Christian characters, are strong characters portrayed nicely by strong B-Level Actors the nature of the story, and of the growing power, and menace, of the character powerfully played by Gordon Currie, demanded an A-List Star with the Gravitas to sell the violent nature of the tale.

You have to remember that this is Low Budget Filmmaking ( Though they obviously spent much more money on the "Boom!" this time, as well as on Gossett.  ), and that plot choices are made with the number of actors the budget would allow.

This film belonged to Lou Gossett Jr.....

Gossett does a steller job of making us believe in all his character does as he learns an awful truth, and makes various decisive choices along the way.

To say more would spoil the enjoyment of a very interesting film.
