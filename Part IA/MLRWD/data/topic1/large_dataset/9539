So many Blu-Ray / DVD reviewers miss the point of these reviews. If I wanted a review of the movie, I'd go to Rotten Tomatoes. The purpose is to review the package you're about to purchase, which is what I'm going to do.

If I were just reviewing the movie itself, I'd give it 5 stars. Great, great movie, humorous, fun. BluRay quality is great. My beef is the fact that the box says "BluRay + Digital Copy". For whatever reason, digital copies expire. The disc is with the movie, your digital copy is locked away on it, but the package does not include the code to unlock it because in very fine print on the back of the box is the disclaimer: "digital copy expires 2/2011." Is it made with eggs and milk? Why would it expire? If the file was being stored on a server somewhere and it was a matter of storage space, I'd understand, but the file *is on the disc in my hands* and I can't get it off.

I applaud the movie studios for figuring out that there are lots of people who like to take movies with them on mobile devices, and doing the digital copies in the first place. But if you're going to do it, don't make it expire arbitrarily.
