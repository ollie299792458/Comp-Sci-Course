Of all the Stephen King stories adapted into movies, this is perhaps the best. Where many of King's books portray implied or internal terror which is difficult to convey on screen ("It" and "The  Shining" come to mind), Carrie shows very real, and very visual  terror. At odds with her hyper-religious mother and outcast from her high  school classmates, Carrie's coming of age includes the onset of telekinetic  powers. Carrie's struggle for acceptance ultimately erupts in a grisly  display of rage, with a truly distrubing finale. 
The majority of the  frightening scenes of this movie come from the heavy religious over tones,  and especially from Piper Laurie's performance as Carrie's mother. With her  piercing eyes and deranged religious enthusiasm, Piper Laurie nearly steals  the movie from the comparably subdued Spacek. As well, De Palma does an  excellent job of pacing the movie to allow for character and suspense  development. 
With this combination of strong acting and directing, along  with the excellent adaptation of Stephen King's novel, Carrie is intense,  disturbing, and perfectly done.
