Caligula is a non-stop parade of perversions, gore, and stunning sets.  Mix all that with a decent job of acting from some brilliant actors and you find that while you may be repulsed by some of what you see, you'll also want to see it again.
The movie graphically depicts of the rise and fall of Caligula (Malcolm McDowell), one of the most notorious of all Roman emperors.  It's rather straight forward in it's portrayal of the man and his exploits.  Throughout the movie you definitely get a feel for how demented Caligula became and in the end you are almost relieved when his life is ended.  The major draw back to the story line is that they never really develop any of the other characters and it leaves them as shallow figures.  
Keep in mind that this movie was brought to us by Penthouse so to say that there is a fair amount of nudity and sex is an understatement.  There are also some rather gruesome scenes as well.  I've read many reviewers use these points to put the movie down, but what they fail to realize is that Rome did have it's dark days of mass perversion.  Yes, the movie did go over the top a bit, but it's not too far off from the decadence of the time.  If you keep this in mind you will love the movie.
As for the DVD itself.  The sound quality is much better the the original VHS version, but still leaves a bit to be desired.  The picture is a bit grainy and that does tend to draw away from the breathtaking sets.  I recommend the unrated version for the sole fact that the R-rated version cuts out a large chunk of the movie.  It also has a nice documentary on the making of the film.
