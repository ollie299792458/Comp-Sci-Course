I couldn't wait for The Abyss Special Edition to be released on DVD.  I already have the Special Edition Widescreen released on VHS in 1995 with the 10 minute featurette on the making of The Abyss.  But as soon as I  bought the DVD - I went home to watch it.  You can choose to watch the  theatrical version or the Special Edition with 28 minutes of additional  footage.  The commentary is visable via subtitles in the black bar.  Which  is great.  For anyone who hasn't already seen this movie - it's an  action-adventure/sci-fi/romance.  Basically it's for everybody.
Ed Harris  play Bud Brigman, the toolpusher on an underwater drilling platform  designed by his soon-to-be-ex-wife, Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  A US submarine sinks near Cuba &amp; the Navy enlists the help of the  workers on the drilling rig in a rescue attempt.  Four Navy SEALs are sent  down to supervise this mission.  Headed by Lt. Coffey, played by Michael  Biehn.  Too bad that Coffey suffers the effects of HPNS and begins to go a  little over the edge.  
All this and oh yeah, there seem to be some  unidentified underwater flying objects.  Of course only Lindsey seems to  see the &amp; Coffey thinks they're Russian.
This movie is full of  conflicts, romance, action and adventure &amp; is one of my favorite  movies.  This DVD is just full of extras that I haven't even fully explored  yet.  Just a few are a 59 minute documentary on the making of The Abyss as  well as a 10 minute featurette.  There are stills, cast historys,  storyboards and anything else you could ever possibly want to know about  this movie.  This is a must buy DVD.  20th Century Fox takes it's time and  puts out first rate DVD's.  The Abyss, Fight Club &amp; Aliens are just a  few examples of this.  If you do enjoy The Abyss Special Edition - try  these others.
