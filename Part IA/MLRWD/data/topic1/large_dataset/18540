Most people still consider Drunken Master II (a.k.a. The Legend of the Drunken Master) to be Jackie Chan's best movie ever, and I agree.  The sad thing is this edition is dubbed in English.  There is no Chinese version.  When I first saw this movie, I watched the laserdisc edition (which is in Chinese, but unfortunately has white subtitles that are often over a white background).  While I'm greatful for the opportunity to finally figure out what they're saying, the acting was definitely better in Chinese.  I'm hoping that one day they'll put out a special edition with both versions, but I'm not gonna hold my breath.  In short, if you ever get the chance to see it in Chinese I say go for it, but for now get this version.  It's still a great movie!

Edit:  It turns out there are undubbed DVD-versions of this movie with English subtitles--with 5.1 sound, even!  These versions just haven't been released in the U.S.  If you're like me, and you prefer to see foreign movies in their original languages, try to get an import DVD instead of this one.(...)
