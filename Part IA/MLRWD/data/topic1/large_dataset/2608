The Host is one of those rare movies these days that uses its top-notch effects scenes to enhance rather than drive the storyline.  The plot does not center around the mutated creature, but rather on the dysfunctional family, which is the primary reason why the audience would give a damn if one or two of them are "offed."  The acting performances are superb, especially by Song Kang Ho and Koh Eun Ah, who play the father and daughter respectively.  It's not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it sure is fun.  I can't really call this a horror movie, because in my assessment, it's not really that horrifying.  Of course, your experience may vary.  No severed limbs, decapitated heads, or other such excess macabre here, so if that's your cup of tea, go seek psychiatric help and then rent Re-Animator or something like that at your local Blockbuster.  There are the obligatory few moments that you sort of expect the monster to show up and kill unimportant characters, and it obliges with a menacing gusto.  The creature's introduction in the opening scenes is handled masterfully and dare I say- realistically.  I mean, if a bus-sized mutated fish/amphibian suddenly decided to get nasty, run over crowds, grab ladies by the face and devour people whole, that's how it would play out, I'm sure.  Ultimately, it's the most original creature flick that Asia has come out with since the original Godzilla in the 1950's, and it's infinitely better than recent Hollywood giant creature flicks like Anaconda or Lake Placid.  And by the way- a note to Amazon- who the hell is Scott Wilson?
