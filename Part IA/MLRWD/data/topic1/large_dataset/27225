I first saw this film in college, in a theatre, back in 1987, I think, and in spite of knowing only a little Japanese then, and only a little of Japanese culture, I fell in love with Japan even more deeply after seeing this. If your idea of Japanese movies is Akira Kurosawa and/or anime, then you have to see Itami's movies, and you have to start with this one.
I actually fell onto the floor laughing when I saw this, and it makes me laugh even now. And this is the film (together, now, with Water Boys, Shall We Dance, anything else with Takenaka Naoto, and After Life) I show friends when I want to share Japan (where I lived for ten years) with them.
The wonderful aspect of this movie is the way Itami intercuts the main story, of a woman named Tampopo (Japanese for dandelion, by the way), trying to run a ramen shop and raise a boy on her own, and the two truck drivers who end up helping her recreate that business and teach her son to stand up to bullies, with many of the different ways that Japanese obsess about food. From shopping, to macrobiotic mothers, to ordering in restaurants, to learning how to eat Western food... And Itami's cast, a group of actors he works with time and again, rise to the challenge brilliantly.
If you decide you need to see only one Japanese film, make it this one. And if you're a fan of Japanese film, but have never seen this, then do so immediately!
