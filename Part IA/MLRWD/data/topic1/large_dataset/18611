Finally, after many years on TV, and quit a nice run on VHS, the series comes to DVD, although not without some drawbacks:
*The DVD remasters are  *superb* picture quality, but it is beyond me why Fox chose to remaster  only "Planet Of The Apes" in 5.1 Dolby; the remainder are 2.0,  except for "Escape" which is in *mono*.  I get around this by  using the "5 channel stereo" effect on my receiver.
*The 5.1  sound on the original "Planet..." is *not* true 5.1; rather, an  enhanced 2.0...kind of like listening to Beatles music in "simulated  stereo".
*The booklet for "Planet..." contains the cues  for "Beneath...".  Why this is the case...I have *NO* idea.  However, the "timeline" information in the booklet is pretty  cool.
So...why 5 stars? 
Because these films are, imho, *brilliant*  SF, when observed together as an arc.  Yes, there are some shortcomings in  the series (most notably "Beneath..." and "Battle..."),  but overall, this is *classic* SF.  Take a few hours on a rainy day and  watch ALL of these flicks...and you'll see what I mean.  In fact, do as I  did, and try starting from "Escape..." and run through the cycle  so that you end with "Beneath...".  It puts a whole new  perspective on things.  
Also, as I previously mentioned, the transfer to  DVD is absolutely *superb* as far as picture is concerned.  Just look at  "Planet..." during the scene when Taylor and his crew are at the  edge of The Forbidden Zone, searching of water, and you'll notice some  human (ape?) figures in the cliffs above them, running along side them up  in the cliffs..  I *never* noticed that before!  It was eye opening!  Also,  the crash sequence in "Planet..." is better than ever.  Now, SF  fans...is *that* the *coolest* spaceship, or what!  Gets my vote!
If you  grew up watching the movies in the movies (like I did), or on TV, then buy  the whole shebang.  If you dislike any of the sequels and don't want to  spend the cash, just buy the original...WELL worth it at *any* price.  In  fact, it's the classic nature of the original film that completely  outweighs any flaws in the sequels which drives my 5 star rating.
I'd  recommend "buy" this title overall.
