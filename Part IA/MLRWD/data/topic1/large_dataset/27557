Halo Legends is a film that follows in the footsteps of the Batman: Gotham Knight film that was recently released.  It is a compilation of sub-stories created within an overall film, but with each sub-story or section being created by a different artist.  This can create a great viewing experience, seeing how it allows the viewer to see different artists' rendering of beloved characters such as Batman and Master Chief.  Did Halo Legends pull it off as well as Batman: Gotham Knight did?  Not really.  It had some excellent sections, while others left a lot to be desired.

Halo Legends is a compilation of seven short stories, created by various artists throughout the anime/cartoon world.  Some of these sections are done beautifully, truly resembling the anime that the original creator is associated with, but with a Halo twist thrown in.

-Origins: Origins is a great way to open up the film.  These sections talk about the Forerunners who originally fought off the Flood upon their initial invasion of the galaxy.  The Forerunners had no choice but to create a final resort weapon, known as Halo, that would wipe out the entire galaxy.  Before doing so, the Forerunners had collected data of specimens from the entire galaxy.  These specimen would multiply once the Flood was no longer in existence, allowing the galaxy to once again re-populate itself to its former state.

-The Duel: Produced by Mituhisa Ishikawa, best known for his work on the Ghost in the Shell films as well as Immortal Grand Prix, this section feels out of place.  The art style resembles a painting, except that it moves.  Whenever the visuals are stationary, this art style looks amazing, resembling something one may find in a museum.  However, upon each motion that the characters take, it feels "awkward" almost as if it shouldn't be moving at all.  This may be because the visuals appear fuzzy due to the design of the characters, making it difficult at times to view what is actually occurring.  This section follows the fight between the Arbiter and his fellow covenant, and the brutal slaying of his wife at the hands of an Elite.  This was all in an attempt to betray the Arbiter, all set up by one of the Prophets.

-Homecoming: Directed by Koji Sawai, best known for his work on anime titles such as Wolf's Rain and .Hack, this section follows the story of the process of Spartan creation.  The corporation responsible for the creation of Spartans, kidnapped children, cloned them, and put them through intense training, leaving them mentally scarred.  Upon escaping and returning home, one female Spartan finds out the truth about her creation and must find a way to cope with it.  Other Spartans who met their clones committed suicide, but the female protagonist is able to proceed with her missions, until the end of the story where she meets a grim fate in the midst of combat.

-Odd One Out: Created by Daisuke Nishio, animator for both Dragonball and Dragonball Z, this section feels exactly like these series as well.  It follows the tale of a Spartan dropped off on a planet left to fight a Covenant opponent on his own.  He gets the assistance from two human teenagers who are capable of flying, and pulling trees out of the ground, ala DBZ.  The Spartan even ditches his traditional heavy artillery guns in favor of hand to hand combat, all the while acting goofy, true to Dragonball fashion.  The enemy even at one point "powers up" reminiscent of Dragonball Z.  Daisuke truly added to Halo Legends what he is used to doing with anime.

-Prototype: Created by Shinji Aramaki, the character designer for series such as Gundam, the Prototype section feels exactly like a Gundam episode.  Utilizing giant Mechs, thrusters, and explosions associated with the Gundam series, Prototype is non-stop action.  It follows the tale of a commander of marine team, named Ghost.  Ghost received his nickname due to his constant lack of emotions.  He has been assigned with the responsibility of destroying the prototype mech suit.  He instead uses the suit to fight off the enemy Covenant long enough for his squad to retreat, before self destructing.  A great section, and my personal favorite of the entire film, possibly due to the fact that I am a huge Gundam fan.

-The Babysitter: Eiko Tanaka, creator of animes such as Beyond and Kiki's Deliver Service, was the lead producer on this segment.  It follows a team of Drop Shock Troopers who are assigned to kill a Prophet of the Covenant, from a distance of two miles away.  In order to assist with the assassination assignment, the team is lead by a Spartan.  The Spartan becomes side-tracked from the mission due to the constant screw ups of the Drop Shock Troopers, who constantly rely on the Spartan for saving.  Until the end, when the Spartan is attacked and must leave the assassination shot to one of the most arrogant of the Troopers.  Upon learning the truth about the Spartan, the whole squad quickly feels like they are to blame for its death.

-The Package: The Package is a fully 3D rendered segment that is visually stunning.  At times the story switches to a first person view, and it feels as if it is truly a videogame during these sections.  It follows Master Chief as he and his squadron try to rescue a scientist from the grasp of the Covenant.  Truly remarkable animation, and a nice balance of story and action make this a great segment.

Overall, the film has its ups and downs.  Sections such as The Package, The Prototype, and The Babysitter are top notch, adding enough action, story, and art style to truly satisfy fans.  However, sections such as The Duel feel too awkward and out of place.  It's interesting to see each segment and see how each artist throws in their own art style that utilize for their own shows for this film.  This gives each segment the personality to match its director/producer and add a layer of familiarity to each story.  An overall great film that is a must buy for fans of Halo, or fans of anime, such as myself.
