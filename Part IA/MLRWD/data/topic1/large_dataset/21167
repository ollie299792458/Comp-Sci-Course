Dexter is, hands down, the most brilliantly written television series I have ever watched. The pacing is downright perfection, the story telling and weaving is an absolute powerhouse of entertainment. Plus, the dialogue is nothing short of utterly amazing.

The cast is something that award shows lust for.  Michael C. Hall was always brilliant on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEVZBW">Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set</a>.  Since episode one he has proven that he can make a totally different character (than the interally conflicted gay brother who owns a funeral home w/his family.)  He truly is an actor in the caliber of DeNiro or Nicholson, in my opinion.

The rest of the cast is amazing too.  Jennifer Carpenter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MVYUQQ">Quarantine (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>] is often called the weak link (by my wife and almost every woman I know for some reason,) however I disagree, she's just as brilliant in her internal conflicts than everyone else.  She's often the conscience in Dexter's mind when there is none otherwise.  That's not to say Dexter doesn't have morals, but there are certain things that his sister points out which seems like a light bulb goes off in the Dexter's head.

Jimmy Smits in any TV show seems to improve it by a factor of three.  This series didn't need it so much, but he's a very welcome addition.  In fact, I compared the 'Donut Shop Scene' in this season to the DeNiro/Pacino coffee shop scene in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006J28KU">Heat (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

This season is full of twists and turns which come like an 18 wheeler truck from out of nowhere.  They blindside you like any great mystery and story does. Constantly brilliant is an understatement when it comes to Dexter and his way of thinking and the problems he faces.

From episode one, the story arc is a white-knuckle thrill ride which grabs you from the get-go.

The only issue which could be seen as a fault to anyone who hasn't seen the last two seasons, is that you MUST watch the first 24 episodes.  Without knowing the history of Dexter, you are completely lost.  This is certainly not a series you can jump into just because it 'looks okay.'

Five stars for sure, wonderful in every way.
