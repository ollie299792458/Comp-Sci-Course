This movie is friggin hilarious!! It has you laughing at the beginning - and keeps you laughing until the credits roll. Of course, who's surprised? Putting Nicholson and Sandler together was pure genius. These two contrast and compliment each other at the same time - and they do so beautifully. You have no idea how fun this movie is until you watch it!! Sandler has bottled-up anger that he isn't even aware of. . . but someone knows all about it. And help is on the way. Nicholson steps in as his anger management therapist and Sandler's "calm" life goes right out the window. There are so many faces in this one you will recognize - too many to mention them all in fact. But suffice it to say that Nicholson and Sandler aren't the only big names here. There are a few scenes I would like to have seen happen - that didn't - but that's just me. The bottom line is this movie delivers. It has everything you want from a comedy - a famous cast, loads of laughs, and memorable scenes. Plus - there's an oh so cute chubby cat. LOL! I expect we'll see another team up between these two stars in the near future - at least - I hope so.
