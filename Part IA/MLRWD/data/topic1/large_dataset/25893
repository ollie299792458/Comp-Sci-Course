Like a meticulously crafted Swiss watch, this visually stunning musical comedy neither skips a beat, loses momentum, nor hits a note that is less than spectacular.  An incredibly detailed and inspired production, this film is the fruit of multiple mastery and creativity, genius and the professional acumen of veteran pros (the best and the brightest): Ernest Lehman, Gene Kelly, Michael Kidd, Irene Sharaff, John DeCuir, Lennie Hayton, Harry Stradling, William Reynolds, etc.

To her credit, and incomparable comedic talent and singing prowess, Miss Streisand commands every frame in which she appears; and she reigns supreme in every sequence, as she masterfully elevates and enlivens each large-scale production number. And, while she has never (verbally) embraced or lauded this role/film, she is, nonetheless, resplendent, charming and incredibly ingratiating as THE matchmaker par excellence.

Like every element in this meticulously crafted film, the supporting cast is uniformly outstanding and brilliant in their respective roles. What more can be said - it's a gem!
