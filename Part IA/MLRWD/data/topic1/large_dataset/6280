Some days it's great just to get away from the troubles of the world to a little bit of light, pleasing entertainment.  The Water Horse will do the trick, and, like any good tale, it works on several levels.

First, it features beautiful photography of the magnificent Scottish Highlands.  Add to this period furnishings of a Scottish manor house, and the clothing of the World War II era -- you might get a touch of nostalgia, but not enough to be cloying.

Next comes the character of the water horse.  From infant through toddler through teenager and on to adulthood, this animation is utterly believeable.  Movement and facial expressions are excellent.

Third is that the human characters are allowed to unfold over time  without the rigidity of simple stereotypes that so often characterize current films.  We see not only behaviors that define character, but are given the opportunity to understand the whys underlying those behaviors.

Fourth is the tale itself -- a timeless story that speaks to some instinctual yearning for true love and true freedom dwelling within the human spirit.

Time will tell whether this film has the pull to become a classic.  I hope it will.

Highly recommended for family viewing.
