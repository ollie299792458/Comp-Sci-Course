...this may not be your cup of tea. This is the Masterpiece Theatre's adaption of R.F.Delderfield's novel of the same name.  It tells the story of a young Welsh miner's son who was wounded in WWI. He is hired on as a history teacher at an elite boarding school, even with his socialistic political leanings, and eventually becomes the school's headmaster.  Along the way, his love life suffers setbacks and he endures professional setbacks, as well. The tale is inspirational, and the lives of the boarding school teachers and students is well explored.  The adaption spans the time between WWI and WWII, and references the politics of the times in a way that is integral to the story, unlike the Downton Abbey saga. This story is considerably drier and more 'stiff upper lip' than the modern romanticized tales of today.

The program was produced in 1980, so there is some lack of vividness of the imagery, though I suspect the videography was always a bit static.  The story sags a bit in the middle, but there is an authenticity to the story, as a whole.  It made me want to make up a pot of tea with a side of scones with jam and sit back to enjoy. John Duttine stars as David Powlett- Jones with a host of pre-Harry Potter English character actors, many who have been seen in other Masterpiece productions over the years.
