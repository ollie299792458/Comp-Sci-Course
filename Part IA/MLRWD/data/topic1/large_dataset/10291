I saw this film when it was in the movie theaters in 1996 and several times on televison and I must say it ages very well. At first blush, it is an odd couple road picture, but the more you watch it through the years, the more fond I become of it. Garner and Lemmon's performance have an energizing gusto that younger performers can't match.  Further, the film evolves into a clear a parody-farce, rather than an odd couple road picture. From its commentary on the homeless, gay rights and the evil in the NSA when ordered to abuse power, the film recalls a time before President George W. Bush, 9/11. The film in today's historical context, holds a surprising critical eye to what may go down as the worst and most damaging United States Presidency in US history.  My Fellow Americans captures two former U.S. presidents who would never have considered what President George W. Bush has done -- unfettered use of wiretapping Americans, twist of evidence to falsely convince the nation into war with Iraq (see books on Amazon.com written from an insider's view of the Bush White House) which caused the shifting of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, causing the failure to wipe out Osama Bin Ladin's Taliban headquarters there, causing the rise of a stronger Iran, due to the weakening of its neighbor Iraq, creating a porous boundary so Iran can foment civil unrest in Iraq with arms shipments, the coddling of Russia that has allowed Putin to invade the former Soviet republic of Georgia and force a treaty that allows Russian troops in Georgia, and the complete and utter failure in managing the U.S. economy and health care costs. The fantasy world of My Fellow Americans reminds us that there used to be a world without the leadership of George W. Bush. So jump down the rabbit hole and spend time with My Fellow Americans to stop thinking about the real world around us.
