... because the subjects and the subject matter are terrific.  However, I really couldn't get past my personal feelings about the filmmaker to enjoy this film to its fullest. He came across as a self-absorbed man who has spent too much time in therapy and maybe not enough focused on honoring and appreciating the gifts life has given him (he appears healthy, has healthy children, a father who is willing to open his life for public viewing, work he is passionate about, etc.  And yet, he isn't "happy").  His parents and their relationship were compelling subjects and I am glad to have seen this film. It certainly does provide viewers with good, meaty material for discussion.  One subject that came up in my case was how to make sure I raise children who respect me in enough to not air my personal struggles and shortfalls publicly for their benefit once I am gone.  It struck me as interesting that, at one point, the filmmaker asks his mother's best friend if she thinks his mother would have wanted her children to read her journals.  Her answer was "yes" and I could understand why, given that his mother had spent her whole life hiding so much of herself from the world.  However, I wish he would have addressed the question "Would my mother have wanted all of her dirty laundry hung out in nationally-released film format?" as well.  I would have understood his motives better and not felt so distracted by his apparent lack of respect for his dead mother.
