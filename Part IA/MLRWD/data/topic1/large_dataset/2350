As far as romantic comedies go, this one is pretty entertaining and surprisingly not typical. The only things typical about this film are the Starbucks plug and the gay best friend with a house in the Hamptons. Other than that, this movie kept surprising me.

Uma Thurman is radiant as Raffi, a divorcee with her biological clock ticking. She meets David, a young painter, and some complications follow.

Meryl Streep plays the shrink of Raffi and David's mother. The uncomfortable moments that ensue once Streep discovers her son is dating her client are priceless. As Raffi exuberantly describes their sex life, it's fun to watch Streep's reactions.

The obstacles Raffi and David keep encountering keep you guessing if they will stay together. Meanwhile, Streep handles her role well as mother and therapist. She gives her role dignity, not playing the typical overprotective, unreasonable mother. She surprisingly gives her son very sound advice. Let's put it this way, in playing a loving Jewish mother armed with intimate details of her son's life, she handles it very nicely, as well as a mother could.

Best of all, the story doesn't end with the typical Hollywood ending. That's always refreshing.
