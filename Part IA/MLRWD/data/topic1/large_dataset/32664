First off-- this is a great movie, even though it differs from the novel in many ways.  How could it not though?  Not to spoil too much-- but since the Jason Bourne of the novel was an un-official Vietnam Vet and things like cellphones and the internet werent around-- the plot needed a little reworking.  Though I will admit that a showdown with Carlos would have been nice..

As for someone's misguided review about "comedy"-- The character didnt jump out of the window to be funny.  It was a way to imply the extent of the "behavioral software" that had been programmed into the assassins.  Since his arm and leg were broken, and he had no weopons he refused to allow himself to be interogatted--by jumping out the window, he takes away information, and draws the attention of the police making Jason flee in hopes that the job can be finished by someon else.

--while not exactly the course I might have chosen...its not odd storytelling, bad comedy, or a misplaced concience...

Anyway-- It is a fun movie to watch, it tries to be smart, but doesnt beat you over the head with it, and the action that takes place is mostly economical, without too much gratuitous gunplay or explosions.

Hope they make a third movie... and perhaps even more-- I was sad when I read the final novel-- maybe the movies will last longer?
