I have been an avid Dylan fan from the begining. I doubt any other director than Martin Scorsese could have captured such an elusive target as well as he did. I do rank "The Last Waltz" a sligh notch higher.

My few complaints with the film are this: First of all, in spite of a lot of footage of them, The Band is barely mentioned. After not touring for 8 years it was The Band he toured with. Several of their members were about the only people he ever co-wrote songs with. Two of the most famous bootlegs were "The Basement Tapes" and the "Royal Albert Hall Concert", both with The Band. Some of the finest music ever.

Secondly, I wish there was more of his carrer than after 1966. The tidbit with one of his heroes, Johnny Cash is just mentioned.

Inspite of this, it is a great look at a great man. By today's hyper-commercial music as product era, I can't imagine news that people were booing at a Britiany Spears concert for selling out!

In the second disk you see him begin to unravel. The innane questions at press conferences show real humor. I loved the one where he was asked how many protest singers there were. "About 136", he said! He really paid an emotional price for playing the music he wanted and this clearly comes out in the film. Thanks to D.A. Pennebaker's work. This is summed up in the end of his European tour when I says in an almost plaintive voice, "I want to go home."

Last thing, I hope that D.A. Pennebaker releases "Eat the Document" after seeing so much of it in this film it whets my appetite for the whole thing.
