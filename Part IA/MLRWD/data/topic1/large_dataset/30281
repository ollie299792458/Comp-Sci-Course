The cinematography is amazing. This is the kind of story for which film is made, because the filmmaker can show the astounding beauty of the world around the central character and then give the viewer a sense of how the boy perceives such beauty. It was fascinating to watch and heartbreaking to witness the inevitable conclusion. Majidi masterfully brings the viewer from a state of judging the father to understanding the agony of the father while simultaneously charming the viewer with the boy's abilities to embrace his world. Mohammed has a special understanding of animals, a sense for the changes of the natural world far beyond that of his sighted companions, and--one begins to feel--a connection to the universe (the film's title translates to "The Color of God") far deeper than that of his father. His father is somehow condemned to his horrible fate of losing everything and exist without his son's special attributes. I wish this film would be shown to all fifth or sixth graders in the US.
