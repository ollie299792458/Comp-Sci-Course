"Freddie Got Fingered" is demented even by the standards of the gross-out genre.  It's not so much a movie as it is a series of outrageous skits strung together.  Some are really funny: the scene with the skateboard ramp where Rip Torn begins screaming for no reason had me in stiches as did the shower scene where Torn tosses Tom Green through the shower door as well as the bizarre restaurant scene.  Others don't work so well but what they all have in common is an irreverance and subversiveness not seen in too many movies today.
That's not to say that I loved the movie or would recommend it.  Some of things Tom Green does are stomach turning and rightly so.  The ending is downright bad and reflects a tendency for movies to have unrealistic or contrived conclusions.  As well, while Rip Torn is outrageously funny in most of this, one can't help but wonder how low his career has sunk to play such a profane character.
I will say this in conclusion: Tom Green at least tries to do something different and that's more and more rarely seen in movies today.
