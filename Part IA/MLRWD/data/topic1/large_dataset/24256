This is a good movie.  It deals with some very interesting and tragic aspects of youth, aspects that become even clearer upon watching the somewhat sparse assortment of extra features.  The director and writer have some interesting input when it comes to the themes presented and examined.  Now, I know some people have been shocked at the graphic portrayals of sex, rape, and violence.  I must confess I found said content to be of less severity than I had been lead to believe.  That being said, this not a film for the squeamish or overly sensitive and caution should definitely be taken when presented to those unconditioned to more hardcore horror material.  I am curious as to the difference between the R rated and unrated versions of the movie, as both edits seem to have the same run time, though.  The other thing I read about the film was that it was too talky and that we weren't treated to enough of the good stuff between extensive scenes of dialogue and narrative development.  I can see that.  That, however, is far from my opinion.  I found the dialogue to be essential to understanding the state and presence of mind with which the characters made their moral choices and decisions to act upon them.  And yes, I realize the supposed sixteen-year-olds appeared to be well into their twenties, but this is far from unusual in the film making process, let alone television programs.  Having looked forward to this release for several months, I guess I could say I was both surprised and disappointed.  On one hand, disappointed for not being as shocked and appalled as I had anticipated/hoped.  But I was far more impressed with the intelligence behind the themes and narrative than I was disappointed for lack of overly graphic gore.  It is a very interesting take on the zombie film, which even to avid zombiphiles like myself, is growing more and more stale.  Good Stuff.
