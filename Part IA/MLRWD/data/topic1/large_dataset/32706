I love Bill Murray, but not even his presence and skill could rescue this crap script!  This movie actually included the line "You're like boating a marlin", when Bill drags the found-again renewed romantic interest (Karen Allen, who also suffers thru delivering terrible lines poorly directed) into the broadcast frame for the final (lame attempt at) satiric-but-sappy scene.  The movie had pretty art design and nice cinematography, but the direction was twitchy and unfocused and the pacing was overwhelmingly fast.  There was no sense of special redemption because Murray mostly displayed the same general social ills, turned up a notch, as half the other characters in the film.  It was near impossible to find anything sympathetic in the half of the Crochett character represented by Luddmilk (Bobcat Goldthwait), especially once he becomes a rifle-wielding revenge seeking drunk.  Murray's Scrooge is merely lost, not greedy, merely uncaring and preoccupied and socially phobic, if extraordinarily snarky about it, not the possessor of a well-developed philosophy antithetical to the spirit of Christmas, like Dickens' original.  I'm not against a modern-day sardonic take on A Christmas Carol; I'd just like the jokes to be funny and the exercise to have a point, the original one or some *interesting* alternative, and this one had none of that...

Overall, it was a terrible movie that was mainly focused on dumb jokes and random cruelties.
