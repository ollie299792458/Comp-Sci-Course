If you are one of those who make it a point to watch this greatest piece of christmas literature, from Charles Dickens, then rest assure that this particular adaption is the best of all I have seen. It is so beautifully directed and picturized, that you really get drawn into the world of poverty, sickness, pain and death, which existed in England. The most touching scene was of that the spirit taking scrooge through different locations, the jail, coal mines, ship in the middle of seas, where all people although in desolation and extreme lonliness were coming together to celebrate the time of year that brings joy and happiness. There are also other extraordinary scenes of young scrooge recollecting his old christmas and his long lost love. The finale is absolutely breath taking and fabulous with him transforming into the person he should be, sharing, loving and friendly. Overall a must have I should say, and the best ever. Patrick Stewart hats off to you, you have done an amazing job.
If this movie doesnt make you a transformed person, then nothing will.
