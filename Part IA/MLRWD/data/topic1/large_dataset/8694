Just a few comments on the reviews of I, Claudius with Derek Jacobi and company. I sympathize with the number of reviewers who have commented on the lack of sophistication and depth in treating this period of the Roman Empire. It is important to remember, however, that this book and TV production reflect a view of history from the top- that is, as seen from those at the pinnacle or near the pinnacle of power and so neglects so much of what we now find fascinating about the Roman Empire. It also neglects its tremendous variety in all facets of life.

After listening to it, a naive viewer might come away with the idea that the Roman Empire fell because of Livia and that Claudius was simple-minded idiot. The studies of the period (especially by B. Levick) show a very different sort of emperor and reign. A broader perspective is needed to really enjoy the series. It is a shame the sound and picture quality on the DVD is not up to par. But it is a fun series to watch and one could have worse introductions to high politics in the age of Augustus!
