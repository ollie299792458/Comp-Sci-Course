For those of you who want to see this movie, but are concerned about the  rating and such, it's not the bloodfest that you may think. The best thing  is that they manage a great werewolf movie with little gore. There is adult  content/language. The plot is evenly paced and clever. A book editor gets  bitten by a wolf while experiencing a professional/life crisis. And he  slowly begins to develop better senses and transforms into a werewolf.  Nicholson required the least amount of makeup I've ever seen, until the him  and an enemy werewolf duel at the end. Jack played his role VERY well,  especially as a werewolf. Pfiefer was also good as the love interest. The  not too over use of slow motion adds to the mood and works surprisingly  well. One word of advice: If you want to enjoy this movie, don't view it as  a critic. The music works well in some parts, but could've been improved to  add more chill. The movie is very original and is recommended highly for  horror, Nicholson, and Pfiefer fans!
