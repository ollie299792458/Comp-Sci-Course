I purchased the entire box set in anticipation of a real great anime, and also because the whole thing cost me around 25 dollars. But put the bargain I got on the anime aside, it didn't live up to the praise and 5 star reviews I read and heard about from various sources.

The first couple episodes started off fairly interesting and had me enthralled in the story and its characters. However I'd like to say less than half way through, I found myself making it a chore to keep watching the series. Sure the action scenes were interesting just because how they were stylized, (I've never seen anything like it before), and some of the story arcs were cool such as what everyone was like in the future, and the detective's previous cases, the rest of the series left too much of really nothing on the dinner platter. It was the same old scenario each episode. "Go to person's house, see how they are, return home, come back next day, see how they are", and then rarely was there any action or discrepancy to break up that cycle.

I don't mind dialogue very much, but when there really is a whole lot of nothing going on while people are talking, I find the viewing experience to become dull and boring.

I think that the story however was pretty good and creative, but it just wasn't presented in the right manner. Again as stated before the anime was just too boring for me. I guess it's a personal thing but I don't really like stories that much if it's just all talk and no play. Or for that matter just all talk and nothing real interesting to talk about.

Usually I don't watch a lot of anime just because it's expensive and I'm not sure I'll like it. Manga however I can get one volume and see if I like it. It was just because of the bargain of this "amazing" series I had to check out what all the hype was about.

Well besides the rare but stylized action scenes, interesting story concept, and few interesting story arcs, not much is left to really "hype about".
