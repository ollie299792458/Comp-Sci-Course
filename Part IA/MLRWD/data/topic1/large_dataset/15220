You know how DVDs claim to have special features, and the special features end up being chapter selections and the original trailers - and that's it?  Well, The Abyss Special Edition is a model for what special editions should  be.  When the movie was originally released, the studio thought it was too  long and wanted it cut.  So Cameron cut a whole subplot of the movie, but  it turns out to be the most important subplot.  So the disc not only  includes the original theatrical release, but the directors cut, which  lengthens the movie to almost three hours, but fills in a lot of holes in  the plot.  The movie, in both versions, is an above average science fiction  thriller.  Cameron, for all his vision and movie-making skills, is still  only an above-average writer.  But the DVD includes scores of information  that makes the technical achievement of the film very fascinating.  There  are two "making of" documentaries, one 10 minutes and one 60  minutes.  There are storyboards, drawings, and pages of technical  information on deep sea diving.  Want to know more about if the liquid  breathing apparatus used in the critical section of the film is science  fiction or science fact?  There is a ton of information on the history of  experiments in liquid breathing and the possibilities for the future. There  is even a copy of the 20 minute special effects video sent to Motion  Picture Academy voters to vote on Oscars for the movie.
If you like  science fiction movies, you will probably like The Abyss.  If you also like  to know how movies are made, you will love this DVD.  Any studio that calls  their disc a special edition without this level of production is guilty of  false advertising.  The only negative is there is no audio commentary by  the director or cast included.
