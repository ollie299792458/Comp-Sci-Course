Its premise is daffy -- a disturbed video store employee (Jack Black) tries to blow up a local power plant and instead ends up demagnetizing every film in the video store at which he works, causing he and his very talented friend (Mos Def) to attempt to avoid the wrath of their boss, Danny Glover, by re-shooting every Hollywood and foreign flim of the last 30 years. But the film is more than that. Jack and Mos end up getting everybody in the neighborhood: the girl who works at a nearby cleaners (Melonie Diaz), the kids at the park, neighbors and friends, doing everything from pouring powdered mashed potatoes to evoke a blizzard, to stealing trains, to accomplish some of the most iconic scenes in recent cinema. Good natured ties are born, a community. It isn't sappy; the relations seem natural and organic. And a subtle supporting role by Mia Farrow, and the sweet, respectful tone of the film (I can't think of a mainstream comedy in the last 5 years so genteel) make it unique and bittersweet, as there is no pat, happy ending.
