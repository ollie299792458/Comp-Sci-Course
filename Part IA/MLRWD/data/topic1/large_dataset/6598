This is the movie in the series that people hate the most, mostly critics and fans of the series. Sure, it does have its noticeable flaws and cringe worthy moments. The film suffers from a rough script and was rushed into production before the script could be perfected, it was released into theaters only a year after part 4 came out. While I can understand this argument, I would argue that almost all of the Friday The 13th films were rushed into production and were also released a year after their predessors and were far worse then what this movie did. Most people point out this movie's faceless characters but again, I would argue that Friday The 13th has done a lot worse when it comes to character development and yet, these films are not bashed for the same reason.

While this isn't a great movie and no where close to the original John Carpenter film, I still feel that it includes some of the most epic scenes in the entire series, more so then the highly praised Halloween 4. The final 30 mintues are thrilling and the ending leaves you wanting more because you're not sure what's going to happen next. I also think that this film added new story elements that were interesting. This film is also much darker and even gothic I think. Still, everyone is welcome to their opinion but I'm just sharing my voice.
