Terrence Mallick's 1978 masterpiece is as strong today as when it was first released...or maybe even better now in comparison to the banal movies of today.  The incredible cinematography and  minimal narrative create a  mood and feeling that very few films would ever even attempt...this is like  a poem on film, but easily accessible and amazingly engrossing.  Ennio  Morricone's score is one of his best and most haunting ever.  The  entire cast is superb (Gere, Adams, Shepard), but the stand-out has always  been young Linda Manz (who also narrates throughout in a subtle almost  surreal authenticity)- her low-key performance is absolutely incredible.  The minimal narrative has been criticized by some,  but anything more  would have damaged the mood and emotion of the film.  The tragic outcome  of events is inevitable...so why clutter it with soap opera?  Compare this  film to anything else out there and you will see that it is truly  one-of-a-kind.  Seeing this movie again after almost 20 years reminded me  how many great films came out of the 70's.  It was a great period for  modern cinema --- maybe call them the "days of heaven" for  movie-going --- and Mallick's masterpiece stands tall to this day.  This  is a must see for any serious film buff.  The only reason I give it 4  stars instead of 5 is that on the DVD some of the darker scenes are  slightly murky...but overall it is still a Very Clean and Nice looking  widescreen transfer.  The DVD has the original kind of awkward trailer as  well.  Don't miss this film!
