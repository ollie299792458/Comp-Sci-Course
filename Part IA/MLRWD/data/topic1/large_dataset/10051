This documentary shows footage of the Sex Pistols back in the day.They interview all the members of S.P although all the members are hidden in the shadows.I thought that was bizzare. But the documentay itself is great.Anybody who is interested in Sid especially should view this.This shows the true side of Sid Vicious.Yeah so does Sid and Nancy but this shows the real Sid in his drugged up,drunkin,cut up self.Viewers can also see how bad it got at some of the Sex Pistols shows.They inspire me becasue two record companies tore their contracts due to their nasty atitudes and bad habits.Instead of giving up on trying to release Never Mind the Bollocks, they kept going no matter what.They had a "nice" little reputation going on for them in the press.But hey, that's just them.And we must drop down on our hands and knees and thank God for the Sex Pistols and their bad attitudes.Because if they hadn't acted the way they did, Never Mind the Bollocks would be a whole different record."Hello EMI!GOOD BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
