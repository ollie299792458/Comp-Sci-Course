**Dont Read this if you dont want logical but possible spoiler info**  So as a typical dance movie: 1) There's a good guy dance crew and a bad guy dance crew, 2) There's a conflict that requires some kind of contest to be won, 3) someone in the good guy crew betrays the good guys, 4) the good guy dance moves are given to the bad guys, 5) totally unnecessary and movie draining love story is involved. &lt;~OK so to get past what we all suspected & it truly delivered... it also delivered some *&^*%&$^# AWESOME Dance skits! I watched this movie 4x in 3d theatre and tho the story line makes my brain hurt, my eyes were glued to the screen for the dance battles/skits. Dont expect great story, expect the same story you've seen on every other dance movie made EVER and you wont be too disappointed cuz thats what FastForward is for!! I'm so excited to get this DVD & watch the dances...Perfect for those who actually know & can appreciate different dnce styles: Tutting, Crumping, Breaking, Pop & Locking, and Robot... Fun Times! I'm so XCited!!!
