This movie is downright hilarious the whole way through. In this story, Ralphie, who is 9 years old, must convince his parents and teacher what the perfect gift for christmas is. At first, he hesitates, and when he asks, its always the same answer: "Oh, no. you'll shoot you're eye out!" Raphie stops at nothing to get what he wants. He would not even listen to the teacher when she gave him a C on his "what i want for christmas" paper and told him it's a bad idea. He didnt even listen to who he thought was the real santa.

The funniest scenes in this movie are :

1. when ralphie and his friends get chased by 2 bullies

2. when his father gets a lamp shaped like a leg and ralphie's mother "accidentally" breaks it,

3. when the dogs next door take the dinner turkey

4. when raphie find out what the little orphan annie code was only a commercial for ovaltine

5. when ralphie gets soap put in his mouth when he says the F-dash-dash-dash word(it is censored by fudge)

6. when santa pushes him down the slide of doom.

My whole family always said, "it isnt Christmas without watching this movie". If you're dying for christmas to come, why not spend time watching this on tv? You'll never miss it, it comes on all day both on christmas and christmas eve.
