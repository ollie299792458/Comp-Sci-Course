I have to say, going in, I'm no expert on horror flicks, and I don't typically go out of my way to see one. But Roger Corman's Sharktopus has a gut-level fascination that compelled me to see what it was about. The cover art reminds you of the 60s B-flicks of which Corman was such a staple of quick and prolific.

S-11 is a shark/octopus hybrid created as a killing machine for the navy. Remember Barf in Spaceballs -- half man, half dog, I'm my own best friend; and in Matinee John Goodman picking up a rubber alligator, "Manigator, Alliman...?" You have to put the analytic critic in the back seat and just enjoy the ride. The sharktopus is a fascinating creation that fills the screen with surprisingly well-rendered graphics in and out of the water. The movie keeps you wanting to see more of the monster, if only to check out its moves. And the appearances aren't stingy like most monster movies.

The story doesn't require too much analysis. Experimental beast loses it's control mechanism, going renegade. Most of the people will end up as shark-bait, so there isn't a surplus of characterization to the munchy morsels along the way. The mercenary and inventor's daughter who hunt down the beast don't exhibit the typically credible human emotions of fear around a morsel-munching shark that just as easily tentacles it's way on land as in the deep. It's a pretty wild ride with high body count and pretty graphic crunchy splatter effects, it that's your thing. Not appropriate for kids. The feeling is SciFi made-for TV movie, not on the same level with Jurrasic Park, Cloverfield, or the recent King Cong.
