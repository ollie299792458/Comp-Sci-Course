Hmm...it's very difficult for me to be mad about this DVD.  Follow that Bird was one of my favorite childhood films and when I found out it was entering the digital realm, I couldn't wait to own my own copy of it on a shiny never-wears-out disc.  The day it came out, I bought it...even though the back of the case said that it was "standard" (full frame) and only had Dolby 2.0 sound.  That's the equivalent of seeing it on video.  I was very disappointed.  Sure, it's a kids' movie...but it's a classic.  And yes, "those cotton-pickin' black bars" that come with widescreen movies annoy some unenlighted viewers.  But really.  At least give us standard on one side and widescreen on another.  As an interesting (if baffling) sidenote, to add insult to injury, the only extra on this disc besides scene selection is the theatrical trailer...AND it's in widescreen.  What's up with that, Warner Brothers???
As for the sound, Dolby 2.0 is what is on most videocassettes and most TV shows.  If you have surround sound on your home theater system, 5.1 or DTS is the only way to go.  DVD is capable of so many things, and I used to think the WB was wonderful with their DVDs...but they have really disappointed me with this one (and Willy Wonka for that matter).  Come ON!  Widescreen TVs will be in everyone's living rooms within the next few years...why not start preparing for it now?  I mean, even ER on TV is in widescreen!
The movie gets 5 stars...the DVD is pointless...averaging out to a 3.
