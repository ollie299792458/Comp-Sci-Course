I saw this back in 2009 it was tense fun and funny.I enjoyed every minute of it except a few things.The ACTING was a huge letdown and sure the FD movies have never been known for high caliber acting but still this was a letdown.

The 2 girl characters were extremely grating everytime they talked horrible actors and just flat out annoying.The main character was very good looking but bland not that interesting to say the least.The stereotypical jerk guy was very cute and someone I was rooting to die the whole time.Mikael Williamson I think thats his name anyways was pretty interesting as a former alcoholic who had lost his family due to an accident.Was not pleased with what happened to him that is all I will say.It was cruel extremely fast and just plain cold.

The deaths ranged from meh to pretty good won't say which or whose deaths in case someone has still not seen this movie.

The 3d was awesome for the most part but after a while it got boring with stuff popping out every few minutes. After a while it became predictable.The ending however I did not see coming and thought it was a great twist.Will not give it away but suffice it to say you should never think for one minute that you are SAFE in a FD movie. Overall a good entry to the franchise a great opening sequence at a race track some good acting some horrible and a clever twist at the end I did not see coming.This is not by no means the BEST FD not by a long shot to me the 2nd one was the best so far.I have still not seen the recent one the 5th one in 3d so I can not make an opinion of that as of yet.
