One of the biggest surprises in '99, this superbly crafted film was majorly overlooked.  The plot is a conventional one but shot and edited brilliantly by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by Lem Dobbs.
It follows an english ex-con named Wilson (played wonderfully by Terence Stamp) and his quest for vengeance for the murder of his daughter.  Soderbergh and Dobbs' commentary on the DVD is worth the price..  they give an amazing insight into the situations and the overall editing style that makes this movie so interesting to watch.
This movie also features a very oddball but amusing cast of supporting actors like Peter Fonda, Leslie Ann Warren and Luis Guzman.
Another real interesting note about this movie is how they convinced director Ken Loach to lend them footage from an older film showing a younger Terence Stamp, to integrate with Wilson's ongoing character development.
Like modern noir-ish classics like Memento and Insomnia (the original version), The Limey is both entertaining and thought provoking and keeps the audience within it's reach.
