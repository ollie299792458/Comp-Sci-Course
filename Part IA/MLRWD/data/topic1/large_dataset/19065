I bought the DVD, and have had it less than a week, and have viewed the movie 3 times already. I can not count how many times I have viewed the features selections. A truly moving, sensual, chemistry filled, erotic, love story between two women. The Director, Nicole Conn, and Producer, Marina Rice Bader have made one of the best lesbian love stories I have ever seen. The casting of the two main characters could not have been better. The chemistry between the two lead characters is unbelievable, and so real. This movie speaks to all lesbians, who find their true sexuality later in life. Not knowing who they are in their teens, and twenties, do what is expected, and date boys/young men, and marry young. Then something happens, and you meet someone who makes your heart race,  your hands sweat, and you can not catch your breath. It's a feeling you have never experienced with a man. You realize that your in love for the very first time. This movie is of a woman who falls into this category. Married, with a child, and just going through the motions of life. Not really feeling. Then she meets a beautiful lesbian who turns her world up side down. She awakens from this sleep she has been in for so long. Her whole body is awakened, and on fire with feelings she never new she had. This movie is a MUST HAVE, and will remain a top favorite for all lesbians.
