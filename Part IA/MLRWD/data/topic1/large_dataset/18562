"The Poseidon Adventure" was the first movie that had viewers heading back to theatres for a third, fourth, or fifth showing. To know that it almost wasn't made because 20th-Century Fox didn't want to flip the $5 million bill makes it all the more incredible. It grossed $100 million (that's ALOT for the early 70's) and was the #1 box office draw of 1973.Now, I am a bit biased when it comes "The Poseidon Adventure." Movie fan that I am, this is the first one I remember going to see at the drive-in with my parents in December, 1972. And what a first movie! Imagine, in 1972 (when we were getting schmalzy film fare like "Love Story") watching an enormous tidal wave over turn a Queen Mary-like luxury liner. William Creber and Irwin Allen did a top notch job in filming a very believable "hell turned upside down.""Poseidon" is based on a best selling 1969 novel by Paul Gallico, a tour de force of disaster at sea. The translation to film showed the characters becoming pretty cardboard and the dialouge being watered down so much the early scenes are laughably bad, but the special effects are superior for the time and one can't help but root for the wonderful cast. Gene Hackman (in a BAFTA winning role), Shelley Winters (in an Oscar nominated roll), Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, Pamela Sue-Martin (pre-Nancy Drew and pre-Dynasty), and even Leslie Nielson in a dramatic roll as the captain. Dated? Sure. Campy? You bet! But "The Poseidon Adventure" will always remain the beloved disaster classic.
