After being disappointed with Star Wars: The Old Republic, I needed something to calm my nerd lust for Star Wars. I've been reading 2-3 books a month as it is and I just started reading books surrounding the Clone Wars saga. This is exactly what I was looking for. There are essentially three different types of episodes in the first two seasons. Padme/Jar Jar episodes, Anakin/Ashoka episodes, and Clone trooper episodes. The Anakin episodes do more justice to the character than the prequels ever did. Ahsoka is annoying at times, more annoying than the series' take on Jar Jar (which isn't even close to as bad as the movies). The Clone trooper episodes are amazing, and make me feel like I'm watching a series based off of the game Republic Commandos. The Padme and Jar Jar episodes are clearly the worst of the three, but they are still enjoyable. Jar Jar is quirky and dumb, but not annoyingly so like in the prequels. Padme is smart, sexy, and diplomatic.

Any Star Wars fan should love to have this on their shelf.

It should be stated that there are actually two different versions of the Blu-ray release. There is one that includes a 68 page artbook with notes and sketches with a better case.
