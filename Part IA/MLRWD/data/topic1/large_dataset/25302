Okay, so these days Jane Fonda is weird, which is entirely understandable given that she is married to Ted Turner, who can often be found snoozing during Braves games, wearing a cap 3 sizes too big for his head.  But in  "Barbarella," Jane Fonda is unbelievably hot, to the point where  I questioned whether this movie was real or a mere figment of my  fantastical imaginations.  Well, it's real, people, and you need to see it.  Not only is Jane utterly flawless (which can be easily seen by comparing  her to today's "hot" stars like Britney Speers, Jennifer Love  Hewitt, and Denise Richards), she also invites every male character in the  film to basically have his way with her.  Um, waiter, check please? But  seriously, we cannot be supporting this type of wanton behavior (primarily  for the reason that the women who act this way in the real world look more  like George Forman than Jane Fonda), so this type of vision is best left to  the campy comedy known as "Barbarella." I am 21, mind you, so I  am not biased towards the 60's, but I am telling you not to miss out on the  world's perfect female--watch it.
