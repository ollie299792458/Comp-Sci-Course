Ok, so maybe its not the worlds greatest cartoon about heroes, but this box set is pretty amazing still. I was VERY skeptical about this series when it started airing on TV. I didn't fall in love with the look right away. I hated the movies and this seemed to be based off of the movie version of the team. Things were not looking good for the latest animated FF. Then something happened that changed how I felt completely: I watched the show. IT'S AWESOME! The animation is great. The character design totally works. The voice acting really suits the characters and the animation is beautiful. I watched one of these DVDs recently on a friends MAC and it looked even better! The colors and clarity really leaped out on a higher definition television. But back to the boxed set:

This set contains over 20 episodes. Most of the major FF villians are featured and even some heroes make appearances on a few episodes. Marvel comics fans will be happy to learn that the main producers of the show are Craig Kyle and Chris Yost. These guys have a huge love for the Marvel U and really treat the FF with respect. You can tell that it's comics fans who are writing the stories and not some disinterested Hollywood writer who's just getting handed a check. There are some visual elements put in there just for the fans, even if they have nothing to do with the episode plot-wise. Little touches like that were some of what really drew me into the show.

I've read some bad reviews for this series and I really couldn't disagree more. This series is wonderful, funny, exciting and just gets better and better as the episodes go on. I was reluctant to give this a shot, but I'm so glad that I did. Any fans of the Fantastic Four comics or movies should definitely own this. Fans of superhero animation should get a copy as well. This is a series that I will definitely watch again and again. My only fear is that there may not be a season 2...
