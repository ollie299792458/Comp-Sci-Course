Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow make a great duo playing the role of Romy and Michelle, respectively, in this mirthful comedy.  Romy (Mira Sorvino) and Michelle (Lisa Kudrow) have been social misfits throughout high school. All through high school Romy and Michelle were made fun of by the popular group of girls otherwise known as the "A group".  They finally have a chance to show they fit in by attending their 10 year high school reunion.  Prior to the reunion, Romy and Michelle transform themselves into "successful" women.  They wanted to impress their classmates, especially the "A group" and thought the way to do this was to show up in a fancy car as efficacious business women.  Romy and Michelle worry about how they are going to be surveyed by their peers so they make up a lifestyle that will astound them.  Romy and Michelle also become their own surveyors.  At the reunion, Romy and Michelle find their definition of success different from the girls of the "A group".  The "A group" girls are married and pregnant which is a typical stereotype of women at their 10 year high school reunion.  Romy and Michelle goes against the stereotype of women getting married and bearing babies.  Instead they portray a more modern representation of women in today's society.  In today's world women are moving more towards a career rather then becoming homemakers.  It's interesting how the movie depicts this idea.  This movie is definitely a must-see.  At the end you realize the problems one encountered in high school are not so significant after all.  Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion took me back to "the good old days" minus the 80s music, big hair, and horrific outfits.
