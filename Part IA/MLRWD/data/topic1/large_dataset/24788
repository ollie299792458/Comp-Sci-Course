This could have been the new age Gremlins, but what it is really dull and predictable. 4 aliens decide that a summer home is the place to start an invasion and its up to a pair of teenage boys, a pair of twins and their good hearted little sister to defend the place. They defend the place by using the heat, and the aliens own sci-fi age weapons. All while keeping it from their parents, a local officer and grand mother.

Although the movie has Kevin Nealon, Andy Rictor and Tim Meadows are in the movie, they could really do less in it. It's all focused on the kids, which I suppose it should be, its a kids movie.

As for the aliens, they aren't ruthless or scary, because this is a movie for kids. If anything they're little formulaic. There is a leader, a female, a thug and a good hearted one that questions the leader. Pretty typical.

The only redeeming factor was a remote control character named Ricky. Ricky starts out as the jerk older boyfriend of the main character's older sister. When the aliens strike, they shoot him with a gun that makes him remote control. Naturally hilarity insues as the aliens, and children can make him talk, act like a goof, back flip and anything else. Its almost like children wrote the movie. He is a great source of comedy and if he weren't in it, the movie would be very bland and run of the mill. In fact the movie should be called "Aliens control Ricky."

Other than Ricky, it's just a chore to sit through. The movie feels very stale, very quickly; after all, 99% of the movie takes place in a single house within a single day.
