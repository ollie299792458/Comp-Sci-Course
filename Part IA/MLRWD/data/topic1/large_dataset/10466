Don't get me wrong- I loved American Beauty.  I was shocked by The Sixth Sense.  I was moved by Magnolia.  But for me, the movie in 1999 that made me sit back and say "wow" was Being John Malkovich.
I am sure  you know the plot, and words wouldn't help to describe how original (and  ingenious) it is.  The film works on so many levels- it is a screwball  comedy, an existential discussion of the nature of existence, a study of  sexual identity, and a satire of the modern desire to "escape"  from life.  On top of all of that, it is darn entertaining to watch!
The  characters (played to perfection but Cusack, Diaz, Keener, and Malkovich  himself) are all well-drawn, and the actors do a fantastic job- wait until  you see Diaz, unrecognizable in frizzy hair and frumpy dress.  
The  directing is top notch as well.  Spike Jonze (of Three Kings fame) has made  a wise choice- he recognizes the script is the star and has directed a film  without any flashy camera work, which would detract from the real focal  point.  That is not to say the work is pedestrian- he did everything that  had to be done to make the film, and he did it well (note his Oscar nod for  best director).
The production design is a big star here as well.  The 7  1/2 floor is almost "Gilliam-esque"- in fact, when I first saw  the preview I assumed it was Terry Gilliam's (Brazil, 12 Monkeys) newest  film.
The best word to describe this film is "giddy."  I saw  that because that is what I brought away from it- I felt giddy watching it,  and you can teel the cast and crew felt the same making it.  The best thing  I have read about the film was from a rejection letter from another studio,  which neglected to option the screenplay:  "I'm sure Being John  Malkovich would be regarded as a work of genius on whatever planet it was  written."  If that doesn't make you want to see the thing, nothing  will.
