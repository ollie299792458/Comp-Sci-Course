What else can be said about this Great movie? First of all Richard Roxburgh steals the movie as Count Dracula. He was the best choice for the role. The special effects are the greatest I have ever seen! For once we can see Dracula and his Brides transform on screen like never before.

The opening was Classic in Black And White paying homage to the old Universal Films of the thirties. Hugh Jackman is classic as the monster hunter, no one could have played it like him. The transformation scenes are fantastic as you see a man change to wolf, the charchter of Igor was also first rate, again going back to the old Universal Films. Richard Roxburgh is perfectly sinister as Dracula, you wanted to see more of him!

Dracula's Bride's are the most Beautiful women I have ever seen on film. Richard Roxburgh met his future Wife doing this movie. I can't wait for the sequel to be made! I am also looking forward to the animated DVD, "Van Helsing- The London Assignment" due out in april. This is a movie you can watch over, and over again it will always keep you on the edge of your seat.
