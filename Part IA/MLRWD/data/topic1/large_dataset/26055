From the opening scene to the final roll of the credits, Cars was a delight for me and my whole family. I'm not a big fan of Owen Wilson, but Cars was so good that I forgot that he was voicing Lightning McQueen, the rookie star vying for the Piston Cup and the prestigious Dynoco sponsorship.

Everything in this movie was cars. Even the flies were tiny VW bugs. The animation was so crisp and clean that during the race at the beginning of the movie, some of the racing segments looked like real cars zooming around the track.

The storyline is simple, yet quite relevant in this day and age of superstar athletes and the hunger for fame. Lightning, forced to serve community service in a forgotten town called Radiator Springs, ultimately learns that it's more important to be a champion on the inside, rather than on the outside with trophies and titles.

I actually didn't expect the movie to end the way it did, but after a bit I was glad for the way it ended. A very strange side effect of seeing this movie in the theater was that on my way home, I kept seeing cars as humanlike, rather than strictly machinery. That's how well Pixar brought the cars to life. They made me see cars as alive (For about an hour. I'm not completely crazy.)

From my two-year-old on up, everyone in my family enjoyed Cars, and I actually came to like Owen Wilson as well.
