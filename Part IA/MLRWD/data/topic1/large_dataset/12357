Great Movie Because of its own original and realistic touch of the ancient World and also because of its Real Truth about the story of Alexander the Great., to me is not a Bad movie just because it reflects the real life of the great conquer ALexander the great., Conquer of 90% of the ancient World and the creator of one of the most powerfull Empires in history... If people have different thoughts of the movie just because they did not understand the meaning of it, and they just go by the controversial topic which was his sexuality... that's one thing, a big thing actually but is not the main thing in the movie., because jet there I think that it has nothing to do with what the movie is talking about or what the writter want to let us know, see and feel from this Film... In my opinion the movie of ALexander is one of the best movies in the year 2004, and I know it migth not be what some people were specting of the Alexander the great Movie, But it is FInally his real Life, and either Anthony HpKnS as Angeline Jolie did an excellent job in the movie, they were just Great, and Collin Farrel was just doing A perfect play of What was in reality the life of Alexander the Great., Even Stories from the Bible have controversial topics but it doesn't mean that just because of that, the movies they make about it are the Worst... and Not to disrespect any Friend Here but as Oliver Stone said when the news reporters asked him about what he tought of the negative comments about his film; he said: "Only Close minds would not get the Meaning of This Movie"., is a Great Film and a story based on the true Life of its character.
