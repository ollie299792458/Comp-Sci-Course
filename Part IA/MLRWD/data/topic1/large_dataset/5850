In Treatment Season 1 was a brilliant show, which offered four very intriguing, multi-faceted patients that therapist Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne) treated. Each one was multi-layered, surprising and interesting. It helped that all the actors were superb.

Season Two still offers good acting, but some of the patients' stories aren't terribly original, and one was very annoying. The strongest, most interesting and eventually surprising patient is Walter, played to perfection by John Mahoney. But Mia - who has a history with Weston - to me was a somewhat weak and uninteresting character whose story lacked depth. Oliver, a boy whose parents are getting a divorce, was a very authentic character - but his issues and the issues of divorce were pretty standard and expected. Not unusual. They could have appeared in many other TV shows.

April, a character who has cancer but stubbornly refuses treatment, to me was a VERY annoying character who I just couldn't seem to identify with. Perhaps the actress played her too whiny. I found myself getting frustrated with her constant self-denials and refusal for treatment, and the story seemed to get bogged down. It just didn't feel right to me.

Paul's sessions with Gina remained great, and Paul's legal troubles this season also were very interesting. All in all, still a good season, but I must confess that If I were watching it again, I would just confine myself to watching Walter and avoid the others.
