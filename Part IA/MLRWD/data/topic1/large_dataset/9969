Gothika is a thriller starring Halle Barry and Robert Downey Jr.. This is a review of the Blu-ray edition.

The story: **
We are introduced to the renowned psychiatrist Miranda Grey (Halle Berry) who is married to the head of the psychiatric hospital. One night she is driving home and almost hits a woman standing in the middle of the road and next she wakes up in one of the cells at the hospital finding she has killed her husband.
The basic idea of the movie is good. I think most people have feared that everyone would suddenly stop believing you and think you are crazy. But the movie doesn't really deliver; it seems to be mixed between trying to explain everything logically and using supernatural explanations and you end up feeling something is missing.

Picture: ****
A very nice transfer, which I have nothing to complain about. The movie is very dark so a display with a high contrast ratio is required.

Sound: *****
The disc contains uncompressed audio tracks and in general the soundtrack is very suspenseful. There is a lot of action in the rear speakers so you really feel surrounded. However the center speaker was a bit low, but that could be my setup.
Special features: ***
Nothing really special here: The obligatory director's commentary and some featurettes.

All in all: ***
The Blu-ray edition is very nice, but the film itself is just too bad. If you want a thriller like this I would definitely recommend buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028RABSE">The Others (2001) [Blu-ray</a>] or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BRZ5J2">The Sixth Sense [Blu-ray</a>].
