What a time trip!  Although I was born after the decade in which this iconic film is set, I do have vague childhood recollections of nuns in full habit staffing our local parish grammar school at the outset of my non-voluntary consignment to the educational ministrations of the good Sisters of Saint Joseph [CSJ].  Acknowledgment of authority and respectful obedience are the key themes of this well-done period piece which is punctuated throughout its length by both tender and humorous scenes/incidents.  Most of all, this low-key and well-acted film classic is a delightful piece of nostalgic escapism with mega-stars of the black& white picture screen era.

The Bells of St. Mary's DVD also highlights a shared value system and a pace of life that rightly had its allure--a welcome contrast with today's digital society living in the moment [or even sooner], where most anything goes while integrity, respect, and religious influence are ebbing.  This is a good flick choice for parents/grandparents, for family viewing, and for study of mid-20th century life in the USA--truly, a flick with no gratuitous violence or garbage language, a film in which strong, selfless personal values, educational achievement, and character development are showcased along the way.
