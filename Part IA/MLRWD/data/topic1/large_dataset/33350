This movie, even one that has been highly hyped such as this one was, isn't exactly a disappointment but isn't a classic that will always be cherished for years to come. With that being said Snakes On A Plane (SoaP) was streaky at best, with very high highs, and low lows. But the lows simply did not outpace the more upbeat moments in the movie, as predictable as it were, and it still jolted even the most skeptical of those in the theater due to the sheer quantity (not necessarily quality) of thrilling moments, as well as the anticipation of the lead character Samuel L. Jackson's infamous line circulated throughout the pre-launch campaigns hype circuit.

All in all, SoaP was a movie I would see again, maybe a rental when it comes out, then again every other year or so, just for good measure, because in all honesty, some of the acting resembled a B-Movie or even foreign films when it came to a believable portrayal of the events they were experiencing, as in a far too evil villain and far too many "oblivious to danger" heroes which made for most of the film's redictability, as this film's plot is blunt (as is its title, which is to be expected) therefore the movie compares best to a James Bond flick in my opinion, as far as the overall mood goes anyways. What I mean by that is, you KNOW what is going to happen (as in James Bond will elude the bad guys) but will inevitably have all the bullets miss him and he kills them all and/or makes a miraculous escape, and you knew that was going to happen, you were just wondering HOW it would happen. So don't let  predictability disappoint your possible opinion of SoaP, because like that same James Bond flick, it delivers when it comes to action or a satisfying conclusion to that action and you will definitely be entertained.

So on a final note, don't get too hung up on the little details of SoaP though or you will find yourself having a much less enjoyable time as opposed to the other 95% of viewers out there, as Snakes On A Plane certainly has mass appeal.
