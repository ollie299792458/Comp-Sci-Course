Maggie Gyllenhaal as Sherry demonstrates a character who has to fight the system (hostile Parole Officers, advantage seeking counselors), her own internal demons (addiction, immaturity, and low-self esteem), and the external demons (a father who appears supportive but only so he can continue the sexual abuse of his self-destructive daughter, though is it any wonder? Plus a daughter who doesn't know her).  Sherry's only real ally is her brother who shows genuine caring and support for a sister who lives a reverse (perverse) philosophy existence contrary of everything he believes in (he even notes that he quit smoking displaying his strength to her weaknesses).  Sherry is self-destructive, and a victim, yet she's a fighter too.  Dean, who she believes is her friend, still uses her for sex unbeknownst to her own na√Øve nature. Additionally, she's quite willing to use her sexual prowess to get ahead, because her low self-esteem has her believing it's all she has.  So sad, and just so Realistic.  A MUST see.
