This is a gay genre film and explores bigotry in an interesting light.  Without giving away any of the plot, it is safe to say this movie is not intended for all ages.

This movie has a definite gay theme, which is apparent throughout the movie.  I first saw this movie on LOGO (a gay channel on DIRECTV).  It involves the love between two high school students, as the movie progresses, it dealves deeply into the love that develops between two high school students, following some magical moments in the film. The school is putting on a production of Shakespeares, "A MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM" - the movie revolves around this play and the magic created is reminiscent of the Shakespeare play.  Timothy, played by Tanner Chohen gives an outstanding performance as our young gay man, who is cast as Puck in the High School production.  Also of note is his teacher, a matronly woman, who brings clarity of vision to the small town and exposes their bigotry.  She seems to have some kind of magic of her own that is woven neatly into this story.
