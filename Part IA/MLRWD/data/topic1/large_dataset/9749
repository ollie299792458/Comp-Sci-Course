There aren't too many directors that could pull-off a horror film about a mutant, killer newborn on the loose, but there aren't too many directors like Larry Cohen either. No matter how outlandish the premise of a Cohen film might be, he has a real knack for getting you to least play along, because outside of the fantastic elements, dramatically Cohen's films ring true.

I think you could look far and wide in contemporary horror films, before you would find characters this well-drawn, performances as sincere, or social observations as keen as Cohen's. It's Alive perfectly captures the "everyman for himself " bad morale and cynicism of the 70's, as the monster-baby's troubled family is both exploited and ostracized. It is absurd, Cohen knows that, yet he plays it with a strait face, never allowing the film to slip into parody. Like George Romero, Cohen is a thinking-mans genre director who isn't afraid to make a "smart" horror film, that's still entertaining to watch.

This Warner Brother's DVD looks grainy, the color leans to the yellows, and some of the night scenes are bit too dark. This is true of many low-budget 70's films, but I think it could have looked better. The audio is fine, and does a decent job presenting the late, great Bernard Herrmann's last film score.
