I originally saw this film as a child when it first came out and it made a lasting impression on me. It is one of my favorite films and one of the greatest ever made, in my opinion. The blu-ray transfer is flawless and reveals the movie as it was originally shot. What should astound modern audiences is that everything you see here is real. There are of course no digital effects, but also no models and miniatures, which was often the technique at the time. The bridge and the train are real. The bridge was built specifically for this film and there was only one chance to capture its destruction. The performances, the direction, and the story itself, (which there is no point in repeating here) are all excellent. This package, along with its extra features is a pure joy to own, and all the more so given its amazingly low price. If you've never seen the film before you are in for a treat, and if you have seen it you will find it faithfully rendered and then some. A must-have product for any serious viewer.
