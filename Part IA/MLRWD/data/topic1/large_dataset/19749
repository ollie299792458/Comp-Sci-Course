Along with the hard-to-find Hammer film classic A STUDY IN TERROR, Billy Wilder's wonderful revisionist THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES stands as one of the best Sherlock Holmes cinema pastiches.  Apparently this film has also influenced one of the better contemporary Sherlock Holmes revisionists, as Mitch Cullin acknowledged Wilder and co-screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond at the front of his excellent Holmes novel A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.

Sadly, this film has yet to be seen as it was originally intended by Wilder, with the studio cutting his epic-length director's version almost in half.  That said, there is still much about the shortened movie that holds the viewer's attention, not the lest of which is the quality of the acting and Wilder-Diamond's classic ear for witty dialogue between men.  Robert Stephens plays a hysterically droll Sherlock, and Colin Blakely offers us a Watson who is high strung, shrill, and, perhaps, even more neurotic than Sherlock.  With Holmes sexuality put under the microscope, the Loch Ness monster making a cameo, and a number of plot twists that create the false impression that a much deeper game is afoot, THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES fails to disappoint.  This is clever, funny stuff, with a proper amount of drama thrown in at the appropriate moments.  Sure, there is much here we Sherlockians could take issue with (Christopher Lee playing a very lean and agile Mycroft, for example), but what Wilder brings to the visual Holmes canon is so rich and smart that such flaws are easily forgiven.

A classic, and very underrated film.  Due to the studio's tampering and editing, I've subtracted a star from my review.  But should the full version ever come to light, I'll gladly tag that extra star to this review.
