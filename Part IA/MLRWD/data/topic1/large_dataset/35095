The first 15 minutes provides a somewhat skewed perception of close quarters combat, complete with unrealistic pursuit tactics (two men entering a cemetery, with no backup, to track down an unknown number of hostiles who know that terrain). This should have served notice that the rest of the movie would also be out of touch with reality. The production team did not disappoint: The rest of the movie was nothing but an opportunity for the producer to rant on film about his anger towards the war and the alleged victimization of the young people serving in Iraq for uncaring politicians, greedy oil barons, or whatever is the bad guy du jour. In doing so, the producer tips his hand and announces his hidden bias to the world: The men and women serving in the armed forces are too emotionally weak and too stupid to deal with the consequences of being in combat. There is no redeeming value in this waste of time, except that by insulting the million or so soldiers he does not know, the producer documents the Hollywood elites' disdain for the perceived inferior classes who give up their lives so that limousines will get VIPs to self-congratulatory parties like the Oscars on time.
