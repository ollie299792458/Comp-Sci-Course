BLOW is surprising - I'm not sure what I expected but what I got was a well thought out and well told story. Depp's character (George Jung) was very believable and for once makeup aged the key character without making him look like he was wearing a wig and several pounds of latex on his face.
The story showed interesting parallelisms between his parents life and relationship to those Jung grew into as he pursued a career of smuggling drugs and getting the US hooked on cocaine. Surprisingly I felt a strong emotional response to Depp's character and the effect he had on his family whereas I didn't have a strong reaction to the drug scene perse.
While covering a large and busy lifetime the movie never seemed to slow or stall rather it seemed move along at quite a pace - all 124 minutes of it.
A few nights later we watched the Infinifilm version (the first one we've actually watched) and I was impressed with the quality of the additional content and its integration.
Depp did overshadow the other talented members of the cast but didn't detract from the movie - I can highly recommend BLOW to anyone that likes a good story telling that provokes emotional reactions while making you think about what you value in life.
