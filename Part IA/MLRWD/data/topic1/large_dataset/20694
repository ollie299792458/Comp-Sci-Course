This movie wasn't too bad. It's about a caveman getting cast out of a male dominated, barbaric, black haired clan. Then stumbling onto another gentle (but able to protect themselves), more advanced, blond clan where he finds a woman (Welch) and they fall in love. He evenually gets cast out of that clan he, then, takes Welch and goes back to his own. He finds his brother had tried to kill the leader (their father), made him blind and lame, and has now taken over the clan. Welch goes back to her clan and gets help as there is about to be a battle. When the final battle starts, an earthquake rips up the land killing many from both sides. After all is over, the blond and black haired people join to form one clan. Of course, the love birds get to stay together.

This movie is a classic 60's portrail of how women were in movies. But in this one the women fought back so there wasn't too many damsal in distress scenes. Everyone is cavemen but they also have trimed beards and styled hair, if kind of frizzy. The monsters are lizards made to look gigantic. There is even a huge sea turtle that is supposed to be scary, but... well, falls short of the mark.

I'm the kind of person that can look past the bad effects and take it for the story. I think the story wasn't too bad so I couldn't bring myself to give it a 2 star.
