This film goes down rough the first time you see it, especially if you didn't know what to expect.  i then wiated a year and saw it agian.  the second time i had a critiques eye, and i must say this is a very good contemporary, and artistic film.  this movie wants to recreate the feeling of the era which it does, to a degree, but it also comunicates a message through exagerated symbolism, example, as the lead characters walk about, everyone around them is getting mugged, or murdered, or something, this is an exageration that i believe references how violence then was far worse than now, by comparing itself to the amount of violence and corruption in most other modern films.  what i'm saying is that the violence in this film is exaagerated, in that errar if that many people died every second, the army would have marched in along time ago.  but in order to communicate how much violence there really was the filmmakers try to unsettle you by raising your expetations and comparing itself to other films, blood is bright red, and very fake, giving the violence a really surreal feeling, as though its not that bad, like the violence is just part of the fantasy of the film.  ironicly that is just it, because the whole film is centered around violence and revenge, and how someone really goes about making change.  when the final battle happens, the blood becomes dark and realistic, as the brutality of conflict and it's utter uselessness dawns on him.  the movie is filled with so much symbolism, i liked it and it has alot of analitical value, but it isn't the most entertaining movie sadly.  only film buffs will love this one.  i still recommend renting, it or something, because it is worth seeing.  i don't k now about owning.
