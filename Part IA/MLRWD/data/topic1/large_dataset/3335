I would love to own any of the Star Trek series, but I simply cannot afford the $70 that Paramount has decided to charge for each season.  Until the price goes down, I'm happy to make do with the Fan Collectives.

Q has always been my favorite character and this set offers every episode that he's appeared in: 8 TNG episodes (2 that are two-parters), 1 DS9 episode and the 3 Voyager episodes.  Since there are tons of reviews already that go into the specific episodes, I see no point in doing the same.

While it's great to have all the Q episodes, I personally would have liked a few more special features with the set.  Aside for subtitle commentary by the producers (which was only done for a few episodes), there were no new or special features.  Picky of me, I know, especially considering the price, but a featurette or even a blooper reel would have been fun to watch. The case that holds the discs is nice and compact. I takes the same amount of space as a single disc cover, yet keeps all the discs separate and scratch-free.

I've been enjoying the release of the Fan Collectives and hope that Paramount plans to continue with the series!
