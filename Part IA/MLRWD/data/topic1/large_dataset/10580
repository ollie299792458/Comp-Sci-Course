Admittedly one doesn't go into a movie like "Bride Wars" expecting anything more than a pleasant diversion for an hour or two.  Sad to say that even by those low standards this movie is a failure.

I cannot think of one scene - not one - that was at all funny.  The acting is uniformly mediocre, and yet far surpasses in quality the writing.  Whoever made this movie wouldn't know funny if it hit them over the head with a 2 x 4.

Anne Hathaway has done a reasonable job in other movies, so she may recover from this turkey.  I hope she was paid a lot of money to be in this - I would hate to think she was motivated by anything other than greed.  Perhaps she can invest a bit of what she was paid into acting lessons, as smiling is not going to get her very much further.  Ditto for Kate Hudson.  Everyone else in the movie is scenery, and so any comments would be superfluous.

Bad, bad, bad....and not "Showgirls" bad (which at least leaves an opportunity for amusement), but bad in a painful way.  And the biggest surprise - that so many people have given this five stars.  Amazing...
