Imagine yourself standing on a hill with Michael Lange and Max Yasgur (and you are actually looking at the site where the Festival was held) and witnessing the deal being made, Ang Lee creates this beautifully, and Eugene Levy is great as Max Yasgur.

Imagine yourself living in this small quiet community and one weekend in August, 500,000 Hippies from America flow through your town and piss off every Redneck aroud .... your there!

Imagine climbing into a Van with two strangers and taking LSD for the first time, then going home to your Mother and Father's house in the morning, feeling like the world was passing you by.

Imagine standing in the abandoned field after the Festival has ended, and you are looking at the stage that presented the bands (this has to be one of the best Sets I've ever seen in a movie)

This movie is about the small community of Bethel, New York and the young man who helped bring The Woodstock Festival there in the summer of 69'. If your a fan of the movie Woodstock and the soundtrack album, you will most likely enjoy this movie.
