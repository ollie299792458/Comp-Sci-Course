Well, the first 3 times I did this video, which was the first week, I did feel like I got a good workout from it.  I was an advanced exerciser before this pregnancy However, I hadn't exercised in over a month so I felt out of shape. As my strength increased and my "muscle memory" returned this DVD got way too easy.  I added more weight and was doing the advanced positions (most of them) and just didn't feel like I was really getting a good workout.  This was just after the 1st week of doing this DVD.  I quickly switched to something else that would give me a better workout.

I know now why.  You only have one set of each exercise.  After much reading about exercise and what is the most effective type, 2-3 sets is recommended to gain the most strength, important for labor and delivery.  It doesn't matter if you're pregnant, you can continue your same routine during pregnancy just lower the intensity, impact, make a few modications, and take more frequent breaks if necessary.  Not to mention keep well hydrated and cool.

This is my 2nd pregnancy and I have read a couple pregnancy fitness books + I worked with a trainer 2 years ago and I was told some invaluable information.  I know what I'm saying.

This DVD is fine if you're an intermediate, just make sure you listen to your body as I question some of the exercises safety and form.
I think the instructor seems very nice and pleasant, but she is not a trainer and doesn't know proper exercise technique.  She's an acrobat for cirque de soleil.

If you want a decent toning prenatal DVD check out the one by Summer Sanders.  It's the best I have found, not perfect, but best for strength training during pregnancy.
