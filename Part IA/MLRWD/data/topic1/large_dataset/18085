Have you ever wondered what would happen if Bill Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and the cast of "Star Trek" actually wound up on the U.S.S. Enterprise?  (There actually was a short story written about just that  subject, but that's for another time.)  That's the premise of "Galaxy  Quest", absolutely the funniest movie I have seen in a long time.  The  basic plot:  washed-up actors from a cancelled science fiction TV show are  enlisted by aliens to help them in their fight against a genocidal  aggressor.  Tim Allen, who now has played two space cadets ("Buzz  Lightyear"), gives an excellent turn as Jason Nesmith, the  Shatner-esque star of "Galaxy Quest" who chews the scenery at  every opportunity.  Allen brought a wonderful mixture of camp and honesty  to the role of an actor who actually believed himself to be "the  star" -- until overhearing a conversation that made him doubt his star  status, especially among his friends.  Alan Rickman is funny as the actor  Alexander Dane, who played the alien Dr. Lazarus, and I can just imagine  Leonard Nimoy saying, "If I have to say 'live long and prosper' one  more time, I'll puke!"  That is the attitude Rickman brings to the  role, and he pulls it off convincingly.  Probably the most stunning casting  decision was Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco, who played Lt. Tawny (where  did they get that name?) Madison.  It's hard to play a blonde bimbo,  especially when you're an intelligent actress.  Weaver gives a very  intelligent performance as the intelligent actress whose main assets are  her breasts, and her only job is to parrot the ship's computer.  "Look, I have one job on this lousy ship, it's stupid, but I'm gonna  do it!  Okay?"  The rest of the cast gives excellent, believable  performances, and Sam Rockwell ("Crewman No. 6") almost steals  the show.  Invite your Trekker friends over to see it...it's worth watching  again and again.
