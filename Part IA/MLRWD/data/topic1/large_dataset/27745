Remember the first time you saw this movie? So do I. If you didn't read the book first, which I didn't until recently, you just knew something bad was gonna happen. But this bad? As breathtaking as the river and wilderness scenes are, the crime is just as shocking. You'd expect a woman to be a rape victim so far from civilization, but with the in-bred hillbillies, anyone will do. And do they show everything that happened. But when Lewis appears drifting slowly along with bow cocked full bore, you cheered because the good guy showed up. There's not really much more to tell, because if we are looking at reviews, we probably seen the movie, more than once! However, if you are thinking about the DVD, buy it. Crisp, clear and very nicely done. You'll be dreaming of (civilized) canoe trips come summer time. I got the novel by Dickey from Amazon.com last Christmas, and I got the DVD this one. They compliment each other so I suggest do both. James Dickey worked hands on with the director, you'll see this in the DVD extras, and the result rings true. Dickey is also the sheriff at the end of the movie which I never knew before the DVD. Spend a weekend reading the book and watching the DVD and it'll be a weekend well spent.
