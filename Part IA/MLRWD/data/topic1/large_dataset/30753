I remember the Muppets from when I was a child.  My sisters and I would scramble to finish homework and get prepared for bed so that we would be allowed to "stay up" and watch Kermit and his troop, along with the marvelous guest stars.  This version of Charles Dicken's classic story - though it may seem silly at first thought - is accurate, moving, and memorable.  My father gave it to us on VHS years ago and it became a family classic.  My father - very much a "manly man" - would make time in his busy schedule to watch this with us every Christmas season.  Summer 2002, we gathered around his hospital bed to watch it one more time together as a family.

The music is appropriate and moving from the opening song about Scrooge - "When a cold wind blows it chills you - chills you to the bone!" - to the last scene of the friends and family together singing "The Love We've Found".  I find myself singing "It Feels Like Christmas" months after watching the movie.  All of the music is wonderful!

Perhaps it is the genius of the comedic touch which makes this version so much better than the others.  In typical Muppet style, physical comedy is added to the mix.  Who can forget Rizzo the Rat's plunge from the top of the iron fence into the snow, then his dash back through the bars because he forgot his bag of food?  And "Light the lamp, not the rat!"  If you have not watched this version, you have truly missed something wonderful.  Make this one of the "must see" movies of the holiday season - or any time of the year!
