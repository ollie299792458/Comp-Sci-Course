I personally thought that this DVD was a big waste of money. I bought it under the impression from others here and from the product label that it presented a honest view of the Christian viewpoint of how the Earth was made. Instead, it set up the biblical view at the beginning, and then made you feel like an uninformed individual if you believed in creation. It then had the gall to admit within five minutes later that there was still controversary on how the oceans were created, so if you expect an honest viewpoint you are not going to get it here. Instead this DVD is basically a short CliffNotes version of a College 101 Physical Geology textbook as it attempts to cram 16 weeks of lecture material into 90 minutes of video. If I had not taken such a class within the past year, I would have been lost within the first few minutes since the DVD assumes you have a basic understanding of physical geology and what the main theories are, but for a balanced viewpoint of how the Earth was made, this DVD falls far short of all reality in that endeavor.
