I feel really bad for Ridley Scott, if only he had been able to bring this version to the cinema then history would look far more favourably on Kingdom of Heaven.

I think I'll clear the air about what I don't like about the film first. That would have to be the first ten minutes of the film. I absolutely love Michael Sheen, he was particularly superb in Frost Vs Nixon, but his performance here is wasted on an unnecessary opening story that is supposed to get the film moving but ultimately causes it some damage.

The first ten minute revenge sequence it the only thing I don't like about this amazing film. After that ten minutes you are in for a long and stellar ride. The story is brilliant and fascinating, the acting (Liam Neeson in particular) is superb, and I felt that Orlando Bloom - although not perfect - was good enough to carry the film.

I can't add much more, as I think everyone else here has praised the film enough. The one thing I love in particular is the portrayal of Muslims, Ridley Scott avoids all the clich&eacute;s and doesn't stereotype - a refreshing change for a Hollywood production.
