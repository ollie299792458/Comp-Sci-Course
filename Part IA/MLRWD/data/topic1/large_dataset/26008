Sorry to disappoint anyone who, like I, hoped for a carefully structured, legitimate, thoughtful look at the coming of age of a young girl of Arab-descent in contemporary America. If you even fancy yourself a thinker, don't insult yourself with this. If, however, you're a fan of grossly obvious, writ-large stereotypes, step right up. As with "American Beauty," the director's tropes are simple: Suburban America is evil, twisted, perverse, depraved. There isn't a single redeeming value or quality about it. All American white males are similarly wanting for moral strength and character; they're merely rapists waiting to prey on their young victims while raising tow-headed racists. Got all that? Believe it? Good. This is for you. As for me, I'll keep searching for a work deserving of the accolades erroneously awarded this barely disguised porn. If this is the extent of what the book's author or the film's director can conjure as depictions of a girl grappling with self-awareness, then feeble is too strong a characterization of their grossly stunted "talent."
