Alas, I wanted to have a good time during this movie.

Really I did.  I wasn't expecting "Citizen Cane", mind you, or even "the 'Citizen Cane' of man-eating-snake films".  But I was expecting to have a good time during a bad movie, and this one just fell short.

Some bad movies are truly bad -- they can't even be enjoyed for their kitsch value -- and this movie *almost* stoops that low.  If you enjoy "cimena con queso", parts of this movie are worth a laugh, but I would say that there isn't the required critical mass to press PLAY.

(And if you're one of those (unfortunate) folks who can't enjoy a bad movie to any extent, then you'll find nothing redeeming about "Anacondas" at all, unless you're a pubescent teenage boy with ADD.)

The fundamental problem lies with the terrible screenplay.  The dialogue is so bad, I got the impression that the screenwriter composed it solely to impress his drunk poker buddies.  Still, the director and performers give it their all, and there's something embarassing -- even pitiful -- about seeing all these unknowns put so much effort into a career deathtrap.

So the screenplay is dumb and ridiculous, and instead of giving you thrills or making you laugh, it makes you roll your eyes while muttering, "Give me a break" and "How stupid do you think I am?"  If you're hoping for a "good bad movie", I would recommend looking elsewhere.
