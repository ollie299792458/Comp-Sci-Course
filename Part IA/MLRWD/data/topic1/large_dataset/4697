Like most, I have a love/hate outlook whenever I think about going to Walmart. I love the vast selection of products and the prices, but I hate the parking, the crowds, the long checkout lines, etc. Never-the-less, I pressed play with an open mind, and viewed the entire documentary. Afterwards, I felt like the entire issue boiled down to apples or oranges. In other words, you can look at it from both sides, but in the end, I will continue to shop at Walmart.

Look, I also live in a small town. In fact, there's a Walmart supercenter around the corner from my house. But, none of the businesses in or around it have suffered. In fact, they've increased by 200%. If you're familiar with Millington, Tenn, then you know this to be a fact! The once small and only hardware store a few doors down from Walmart, on Hwy 51 did not close, but actually expanded. Lowes even built a supercenter across the street.

So, as for the documentary, I'm really not feeling it. This is my perspective as a consumer. I'm sure both sides of the argument have substance. But the question is whether or not the good outweighs the bad.

I think the American public would have been better served if the producers of this film tackled a hard-hitting documentary that focuses on either of the following:

1. The Military Industrial Complex
2. The Central Banking System and/or I.R.S.
3. The big oil industry
4. Insurance and Pharmaceutical companies.

I'm sure any of you can add few more to the list. In my opinion, those listed above are the real boogie-man...............not Walmart.
