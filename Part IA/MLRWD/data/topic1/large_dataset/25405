Anyone familiar with Jan Svanky's work already knows they'll love this from the box art alone.  For those who are not, however, this is the perfect entry-level Svank film; this is rather tame compared to his other works, which is the only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  I like my Svank on far side of surreal.
  It is a modern retelling of a classic Czech folk tale, and, like many such old stories, is quite disturbing on many levels.  We in the west have fallen victim to disneyfication with most of our legends, a process through whcih most of them have lost much of their meaning, and all of their flavor.
  Svankmeier has recognized this unpleasant trend, and subsequently has dedicated much of his recent films towards rekindling the surreal embers of our oral memories.  Though you may not be familiar with the tale of little Otik, the journey of discovering who, or what, he is and what he represents to humanity is a genuine trip, one that should not be missed.  If you maintain your sanity after viewing this, then get ready because the ride has just begun.  I recommend moving on to Jan's other retellings, notably Alice and Faust.
