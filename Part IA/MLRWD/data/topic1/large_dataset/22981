Toy Story 3 is awesome!!  It continues the story of toys Woody, Buzz, Jesse, The Potatoes (Mr & Mrs.) and the rest of Andy's toys.  And is all grown up so what happens to his toys?  Very fun adventure with the original characters every one has grown to love and a few new ones too!!

My son saw this in the movies with his daddy and we knew we would be getting it for Christmas because he loves the first two movies!  He saw Toy Story 3 before getting the other 2 for his birthday in September.  I ordered it from Amazon (for a great price!)  and it arrived within 2 days.  I couldn't wait for him to get it and ended up letting him open up the box three days later!

The first time he watched it he was a little weary of it due to the fact that Andy was "big" and wanted to watch Part 2 to see Andy be "little again" but after explaining to him that everyone grows up and it's ok, he soon wanted to watch it again and is now an absolute favorite!

I love it as well!!  It's a great adventure that teaches morals of what's nice and not so nice to do.  It's also great to see a movie where so many main characters (voices) stayed for the sequels!  It's definitely a family favorite!!
