Firstly i'd have to say that if i weren't for the huge special features contained on each disc i'd have only given the pack a 4.  Only one movie out of the 5 is in True Dolby Digital 5.1 and the rest are stereo with Dr  No being Mono.  Still i believe this captures the spirit of the original  title and if indeed all had been in the 5.1 format it would have spoilt the  originality of the movies. I personally want to view them as close as  possible to how they were originally made.  The special features is where  this box set gets the extra points.  The makings of and other bit and  pieces provid the viewer with involment in the movie that other titles  should offer.  Seeing how the stunts were performed and how they did  certain special effects is great and still gives you something to watch if  you haven't got time to sit down infront of the whole movie.  Perhaps the  only title i would have changed was OHMSS. This could have waited till the  last set so a more popular title could be inserted.  The other movies that  are due for the last set will definately be worth waiting for with  "from Russia with love" being a personal favorite.  The extra  space for the newest addition TWINE is also a great idea. If you are a fan  you would have to be crazy not to pick up the set. A truly fantastic job by  MGM and i'm definately looking forward to the last set later in the year.
