I cannot say enough good things about baby Van Gogh!  And I cannot disagree more wholeheartedly that this video is not good for newborns.  We start showing this DVD to our baby at 3 months- she was captivated!  She would laugh and laugh at the little puppet Vincent Van Goat, especially the part where he pops the green balloons. Anytime she was fussy - we just played the video and like a miracle she calmed down. I know everyone says that they won't use TV as crutch - but when you are sleep deprived a few moments of a content happy baby is worth its price in gold.
I don't think that other people really believed how great this DVD is until I invited a group of new mothers over for lunch. We put six babies in front of the DVD player (in their cars seat) played Baby Van Gogh - All of the babies were mesmerized!  All six moms actually were able to eat lunch.
In addition, my baby didn't really like bath time. I bought the Vincent Van Goat bath puppet and now she kicks and laughs in the tub.
This product is the best!!!
