I'm glad that I saw the review which explained the real story of the 4:3 aspect ratio.
That was an obstacle for me.  I compared a scene from the disc with the You Tube version
and verified that, yes, there is actually more screen area visible on the disc.

But it is a little complicated.  There is definitely considerably more top and bottom,
but for some reason there is slightly less in horizontal dimension. But overall, more
screen area.

For some reason I feel a little proud that I saw Ironweed in its initial theatrical release
and contributed to the meager $7M domestic box.

The print is a pleasant surprise.  No visible scratches, smudges, end reel crumple, or signs
of hand work.  It looks like a typical transfer of a recent movie, which is actually quite a
compliment.

Box Office Mojo says the movie length is 2:24; the DVD case says "approx." 2:23.  I assume
the difference is a slight cut, but I'm not Type A enough to worry about it.

I'm very pleased with this DVD, but dock a star for very slight aspect ratio shenanigans.
