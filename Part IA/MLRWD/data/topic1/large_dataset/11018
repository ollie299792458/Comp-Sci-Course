I think if the other reviews of Goldmember prove anything, it is that Goldmember is a love it or hate it movie. Personally I loved it in the theater. My gripe is with the DVD, not the movie itself.
The first two movie DVD releases were great. They had the movie with commentary tracks and then a special features menu. For some reason, they decided to make the third one different and use the "Infinifilm" gimmick. Personally, I don't care for it. But again, this can be a matter of opinion, as other people seem to really like the way it works, by making many of the special features available during the movie itself.
However, there is one unforgivable problem with this DVD - you cannot PAUSE or FORWARD/REVERSE during play of the movie. By itself, this fact makes this DVD unacceptable. If you want to watch Goldmember on DVD, make sure you have 90+ minutes free with no interruptions, because you CANNOT PAUSE THE MOVIE. I cannot figure out what they were thinking.
I am hoping there will be another release of this movie. If so, I will buy it and give away the Infinifilm DVD.
In short, good movie, terrible DVD.
