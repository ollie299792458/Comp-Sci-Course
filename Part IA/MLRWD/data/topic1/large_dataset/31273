A wonderful movie about three friends who were best buds in Jr. High only to have one of them move away.  Then to reappear when they are all in their adult years.  I will not go into much detail over the movie, since you can read it as listed above, what I will state however was that I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.  The casting was excellent, Ben Stiller was a riot, and was not to over the top in this movie.  Jenna Elfman was lovable as ever, and Edward Norton rounded at the cast brilliantly.  The DVD version of the movie was great with the extra's provided.  I think this where the movie really shines.  Some of the deleted scene's were such a riot, I could not believe they left them out of the movie (Cell phone scene!) 5 stars to extras, I have yet to watch the commentary due to lack of time.  The sound and picture quality were what to be expected on DVD.  In all a worthy DVD to purchase if you like a romantic comedy.  I would have purchased this movie, just for the deleted scenes, but the movie itself was so good too.  I highly recommend.
