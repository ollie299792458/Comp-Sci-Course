This film started off with a wholoe new approach I'd never seen before, and I liked it. It took the story of all three girls in depth, and the villan in the film made the tactics dreadful.

The highway scene with the character Shelby had a great twist-turn at the end when you find out about the trucker.

The house scene with Tabitha kept me at the edge of my seat- I absolutly hate - really hate! - clowns. You kind of knew what was going to happen with the clown dummy sitting in the rocker, but I could still imagine that happening to any new babysitter.

The sequence where it introduced Lisa seemed to take to long to get to the end and to the capture, but it was still creepy.

As for the end, I think that the writer could have made it more revealing about what actually happened to the little boy, but it seemed to be too sloppy.

Overall: the beginning was great, the middle was pretty good, and the end could've used some work.

I would still recommend
