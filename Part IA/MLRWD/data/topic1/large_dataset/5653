Wow! If only my grandfather would have seen this movie, too.
A German Type VII submarine that survives explosions of depth charges less than 10 meters away, torps another dived submarine, dives below 200 meters regularly, goes muzzle to muzzle with a German destroyer (how did this thing get into the Atlantic anyway?) and sinks it with a single torpedo (not to mention an explosion like a Chinese nuclear torp)?
Sounds like the dream of 30.000 seamen come true.
Okay, enough sarcasm. It is a nice-made movie. What really surprised me is that - unlike most compareable movies - the original crew of U-571 was really speaking German language and all the gauges, levers and buttons have the correct markings. I really would like to know, if the U.S. version of this movie has subtitles, because the European version has none. Compared to - naturally - Das Boot, the optical presentation of U-571 is much better after 20 years, but the athmosphere of being inside such a steel tube is being presented much better on board of U-96 (a Type VII sub, too). Another point where U-571 can't win against Das Boot is Klaus Doldinger's great soundtrack of DB, but on the other hand, being much more action-oriented, U-571 got no long periods of talking, waiting and thinking that made Das Boot sometimes hard to bear for the typical action freak.
If you like submarines, light stories, well-made action and have seen movies like Hunt For Red October, Crimson Tide and Das Boot, you've found the right movie.
(but I still don't understand how a Messerschmidt 109 recon bird can get that far into the Atlantic Ocean...)
