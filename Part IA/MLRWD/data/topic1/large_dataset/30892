Documentary?

More like duh-cumentary.

I shouldn't be surprised that a fair few of the fear-driven right-wing religiosos have been won over by this slickly produced bit of heavy-handed fundie hucksterism- and the genuinely sad fact of the matter is that I'm *not* surprised by it, either.

Here's what you're getting- some o'that OLDE TYME RELIGION, all dolled up in glossy technicolor and wrapped in a shiny new veneer of old-hat parlour tricks adapted for the modern age, from the classic drop-their-defenses "But what *if* &lt;fact x> is true?" bit of logical three card monte, right on down to the classic relativist bait-and-switch "If fact A is true, then mustn't fact B- written in the same book!- ALSO be true?" shuck-n-jive.

In the end, it boils down to the same message the terrified xenophobes have been lapping from the hands of their fearmonger "shepherds" for centuries- if you're not in lockstep, then you're clearly goin' straight to aitch-ee-dubba-hockeysticks, good lawd!

You'd think people so fond of espousing their absolute-and-unquestionable mastery of the historical facts would maybe, just maybe, have heard that little chestnut 'post hoc, ergo propter hoc.'

Inconvenient, that.
