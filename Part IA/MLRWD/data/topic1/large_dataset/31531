Everyone knows that Apollo 13 is a well written and directed movie (Ronny Howard).  What everyone may not know is that the DTS audio track transfer from the Video master to the DVD is excellent.  With nice speakers and a  subwoofer, DTS makes this movie worth the price.  AC-3, having to compress  the audio more than DTS on the DVD disc, the Dolby Digital just doesn't  sound as good.  Period.  The rumbles of the lift-off are clean and tight -  they are not just a low "buzz" or vibration.  The high's in the  dialog are much crisper and give the audience the sense they are sitting  right there next to Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon.  DTS does a much better job  with the surround channels as well.  What moves around the rear with AC-3  Dolby Digital, REALLY moves around the room with DTS.  Transitions are  smoother and the sound "flows" around you.  The one problem?  The  cheapest DTS decoder (needed to watch DTS DVD's) is a Technics for 300  bucks.  I say that the DTS decoder and the DTS movies by Amazon are well  worth the money for even the small home theater guru.
