"Jaws 2" is an interesting sequel.  At least it has Roy Scheider -once again playing the role of Chief Martin Brody -, and it has John Williams' familiar shark theme.  The movie has its fine moments, especially the attack on the kids' catamarans and Brody's obssession with the shark.  However, I find exaggerating the scene when the shark swims like a torpedo in order to attack a water skier.  And what about the shark attacking on a helicopter?  Oh, please!!!  No way I could buy that.
However, the extras on this DVD are quite interesting.  The behind-the-scenes featurette is fantastic at explaining what Director Jeannot Szwarc and crew went through while filming.  I personally felt happy at watching John Williams as he explained the process of making the music for this film.  And let's not forget the deleted scenes, which makes me wonder why they are not included in the final cut.  All in all, this DVD is worth buying.  Sometimes I'd love to see some of the viewers' faces at the helicopter scene.
