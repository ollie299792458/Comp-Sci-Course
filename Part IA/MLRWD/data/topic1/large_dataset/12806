I loved 'Shrek' from the first time I saw it at the theater, and left thinking, 'that soundtrack was great.' I especially liked the track, 'Halleluiah' by Leonard Cohen.
Since then, I've made a digital recording (Tivo) of 'Shrek' and watched it 10+ times. (My wife says, 'Are you watching Shrek again? Well, yes I am ...)
From the opening minute to the closing credits, this film is a delight - visually, musically, and narratively. There isn't a wasted minute. And that is why I consider it a perfect film. From beginning to end you will be thoroughly entertained.
I love Mike Myers' voice as Shrek, and the animation gives him a real heart. Eddie Murphy as Donkey is superb. I guess Eddie might not appreciate this, but Shrek is a high point in his career. His constant prattle is hilarious. I still laugh outloud at his lines, and 10+ times later, I still cry when he meets Dragon at the stream.
The pop-culture references - 'Matrix' and 'Disney World' get reamed - still seem very fresh to me. And then Lord Farquaad meets his demise and Donkey exclaims, 'Celebrity marriages. They never last!' It's a very clever script, beautifully animated, beautifully execited.
There's a sweet message in Shrek, and it touches the heart.
It richly deserved the 2002 Oscar for 'Best Animated Film'. I just wonder, wasn't it the best film of 2002? Yes.
