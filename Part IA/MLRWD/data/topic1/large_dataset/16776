This movie is original in the sense that it's made in ten days.  Looking at the commentary, it's obvious that movie-makers indulged themselves in this project is because they wanted to prove a point that it could be done.  That, they did with aid from enlisted seasoned actors such as Colin Farrell, Kiefer Sutherland, and Forest Whitaker.  The ending of "Phone Booth" was open-ended and this movie would mean different things to different audience.  Thus, its lukewarm reception by the mainstream captive audience.  Still, this movie is a tour-de-force in terms of capturing our attention for the duration of the movie as we were teased to wonder what would happen to Farrell's character next.  Whilst this project certainly raised some eyebrows, it did reinforce Colin Farrell's stand in movie-making industry for being an astounding actor for his versatility and his resolution.  To conclude, a movie that highlighted the main actor's brilliance but nothing else.  DVD's extra is thin by any standard.  Commendable watching.
