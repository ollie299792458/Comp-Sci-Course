I, too, saw this movie in the theatre and was overwhelmed, both by the story of the dancers auditioning for the revival as well as the archival material & interviews with the cast & creators of the original.  I saw ACL on Broadway in 1976 and it helped inspire me to pursue a career as an actor and to take years of dance class.  Although no longer a performer, I love those who are and this film is a paean to anyone who dreams of earning a living doing the one thing they love most.  ACL has always had a special place in my heart (the movie version notwithstanding) and "Every Little Step" was like a giant bouquet of roses laid at the feet of an adored diva.  I wept at the loss of Michael Bennett and so many others, reveled in the joy of knowing that as long as ACL is being performed they will live on, and was on the edge of my seat waiting to learn which dancers made the final cut.  I could not have loved this film more.  A final note: my 15-year-old niece attends Pebblebrook, a performing arts school in Atlanta, and she, too, dreams of becoming an actress.  I have already sent her the DVD as I believe it should be required viewing for every aspiring performer.  Just like ACL, "Every Little Step" pulls no punches in its portrayal of the difficult road traveled by those hoping for success on the stage.  It drives home the concept that if one can be happy doing anything other than performing, one should not choose it as a career.
