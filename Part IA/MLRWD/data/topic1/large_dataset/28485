First of all, why everybody is complaining about the soundtrack? Moroder's disco-synth tracks capture 110% the feeling of the era, this was exactly the music that coke-heads of the early 80's were listening to. For comparison nobody complains about the music in Miami Vice...Style and feel of Scarface and Miami Vice are very similar beacuse of the Miami location(colors of the buildings, palm trees, expensive cars of the 80's, neon lights at night), clothing, drug related story etc. In Miami Vice the music makes the feeling complete and that is also what makes Scarface a whole enjoyable experience capturing the essence of this era.

Pacino plays the role of a century. In 1983 Oscar winner for best male actor was Robert Duvall in Tender Mercies!!! Now comon meng! Duvall in Tender Mercies pales compared to Pacino in Scarface.

From the first seconds of the first scene where Antonio Montana is interrogated you can feel that Pacino's acting is beyond extraordinary - even the look on his face when he is asked the first question makes you smirk. "Okay, so what do you call yourself? Ã¦Como se llama?" :) For the interrogation scene alone Pacino should have won the oscar.

Another great character in the film with memorable lines was Omar Suarez - "I will talk to Frank personally!" and "We coulda gotten some other space cadet to do it cheaper, for 50 bucks!"

Like one reviwer said, this movie is beyond legendary.
