Okay, this isn't Kevin Smith's best, but there are extenuating circumstances. First of all how do you follow Clerks? Secondly, this was a studio production not an indie like Clerks, so Mister Smith didn't hgave total control over his vision. For more on this read the notes in the Chasing Amy DVD. Aside from being hamstrung by hollywood execs (honestly, you will never find a more wicked hive of scum and villany than in movie studio boardrooms), this movie was very funny. Comic geeks will love the references to all their favorite heroes and the questions they ask each other about them. Come on, haven't you wondered about how prehensile Mister Fantastic is? Did the Invisible Woman give him that name? Just wondering...
  While I thought this movie was really funny I know it really isn't for everyone, just die hard view askew fans. Even those not from Jersey. Pay close attention especially to the credits for tie ins to other works of Mr. Smith like the monkey from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. There's lots of other little tidbits but that would be telling...
