Approaching 50 or already have your AARP card?  Odds are you probably saw this as a child and it was one of your favorite movies.  What 10-15 year old ever LOVED a western??

Now, EVIL ROY SLADE returns, at long last, on DVD and guess what?  It's STILL funny, without profanity nor nudity - remember, it was a made-for-TV movie in the early 1970s.

This alone makes it worth the purchase - a wacky comedy the entire family can enjoy.  Of course, by now, you may be watching & enjoying it with your children AND grandchildren, but hey, the more the merrier!

You can expose them to some true genius, like the writing of Garry Marshall & Jerry Belson, or the comedic talents of John Astin, Mickey Rooney, Milton Berle and Henry Gibson.  They'll ask you "who ARE these guys, Grandpa?"  So be prepared to discuss "The Addams Family", "Uncle Miltie", Mickey and Judy as kids in the movies, and "Laugh-In".

Enjoy "EVIL ROY SLADE" for what it is...pure slapstick, silliness, fun for kids of all ages from 10-100.
