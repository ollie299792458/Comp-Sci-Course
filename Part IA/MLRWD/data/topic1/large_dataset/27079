This boxset includes 1-10 of season 2, with some episode commentaries and a sneak peak at eps 11-20, sort of.  In the podcast/commentary (on the scifi.com/battlestar website for ep 210 "Pegasus" (which the commentary isn't on the dvd for some reason), Mr. Moore mentioned that Universal Home Video will be releasing a longer ver of "Pegasus" on the dvd set.

Well, its not in THIS dvd set, whats included is the tv version of the ep, which is really good in its own right and by far the best ep to date.

I hope its in the full box set, but I also hope that eps 11-20 are released in their own box set before the full set comes out, so that those who bought 1-10 already, like myself, wont be forgotten.

I am dissapointed about not having the longer ep on this dvd, or the podcasts for every episode, but hey, Babylon 5 only has a couple commentaries per season boxset for KEY episodes, so its understandable.

I sent a email to universal home video asking whether 11-20 will be out in a separate box set or if just the full season box will be out as is tradition for multiple season series'...

I hope to receive somesort of response, preferably positive.
