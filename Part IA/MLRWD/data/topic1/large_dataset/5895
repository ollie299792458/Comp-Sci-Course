I have seen this many, many times. One of my favorites!  I simply love it.  I, too, think that Brando do a fine job here.  I am not really a fan of his, but gee this guy just oozes sex appeal and bad-boy charm.  Sinatra...what else can you say? He is his sexy, charming, cool self.  Jean Simmons is good, beautiful...etc.  But contrary to another reviewer...she doesn't do her own singing...ironic that this reviewer's other favorite musical is Singin' in the Rain!!  (Where the protagonist is a voice for another..if you haven't seen it.)  Great flick.  I have heard some critical remarks that it is too stage-like and does't lead the viewer to think that it is really happening...only a movie of a stage play...but I think that it is just charming....stagey as it is.  I also love How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.  (Not with that guy from Seinfeld... the one with Robert Morse & Michele Lee)  Another great musical for you to see (even though is skips a few numbers.  Still waiting for Sweeny Todd (with Len Cariou/Angela Lansbury) to be released....saw it on Broadway..it was on PBS once. Now THAT is a musical!
