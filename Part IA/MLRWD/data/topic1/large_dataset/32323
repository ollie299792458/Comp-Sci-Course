I love this movie...but I'm an aviation geek and seeing this film in all it's restored technicolor glory is a real treat for me because I can sit there and say stuff like, "Wow!  It's an SBU in pre-war colors!" and "Zow!  That's great footage of a pre-war Naval Air Station--look at that PBY!"

If that doesn't switch your switch, and you don't know a PBY from SBU, then this film might not do it for ya.  There are two problems that might confuse a "film buff" who sees this movie based on the quality of the cast.  One, Fred McMurray and Errol Flynn are cast against type.  McMurray is the dashing aviator and Flynn is the nerdy doctor/scientist.  Right...

Forcing myself to remember that Flynn is the "brainiac" and McMurray is the fly-boy strained my brain.  I don't know why they cast the film this way but I have a feeling that it was deliberate.  You may find it intriguing, I found it distracting.

Problem two is the "plot."  I'll give the filmmakers credit for not making this movie too sappy and avoiding allowing a "love story" to overwhelm the aerial action.  No mushy stuff!  But this movie is, without a doubt, for aviation geeks like me, and so the plot is a trifle confusing because the screenplay mixes up about a half-dozen different medical conditions and treats them as a single problem, and that's not accurate.  That's like dive bombing in a...in a... in a PBY!  The horror!

So, if you just happen to be geeky enough to know what G-LOC, nitrogen narcosis, altitude sickness, hypoxia and "the bends" are and what causes them, this movie will drive you to distraction because the script writers did not know and mix them all up.  In other words, for a film about science, the science is a little weak.

But that won't matter unless you a real aviation geek--but who else is going to give this movie four stars?

Final answer--if you want to see a great color film from 1939 and and you care more about SBU's than ruby slippers or plantations, then this for you.
