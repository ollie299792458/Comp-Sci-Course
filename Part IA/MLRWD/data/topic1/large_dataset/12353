Wow! Not only does this film have some excellent casual moments of hilarity, some cooly executed violence, some great characters, but it has the finest twist I have EVER seen.
The basic story comes from a cripple, Spacey, as he recounts his story to cop Palminteri. It shows how a number of crooks were pulled together by a mysterious crime lord whose very existence is in dispute. The crew do a couple of jobs before getting taken out on a boat during a drugs money intervention.
Writer Chris Mcquarie spins the twist perfectly and I don't know of anyone that guessed it.
it would have been easy to steer the whole film toward the final revelation, in which case the finale would have, maybe, been expected. Mcquarie manages to wrap the whole film up, conclude with one twist, before pulling the carpet out from under us just as we thought it had finished.
this film is a true calssic and among my top ten. Definitely worth buying. I've seen it nearly ten times and the end still makes me smile. Excellent.
Shame about Mcquarie's attempt at direction with the dubious way of the gun. Usual suspects is his finest hour.
