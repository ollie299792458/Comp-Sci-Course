This movie was moving, brilliantly filmed, consistent and thought provoking throughout. Each portrait is beautifully portrayed, each woman struggling with her own story, ghosts and baggage, fears and hopes, searching for a sense of her own power, all the while looking for something better... What will it take to seize the moment fearlessly?

Delia's story was heartbreaking: her roots, her history.  Gripping fear keeps her from utilizing those chances to be vulnerable (since vulnerability has failed her in the past),to break free and to choose those people who can truly help her. She chooses, instead, her old survival tools--a tough exterior, self-sufficiency, and sexual power--which, in the end, is what she knows best.

Watching Greta was disconcerting...I am still not sure if she is a woman moving towards her own truth (ambition and power) or away from it (family and the beautiful husband). Still, attempting to figure her out, and coming up with a different answer each time, reminds me to be non-judgmental and allow everyone his or her own path.

Paula comes full circle: a runaway once herself, befriended and "adopted" by the gentle Haitian, she has one foot out the door when she learns she is pregnant. A near death experience and she bolts, she picks up a boy, also running and covered with visible cuts and bruises that mirror her own inner ones. She responds with such tenderness and vulnerability and  forgives the boy for stealing her car...she has been transformed somehow by the experience, enough to feel the stirrings of life within her and taste joy.  Which home will she choose?

Life is filled with opportunities to do things differently.  My life has shown me that rigid formulas don't work in the long run. Every time that moment of transition calls us to take pause, we are offered, as our women were, a new opportunity to discern how we will respond.
