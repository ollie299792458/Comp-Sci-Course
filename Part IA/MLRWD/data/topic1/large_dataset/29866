The opening title sequence is a perfect illustration:  Starting with a close-up of the group's icon on Ringo's bass drum, the band, as if from an ethereal plan, plays while the frame pans out.  The music gets louder but the background screaming of the crowd becomes overwhelming in intensity as the image of the band diminishes under a huge Beatles logo and their song becomes totally drowned out by the hysterical crowd:  As a pebble thrown into a still pond, the ripples expand indefinitely while the source of the energy becomes lost beneath the water.  This incredible set of live performances, video footage, interviews, and excellent digitally mastered audio recordings weaves a comprehensive portrait of the rise of the working-class bar-band from their youth through their last recordings as the Beatles.  Recent interviews intertwined with the earliest impressions of John, Paul, George, and Ringo provide a full circle perspective that is probably the best recorded compilation of a pop super-phenomenon in the 1960s.
