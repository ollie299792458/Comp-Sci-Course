I, like so many of its fans, cannot understand what was in the minds of critics at the time who bashed this film.  No, it is certainly not Quiet Man, and thank God for that.  The Ireland reflected in Ryan's Daughter is not your quaint, leprechan-filled stereotypical place beloved by the world that doesn't know much about the real Ireland.  The atmosphere in this movie is haunting and disturbing and reflective of a great deal in Irish life, particularly at the time of the revolution against British rule.  The attitudes of the narrow-minded villagers was realistic and in line with the church-dominated lives they led, and the Irish are great begrudgers so their jealousy of the lovely daughter of the local publican is quite believable.  However, this story of a young woman married to a respectable and kindly older man but yearning for romantic love takes on a greater significance when it addresses the deeper issues involved: retribution, redemption, forgiveness, betrayal and loyalty.  The love scenes between Sara Miles and Christopher Jones, playing the shell-shocked British soldier who arouses the desire she has kept under wraps, are some of the most intense and moving I've seen.  When they become enmeshed in the village's suspicions, prejudices and hatred of the English, all set against the backdrop of the brooding and rather sinister Irish countryside, the tragedy is set in place.  This is a riveting film filled with outstanding performances, beautiful scenery and universal themes.  Robert Mitchum in particular is outstanding in what may have been his best ever performance, and one very much against type. And, of course, there is the ever-present star of the show, Ireland, the incredibly beautiful land of saints and scholars, informers and patriots, martyrs and conspirators.  This is a film to add to your collection.
