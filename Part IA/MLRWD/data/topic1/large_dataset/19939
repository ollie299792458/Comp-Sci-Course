Great movie! Story and action is awesome. Any fan of the old G.I. Joe cartoon will love this movie. It's good to have it on DVD, as now you can watch the unforgettable excitement of the goose bump-inducing opening sequence over and over without degrading the video quality. :-)

Starring the voices of Don Johnson ("Miami Vice") as Lt. Falcon, Burgess Meredith ("Rocky" films and "Batman" TV series) as Golobulus, and Robert Remus (WWF/WWE) as Sgt. Slaughter.

This DVD contains
* 25 "And knowing is half the battle" Public Service Announcements
* 2 "Theatrical" Movie trailers (although they look to be TV ads)
* 2 Vintage Commercials that feature the 70's 12" G.I. Joe dolls (remember this is a Rhino release)
* 5.1 Audio
NOTE: Although this film was originally meant to be a theatrical release it was released straight to video in the 80's so it is not in letterbox (if such a  version even exists).

You get to see a version of the origins of both Cobra Commander and the Cobra Organization...and you get to see Cobra Commander's face.

This marks the last story of the Sunbow 80's cartoon and some of the events were used and concluded when DiC revised the show.
