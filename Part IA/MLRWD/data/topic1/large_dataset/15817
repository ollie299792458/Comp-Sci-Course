Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Candy, John Larroquette (spelling???) and Judge Reinhold! 4 of them became big time comedians in the 80's. Harold Ramis went on to direct some of the funniest movies ever. This movie is very funny and holds up well. Bill Murray is again in top sarcastic form as a disillusioned cab driver looking for some discipline. So what does he do? Convinces his buddy to join him in the army. This extended cut is great. Doesn't feel like just unnecessary scenes added in. Of course, I hadn't seen the original cut in over 20 years but I liked it back then. Some scenes I read about being added in and they make sense. The added stuff is interesting and funny now that I know what it is. Others have complained about the quality of picture on this Blu-Ray and I just gotta say that the picture is top notch. The film never looked so good. The Blu-Ray is a tad expensive right now but I looked past the price and was pleasantly surprised. This comedy holds up well and can be seen and enjoyed by any generation. And that's the fact, Jack!
