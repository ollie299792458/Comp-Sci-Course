This is by far my favorite version of the Christmas classic. This is the version I watched on television most often as I was growing up,on WGN TV's "Family Classics", show in Chicagoland. So many people are diehard fans of the Alastair Sim version, and it is good, but there is a warm old-fashioned genuineness to this 1930's MGM version. I always think of the Tiny Tim from this version, Gene Lockhart as Cratchit, and Reginald Owen as Scrooge.
  This version always seems superior to me...It's older, more traditional,...the snow seems more real, the fireplace warmer. Everything about it is top-drawer, and how about the great Leo G. Carroll as Jacob Marley's Ghost? No one has ever played the part better.
  I got my copy from Amazon in the "Warner Classic Holiday Collection" with "Christmas In Connecticut", etc.. The DVD here is exactly the same (as far as I can tell) as the one included in the "Collection". (You may want to check the price and the goodies included in the box set...it was a bargain in late 2009...about $15.99, and decide whether to opt for it, or this GREAT single Christmas classic). As for the "Christmas Carol" we are reviewing, GREAT PICTURE, GREAT SOUND. Just as gloriously rich in black and white as you remember! An absolutely essential Holiday Classic! Highest Recommendation!
