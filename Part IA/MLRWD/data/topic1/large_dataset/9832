This is really one of the best hard rock heavy metal DVDs ever!!
This dvd is a must-have for any heavy metal fan! Every of these
songs are totally 100 percent great!! I love how Mark does Solid
Rock. Dire Straits are definately one of the greatest bands of
all time!! Now I'll preview all the songs on this DVD that are
so awesome!!!!
1. Calling Elvis 9/10 Mark's first song! Always! This is a great
intro to Elvis Presley. A great song, really at heavy metal.
2. Walk of Life 10/10 One of my favorite songs!! This song has
some of the greatest steel in history. Way better than the studio
version on the Brothers in Arms CD.
3. Heavy Fuel 10/10 One of DS' best heavy metal songs ever!!! This is done almost to be the best one. Another pure hard rocker.
4. Romeo and Juliet 10/10 This version's just great!! I love to
bang my head on this!! Way better than studio.
5. The Bug 9/10 Awesome fast song with some great heavy metal
riffs. One of the best on this DVD.
6. Private Investigations 9/10 I love the other version, plus this version has more of the best heavy metal riffs you'll ever
hear. 
7. Your Latest Trick 8/10 One of the slower songs on this. It
has a great ending to it.
8. On Every Street 8/10 This track is quite good, but not so
great! 
9. You and Your Friend 7/10 This is not heavy metal just a acoustic song.
10. Money for Nothing 9/10 I almost like the other version a lot
better!! But in this version, you get the heavy metal riffs. 
11. Brothers in Arms 9/10 Almost heavy metal at this best!!
The riff is so incredible, watch this song play.
12. Solid Rock 10/10 This is my favorite song on the whole DVD!
It should have been out on CD. The riff you know is even more
what heavy metal should be!! ALL I CAN SAY IS GREAT!!!
13. Local Hero/Wild Theme 6/10 I dont know about this.
There should have been more songs because this is a reccomendation for heavy metal fans! Songs like Sultans, Tunnel
of Love, and So Far Away would have been even better.
BEST DVD EVER!!
