As with any made documentary, it generally portrays a point of view, and comes up with thin slices that support that. This documentary does does present a point of view : of how the Iraq war is being turned in to mind boggling profits for mighty corporations who are sleeping in bed with republicans. And it presents a lot of facts to support that. Testimony of how Halliburton was running empty trucks, endangering the lives of its employees (who are not entirely blameless) to bill the US government (you and me). Of how Halliburton would blow up a brand new 100K truck with a flat just so that they could buy a new one.

  There are lots of things happening in Iraq that are illegal. But what shocked me most is the use of private contractors for Military Intelligence gathering. So you are putting a person (Contractor whose primary motive is profit) in charge of a job that affects the lives of American Soldiers, you are essentially endangering American lives. And the blame lays squarely on the Repbulican Leadership and their friends in Halliburton, KBR, CACI etc.

  I hope, now that both the House and Senate is controlled by Democrats, that an investigation is launched, and the crooks running these companies are brought to book, prosecuted, sent to jail and the companies are forced to shut down.

  I was left with the feeling that I have blood on my hands. Of Iraqis civilians and American soldiers, because for so long we chose to be hoodwinked by the crooks now running this country.
