After watching this movie, I was actually angry. I've come to realize just how shallow some critics can be. This film has been put down for its lacking similarity to its predecessor, Bruce Almighty. What do we really want from this movie, a carbon copy of the original? What are we looking for from Steve Carell, another moment of babling?

The truth is this is a good movie. To reiterate, THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE! It's not a Jim Carry flick. Evan Baxter wasn't the main character even then. In this story it's only natural that he isn't the same man. He's moved on to bigger things. Steve Carell does a great job of reintroducing Evan as a seperate, yet familiar character. The film holds its own as both a sequel, and a seperate movie.

The story is deep and honest, so what if it doesn't meet the demand! Just like any "good" film the core of the story flies right over the heads of dead-pan critics and uncultured movie goers. This story relates to our care of the environment or lack thereof and, most importantly, how we treat each other.

What this movie isn't is a film for the narrow minded or self-centered. You either get it, or you don't! Evan Almighty offers what few movies can boast these days, a rich, precise tale of the human condition and what often happens when we're facing our own faults... ignorance. Watch this film with your family. Respond to any questions your kids might have. Challenge yourselves, and remember the massage being offered.
