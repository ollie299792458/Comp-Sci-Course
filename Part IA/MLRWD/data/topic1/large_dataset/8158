I just picked up one of the DD DVD versions from Amazon and yeah, it's going right back out for sale -- it's as bad as many others have said. I couldn't get through the first couple of minutes! Skipped around to check, but yeah, the whole thing is littered with bootleg-esque and/or PAL-like conversion artifacts over *every moving image*...insanely bad for a professionally produced release such as this. Normally I'm not picky when it comes to Hong Kong films as I know that they have a reputation for not taking care of their own archives (and indeed I've leaned more toward DD DVDs rather than their Blus, based on overall buyer recommendations). But DD has been doing a pretty good job on much older films such as 'Come Drink with Me' -- what's the deal, dudes? (I know it's not all your fault, Bey!) This release is pitiful, and for one of my favorite films, I'll happily stick with my Winstar DVD for a more 'authentic' presentation, including more accurate cultural opening. The resolution of the soundtrack is actually improved, it's deeper, fuller sounding even only in 2.0 (as it was originally produced and intended), but it's still not worth it to sit through the awful DVD imaging.

As far as the bonus material, the interview with John Woo cuts out of sound during the opening moments, again strange and hard to believe, plus he's basically repeating things fans all know from various other interviews on other releases surrounding this film (why not try to include the great doc/interview from the French release?). The American Cinematheque interviews are hard to decipher due to their local audio (and again has Woo saying things that for the most part fans have all heard before), and the only rather amusing and interesting featurette is the short following up on locations utilized in the film.

A highly disappointing release -- this film still hasn't received near the respect it deserves.
