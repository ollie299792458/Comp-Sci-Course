Watching Jimmy Cagney in these classic gangster films is like watching Fred Astaire dance or hearing Nat King Cole sing. He is the best tough guy in the history of cinema. Acting styles have changed over the years and many of the supporting actors will no doubt seem very presentational to the modern, post-Brando viewer. But Jimmy Cagney is as timeless as ever. The same is true for Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson too.

 I can't recommend this collection enough. These  six wonderful movies are a must for any movie buff's collection.

I've waitied for White Heat on DVD for years and it alone was worth the wait. I've seen White Heat a dozen times at least, but seeing it on DVD was like seeing it for the first time.

I'm a screenwriter in L.A. and while watching these great new transfers, I realized that the reason I got into this business in the first place was because of watching these old Jimmy Cagney movies on TV when I was a kid in Chicago.

If you make no other purchase this year -- make it this one.
