DOWN PERISCOPE is one of those rare movies that is significantly better than first instinct.  Considering this was Kelsey Grammer's first starring movie, I was very curious (as a great fan of Frasier) but cautious.  No need to be.  Hugh Wilson's script was as good as we could have asked for, and Grammer pulled off one of his best acting experiences in his career...believable, intelligent, funny, and on the mark.  To stop the review here would not do justice, though.

Let's begin with the actors.  What an amazing cast!  First, you have Rip Torn, Harry Dean Stanton, Bruce Dern, and William H. Macy...these are heavyweights in the acting world and boy do they come through.  Bruce Dern is especially good playing real jerks and this is no exception.  The remaining cast includes Lauren Hotty...er Holly, Rob Schneider (giving a solid, give-it-all-you-got performance), Ken Hudson Campbell, and Harland Williams (always funny...check out the movie ROCKETMAN if you love off-the-wall humor).

Then there's the sea-going action.  As a real fan of submarine movies (another reason I was cautious of this movie at first), I was blown away at the amount of attention to detail they gave to this part of the film.  Since it was a comedy, they could have just given scant attention to the action part of it and left it to dialogue to carry the movie.  But no!  They went all out and gave the viewer a wonderful action movie to boot (of course not Das Boot, the great submarine film...).  Anyway, the bottomline is that folks that like this genre won't be disappointed.

When you get a chance, watch this film.  As one that would like to buy a Special Edition DVD in widescreen of this movie, I know I will be disappointed since I doubt it will ever materialize.  Oh well...
