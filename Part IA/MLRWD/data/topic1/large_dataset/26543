This is Tom Selleck at his finest, as a director, writer and actor.  The Jesse Stone films are so well directed that they are over before you know it and leave you wanting more.  They are so quietly advanced that you are on the edge of your seat without realizing it.  The tiny details sink into the back of your mind and nag at you as the integral parts of the mystery that they are while you wait for the answers.  Get them ALL.  Then figure out the order they belong in versus the order in which they were televised.  You will want to watch them again and again.  Especially on a cold winter's night when you want to feel especially warm and cozy because someone else is out in the cold doing detective work.  Humorous, tight, superbly acted down to the extra with no lines.  Must see movies, all of them.  So sad the original author has passed on and left us wondering what Jesse's next move will be.  Perhaps Tom and company can continue to read his mind and bring us Jesse Stone's life until he, too, must leave us for the great casting call in the sky.  If there were 10 stars in the rating, I would give them all of mine.  Love the dogs, by the way.
