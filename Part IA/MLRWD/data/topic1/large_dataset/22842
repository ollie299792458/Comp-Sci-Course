Apparently the very-talented Tom Hanks is even more talented that we previously knew. Hanks has shown for some time that he is the closest modern actor to the late, great Jimmy Stewart in the superb naturalness of his acting in every movie genre from comedies to drama. But with this film he shows himself also to be a talented writer and director as well. The movie chronicles the rise and dissolution of a 1960's rock band which writes and records a single top-ten hit. Personally I've always wondered why so many early rock groups were one-hit-wonders. If a band is good enough to make one hit record, why isn't it capable of making several -- or at least a few -- more? The answer presented in this movie is that the one-hit Wonders self detruct due to a combination of ego conflicts, the pressures of success, and just the vagaries of circumstance. This movie could have been a mildly entertaining quasi-documentary. Instead, as written and directed by Hanks and played by the talented young cast he assembled -- the most outstanding of whom is Tom Everett Scott and Liv Tyler (who recently played the beautiful elf Arwen in The Lord of the Rings) -- this is a fun film from beginning to end. Frankly, I'm not much of a rock fan, but I loved this film. If you haven't seen it yet, please give yourself a treat and get this DVD.
