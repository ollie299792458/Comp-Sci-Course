I fully agree with a previous reviewer regarding gushing reviews of titles that haven't even been released yet.  There was a time --  a long time ago -- when the only reviews you read on Amazon were for things that had actually been released or published.  Imagine that!!

It's one thing to wax sentimental in public about your childhood memories of a favorite TV show...but it's something else again to write a "review" of a DVD set that hasn't even been released yet.  Sure, the show has been around for half a century, but the actual DVD set people are going to purchase with their hard-earned cash won't be released until November...and probably hasn't even been manufactured yet!!  So how can people review something they haven't received yet??

Don't misunderstand. I too was a huge fan of Zorro as a five and six-year-old back in 1957-1959. I even remember the main sponsor of the show in its first season, which I'd bet no one else here does. It was 7-Up soda pop...with its punchy jingle sung by a bizarre, highly excitable little cartoon version of a 7-Up bottle come-to-life. It ran around the screen singing over and over in a high-pitched, speeded-up voice: "Nothing does it like 7-Up, 7-Up. Nothing does it like 7-Up, 7-Up." Then it was back to Sgt. Garcia, Bernardo and Don Diego de la Vega.

I'm leaving a rating only because it's required to post this sincere message to my fellow Zorro fans. I give the Disney Treasures version of the complete Zorro series four HOPEFUL stars based on what we all pray will be a terrific DVD set.

If you're smart, you won't purchase this set until you read a couple serious reviews of the actual DVD set when it's released. I've seen a lot of Amazon customers cry the blues when they pre-ordered titles that turned out to be far different than what they'd been led to expect...especially when their expectations were based on other people's fond childhood memories passed off as a "review".

Caveat Emptor.
