Wow.
This flick is just head-slappingly bad.
I was unlucky-enough to catch a preview-screening of this "movie" about, oh, one year ago. While I didn't expect cinema-magic (I mean, how could it possibly match the original?!), I still hoped to at least be somewhat entertained.
I wasn't.
NObody in that audience was entertained. We all sat slack-jaw'd at the miserable failure unspooling before us. Sure, we laughed - during the ridiculous dialogue, mainly.  But other than the echoes of unintended humour, there was little entertainment to be had at that screening.

Here's the breakdown:
- The 3-D used is the primitive red/blue glasses. That technology, needless to say, hasn't exactly improved with age.
- The dialogue is a hoot. One watches and wonders if, in truth, this was meant to be a comedy. Speaking of which....
- Zombies using text-messaging? *sighs* OK then.
- There is NO GORE in this film. If you're expecting any bloody thrills, think again.
- Poor Sid Haig. FIRE YOUR AGENT! You deserve better.

Overall, this film is a miserable failure that doesn't deliver as a comedy, as a horror-movie, as a 3-D film, or as a tribute to the original. It's a LAME IDEA that was stretched into a feature film, with little regard for the audience.

AVOID!!!!
