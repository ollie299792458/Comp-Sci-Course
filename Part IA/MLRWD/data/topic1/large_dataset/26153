I first caught wind of this film at a preview-to-coming-attractions, and thought it might be pretty good, even though I didn't think much of Brad Pitt (or Sean Penn) at that time. When I finally saw it as a rental DVD, I was intrigued by the opening quotation from the Book of Job, which I was vaguely familiar with.

That quote's subsequent interpretation by Terrence Malick blew my head away with portrayals of the cosmos reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The other positive reviews here are right on target - that this movie is an experience, and one that will probably require several viewings to fathom. I didn't pick up on any sound qualities during my first viewing, but then found on my second viewing (with the DVD purchased here) a powerful soundtrack that greatly enhanced an already great movie experience.

I purchased the DVD in part to share with relatives who are grieving over a recent tragic loss. When it arrived, I tried viewing it with a cold eye to ascertain its appropriateness, but found myself tearing up during the story several times over the specific tragedy and over the plight of humanity in general. If you aren't familiar with the opening quotation - God's response to the complaint of a righteous man who has lost all - you may not appreciate this film, or if you expect this film to be just a movie.

Regarding movies as a major art form along with music, painting, literature, architecture, etc., then the Tree of Life is one of the greatest works of art ever produced, IMHO. It does the great service of putting human suffering into the ultimate context while effectively bridging often virulent disputes between science and faith. I recommend The Tree of Life to anyone who seeks the ultimate perspective - and comfort.
