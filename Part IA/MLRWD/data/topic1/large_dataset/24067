Our 3 YO daughter LOVES Miyazaki's movies. She can watch Totoro (1st edition) & Kiki's delivery over and over. (She hasn't watched Chihiro and others yet because I find them a bit scary or dark for her age).

The beginning was a bit intriguing and scary at times so my daughter had to be in my arms (I won't complain about it) but other than that, this movie is just awesome...  Ponyo is just a cute little "fish/girl" (spitting image of Mei from Totoro) and Sosuke is an adorable 5 YO boy with a big heart. Some characters look familiar = my daughter spotted Satsuki & Mei's father. I'm glad we watched it on bluray at home because I don't know the reaction in the audience if our daughter shouted in the theater "Maman look, it's Satsuki's dad !!!!"

The animation looks "simple" but is gorgeous. The background is amazing (the town, trees, harbor etc) and kind of made us want to live there, with Sosuke and his mom. The tsunami scene is impressive and the waves look like these old Japanese paintings of storms...

Today is Friday, no school tomorrow, I guess tonight we'll be watching Ponyo again => YEAH !!!!
