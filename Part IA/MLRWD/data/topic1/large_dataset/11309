I had the good fortune to have seen this movie in its original, uncut, length on Christmas Day 1954 at the Pantages Theater in LA. The production number "Born in a Trunk" was the last scene prior to intermission. When Judy finished the number, the entire movie audience rose to thier feet and gave that filmed performance a 5 minute standing ovation. To this day, I have never witnessed anything like it. It was pure magic.
I know that many movie critics have rated her performance as the finest by a female performer in the history of show business. I would offer that it was the best by any performer in the history of show business.
Over the years, I have purchased a couple of VHS tapes of the movie. One was the butchered release by Warner Bros. The other was the first attempt
at restoration. Niether of these were satisfactory reproductions.
One of my Grand Daughters is very much involved in theater study and is working hard to fulfill her dream to become a star. I want her to have an advance study guide on "how to deliver a fantastic performance"
I want her to see the all time epic movie star performance, so I purchased two copies of this almost fully restored latest version. I must say I am totally impressed. The sound is great on my 5.1 home theater and the restoration is superb.
The supporting cast, led by James Mason, is truly great.
It will always be show businesses ultimate mystery as to why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the greatness of this all time classic movie. Judy Garland and James Mason, without a doubt, deserved Oscars for thier performances.
If I could give this DVD 10 rating, I would. Buy it, you will love it!
