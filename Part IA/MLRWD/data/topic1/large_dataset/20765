Traffickers in illegal rare animals dump a cluster of Komodo dragon eggs because they smell bad.  They have been living on a small island and have been pretty content.  Until an oil company poisons the local wildlife leaving the lizards hungry and desperate.  A young boy is traumatized when his dog and parents are eaten by the lizards.
Years later a psychiatrist wants to take the boy back to the island so that he can confront his fears.  It seems like a good idea scientifically but the monsters are real.  Somehow the oil company controls the island but the family still owns a house there.  The two groups clash together and with the dragons.  The boy goes off on his own and turns savage and takes vengeance on the lizards.
The dragons were designed by the same man who did the dinosaurs for Jurassic Park but the great effects are not supported by the rest of the film.  Bad acting and writing pull the movie down.  The final scene of the survivors walking through town stands out like a sore thumb.  But still, it has great monsters so some will really like this film.
