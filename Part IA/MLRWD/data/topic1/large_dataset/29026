Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady... I love them and hate them. I watch them repeatedly but I frequently grow impatient and wish that the extremely familiar song was over already. I endure the songs because I love the rest of the movie. Lagaan is nearly identical to these well-recognized musicals in that respect but, as an American, I find that I have a slightly higher tolerance for the song and dance routines in Lagaan. The costumes are gorgeous; the dances are unfamiliar to me and, therefore, catch my eye. The language (I prefer to watch foreign films in the original language with English subtitles) is strange, plaintive, and well-suited to melody. On a purely aesthetic level, the movie is superb.
Moreover, the acting is good and the story engrossing. I knew absolutely nothing about cricket before I watched Lagaan but I was tense through the whole game and winced at every set-back. This movie pulls the viewer in.
Essentially, it is a sports flick in a fairy-tale. The hero forms a team from the inhabitants of his small village. Like the handy sidekicks in the Grimm fairy-tales, each of them has an ability--previously unremarkable--that helps them play the game. For example, the man who raises chickens is naturally adept at fielding the ball and the hunter (who uses a slingshot) throws a wicked fast-pitch. The British players are arrogant, ruthless, and their faces are locked in sneers most of the time, but they are not monsters. The film treats them as pompous intruders whose egos deserve considerable deflation. In tone, it is similar to The Greatest Game Ever Played (Shia LeBoef) and is equally family-friendly.
Well worth watching. Well worth owning.
