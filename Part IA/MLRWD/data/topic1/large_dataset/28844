To me what made this stand out was the story, written by someone who knew or had heard of the ins and outs and tricks of the so-called justice system. This isn't the first movie in which Matthew plays a lawyer, and there's something about him that makes him especially fitting for the part. Ryan P. has filled out a bit since I last saw him in Crash, and he seems perfect for the pretty rich boy role he was cast into. *spoiler at asterisk

Still, the plot was the main feature here. It seems to tell us that when it's all about the money, there's a lot of dirty tricks that can be used to rig the game. I don't think all of this stuff can be made up, so perhaps we've been given a glimpse into the scandals inherent in the system.

*But, what was his motive to kill from the beginning? Who was trying to frame the lawyer and what was their personal motive in doing so? Why would Ryan implicate himself in a murder? He didn't appear to be the killing type; it seemed random. Was it because his mother was a hooker (or dealt her sex for good real estate deals), and he found out, couldn't hurt her, so he takes it out on other hookers?
