this spanish film sadly tells the true story of a young sailor who while diving in the sea at his home suffers hoffific injuries, with the raging debate in the us at the moment this film examines a timely topic, his wish to die  (although he is still able to communicate) this film is a stunning acting performance by all involved, however some of the real facts have been airbrushed, firstly the scene with the quadreplegic priest is totally inaccurate (they met and had a v cordial convesation) also his sister in law is seen to be unsure about his wish to die (while in real life she was adamantly opposed) in fact everyone who supports his desire to die is seen to be smiling , understanding and intelligent, while those who are opposed are seen as ignorant , hostile and uncaring,

the climax of this film is when he and his brother have a final conflict about his request, ramon tell his brother that his is a slave while his brother retorts that in fact he is the slave and has given his life to look after ramon, this in my opinion is real motivation  roman sampedro had for wanting to end his life( to ease his familys pain) sadly this argument is not examined in this film.

however despite these points this film is a mini masterpiece and will stay in your memory for along time
