This was my favorite film from '98 and it's a modern day masterpiece of its type. I've always been intrigued by films where several characters do something that ties them together(rob a bank, kill someone, find some stolen loot, etc....) and then proceed to all turn on each other one by one. 
This film concerns three men who find a downed plane and a sack with 4 million in cash. The 3 decide to split the obviously HOT loot without turning it into the authorities. The after effects of the characters criminal actions become harsher as the film progresses and Raimi and crew do a wonderful job of slowly tightening the knot of suspense.  I think some people may have been turned off by how down-beat the tone of the film is but that's precisely why the film is so great. It's dark but appropriately so.  The film is all of a piece and I think if you give it a chance you won't be disappointed. Btw, Thornton was robbed of an oscar for this film. I think he was nominated and lost to James Coburn. He is amazing. And for once, Bridget Fonda's listless, colorless under-acting is perfectly suited. She works well with Paxton and Thornton and this is probably the best work her & Paxton have done. Although Paxton is also good in the later under-rated "Frailty". 
You don't get anything in the way of extras w/this dvd but it's worth it for the film alone. Lastly, props to Danny Elman for his wonderfully eerie little film score.
