This film is one of the best to have appeared in recent years. In the tradition of Cinema Paradiso (and just as good), this movie has a flashback style plot. One of the greatest conductors of the world recalls his life in a school for boys with problems. The movie deals with the not-so-new theme of education in 1949 Europe: traditional exaggerated discipine versus love, and the importance of trust. The new part: the fullfilment of a man's frustrated musical dreams through the conduction of a boy's chorus.

  The music?? Ah!! The music is so exquisite, it brings tears to your eyes. I bought the soundtrack as well and listen to it all the time, further appreciating the significance of the lyrics. The boy's voces are beautiful, as so are each and everyone of the characters. What differentiates this film from others which deal with the same theme (such as Mr Holland's Opus) is the director's excellence at making each and every one of the characters authentic and absolutely real. In the purest European cinematic tradition this movie deals with an ordinary theme making it extraordinary by means of excellent acting, casting and simplicity of plot: French cinema at its best! The bonus: the movie brings attention to the importance of musical education for the developmet of healthy children, and shows us once more how a correctly induced gift can end in a lifelong passion that will never make you lonely: music, music, music. He who has music needs nothing more.
