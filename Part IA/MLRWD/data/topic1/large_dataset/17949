I enjoyed these movies very much, especially the Voyage of the Dawn Treader and the Silver Chair, but I still have some reservations. I feel that the four Pevensey children were too young, and had too little screen presence and acting ability. The part of Lucy is especially miscast, which is a great pity. But the movies are very true to the books, both in letter and in spirit, and that's what matters. The simple special effects and the fur-suit animals didn't bother me. The general atmosphere is more like a high school stage play than a professional movie, but the unpretentiousness and the lack of melodrama are refreshing. There is plenty of room for the imagination to be active, which generally isn't the case in modern movies.
I totally fell in love with the ship in the Dawn Treader. It's a real ship, full size (which still means small!), strikingly beautiful, and accurately built to Lewis' descriptions, except that it doesn't have oars. A better Narnian ship could hardly have been created, even by the highest budget production. The scenes with the giants in Harfang were very well done, and many underground scenes in the Silver Chair were filmed in real underground caverns. The gentle and appealing theme music evokes, for me, the real feeling of Narnia.
Overall, even though these movies could have been improved by better casting and tauter scripts, and even though they seem embarassingly amateurish at times, somehow a little of the wonder and delight of the books still shines through.
