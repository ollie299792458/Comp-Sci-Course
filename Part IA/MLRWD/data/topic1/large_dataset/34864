This film follows a small group of colonial soldiers from different parts of the old French empire as they make their way through occupied Europe during WWII. It moves quickly from 1943 to 1945 and includes an impressive full-scale battle scene, moments of personal grief and happiness, and an impressive and saddening conclusion. Always present is the tension between the colonial soldiers and the nation whom they are serving.

You'll notice some similarity with Private Ryan, but it's a very different film. It's saying: "You made our country part of your empire and, because we resented your presence and tried to do something about it, you killed our families and said it was in the name of peace. When the Germans invaded, your resistance collapsed in 6 weeks. We heard the call and came to fight and die for you; but you wouldn't treat us as equals. You promised us a place in the history of the liberation, but you pushed us aside and gave the victors' laurels to Frenchmen. Then, when it was all over, when those of us who left our homeland and families, who lost friends and saw the terrors of war at first hand needed your help, you paid us a derisory pension which you then froze."

The French behaved towards their colonial fighters no worse than the Brits did towards the Gurkhas. Shame on them both.

The battle scene at the end it first-rate - a realistic piece, not some over-blown load of bollocks. It's a sad end to a good film.
