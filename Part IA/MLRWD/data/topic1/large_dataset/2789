Winona Ryder(Susanna Kaysen)has a borderline personality disorder from possibly being dropped on her head when she was a baby. When she has to go to a mental Institute where she meets up with Whoopi Goldberg(mental woman helper)and Angelina Jolie who was one of my favorite characters in the film. Angelina who is a sociopath has to many highs and lows without having any feelings, but anger is the main point in this movie. That's all Winona(Susanna) would mostly talk about in her journal she keeps. Angelina was so scary that it made me laugh. The people were so outgoing and wild it made me laugh, Britany Murphey also stars in this movie the one who stars in "Don't Say A Word" of 'I'll never tell, any of you.' She only eats her fathers chicken in her room and she was one of the weirdest people in there, but it was still funny. There is many curse words in this movie and drugs. The F*** word is used quite a bit, but other than that it's an excellent movie. I rated it a four because some scenes were not quite there, but I'm glad it was a long enough movie!
