So if you've read the previous reviews you already know how good this movie is. Well I will throw my 2 cents in. I loved it. I wish there was more fighting in it. Actually let me clarify, I wish there was someone to give Michael Jai White's character of "Bone" more competition in the film because he just destroys everybody. Seriously, it's crazy how many guys he runs through in the film. That said I want a sequel!!

You see this is a martial arts film with some actual heart and soul to it. The story isn't just there to get from fight to fight. It is a cliched plot, but something doesn't become a cliche if it doesn't work. But the plot only gives us a glimpse into the man "Bone" and his backstory, and I wanted more just from one line/scene in te film. Without giving anything away because they never elaborate on the issue, at some point in the past "Bone" had a twin that was mistakenly killed instead of "Bone." This left me wondering why he had a hit out on him. Also we later see he's good with a gun too, and another question arises, why is he so damned proficient at hurting and killing and why was he in jail? These questions are never answered and would make great subject matter for the sequel. Other than that this was a great film to show off exactly what Michael Jai White is capable of. So Please let there be a sequel.
