Fallen is a very good movie, however, I wouldn't classify it as horror just because it involves demons. It was more thrilling than anything and will certainly hold your interest. Perhaps there are people out there who would find Fallen to be a scary horror movie, but for me, I did not. I did thoroughly enjoy it and am delighted to have it grace my collection.

Denzel plays a detective, and we first come into the story as one of the criminals he's putting away gets executed. But the criminal is possessed by a demon (as I type this, it sounds like such a stupid idea, but it really isn't...I promise!) and the demon is a shapeshifter, meaning it has no body of its own, so it possesses the bodies of anything living and has done so for a very long time. As the demon hides out in the bodies of others, it kills and leaves identical crime scenes, trying to throw Denzel off. But he soon figures it out. And every time someone sings a certain song, you know it's the demon. This one's a toughie to explain further without ruining the intrigue of the film. For those that enjoy thrillers, the cast is great and the story will keep you entertained. Not once did I look at how much time had elapsed into the movie as I watched it. It's a good one. Enjoy it!
