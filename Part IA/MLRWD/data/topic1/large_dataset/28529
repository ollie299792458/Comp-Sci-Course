Agora was a Cinema Masterpiece, no less.  It showed the evils of religion in whatever form it takes.  The film focuses on the Christians but it shows the Hubris and self importance of all religions, "Pagan", Jew, and Christian.  They all felt that they were the chosen ones, that the others were misguided children who did not really understand the true word of God or the Gods and in this sanctimonious self righteosness they brought about a long slow slide into a Dark Age that lasted for a Millenium and destroyed almost all of the light and knowledge that man had created.  The ironic thing was that some of the "Pagan" writings were saved by the Christian Church not because they valued the widom and knowledge but because they used them to show how much more enlightened they were and how ignorant and un-enlightend the "Pagans" were.  Well at least they saved those great works for a more enlightend time.

The most dire and horrifying effect this film has is to show the shadows of our world today.  Once again our world is sliding into the darkness of religous extremism and ignorance.....this time Islam.  Once again anything that does not fit into what they feel is the "True Way" must be destroyed and once again our leadership and our societs are a bunch of spineless cowards giving in to the ignorance and darkness and masking it as "compassion", "tolerance", and that it is "inevevitable".

I hope that the world will wake up and all religions will be abolished so that God and Man can really live in peace.
