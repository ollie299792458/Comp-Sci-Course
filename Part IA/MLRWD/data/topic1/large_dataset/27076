Eschewing the well-worn path of filmed fighting and choosing to embark on a mission of spotlighting international bureaucracy, director Brank Djuric shines in "No Man's Land" at a radiance brighter than any other war movie in recent memory. 
The movie grabs its backdrop from the warm years of conflict in the so-called "powder-keg" of Europe -- the Balkans -- and thrusts two individuals from each side into a stew of regret, fighting, and an increasingly awful awareness that they are more alike each other than each had suspected.  A black comedy designed to make the viewer think more about the vagaries of war and less about the particulars of the Bosnian/Serb conflict, it deeply uncovers the fact that war has almost always been a tool for leaders, rather than simply one dispatched upon by individuals. 
Further scenes highlight a chain of humanity that is consistently broken by the forces of power politics that accompany any modern-day war. Given different circumstances and different propaganda, sharing a lager in Belgrade would not have been hard to see. 
But that is not to be. What "No Man's Land" highlights so much better than the sappy "Saving Private Ryan" or obtuse "The Thin Red Line" is that, when geopolitics are being played on a grand chessboard, it never truly will. Not many leaders really mind about the pawns.
