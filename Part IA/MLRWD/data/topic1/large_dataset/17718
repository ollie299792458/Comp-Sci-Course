I rented this last night and found it very rewarding. If one were to sit through all of the existing footage and primary source material on the WTC attacks it would probably take a decade to watch it all. We've all witnessed the fate of the people in the first two planes, the firefighters, the hopeless victims trapped on the upper floors many times over. For that reason, I will never watch a fictionalized version of anything related to the WTC. There is simply no need.

The story of those aboard United 93 has largely been overshadowed because there are no witnesses or videotapes. Actual audio has been withheld, misguidedly in my opinion, by the government. So I thought this film would be the closest thing to a factual portrayal I was going to get. And that is exactly the case. The viewer is given the opportunity to experience what the passengers experienced without a lot of emotionally manipulative moviemaking techniques. It's ordinary people on an ordinary flight.

I did feel a rush of pride during the "final charge" and that is the best memorial that could be given to these brave people. I found myself hoping they could still pull it off, even though that was obviously impossible. I got the impression from the film that the passengers got pretty close to actually taking back control of the plane. And it is suggested that had they done so, there were a couple passengers capable of operating the plane. Another two minutes and who knows? Maybe they all would have been awarded medals instead of being memorialized.

Regardless, they accomplished a great deal in saving countless lives of others and demonstrated the best of humanity in the darkest circumstances imaginable.
