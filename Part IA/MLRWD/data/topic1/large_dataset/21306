It is all to easy to live vicariously through cooking shows, scrapbooks, conversations with people who gratuitously listen but never really hear, and  work environments that only support the "company".  That being said, this movie takes all that emptyness and splendidly fills it with Queen Latifah, LL Cool J, Gerard Depardieu and worthy supporting cast.  This is a feel good, watch again movie you see with your kids (even with the few adult humor situations).  As Chef Didion (Depardieu) says about the lowly turnip, "It's not about how you start, it's about how you finish."  There are a lot more memorable lines, and it makes you think about how you live your life.

Technically, there are a few slow moments, when the pacing of the film is awkward, but the excellent and lively music track more than makes up for it.  The European film locations are eye candy, especially when the weather outside is 106 degrees.

Queen Latifah just continues to get better each time she appears on camera. The pairing of Latifah and Depardieu is magical.  One could hope that there might be a sequel.
