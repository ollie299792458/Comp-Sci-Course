With THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS Eon productions returned to the style that made the James Bond films a success in the first place.  Bond classics like FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY are the template that director John Glen and writers Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson (who also co-produced the film) used in creating a style to fit new Bond Timothy Dalton.  Dalton's performance comes straight out of Ian Fleming's 007 novels, as he re-read all of Fleming's books before filming TLD.  At times Dalton's performance echoes those of Sean Connery, but with a harder edge befitting a character who has been through as much, and come as close to death as many times as Bond has.  Dalton's Bond is professional, but cynical, while maintaing a suave persona and a subtle sense of humor.  The supporting cast is excellent as well, with Jeroen Krabbe and Joe Don Baker as particular standouts.  The story echoes the decline of the cold war, and leads Bond into a new era where the Soviets are no longer the main threat for Bond to foil (like OCTOPUSSY, TLD features a rogue Russian General acting without the knowledge of his government).  The action sequences are outstanding, and the locations are exotic (as usual), befitting a great Bond film.  The DVD includes the best picture and sound that this film has ever seen, easily surpassing the VHS and LaserDisc versions.  The special features include 2 documentaries, a "lost" scene, trailers and TV commercials, and more, making this DVD package a "must buy" even if you have already seen the movie several times.  Timothy Dalton brought credibility back to Bond as an action hero, but, sadly, he was to appear in only one more Bond film, the outstanding LICENCE TO KILL.
