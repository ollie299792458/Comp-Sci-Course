Knowing nothing but generalities about the Zodiac murders, I watched this movie with not much expectation.  The truth being I bought it because Rory Culkin was in it and am a fan of his.  It was a decent film but nothing spectacular or enlightening.  I liked the cinematography.  I thought Justin Chambers was good in the film but he and Robin Tunney seemed a bit young to have a 13 year old son; they looked more llke the people who were victims of this sadistic, sad excuse of a human being.  It's quite sad that this cold-blooded killer got his wish:  a movie or two made about his murders.  What I cannot believe is that he is still at large today which is even more creepy.  I found the movie to be genuinely suspenseful but I don't think someone as crafty as this Zodiac killer will be too impressed by it.  It's also sad that movies like this get made that really don't offer much but glorification and fear-raising.  I'd like to see a movie where this killer gets caught and pays for his crimes.
