This wonderful film has never become dated.  It is a catalogue of superlatives -- an outstanding film score (and indeed soundtrack), an outstanding cast (Alan Bates and Irene Papas were probably the two most beautiful people in the world at that time and Anthony Quinn was certainly the most charismatic actor), a stunning screenplay by Michael Cacoyannis, extraordinary sets and settings, superb photography and above all, a vivid sense of the pathetic and the ridiculous make this a film that you should watch.  You won't regret it.

The film has a few flaws.  The cinema is a medium in which dozens of characters can gleam and live for a few minutes or seconds at a time, as Fellini showed us.  Despite the profound human intimacy achieved among the principal characters, the lives of the islanders are not penetrated and their depiction as cruel, rapacious and ignorant can hardly have been atoned for by Cacoyannis's dedication of the movie "to the people of Crete."  As in an ancient Greek drama, the cast is starkly divided into chorus and a handful of characters.  More could have been achieved.

All in all, however, this was a dazzling moment in which Quinn, Cacoyannis, Bates, Papas, Kedrova, Theodorakis and others reached the apotheosis of their careers.

None of these great artists ever surpassed this glorious performance.

Highly recommended.
