I enjoyed ATM a lot.  I was originally going to avoid renting it because it had some bad reviews on here but I wanted to because I love Josh Peck and Alice Eve.  Two of my favorite actors ever!  Plus somebody had compared it to Frozen . Frozen is one of my all time favorite movies.

I don't like this nearly as much as Frozen but that's a movie I'd have to give at least twenty stars to.

ATM still deserves five stars.  It's suspenseful as hell, the killer is really creepy and the general atmosphere is just creepy and scary.  The midwest setting in the dead of winter is great.

The ATM premise is obviously a bit absurd but no more than the ski lift premise of Frozen.  What matters is the execution.  This movie is just flawless.  The acting is great all around and it was nice to see Alice Eve in a role that had nothing to do with her looks, she was almost playing a nerdy plain girl and she did a great job.

I haven't checked the director's name but I will definitely do that and be looking out for any other movies they have made.

I would even see a sequel to this.  It was a fun movie!
