The biggest problem with this movie is that its title suggests that it is the same story as the book by Susan Cooper, "The Dark Is Rising". The characters have the same names, and there are six signs of the Light to find, with the Dark in pursuit. That's about where the similarity ends. The characters themselves are different (very disappointing, since I thought that, despite obvious departures from Cooper's careful depictions of Merriman Lyon's appearance, Ian McShane could actually pull it off if given the chance) and the story itself is so different as to be almost unrecognizable. This is not a reinterpretation -- it is a different story. So, if you are a fan of the books (and you should be -- they are so very much better than this), you will have a hard time with this movie. Since I have known the Cooper story since I was a kid, it's hard to watch the movie objectively, simply as a completely different story. It feels insulting. The book The Dark Is Rising depicts an epic quest that can only be achieved with compassion, sacrifice and strength as Will Stanton grows into a perilous power. The movie The Seeker abandons all character development, featuring instead Old Ones swinging swords in slow motion and rooks exploding out of baddies' stomachs a la Alien. I would love to see Susan Cooper's The Dark Is Rising made into a movie -- this ain't it. So this movie loses one star for lying to us with the title, one star for insulting us with formulaic movie stunts and two more stars for ruining a great story.
