After purchasing volume one of the series with little disappointment, I just had to get vol. 2. I have to say that Nadesico has a certain quality to it that I haven't seen before. For one thing, it can be absolutely  hilarious and still have a deeper meaning. For another, the character  designs are spectacular, and anyone who watches anime for its artistic  quality will love this video. The main plot doesn't seem too interesting.  Just one of those "aliens attack and its up to a single ship to save  the day" series. Except that this time, they practically lose the war.  Thats probably what makes it such a cool movie. There is one part where the  captain is forced to choose between saving a collony of refugees or  sacrificing her ship. Its a very tense moment, and for some it is pretty  unpredictable. Another awesome element of Nadesico is its mecha. They are  pretty cool looking robots, nothing special, but very well animated.  Besides, they make for some funny scenes. I won't spoil the plot for you,  but really. Don't become one of Ruri's "idiots". Buy this video.  I promise you, you won't regret it.
