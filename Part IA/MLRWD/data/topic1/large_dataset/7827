I liked this movie a lot.  It's not a powerhouse, it's what I think of as a "whisperer."  I watched it months ago, and there are some particular moments that keep playing in my mind, still, because I could really feel them.  I'm far from being a Latina, but I love Latino/Mexican/Central American culture, so I watched this movie expecting it to be aimed at an audience much younger than me.  I love "Ugly Betty" and thought seeing America Ferrera in one of her movies would be interesting.  There were several mother-daughter scenes in this movie which really brought forth long-buried memories of exchanges with my own mother, moments where you realize how uncomfortable you're making your mother and you can't help it.  As an adult I realize what those moments were, and they don't seem so large and terrible now, but at the time they were.  This movie brought them back into focus and made me realize the importance of growing up, of becoming your own person, and the necessity for every daughter to have the courage to "step over" their mother and become herself.  It's interesting to watch Ana come through the process and finally realize how HARD her family works to make her able to take that step over.  On another note, I am appalled and disappointed at how many fans of Ms. Ferrera have posted on various sites that they love her, love that she's not the usual lookalike skinny stick-insect, and then finish their post with something like, "she'd be prettier if she'd lose weight."  It's mean and false.  This movie also made me go back and watch "The Joy Luck Club" again, another excellent mother-daughter reflection.
