An incredibly revealing documentary not only condemning (thru footage of what took place) the horrible violence inflicted on the Vietnamese but the inculcation of making an "enemy" in a nation far from the United States. American culture sees war as a football game.

Nothing, and I do mean nothing, has changed between then, and now. The same comparisons to the "enemy" to "fighting for freedom" are made in this film by the same people you hear say it today, some soldiers and some politicians. And then, as today, you can hear even more voices speaking out against it, and I wonder if those voices were as muted then by the media as they are today. However, they are not muted in this documentary.

At times graphic images of death are included with footage of sorties against cities and villages. At times we hear from the surivivors of these raids, and we also see them.  Particularly upsetting is a North Vietnamese man describing how his daughter was killed in a bombing raid that clearly was simply a village, this man only a grieving father. Crying out "Take her shirt back to Nixon" in Vietnamese was terrible to watch. If only U.S. Presidents could understand how innocents die in these aggressive military actions against other nations but U.S. governments seem impervious to this reality.

This is an excellent film in its own right but if you've been paying attention to whats happening in Iraq, you will watch this film and all the clips from every politician of this era (and before) and realize that, yes, what we are hearing today is the same recycled pattern of lying that proves history repeats itself.

Sad, tragic, and seemingly inevitable is war to our government.
