I am revising a review I posted earlier on Amazon due to some new information. I have been checking back every so many months to see if a special edition has been released because I feel that this film is so incredible it deserves such treatment. Even though Universal has not yet chosen to do this yet, if you love this movie you still can't go wrong with this release. Yes there are no extra features and yes the movie could probably use some remastering- however you are seeing more of the movie than you actually would have seen in the theaters. Not convinced? Read on...
Because of the great amount of confusion and ongoing debate on this topic I decided to go straight to the source and contact Universal Studios themselves and this was their answer ...:
"THE STING was shot in 1.33 but projected in a matted 1.85 aspect ratio for theatrical distribution. The full frame DVD carries the modification disclaimer for this reason. This is one of those rare cases where you actually see more picture information on the full frame home video presentation than was shown in theaters."
So there you have it. As you can see everyone is correct. It WAS shown in the theaters at 1.85:1 but FILMED in 1.33:1. Hopefully this will put an end to all the confusion once and for all. Universal has also stated at this time that they have no plans to release a Special Edition DVD so if you want to have this movie - this is it for now. If they do at some point in the future let's just hope they provide a rebate for those of us who have bought this edition.
