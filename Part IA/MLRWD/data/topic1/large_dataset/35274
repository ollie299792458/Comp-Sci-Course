Well,well Rocky IV. A real blockbuster when it came out back in '85. Although the fans enjoyed it the critics really didn't. Sylvester Stallone plays the underdog turned people's champ Rocky Balboa for the fourth time. This time the enemy is played by swedish giant Dolph Lundgren as the Russian destroyer Ivan Drago. Rocky's foe turned friend Apollo Creed has decided that he wants to fight the russian in a exhibition bout. He is awfully confident about himself before the fight,but not so much after. He is actually killed by the hard shots coming from the Siberian bull. After this Balboa is outraged and decides that he is gonna step away from the title. The fight between Drago and Balboa takes place on Christmas day in Moscow. It's a hardfought battle with Balboa being really shaken up during the fight,but luckely manage to knockout Ivan Drago in the fifteen round. I love this movie very much,maybe it's because Iam a real Rocky fanatic. I think it's only the second best sequal in the Rocky series with the third one from 1982 being the better one. It do deserve the 5 stars I have given.
