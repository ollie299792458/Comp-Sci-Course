I didn't realize this movie was that old. 1951. I remember seeing this many years ago and always thought the movie did a pretty good job of how Erwin Rommel was portrayed. I thought Mr. Mason did an excellent job in this role, and thus is why I added this movie to my DVD collection.

It really portrays how disenchanted the German generals were getting at Hitler, and starts telling of all the plots to eliminate one of the most heinous war criminals to date...Adolph Hitler. I wish the movie did more to go into detail of Rommel's career, but I think the producer's or script writer jumps around and hits the highlights of the frustration Rommel was going through. It's as if Rommel is portrayed as a man trapped in his situation and must decide the fate of his Germany to join the resistance against Hitler or ignore it. So at the end they allow him to kill himself to save his family. I believe Hitler had a higher price to pay if at that point in time Germany found out the real death of Erwin Rommel.
