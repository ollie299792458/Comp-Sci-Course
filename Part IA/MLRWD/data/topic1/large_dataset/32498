I was thoroughly prepared to dislike this film.  I had tried Dreyer's Joan of Arc and found it tedious (I'll be revisiting it soon) and had read some things about Vampyr that suggested it would be dull and confusing (like some parts of the BFI book on the film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844570738">Vampyr</a>).

I got a chance to watch it with a friend (double-billed with the Lugosi <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000035Z3K">Dracula </a> - luckily we watched Lugosi first) and I was captivated by about 5 minutes in.  The cinematography and the direction are superb - there are all sorts of little touches that unsettle you from the start.  There are a number of genuinely creepy and scary moments.

Most of all, I was simply riveted by the film - it's compellingly strange and unnerving.  There's something fascinating in almost every shot (to the point where I actually found it quite tiring to watch - I was so focused and intent on every detail).

My friend, I will add, was not as happy with the film as I - in particular the oblique story-line that doesn't really resolve (it does come to an emotionally satisfying end, but without ever really clarifying what it was that happened) and the general lack of coherent narrative were problems.  while I will grant that the film has its flaws, it was so compelling that I have to give it 5 stars.  I will probabvly watch it a second time in short order (something I rarely do).

For what it's worth, this is much more like watching a silent film than a talkie - there's very little dialogue, though there are some significant sound effects and suitable music.
