The thing about BJM is that for a wierd movie the plot holds together right through to the end.  Sometimes something Avant Garde like this gets so wrapped up in being wierd that when the credits roll you are surprised.  Not this movie - it has book ends.
There are some really funny moments in this movie.  There is a spoof on corporate videos that is fabulous, including a non-PC reference to midgets as "accursed"!  There are surealistic moments that have the edge of wierdness made easier to handle by subltle comedy.  John Malkovitch is actually quite good at having a sense of humor.  He depicts his own life as rather boring and mundane - you almost wonder why anyone would care to be him - he leads a life no more interesting than anyone elses.  However it gets interesting because of interference from the principle characters, so in a sense no one gets to be John Malkovitch because the act of observing his life changes it.
One of the major themes in the movie is puppeteering. The puppet work in BJM is fantastic.  I think it is one of the great little surprises of the movie and really enhances the enjoyment.
Overall this is a fabulous movie.
