First, this is a good action flick for when you are bored.  It has all the basics any would find in the adventure genre.

Unfortunately, some of the first "1" score reviews reflected some of my concerns.  I would suggest approaching this movie as a fiction and based on an individual group of villains, as opposed to the entirety of the worship populace of their goddess.  Not only is the depiction of Shiva being a God of Light figure and Kali being a demonic goddess inaccurate to the views of their religion, people still have this tendency to believe these stories reflect the culture.  Consequently, I warn against this.  When I watched the movie, the Thugee controversy was the least of concern when I saw what people were having for dinner in the film.  In some ways I actually  cannot blame people for thinking it negatively portrayed South Asians.

That aside, I had other critiques.  The female lead, while played well, was not my ideal character.  I also thought Lucas could have written a better movie if he actually made it like he did with Star Wars (which redeemed him in the end, as far as I am concerned).  The story would have been better if it was deliberately portrayed as being based off a myth made by him and inspired by Hinduism, as opposed to have been based off what was already established (albeit with the addendum of negative colonial propaganda and orientalism).  Not only would this remove some cultural representation (or misrepresentation) concerns, but it would emphasize his strengths.

If one can take this as what it is - a fiction - and try not to judge South Asians based on this film, I say this is a good film to watch for what it is.  I personally preferred the other Indiana Jones movies for what they had to offer as far as content goes.  I just would not would not call every German a racist Nazi (who even they had their heroes who opposed the inhumane ones).
