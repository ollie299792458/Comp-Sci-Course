I personally am one of those people who actually (gasp) likes the typical Adam Sandler humor (in reasonable dosages). Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore, and Billy Madison are all a good time in my book. But Click... it just can't make its mind up about what it is supposed to be. On one hand, it tries to be a fantasy movie with a message and deeper meaning. Typically, I don't enjoy these types of movies-- to me, they often seem full of themselves, pretentious, self-important... you get the idea. On the other hand, it tries to be a typical Adam Sandler movie, the humor and style of which just don't work for a movie with a deeper meaning. The result is that it succeeds at neither. The two simply cannot co-exist in the same movie. It tries to be and acts like it's deeper than it is, WHILE trying to incorporate Adam Sandler Humor, but the two constantly negate each other-- you can't have a deep message AND a humping dog, and the attempts to make it deep cause the humor to be of inconsistent quality and just generally lacking. It's clear Adam Sandler wants to "legitimize his career" beyond raunchy comedy by making his movies have more "meaning," but in doing so he loses the trademark humor fans go to his movies FOR, while managing to TRY to hold on to the humor and negating any "legitimate" qualities the movie might have.

In short, this movie TRIES to be deeper than it is, and TRIES to be funnier than it is, and the two cancel each other out into a big mess. Make up your mind, Mr. Sandler-- are you going to be a comedian or a "deep" actor? Choose one and do it well- stop doing both poorly.
