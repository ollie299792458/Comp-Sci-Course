Best:
1) The numerous man-to-man fight scenes (which often shifted from martial arts to fist-fighting to weapons usage) were as brutal and realistic as anything you're likely to see.
2) The 2 lead good guys (an intellectual and a fighter) share a very unique and interesting relationship.
3) The deleted scenes (especially the extended beginning fight scene) are worth watching over and over.
Worst:
1) The movie is almost all "Brotherhood" and very little "Wolf". If you're led to believe that it's a horror movie, you might be very disappointed.
2) Since it's a French movie, you'll have to accept the actor's lips not moving in sync with the spoken words (assuming you don't speak French) or watch it with subtitles.
3) The exact plot of the movie is extremely hard to understand.
4) The special features are limited to deleted scenes and the director taking about them beforehand.
Recommendation:
If you're looking for a horror or werewolf movie, you definitely will NOT want this one. If you're looking for a fight movie, where lots of people get killed and injured, then this one delivers big time. If you're looking for a mystery movie, where a 1700's detective follows clues to solve a crime, then it also delivers fairly well. Overall, I like it more with each viewing and highly recommend it.
