Most people won't agree with my assessment, but they will likely be people that only know Conan from the movies or possibly the comic books.  I read all the Conan books growing up, and this is the Conan that should have been.  It better captured his personality, as a rogue, that's fair, cunning, and relentless.  It doesn't show him to be "nice", but not a "bully".  It makes him interesting and likable, with a little more depth than punching a camel.  Conan wasn't supposed to be HUGE, but large, and athletic looking.  He was supposed to have black hair.  They still didn't give him blue eyes, but it can be forgiven.  The "bad guys" were quite appropriate for the setting, and fairly well done.  I don't feel that the weapons were grossly over-sized like I saw another reviewer say, but they weren't "authentically" sized.  This is a fantasy piece- while I suppose they could be more "realistic", I don't see that as being necessary, when you have necromancers and monsters in the story...  I hope they come out with others, but given the general reception and poor box office numbers, it isn't too likely.
