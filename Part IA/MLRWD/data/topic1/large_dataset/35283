This was The Next Genarations first movie outing,and I thought it could of been alot better.I dont hate the movie,but I think they did not need to include Kirk?I think the people who did this movie should of done there home work better.The scene that always buged me was the begining.And if you watched the TNG episode Relics then you should know what i'm talking about.Scotty was on The Enterprise B when Kirk got sucked in the Nexus.Yet in the TNG episode Relics when Scotty gets rescued by the TNG crew.Riker tells Scotty that he was Commander of The Enterprise and Scottys replied was "Kirk has come to rescue me?"Yet Kirk is supposed to be dead to Scotty.I also think it would of been nice to see Kirk aboard The Enterprise-D,I would of loved to have seen his reaction to Worf.A Klingon serving on The Enterprise!Leonard Nimoy was invited back to play Spock again and also to direct the film,I know Leonard read the script and he thought it was awful,he told Paramount he would do Genarations but he wanted a new screen play to be writen,Paramount said no,so Leonard walked away and refused to direct and star in Genarations,so Paramount wrote him out of the script.Well that's the story I heard.Well I never realy hated the movie,I did enjoy Data in the movie.The new DVD is going to feature for the first time for a Trek movie DTS sound.As well as some special features.This DVD will be alot better then the first version that hit DVD that did not have any special features not even a Theatical trailer.Well this DVD will be a treat for Trek fans and should tie people over until a First Contact Collectors DVD comes out.
