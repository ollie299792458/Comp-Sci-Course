Movies set in High schools these days are always too good to be true. These High schools the most popular person happens to be also Captain of the soccer team and Valictorium. The school's teachers seem to be like students. The school itself is big with windows and huge courtyards where 30-year olds portay teens are stuck in little "cliques" in which they are drive Lexuses.
Yet, Election shows what a High School is trully like. Now, I'm not saying that It portrays a school perfectally, but it comes close. The class rooms lack windows, the students are real students, and the general enviroment in quite similar. 
The movie also points out that it is always those people, those over achievers who do run for president of SGA, however, these same people use others to gain more. Those same people who always thinks they know more than the teacher and deserve more respect. Then the movie also shows an outcast, and also a typical popular person, an over achiever in sports, and gennerally a really nice guy.
The movie also has many "patterns". I recomend listening to the auido commentary. You pick up the connections, such as the use of garbarge in the movie.
The movie election isn't the best movie ever, but It comes close. It tells a dark comedy, and at the same time does not sacrifice the truth of High school life.
