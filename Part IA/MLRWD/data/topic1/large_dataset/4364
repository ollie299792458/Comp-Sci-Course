Wow, I was one of the few reviewers that gave Season One of Justified less than a perfect score. For me it just was'nt that great. It started out bumpy in a couple of different ways. One of the things I liked least was that each episode wrapped up a case from start to finish in a neat little bow. It lacked depth and focused more on Ray's cases he was assigned to instead of his personal relationships with the rest of the cast. For me something was missing, but as the season neared the end I thought it gained it's footing and I decided to stick with it because with a cast such as this it was bound to go places. I usually enjoy FX's series and sure enough when Season Two began we had the show I had wanted all along. This season starts out great and it never drags. Each episode is exciting and much different in that we don't focus on Ray's cases so much, but more on his everyday life. There are alot of different plots and subplots, each one explored and carried into the next week's show. The entire series feels more developed and put together. The viewer gets to meet so many interesting folks in Harland County and the characters come alive. The acting is great, Timothy Olyphant as the lead is awesome. I have always loved him since watching him in Deadwood as the town's sherriff. There is alot of intrigue for such a small town and we get to see how hard life is in a town who's industry is coal and not much else. We also get to understand how deeply family and home town ties can hold us. If you have not yet seen this series, I highly suggest you start from the begining of Season One as to get all the background.
