This is not an action film. Stallone does not blow up any buildings and Keanu Reeves does not do kung fu (thank god!)....This is an astounding film representing the drug world as it is in the present day. A docu-drama, with amazing performances by all (especially the award winning Benicio del Toro) and brilliantly directed and mostly hand-shot by Soderburgh himself, the film deserved every award and bit of acclaim it got and more!! For anyone so easily distracted by a "mind-boggling" 3 storylines, 3 different tints to the screen, and anything shiny, or who's just lookin for a movie with a perfect ending, this is not your film. Traffic brings up many interesting points about how we are dealing with the drug war, and how everyone is so easily affected. Some bash Traffic for not having a clear answer, and too much irony: Well, there is no clear answer to the drug war, watch the film and you can see that. Listen while the arrested drug-smuggler explains how things are operated, and listen as the teenagers explain how drugs are easier to get than alcohol these days. Its true, and if it makes you re-evaluate the world around you, then good, Traffic has made a start.  This is not your average movie, cast or storyline. It stands above the rest of the fast-paced, no-thought-required films of our time, and shouldn't be so easily overlooked because its not directed by Bruckheimer.
