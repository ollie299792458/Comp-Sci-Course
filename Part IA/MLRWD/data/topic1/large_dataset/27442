John Guillermin's "Death on the Nile" (1978) makes for a pleasant two and a half hours, as long as you're willing to participate in the conventions of the Hercule Poirot murder mystery as set forth by Agatha Christie.  Guillermin, who had previously worked with an all-star cast in "The Towering Inferno" (1974), effectively directs a comparable cast of luminaries here, led by Peter Ustinov as Poirot and also featuring, among others, Bette Davis, Mia Farrow, Olivia Hussey, George Kennedy, Angela Lansbury, David Niven, Maggie Smith, and Jack Warden.  The conventions that one must accept, if one is to enjoy this sort of film, include the following: 1) A murder will be committed in an enclosed space (here, a Nile River cruise boat); 2) the murderer will commit his or her crime in spite of being aware of the presence of a world-renowned detective who has never failed to solve a case; 3) virtually everyone on the boat, with the exception of said detective, will have a plausible motive for having committed the murder; and 4) all of the suspects will sit together, quietly and cooperatively, in a comfortable parlor at story's end while said detective identifies the murderer and explains how he solved the crime.  In the case of "Death on the Nile," the victim is wealthy heiress Linnet Ridgeway (played by Lois Chiles), and the motives of the various passengers on the boat range from broken love to financial self-interest.  Ustinov makes a fine Poirot, though I prefer Albert Finney's portrayal of the same character in Sidney Lumet's "Murder on the Orient Express" (1973); the rest of the cast provides solid support.  Future TV sleuth Angela Lansbury seems to be having particular fun as one of the suspects, a sex-crazed romance novelist.  The film also features gorgeous photography of ancient Egyptian sites such as the temple complex of Abu Simbel, along with Academy Award-winning costume design.  And I was impressed with how fair-mindedly Guillermin as director scattered clues throughout the film, in a manner that is faithful to the spirit of Christie's work.  If you like watching film adaptations of Agatha Christie's novels, this film should not disappoint you.
