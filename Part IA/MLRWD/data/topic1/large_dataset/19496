Halloween is a classic movie in every sense, but each sucessive sequel becomes more and contrived and less concerned with scaring us and more with  perplexing us with meaningless plot twists and wanton hokey drama.  Halloween 6 involves not relatives of Michael Myers but now semi-relatives  who happen to live in his house (which also is the third different  "Myers house" in the series). But technicalities aside the film  now intruduces a new evil culprate which is a cult of witches/warlocks who  practice Celtic witchcraft, that control Myers' violent outings. While in  the process of explaining this convoluted plot to us the movie forgets to  create any likeable characters or creative scares (it resorts to the same  old "boo" technique with the loud music). The film finally  completes it's contrived reign with the standard chase scenes, oceans of  carnage and lame one-liners. If you don't care in the least to positively  stimulate the grey matter RUN!  and get this movie!  It truly is a trashy  throw away.
