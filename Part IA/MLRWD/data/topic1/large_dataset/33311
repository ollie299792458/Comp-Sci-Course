Long after its debut, THE THING is finally getting the respect it deserves. I'm glad John Carpenter is young enough to be around to see it. This film was unfairly shunned when it came out because E.T. came out at  the same time. Nobody wanted to see E.T. killing people, hence no one went  to see THE THING.
Along with THE HIDDEN, this is one of the greatest  horror/action movies to come out of the 80s. It should be on any serious  horror fan's top ten list (it's number two on mine) and it is perhaps  Carpenter's greatest film to date. Yes, I think it is even better than  HALLOWEEN. This movie sticks closer to the original story ("Who Goes  There") that both this and the older movie THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE  were based on. The latter was more of a monster movie, whereas Carpenter's  version is more of a psychological action film with a great dollop of  paranoia. Kurt Russell and John Carpenter work so well together, and  Russell does a great job here (along with the underrated Keith David). I  hope they make more films together. Wilford Brimley, better known as the  Quaker Oats man, is terrific as well.  Actually the whole cast puts in  amazing performances. On the DVD commentary J.C. says they all were really  into their parts, and it shows. The "blood test" scene is a great  example of how well they all worked together.
The special effects in this  movie still look good. I honestly don't think they look dated at all. I  imagine that if they did this today we would be inflicted with some  dumb-looking CGI monster that would ruin the film and seem silly in a few  years' time.
If you like this one, get the DVD. It has tons of extras and  is worth the money just for the commentary by Russell and Carpenter. 10/10
