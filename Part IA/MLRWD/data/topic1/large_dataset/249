Amy Adams is a home stager who is about to move in with her doctor boyfriend of four years. Ready to take the leap - she travels to Ireland hopefully in time to ask her boyfriend to marry her on February 29 (leap year day). Of course nothing goes as planned, and she has plenty of roadblocks along the way that threaten to thwart her plans, including a surly Irish tour guide and cows galore.

This movie sounds like it might be a refreshing change of pace romantic comedy, but there is plenty of "been there, seen that" moments to give viewers a sense of deja vu.  I felt like I was watching a romanticized version of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JIOOAI">Planes, Trains and Automobiles (Those Aren't Pillows Edition)</a>" and not a good one at that.  There is little chemistry between the two leads, and even less between Amy and her long-term boyfriend. The entire story is a bit tedious and the only thing that kept me glued (other than the hope that things might get better) was the Irish countryside (though all Irish characters were a bit stereotypical).

I know that this is nit picky, but I am so tired of watching movies and television shows in which heroines travel internationally and wear impractical $600 stilettos that inevitably get muddied, soaking wet, or trudged through animal feces when the heroine eventually finds herself having to walk.  When I see one of these such travelers in an airport, I pray that they are seated behind me and the emergency life boat so they won't deflate it.

A much more believable and enjoyable fish out of water tale set in Ireland is "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000714BW">Matchmaker</a>" starring Janeane Garofalo as a cynical Boston political consultant stuck in a small Irish town during a matchmaking festival.
