That is how star Bill Pullman describes this movie, but I will tell you it is SO FUNNY! This is a real good time party movie: great humour, a few scares all with an ecological bent. The dialogue is crisp and brings all  the characters to life. The action is cool and believeable but never takes  over.
This is the story of a 30 foot croc that attracts the attention of  the law, a fish guy, a museum girl and a very rich eccentric after it rips  a beaver tagger in half. Now this disparate bunch can give lessons in  sarcasm and as you would expect they just do not get on.
But how does a  croc get to Maine? Well that is one question you have to figure out for  yourself (although there is a clue at the end). The film borrows (ever so  slightly) from Jaws and has some fantastic scenes (when the croc grabs the  bear for example).
Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt and Brendan  Gleeson play their parts straight to hilarious effect. Stan Winston's  effects are so much better than many monster movies but the prize has to go  to Betty White's Mrs Bickerman. She really steals the show.
You want to  laugh out loud - well you have got to see this!
