I really enjoyed  this movie more than any of the other Christian movies, such as Jesus of Nazereth and so on.  In this movie, Jesus is seen as more of how I would see him, as being full of life, laughter, and even likes to joke around with his disciples.  He was not seen as the always very serious and somber type who never smiles, like in all the other movies that were made about him.  However, there are some parts I don't agree with, like the devil coming to him in the garden the night he was captured.  That is not in the Bible!  It was a good angel that came to give him comfort.  Also it shows the devil showing himself as a beautiful woman tryging to entice him when he was fasting for 40 days and nights, which is not mentioned in the bible and according to the bible,(the part about the devil being a woman  that is) Jesus picked his disciples to come follow him, they did not pick him, such as the first two in the movie, who asked to be his followers.  Anyway, except for a few things that I don't quite agree with since it is not in the Bible, I love how his personality is portrayed in this movie and don't like the other movies anymore, with him always being so somber and never smiling.  The good Lord is a happy person and full of laughter!  That is more of how I see Jesus!
