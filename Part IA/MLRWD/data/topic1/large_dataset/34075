I was lucky to attend the festival in Dallas this summer.  While the songs selected for the DVD aren't always the ones I would have picked (Buddy Guy blew everyone else away, but he is conspicuously absent except for the ensemble numbers), this is nontheless sure to be a great DVD.  Clapton was brilliant as usual, Santana was fantastic and ZZ Top were their usual eccentric selves.

John Mayer, Jonny Lang and Robert Randolph were all excellent newcomers in the mostly over-50 lineup.  Jimmie Vaughan and his Tilt-a-whirl band served as a fantastic houseband, backing up the many blues legends on hand.

Some disappointing omissions ... Robert Randolph's "I Need More Love" ,a surprising show-stealer on the second day of the festival is not listed.  Same with John Mayer's "Come Back To Bed".  Styx put on a surprisingly good set of cover tunes, from the Beatles' "I Am The Walrus" to BB King's "The Thrill Is Gone".  Also, Eric Clapton's set on the third day included a nice selection of songs from his new album of Robert Johnson covers that are omitted here.

That said, I still pre-ordered my copy as soon as I saw it announced.  They could have made it a four disc set with more material and doubled the price and I still would have bought it.
