There seem to be several versions of "Nosferatu" available - this is a review of the one streamable on Netflix.  The film itself is a testament to Max Schreck and his makeup artist - with his spidery fingers and bat-like face, the actor convincingly terrifies the other characters and the viewers, merely by showing up on screen.  It's not a great leap to the idea in "Shadow of the Vampire" from a few years ago, that Schreck was a real vampire, and "Nosferatu" was actually a documentary.

One problem is the image.  The black-and-white cycles between magenta, blue, brown, and green, for no apparent reason.  One explanation I have heard is that this was the only way to show night scenes, since the cameras and film of the time could not capture images in low light.  If that's the case, I see nothing lost by restoring the film with corrections to the gamma and highlights, to give the correct impression of whatever lighting level each scene is supposed to be portraying.  I'm not saying to colorize it - just to remove the spurious color that serves no function for a modern audience, if it ever did.

I could have overlooked this - it's somewhat distracting, but no more so than the lines, threads, and other flaws in the film stock.  It is, after all, a 90-year-old movie.  What ruins it is the music.  The "modern classical" score is not only inappropriate overall, but ludicrously upbeat in several serious scenes.  Music is so integral to film, especially silent film, that the choices made here are inexcusable.  This landmark film deserves better, and apparently has received it in other versions.

"Blow your nose, Feratu!"
