When I first saw the trailer for Person of Interest last summer, I couldn't wait for the first episode. I had a gut feeling this show was going to be very special. And it is...so very special. First, anything produced by J.J. Abrams is something that must be watched. Then the actors. Jim Caviezel is mesmerizing as Reese. He may not say much at times, but he can express more in his face and eyes than most actors can in words. When he spoke to the serial rapist at the end of one episode, it was gut wrenching. Then you have Michael Emerson the emmy winning actor from Lost. He is just a thrill to watch. He has inhabited his character, Harold Finch, so well that you want to grab him and say "OK. Tell me your secrets." And then you have Taraji Henson. She's not just a cop. She's a strong, interesting woman who has had to make some tough decisions in a man's world. And last but not least is Kevin Chapman, Det. Fusco, or "fiasco" as one character called him. The perfect name for a very imperfect, corrupt cop who will turn on Reese if he can get away with it. But he certainly has major problems of his own. All of these characters are so well written, amazingly complex, and wonderfully acted. This is the finest new show that has come to television in a number of years. And I'm so happy to be around to not only watch it and thoroughly enjoy it every week, but to express to everyone associated with it, congratulations!
