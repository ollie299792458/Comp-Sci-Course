Finally, comes a director brave enough to make an experience that can conclude the entire atmosphere of the SF Warehouse rave scene in 86 minutes of aurally exciting, brain-moshing joyride into the eye candy that is 'Groove'.
Taking a major risk, Greg Harrison made the ultimate movie experience about raving in the U.S, something which isn't easy to accomplish considering what "Go" and other movies failed to portray. Greg did this simply enough with the aid of unknown cast, low budgeting, amazing editing and filmography and of course, The entire cast of the best-known DJ's, which, for the first time in movie history, get to demonstrate what it's really like to actually spin vinyl.
Never has a movie shown before what a DJ feels right before he punches the "Crossfader" knob and makes magic. The hesitations, the careful listening and cueing of the record, and of course, fear of rejection. DJ's finally get recognized for their skills in this movie, from the rookies to the big shot DJ's such as Digweed.
Highly reccomended alongside the british portrayal of the same kind, "Human Traffic".
