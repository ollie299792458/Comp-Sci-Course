As others before me have said, LXG has recieved a lot of undeserved negative reviews. I went along, and I had never read the book before, or seen any movies or the like. I came out of the theatre itching to go see a sequel (As they left room for one) The special effects were of the same standard as the Matrix, and the characters were portrayed beautifully. I especially liked Mina Murray, (Played by Peta Wilson ... I think) a damsel fallen victim to Dracula. Sean Connery played his character to be plausible of such wonderful feats and even the Invisible Man was a clever adaptation. The special effects, as I said, were that of Matrix standard, particulary the detail of the effects, eg. being able to see the other side of the Invisible Man's mask, and the other, bigger effects. I won't give away the plot, there are some flaws with it, but they were masked by the wonderful performance of the actors. I thought that the collection of legendary characters in the one film was a fantastic idea. 
Just a quick run down of the characters - 1) the hunter, Allan Quartermain
2) Dorian Gray, the undead
3) The Invisible Man AKA Skinner
4) Mina Murray, the widowed Dracula victim come feminist
5) Captain Nemo, the transportation and sword specialist
6) Tom Sawyer - the die hard, trigger happy Yank
7) Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde, the bad turned good, half evil, half angellic (You don't QUITE know what he is) do-gooder
and the resident evil 8) the 'Phantom'
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and recommend it to people ages 3 and up, *It's on my box* (Toy Story) Seriously ... no one younger than 10, as there are some pretty dark scenes
