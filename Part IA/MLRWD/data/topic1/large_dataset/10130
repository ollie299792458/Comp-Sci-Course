This show is based off of the events of the first Gungrave game and manga by Yasuhiro Nightow the creator of Trigun.

 This is a truly amazing series. While in the game you have a sense of what is going on but you don't know all the events before it. This has all the action of the game and more background story into Harry and Brandon's past.

 Brandon Heat and his best Friend Harry MacDowell are the point men for a small time street gang. However when the big brother of a rival gang's leader returns to town Brandon and Harry's lives change forever. After the deaths of their friends and the uncle of Brandon's girlfriend Maria they join the mafia. Once inside working for the criminal organization Millenion Brandon realizes that Maria is now being taken care of by Millenion's leader Big Daddy.

 Brandon Heat is the strong silent type he doesn't say much but he doesn't have to say anything to get his point across. The show takes place during Brandon's rebirth as Beyond the Grave and has many good quality action seens this dvd is worth picking up. It moves kinda slow at first but the excellent storyline and later episodes make up for it.
