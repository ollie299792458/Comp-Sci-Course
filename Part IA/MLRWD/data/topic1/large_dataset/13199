While the other reviewer of this DVD felt that there was a 'world of knowledge' contained in this disc is a matter of conjecture.

As an above average guitar player (blues, R & B, classic rock)who still relies on my fret markers periodically, but, and this is important, who doesn't read music but does understand basic music theory, there is little I could glean from this DVD as presented. There is no question that Bruno is incredible and his approach to scales appears to have considerable merit.

But he does not really 'teach' you what he is doing. His guitars have no fret markers and while I can follow him in slow motion as anyone probably could who understands the fret board, I am afraid this disc is only for the acomplished and those looking for a thoughtful approach to Jazz guitar.

Before he even gets to the basic chord voicings you have to buy into and learn his approach as a prerequiste. Had I known that and had I been prepared to spend months with this DVD (which I was not) I would not have bought it.

If you are really serious about Jazz guitar and want an interesting approach and you understand music theory and can read sheet music, then this might work for you.

Otherwise stay away.

I was looking for some further Jazz guitar chord voicings such as Aaron Stang (this guy is good) teaches in a couple of his dvds, to interject into the form of blues I am gravitating toward.

This wan't the disc and frankly was a waste of my money.

My mistake, I bought into what the guitar teacher's review said, but it was beyond me or the time I was prepared to devote to it.

There is a lot of good material out there of the 'here's how to do kind and why'. If that's what you are looking for then stay away. I want my money back but that isn't going to happen!

I feel I was misled, but that's my problem.
