Cinderella is a story of a young girl who's only living family left is her (mean) step-mother and (equally rude) step-sisters.  Cinderella is forced to be the housekeeper, cook, chore girl, etc.  She takes care of all needs of the step-family.  Her only friends are the animals she takes care of, except for Lucifer, the mean old cat.
It is made known that the Prince is looking for a bride.  The animals help Cinderella by creating a beautiful gown from an old dress.  When the step-sisters become jealous of how beautiful Cinderella looks, they rip her dress to shreds and leave her to stay home while they attend the ball.  This is where Cinderella's Fairy Godmother steps in and creates a nite worth remembering for her.
I hesitate to say anymore for fear of ruining the movie for you!  This is a Disney classic that should be in every family's video library.  My 2 girls, ages 4 &5, love this movie! After watching it, you'll find them in their room, dressed up, pretending to be Cinderella for days!
Wonderful family movie!
