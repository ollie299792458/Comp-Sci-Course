Meet the Parents is a hilarious movie that parallels the relationship between a typical father/future son-in-law when they first meet. The movie takes place as the daughter and future son-in-law visit the parents for a family wedding. Laughter abounds as Ben Stiller, who plays the future son-in-law Greg Focker, encounters one disastrous event after another. Focker feels he must fit in with the family and impress the father, Jack Byrnes, so he can marry his daughter, Pam. The role of the father is played expertly by Robert DeNiro.  He is a C.I.A. agent and an overprotective father who only wants his daughter to marry the right man. Pam played by Teri Polo, is in love with Greg when she goes with him to visit her parents, but that love is severely tested as Jack continually makes mistakes such as losing her father's cat and then bringing home an imposter cat. The funniest scene in the movie is one in which Greg, eager to please the family, offers to open a bottle of champagne, and ends up knocking an urn holding Jack's mother's ashes on the floor, at which time the beloved family cat urinates on the ashes.  Things only get worse for Greg. This movie is sure to make you laugh.  Stiller and DeNiro's roles are classics.
