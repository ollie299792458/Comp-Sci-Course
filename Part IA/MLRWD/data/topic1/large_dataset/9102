Film Noir never had it so good: "Mildred Pierce" combines the toughness of the Cain novel; a gutsy cast delivering knock-out performances; and at the center of it all one of cinema's great hard-shell dames, Joan Crawford.
Do not be mislead into thinking this is essentially a "women's picture" of the sort typically ground out by Hollywood during the 1930s and 1940s.  Given that the story concerns a woman who must find her own financial way after a bitter divorce, it may have a special appeal for women as a group--but let's face it, Joan Crawford ain't your average wife and mother, and while Mildred Pierce may engage our sympathies she ain't exactly a "little woman" stereotype herself.
As noted, the plot revolves around Mildred/Joan's need to make her way in the world--but more to the point, her need to endow her daughters, particularly eldest daughter Veda, with all the best that money can buy.  (Never mind, of course, that Veda is clearly a man-hungry, social-climbing little serpent dripping poison from both fangs.) And if that entails kicking out the husband, playing house with a society heel, or even... just possibly... murder... well, then so be it.
The cinematography is light-and-shadow film noir classic; the production values are first rate throughout; and Joan and company deliver enough double-dealing spirit to make "Mildred Pierce" a vastly entertaining ride.  And if you ever wondered what made Crawford one of the great stars of her era... Mildred Pierce will show ya and how!
