With the emergence of the DVD format, the BBC finally had a chance to do right by the Doctor.  And they owe him big time!  After all, it was the BBC's desperate hunger for shelf space that deprived us of dozens of classic stories from the show's sixties heyday.  Treasures wiped clean by bureaucratic short-sightedness.  Heavy sigh.
But here they go again, releasing episodes piecemeal, cherry picking the supposed "good" ones and never getting around to what the Doctor deserves:  a full release of all available material.  A release, by the by, that DVD would be perfect for.  Imagine a disc with surviving clips from all deleted Hartnell and Troughton stories as a bonus.  Or with full episodes from incomplete serials that still exist but haven't yet seen video release; from "The Reign of Terror" and "The Faceless Ones," for instance.
But no.  Instead, we'll get three episodes this year.  Then maybe three more next year.  And I will have shuffled off this mortal coil by the time the BBC gets around to releasing "The Invisible Enemy" or -- fervent wish -- a complete "Invasion of the Dinosaurs."  Yes it does exist...P>The Doctor deserves a little respect.  And we fans would like to be able to watch the series within our brief, non-Time Lord lifespans.
