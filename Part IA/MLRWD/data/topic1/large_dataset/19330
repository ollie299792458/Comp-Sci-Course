This is the Mame movie! I will review the Lucille Ball version under that movies heading. For anyone that has read  the book this is the version for you. Rosalind Russell is perfectly cast in this roll.  She is the quintessential Mame. Her clothes and overall attitude is just perfect. Forrest Tucker is the perfect southern gentleman to see the misplacement of Mame in the department store. While I liked Coral Browne as the "First Lady of the American Stage" I will admit that Bea Arther was better (alas for this movie she was a bit young to play the part as she was only 35).  Peggy Cass made for a lovable Agnes Gooch. Roger Smith played a very good looking and very believable "Aryan from Darien."  The sets are just right, grand but "real."  All in all this movie held true to the feel and tenor of the book. Read the book and you will find several situations that Rosalind Russell would have been wonderful at pulling iff but it NEVER would have made it past the studio censors! Watch Auntie Mame enjoy it... do not compare it to Mame... its like watching West Side Story and saying its better then Romeo and Juliet. They are different movies and can be enjoyed separately!
