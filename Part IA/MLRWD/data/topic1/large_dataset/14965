I didn't get this DVD yet, rather I just ordered it.  Up until about one year ago,  I had never, ever seen a James Bond movie,  and had not interest in seeing one either,  it just was not my thing.  Then, one cold night (about 1AM) in January of "05" I was bored and nothing was on TV.  I somehow ended up on AMC, and they happened to be running a James Bond movie marathon.  The movie I happened upon was this one, Dr No.  the movie was about a third of the way through,  but for some reason, I was captivated,  and could not stop watching...  This movie seriously rocked,  and it from my guess anyways was about 30 or 40 years old!!  Not to mention, I only saw half of the movie.  A few days later I saw it was on again, and this time saw the whole thing,  again,  I was just blown away!!  This was a great movie,  and I am not a movie person.  Getting a root canal was higher on my list of things I would rather do than watch a movie from the 60's! But this was a turning point for me.  The marathon lasted the whole week and I was able to see many more Bond films. Some of my other new favs were, Goldfinger, Live And Let Die, MOONRAKER (my next addition to my DVD collection!!), View To A Kill, and Diamonds Are Forever ( I love the two homo's).  Like I said,  I am not a movie person,not by a longshot.  Never had an interest in this sort of thing before.  But I just cant get enough of James Bond.  I can't wait to get my Dr No DVD.  Rest assured,  this DVD will be getting played every night and as often as possible.  One of the things I like about these Bond movies is how many different sub plots and layers there are to these films.

  I just cant wait.

  As I said in my opening line,  IF YOU ONLY SEE ONE JAMES BOND MOVIE,  THIS IS THE ONE!!!  You will be hooked on James Bond!
