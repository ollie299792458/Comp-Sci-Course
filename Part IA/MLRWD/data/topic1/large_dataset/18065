Clark Gable felt that this was one of his best films; it was.  Marilyn Monroe was indeed a great actress; this film proves it.  John Huston was one of the finest directors in history; this film is a part of that legacy.  It was very much 'ahead of it's time', so several critics didn't understand it. Gable's unexpected death also played a part in what became very mixed reviews in 1961.  But time has a way of 'catching up' with things, and today, "The Misfits" is regarded as a genuine Classic.
I remember seeing it in the mid-'70's at the Harvard Square Theater in Cambridge MA.  The theater was jam-packed, and the mostly college-age-audience broke into the film several times with appplause; most notably at the scene where Monroe screamingly denounces the men as "Liars! All of you, liars...".  At the end of the film, there was a second of almost-stunned silence, before the place exploded into thunderous cheers and applause.  The film was shown several times while I lived in the area (I always brought friends to see it), and the reaction was nearly always the same, as time was beginning to catch up with "The Misfits"...and the legend continued to grow...
Mention should also be made of the great Montgomery Clift, brilliant in one of his finest portrayals; Eli Wallach, eerily intense as Guido, and the always-wonderful Thelma Ritter.  They're all magnificent.
Even today, as new friends come into my life, they always get a DVD copy of "The Misfits" (though many already know & love it) for Christmas or birthday, and the reactions are usually "Gable was fantastic!" or "Marilyn really WAS a great actress!"
Thanks to the miracle of home-video & DVD, time has finally caught up with the brilliance of "The Misfits".  It's time everyone did.
