WHOA, yes, I said it! Not that I don't love Romeo and Juliet, but it's nice, now and then, to see a pair of lovers who are NOT dysfunctional teenagers. Maybe it's just because I've recently watched such excellent but frustrating tragedies as Wuthering Heights and Tess of the D'Urbervilles, but this movie was SUCH a breath of fresh air. Both John and Lorna are honest, assertive, and genuinely kind, so there are none of the usual games with characters serially lying to one another until you'd just rather they not get together at all - you ROOT for these two. I know that many people out there will say that Carver is hot/pitiable and if bad boys are your thing, then by all means, enjoy. If, however, you've thought the recent selection of BBC romances somewhat devoid of likable protagonists, I highly recommend Lorna Doone.

I do have a whole host of complaints about the actual execution of this film, which is why it gets only four stars instead of five. The pacing is uneven at times, the action is filmed in such a way that can make it hard to follow, and there are not enough close-up reaction shots during the meatier scenes (just my opinion). Furthermore, this DVD version is most unfortunately NOT widescreen, and it's painfully obvious when beautiful moments are interrupted by the realization that half of a character's face is off-screen. Even so, the excellent story and appealing cast make this DVD well worth owning.

So the next time Romeo and Juliet, Heathcliff and Cathy, or Angel and Tess get you down, watch Lorna Doone instead, and you'll remember that some fictional characters still demonstrate the best in humanity.
