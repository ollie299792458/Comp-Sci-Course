The comercials showed helicopters.  The posters and trailers and production stills showed helicopters.  I saw images of hundreds of dragons torching large buildings.  The previews and comercials led us all to believe that this move took place in the present day or near future where dragons appeared and laid waste to our civilization, massive battles between a modern army and an ancient race.  This is what I wanted to see.
  Instead I got a two or three minute filmreal of still photographs of magazine covers showing dragons burning stuff.  Pretty much all the same stuff they had put into a half dozen TV commercials.  The posters and DVD case show multiple helicopters in the air. In the movie there was only one helicopter and it didn't even have guns on it.  There was none of the destruction or fighting that the trailers promised.  Only the aftermath of dragons, burned out barns and scorched rocks and such.  Not to mention that there was never more than one dragon on the screen at a time unless they were so far away they could have been crows or other small birds.  This movie is a total let down.  I'm not going to buy the dvd and frankly I want my eight dollars back.  This movie could have been great.  All it needed was a little more carnage, some cool explosions and multiple helicopters like it showed on all its advertising.
  Save your money or buy something else.
