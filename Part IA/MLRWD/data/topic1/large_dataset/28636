What is it about English dubbing businesses?  why can't they do it right.
You see it time and time again,  when an excellent foreign language film is killed by sloppy, insensitive and frankly piss poor standards of translation, and it's not just translation, but the whole tone of the film is changed  (for the worse) it is quite obvious that the people whose voices are used for the English translation are not proper actors  ......or if they are they are the worst examples of actors one could hope to come across. They deliver their lines in a stilted overly formal & completely at odds with what is on the screen.  It's quite obvious to anyone watching it that the original dialogue was delivered naturalisticly using the vernacular of the street & in sync with the environment, the dubbed version comes across like it was recorded in some second rate studio.... completely ruining the film.
In other countries famous American actors in US films or always dubbed by the same competent actor.  The dubbing is professionally done so as not to break the illusion. Why can't American dubbing companies do the same for foreign films?
