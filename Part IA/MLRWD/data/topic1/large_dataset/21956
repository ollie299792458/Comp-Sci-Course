If you're looking at this you probably know Satch and his music. I saw this tour in two different venues and this is similar. Small, intimate, and up front. Though the True HD 7.1 is good, I think the small venue tended to suck up some of the sound. All in all the mix is good but the surround rear channels don't do too much except filler. The video is clear and unsaturated and for the most part top notch. Some camera shaking here and there but not overly annoying. Song selection is OK but we all have favorites we'd rather hear and see.

The only negatives for me are...3D...not sure why he bothered. Haven't watched it and probably won't. And...

A: Keyboards....eh....Mike Keneally is competent enough but just not sure how much it lends to Joes repertoire.
B: Alan Whitman....even less of an eh...Sort of reminds me of Glenn Hughes. Just as an annoying stage presence only not as good.
C: Galen Henson...just never seems happy to be there. Sort of the bastard step child of the band.

Joe and Jeff Campitelli put in great performances as usual. These two have played together for a while now and it shows. They definitely make the show.

If you're a Satriani fan. Buy it. You'll like it.
