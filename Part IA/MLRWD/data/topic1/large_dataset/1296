I've never understood why critics who dislike this movie comment how the movie doesn't capture the humor displayed in the book.  I disagree.  I think this is an extremely well-made movie, adapts the book wonderfully (though it doesn't cover the ashes part of the title)and one powerfully acted, designed, scored (wonderful John Williams score) and directed movie.  If I had two nitpicks it's that the three Franks don't look like they'd be the same person and the dead horse looks odd, but the latter is on screen for seconds and each one of the Franks are excellent in their own right.  There's no wishing any of the other Franks were still playing the role.  As soon as the years progress and we see a new Frank, the actor makes us forget the other two until the touching Eclipse scene.  What I found interesting this year is finding faces I recognize from Ballykissangel (the superb BBC series).  The entire movie may seem episodic but it goes full circle and I dare anyone to watch it without shedding a tear or two.  But back to the humor issue, this film balances the hearbreak and the humor fantastically.  I would highly recommend this movie.
