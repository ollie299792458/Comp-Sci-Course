I enjoyed watching Hogan's Heroes when it was originally shown on network television. I was glad to see it is now available. The set I received must be the culmination of each season released separately. I say that because each season is packaged differently and has different pre-show things shown. And, these pre-show things, including the listing of episodes on the disk, are very, very, very loud. I learned to turn off the sound until an episode has actually started.

Each episode is funny, as expected. The Big Three, Klink, Shultz and Hogan, played their parts so well (hard to believe all three are now gone). Their characters never got old for me. It is still fun to watch the cautious friendship both Shultz and Klink form with Hogan.

What did surprise me is, when watching an entire season in a short amount of time, how each episode seems to be pretty much the same as prior episodes. It is also interesting to note all of the guest stars throughout the series, knowing what eventually became of the actor/actress.

I am glad I ordered this set.
