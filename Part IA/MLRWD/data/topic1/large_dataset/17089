"Nosferatu" is a wonderous example of what an innovative, imaginative filmmaker can do with a worn out formulaic idea. Werner Herzog injects his film with poetic imagery and a amazing restraint in telling the  tale told in the original 1922 version. Klaus Kinski is a pathetic,  pale-faced, recreation of the character made famous by Max Schreck. He is  eccentric, educated, and diabolically evil at the same time. The film moves  at a slow, ponderous pace, that draws one in with its' melodic and well  filmed sequentially staged scenes. The film is not for those expecting a  loud, obnoxious, "Lost Boys" or "Interview With The  Vampire" type storytelling. It is a strange type of art form that will  hopefully be eventually seen as the classic that it is. The DVD  presentation is excellent, both the original German Language version and  the lesser English language version are contained on the disk. There is  also interesting commentary by the director in which he points out many  similarities between the earlier version and his. The film is also  letterboxed, presenting the entire scope of beautiful and horrific images.  "Nosferatu" is simply a great film that those looking for a  change of pace from the usual should see.
