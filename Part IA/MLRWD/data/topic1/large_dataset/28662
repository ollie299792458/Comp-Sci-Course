The movie was good, but not great.  For non-horse people; they'll think it's wonderful.  For the horse person, who knows the story of Secretariat; they'll see all the flaws. For one, Penny Chenery was not present at the birth of Secretariat.  For another, the movie makes you think she was thrown into the world of horses with Secretariat.  Not the case, she was into it before that.  Does anyone remember Riva Ridge, the horse she had the year before Secretariat?  He won the Kentucky Derby and The Belmont in 1972.  She loved Riva Ridge. Sham's owner was not the jerk that Disney made him out to be, and Lucien Laurin was not the colorful, outlandish person they made him out to be, either.  And filming Secretariat's Triple Crown - Belmont win at Keeneland had no comparison to Belmont Park which is huge.  And what was with the gospel song when he won it.  I wanted to be swept away with emotion when he won that race. It was such a monumental victory that one needed to cry tears of joy. Instead I got a gospel song.  Don't get me wrong; Keeneland is a beautiful racetrack, but it's not Belmont or even close.  All in all, it was just good, unlike Seabiscuit that brought all the emotion and greatness of this horse to the screen so you could feel it.
