Viewers and reviewers of "Pan's Labyrinth" have either blessed or cursed the entwining of its two different worlds.  The arguments on both sides seem based on the expectations brought to the film.

My own childhood's difficult search for personal significance recognizes a taste of the familiar in Ofelia's entry into her mythical world.  The film's bittersweet aftertaste, a persistent sensation the day after seeing the film, calls up this perspective.

The film's violence provides context in showing that a powerful sense of significance can overcome even the fear of death.  Both the hidden Revolutionaries and Franco's soldiers view the danger they face as the price paid for their own significance, as defined by their separate causes.

Captain Vidal reaches back for the significance he failed to achieve from his strict father, and forward to the lasting significance that his unborn child would carry into the future.  In the end, his own actions of repairing his father's stopped timepiece and the final results of his brutality - which deny him even the memory of his name - leave his quest unfulfilled.

The myth of the Lost Princess shows Ofelia the path to her own significance.  As a child in war time, she will not find that path in the brutal world around her.  Only in a separate world, where her virtues of courage, ingenuity and resolve have consequence, can she achieve her quest.

And in the last moments of the film, we are assured that she does.
