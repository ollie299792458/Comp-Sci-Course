The Premise: Kate Hudson works for a fashion magazine, and as research for her column she has agreed to hook a man and then drive him away in 10 days by making the common 'mistakes' that many women make in dating. Unbeknownst to her, the man she gets is Matthew McConaughey, an ad exec who has been challenged by his boss and competitors at work to make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days or less. See? One wants to wreck it at all costs, one wants to save it at all costs. The wackiness is supposed to ensue.

Why It Doesn't Work: This type of set-up forces two very amiable stars to behave like nitwits for the entire film. By the time they inevitably discover that each was deceiving the other, you haven't developed any sympathy for either character. You don't care if they get past it and end up together. If just one was deceiving the other, you'd have a place to make your emotional connection to what's happening, and it doesn't even necessarily preclude you from ending up liking the deceiver (especially if he or she is being deceptive for reasons beyond their control). Here, however, they're both being extraordinarly callous about the feelings of another human being, for pretty flimsy reasons. After awhile, rather than sucking you in, it just starts to piss you off.

McConaughey's a very likeable star, and I'm crazy about Hudson. I'm inclined to like any movie she makes. This one, though, just makes ya try too hard. It's flatter than a pancake.
