This was a good movie. Intriguing storyline, impressive cast, believable (and likable) characters, plenty of excitement, and even a subplot of romance. Admittedly, not all of the "very bad weather" that earned it the PG-13 rating was completely realistic...but what can you expect? CGI animation was still very new at the time.
However, there's one problem: The movie was edited for length. Most of what was deemed nonessential was still another entire subplot--one involving the rival storm-chaser team (led by Cary Elwes, playing an antagonist who's not quite evil enough to be called a villain) and revealing their actual agenda.
But the editors didn't entirely succeed at what they attempted to do--that is, cut out the entire rival storm-chaser team apart from Elwes and Zach Grenier. 
Which is why there are a few scenes that involve Abraham Benrubi (the only other actor from Elwes's team whose name I can recall right off the bat) looming imposingly behind Elwes, or some other fresh-faced thirtysomething smirking in the background. Their characters have names, and are listed fairly early in the end credits...but they seem to be little more than walk-ons. If a Director's Cut of this movie is ever released, I want it.
