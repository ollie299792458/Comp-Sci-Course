I first came across this work when it was showing at the IMax theaters in Southern California.  It is very interesting to all ages because of the technology and how it was accomplished several hundred feet below the ocean.

I wanted a video because I wanted my 8 year old Granddaughter to be able to see what I saw when I attended the movie in 2004.

What is left of the Titanic has been eaten away through the years of being at the bottom of the ocean.  However, we were able to see some hats and items left on dressers in the various state rooms that had an open door.

Two men designed and built what they called "BOTS", small crafts that carry 1 or 2 people lying down with a trailing lifeline.  These Bots could then travel through the ship viewing what is left in certain areas.

The colors of the ocean down deep are truly beautiful and the detail is explained very carefully by the voices of the two men as they go down into the deep and enter the ship.

I recommend this video because of the tremendous information that is shown starting with when the ship left the port in England and traveled to Ireland then across the ocean to where it sunk after hitting the large chunk of ice.
