Well, this is a really hard movie to review because I have such mixed feelings.  Disney is known for taking liberties with many stories and basically changing them to the point that they are almost unrecognizable and this is no exception.  Any time my children hear the original storybook version of a story Disney has made into a movie they say things like, "That's not how it happened in the movie."  Snow White, Cinderella, Sword in the Stone, to mention just a few, but the absolute worst was Pocahonas since that was history they were messing with!  Back to The Black Cauldron. They have totally changed so many things that if you know the story you may very well be sickened by what they have done to the story and it's characters.  On the other hand, if you go into this with no previous knowledge, it's a wonderfully animated, fun story to be watched again and again.  My children have read the Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexander and although they immediately noted many discrepancies, they still thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I guess what it comes down to is this.  If you can watch it through the eyes of a child without expectations of acuracy, you'll probably really enjoy this movie, but if you're expecting Lloyd Alexander's novels on screen don't bother with this one.
