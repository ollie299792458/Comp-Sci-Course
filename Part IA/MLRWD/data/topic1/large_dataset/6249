In an age where everyone and their mother knows the basic plotline of JAWS and has seen this classic at least half a dozen times, I was very disappointed when I picked up this Collector's Edition to discover that half of the supplemental documentary was excised. These days, seeing 2-disc special editions is a norm, but back in 1998, more than one disc in a package was unheard of. So in order to be able to cram the entire movie, trailers and the documentary onto one single disc, the phenomenal 2-hour making-of documentary (directed by Laurent Bouzereau) that was produced for the JAWS: SIGNATURE COLLECTION Laserdisc in 1995 was condensed to a 50-minute "featurette." I really, really hope Universal takes heed to the cries of foul from the fans and re-releases this title one day as a 2-disc set, restoring many wonderful recollections that were cut out of the DVD's documentary (including Roy Scheider's recollection of the infamous night the entire cast and crew had a massive food fight and then all jumped into a resort pool to wash themselves off). Luckily, I still have my original laserdisc set and can see this documentary in all of its nostalgic glory. I'm very surprised Spielberg let them cut that much out, but being released in 1998, it was still the birth of DVD and thus forgiveness can be bestowed. This is why I give four stars out of five...four stars for the film masterpiece, zero stars for the extras. Universal, please give us fans what we want! Restore your original grand homage to one of the great contemporary cinematic classics!
