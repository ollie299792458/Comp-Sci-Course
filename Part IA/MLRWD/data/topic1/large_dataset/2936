This movie had some great special effects and I still love the gang from Hogwarts, but it was also very disappointing.  The story was shortened so badly that elements that should have been emphasized got lost in translation.  If you read the book you could probably follow along, but I feel sorry for those people who just wanted to see the movie.  Too many things weren't explained.

The dreams that Harry had about the ministry of magic were a key element in the story, yet they were barely shown in the film.  The attack on Mr Weasley and the "hunt" for the prophecy were much too vague in the movie, yet the prophecy and Voldemort's desire for it was the key point of the story.

At Hogwarts, the appointment of Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor, and later as the replacecment for Dumbledore, was also a key story line.  She banned groups of three or more students from meeting, which is why they needed a secret place to train together.  She didn't want them to learn defense, so she taught them the book.  She passed one decree after another making life miserable for the stundents, yet that was relegated to simply showing Filch hanging one frame after the other.

This movie had very little impact on the understanding of the continuing story of Harry, Hermione and Ron.  The important of the OWLS for the students was downplayed, as was the intense scrutiny of the teachers by Umbridge and her dismissal of Trelawny.  Let's don't forget about the departure of the Weasley twins.  In the film it wasn't much more than a quick fireworks scene and them flying away...not the impact that their leaving should have had.

And where the heck was the Order of the Phoenix in all this???  There were very few hints at the Order throughout the film...kinda of defeats the purpose of the title.

All in all, I wasn't very satisfied at the end of the film.  I really think they could have added 30 minutes and done more justice to the story.
