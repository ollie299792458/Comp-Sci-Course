now i am not a clint eastwood fan. he was great in The good the bad the ugly and also in dirty harry. i never this man to last so long in the movie industry spewing out one hit after another. i just watched his latest offering Gran Torino. i am BLOWN AWAY. i will recommend this movie to fans and non-fans alike. this movie is like a comedy drama. the drama builds up so much tension that when the comedy comes, i literally burst out laughing out so loud!!
i'll leave the story for you to read in the synopsis. eastwood is still at the top of his game and totally convincing as the disgruntled, racist, war vet. what is likeable about him is his blunt honesty. he is a racist. admits it but when he has a reason to like his neighbors, he admits that too. very realistic movie. the end was very interesting. not what i would have expected at all. but totally justified. in the end credits there is a song sung by eastwood himself. never heard him sing before. but couldn't help listening to the whole song. its a movie about a man who has been living with ghosts in his head, the only woman who ever loved him is his wife, now he is left with his second love, his 1972 Gran Torino!!
