I love this show - I started watching it at about episode 4. While the editing is not as polished as other seasons, there's a lot to be said for the freshness of the show and the people on it. More people who wanted the adventure and fewer people trying to break into acting or modeling. Also, no one in Season 1 knew how the game was played. Everything was new.

Also, much of this season is "amazing." You get to see some of the sites you've always wanted to see like Victoria Falls. In the more recent seasons, you have to avoid big cities because of spoilers being posted.

The extra footage that is worked in is fun - it gives you a sense of what is really recorded and how it is edited. The airport confrontation between the Guidos and Drew and Kevin is shown unedited. The commentary on four episodes is also wonderful - I wish there were more.

If you are new to the Amazing Race, I'm sure this season will strike you as quirky. But you'll have an insight into how this show got started in the first place.
