sunday may 24th 2009 will be the 20th anniversary of the release of indiana jones and the last crusade.i was fortunate to see this movie openeing evening with my mom and my grandpa(my dad had to work that night).to this day one of the greatest movies ever made.what makes this movie great is the characters and the story.harrison ford plays indy as a mans man not a weak babling dweeb as so many men are presented in movies and tv today.he plays indy as a smart,tough, but decent man who would do any thing for his family and friends.he also loves his country and the reast of the world by trying to stop the most dangerous man made evil the world has ever faced the nazis from getting their evil hands on one of the most holy relics in the world the holy grail.this is a great story of good vs. evil which in my opinion is lacking in a lot of todays films.the film takes you all over the world from the united states ,to italy,to germany where indy comes face to face with hitler his evil self,to cairo,to petra just to name a few.sallah one of my favorite movie characters is back from raiders of the lost ark as well as marcus brody and sean connery's performance as henry jones sr. is one of the best movie performances ever.ever since that night 20 years ago i have really liked this movie a lot.the thing that really makes this movie special to me is that my grandpa was with me and my mom that night we saw this movie and he liked the movie.we lost hom almost 5 years ago cancer and i love him so much to this day and for ever.i look back at that night every time i even hear the movie mentioned and i think of him.i know he was with us then when went that evening to cinamas west movie theatre in gainesville
ga may 24th 1989 and he is still with us on the 20th anniversary of indiana jones and the last crusade.
love ya pawpaw
