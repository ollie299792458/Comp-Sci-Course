I loved Nacho Libre so much that I memorized it and still use a lot of the lines in everyday life, as does my husband and step-son and a few other die hard Nacho Libre fans.  I even had a Nacho Libre bathroom decorated with all my Nacho gifts and original art from friends.  My letters to Jared and Jerusha Hess were returned undeliverable, so I could not let them know how much Nacho Libre meant to me and others who valued it for its high moral standards, great acting, memorable lines, un-offensive language and "Christian" message.  It is still my favorite movie because it makes me so happy!  I like Napoleon, too.  I could not wait to see Jared's next film, but wish I hadn't.  Gentlemen Broncos was everything Nacho Libre wasn't.  In one word, Gentlemen Broncos is "vile."  I could hardly watch it because of the creepy, sickening feeling it gave me.  I don't like offensive movies and I wish I did not buy this DVD.  I hope Jared and Jerusha go back to making good movies that don't make me sick.  Movies that you can watch with the whole family; movies that have timeless humor.  Oh, and Mike White should have stayed behind the scenes (like in Nacho Libre.)
