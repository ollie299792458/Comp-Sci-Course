I rented the DVD and will be buying a copy (from Amazon of course). The reviews suggested this could be a stinker, but as I am interested in aviation history and like watching airplanes I decided to view the movie. Parts of the story are a bit corny but the story of the training was quite good. Although much of the flying was special effects, it carried with it a feeling of accuracy. Some of the heroes die and as mentioned in the movie WWI flyers had a horrible life expectancy. Part of the reason was the fact that the planes were flimsy and parachutes by and large were not used. To those who complained that real airplanes were not used, you only have to follow aviation and note the number of "warbirds" flown by enthusiasts that have crashed with quite a few fatalities - even when flown by experts -- and these are much safer World War II and post-war planes. Making a movie like this is not worth endangering flyers' lives  - cgi is good enough for me -- I do not feel cheated. It was a long movie but did not feel long. Great Zeppelin and bomber scenes were good watching. I really enjoyed FLYBOYS.
