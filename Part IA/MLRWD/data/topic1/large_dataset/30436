I feel that if you are: into the slasher films of the early 80s, like Tobe Hooper's films, and don't care for gore--- than you might like The Funhouse(1981). This movie is awesome! I liked it because I am into chase scenes, OR CAT AND MOUSE CHASES,and movies were there is a final girl or someone that is all bloodeed up or is all messed up and this movie has just that. I loved how Elizabeth Berridge(the final girl) is walking through the carnival and passes a home-less man who is all dirty and dressed like a hobo and she is wearing make-up and a dressy dress and is beautiful. At the end of the film when she is leavind the Carnival grounds she passes him again but this time she is all messed up just as he is. Also a homeless women kept reminder her "God is watching" and at the end while she is passing the homeless woman the woman smiles almost as if she said I TOLD YA SO, YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN: GOD PUNISHED YOU!

Overall it is a great movie and I loved the beginning and ending scenes!
If anyone hasn't scene it and is into old slashers I suggest you see it(it's not that bloody or gory)!!!!!
