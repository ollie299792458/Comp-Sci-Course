This is a movie that never fails to bring me warmly back to my halcyon teenage years.  I think anybody who, like me, hung with the nerds in the 90s, randomly quoting this film (fully aware of it's technical inaccuracy), hanging at 2600 meetings, and wishing to god to be part of the core culture protrayed in this film will feel the same.

Look at this film, guys!  Filmed in New York and London, the meccas of such culture, dark rooms, 90s graphics, that wicked cool fashion, the grungy tude towards the establishment, ocassional referances to Japan, rollerblading and the subway as primary means of transportation, and a totally brilliant chick . . . what else could a technically able zene-reading bowling-shoe-stealing (well, not actually, I was too moral) teenager from the suburbs of Chicago dream for?

This is the quintessential film of the 90s.  If my kids ever want to know what I thought was the cat's meow when I was a teenager, I'm showing them this film and a few episodes of My So Called Life.
