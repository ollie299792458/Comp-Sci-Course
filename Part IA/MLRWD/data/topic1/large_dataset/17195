On one hand, Griffith deserves an "A" for such a large undertaking, but on the other, he also deserves an "F" for proliferating the myth that all male slaves, or former male slaves wanted, even to the point of rape, the fair-haired and pure Southern white woman.  Not once does he show black females being raped by their masters, or the horrors of black families being ripped apart by family members being sold off to different parts of the states or the Carribean, never to see their families again.  Moreover, he totally ignores the true reason for the Civil War which was Southern economics based on free black labor, and the South's insistence that slavery be further extended into Western states.

It shows the wrath and anger of whites who, after almost four-hundred years of brutality and tryanny toward kidnapped and enslaved Africans, suddenly found themselves disenfranchised during Reconstruction, and who decided to form a secret and clandestine organization to terrorize and frighten those who wanted to be free.

Sadly, "Birth Of A Nation" and the caricatures and stereotypes it depicts is one of the root causes that Americans are still grappling wih race to this day.
