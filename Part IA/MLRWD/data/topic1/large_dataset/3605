Alright before we start off, no I didn't appreciate this movie as much as I loved the first one, but that doesn't mean that the movie isn't still hilarious.
The story you can find around all of the other reviews, plus if I gave you too much details I would spoil some of the story, not that the story itself is earth-shattering but I know I myself don't like it when I head into a movie already knowing what is going to happen when I watch it for the first time.
Now onto the details, the animation as you have come to expect from the Shrek franchise is absolutely flawless, every scene is more gorgeous than the next, beautiful fireworks, superb colors and it's all set in a bit more of a light atmosphere than the first one was.
To me the high-light of the movie was s toss-up between "Puss-in-boots" the character whose voice was given birth by Antonio Banderas, I personally believed that this character was the highlight of the movie. The other highlight of course was Donkey, the wise-cracking-annoying as hell creature voiced by Eddie Murphy.
Is it as good as the first one? I personally didn't believe so seeing as they had to make a  bit more of a story this time (last one was just cracking jokes with a little bit of a story in the background, this time we already know the characters so they actually have to give us something else to entertain us)
So even though maybe not as good as the first one its still an hilarious movie, definitely worth watching for all ages because there are jokes in there that entertain everyone, and jokes that only the adults in the audience will get, especially the joke involving Pinocchio is hilarious (you'll know it when you see it). Absolutely worth watching.
