I was not sure what to expect from someone like David Duchovny as the director and writer.  I was pleasantly surprised by the story and the characters in this movie.  Scenes of New York are great and love that the character Tommy has so much "life" to him.  Many of us growing up have experienced life as a child and as a young person growing up-the experiences Tommy goes through with his delivery job, friends like Pappas (played by Robin Williams), first love and kiss, becoming responsible to a parent that cannot care for themselves emotionally, and over all experiencing "life".  Erika Badu also playes an important role of a female that was at "The house of D" D-stands for dentention center.  Young Tommy would visit this woman for advice and guidance.  I loved this movie and would love to see David Duchovny write and direct more movies like this. It helped me to remember being a 13 year old and all the fun I had even if I was a girl living in the 1970's California.  Great work to all, and for the person who only gave you one star for this movie.  Get a life.
