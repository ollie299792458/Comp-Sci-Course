I had read  the book as required reading in ninth grade, then my teacher showed the class the movie. If this were a stand-alone film, and the novel didn't exist, then I would greatly enjoy it. However, it gets several things wrong. It adds a level of hostility to Joe Starret's relationship with Shane. In the novel, the two were more friendly towards each other. In the film however, you get the impression that Joe's on the verge of shooting him. Joe's wife (sorry, I forgot her name) is made to appear a little more rougher thean she was in the novel. The actor who played Shane looks all wrong. The cover of the novel paints Shane as a man with an ominous air to him, and he looks younger. The movie version seems to have trouble potraying that. Then there is Joey, who is called Boby in the novel and also the narrator. In the novel, I sympathised with him. The movie goes for the route of curious kid with annoying voice. Thne there's the scene where Shane knocks Joe out to prevent him from fighting Fletcher. This never happened. In the novel, Shane persuaded Joe to let him go instead. I will give props to the costume design, the beatiful settings, and a score that really fit the scenes. If you enjoyed the book, then don't expect a faithful adpation. This is not.
