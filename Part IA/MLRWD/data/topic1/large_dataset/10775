Even though half of these movies are not good, this is still a real find. The two good movies of the mid-era on one disc is both convenient and worth the price by themselves. Really, though, if you can find them both on separate DVDs for about the same money, about the only thing you'll be out is additional shipping and handling. I consider this being less worth the cost for having the later two movies included.

I can't do it! I can't not say anything about Batman and Robin! Its so bad! Its really bad! Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad! Its the saddest movie ever made. Not in the sentimental way, not in the tragic way. It just makes me very sad. Batman Forever, while far less bad, is no picnic either. Jim Carrey can be The Riddler, but why is The Riddler Jim Carrey? If you're looking for Riddler, Two-Face, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy and even Bane and Batgirl, you'd be better off trying to find the animated series. Michael Gough's Alfred is the best performance and has the best writing on disc two by a disappointingly wide margin.

That said, Batman and Batman Returns are awesome! Some of Tim Burton's finest reality-based work, well cast. Brilliantly scored. These movies have some of the most perfect Batman music, including the two Nolan movies. And no matter where you stand on Nicholson vs Ledger for best Joker (I like Hamill myself), you've got to admit that on his own merits, Jack makes for an outstanding Clown Prince of Crime. Hes threatening and at the same time really funny in that special Joker way, the way he should be.

Oh, and Keaton was good as Bats.

Should you buy it? Well...about ten bucks for a whole set of movies is pretty much always a good deal, and when that set includes two classics, so much the better. I would say reserve disc two for one of those times you're looking for a movie to mock and tell yourself you only paid for disc one. Nobody should ever pay money for Batman and Robin unless it includes a night with Catwoman afterward.
