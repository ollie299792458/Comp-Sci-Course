The title of this feature is somewhat disingenuous, smacking of "bait and switch". A more accurate title might read something like: "Colorado River Conservation Propaganda and Why the Glen Canyon Dam is BAAAD (and with some majestic fly-over scenes of the Grand Canyon thrown in here and there)". While all or at least most of such IMAX productions have obligatory (often insipid) story lines, this production is so insistent on flooding the viewer with conservation messages (many of which appear to be anecdotal and/ or trite) that it becomes annoying. It is as if this feature was produced by a group of idealistic, and very na√Øve, junior high school students, and aimed at a similar audience . Yes, the photography is often remarkable, with filming done on bright sunny days, resulting in bright, brilliant images. Unfortunately, there seems to be more footage of people sharing their thoughts/ personal opinions about this and that than footage involving fly-over scenes of the grand/ majestic canyon.
