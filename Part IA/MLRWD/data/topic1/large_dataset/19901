The first time I saw this movie, back in the 80's, I was just beginning to realize my own great dream.  I was just beginning to succeed at doing what I had wanted to do since childhood.  Unfortunately, someone in my life at that time was equally dedicated to derailing that dream, so it didn't happen.  The dream, and the opportunity to achieve it, were lost. Sad, yes. But hopeless, no.

This fantastic, energizing movie makes  me even more determined to see that my children and my grandchildren have every opportunity to achieve their own dreams.  I have and will continue to cheer and do whatever it takes to help them along the way.

This wonderful movie is too full of hope and joy and drive to allow anyone to sit and mourn the loss of their own dream.  Pick up the pieces, move on, and help the ones you love - and share their joy when they reach for their own stars!

I like to identify with old Hannah in the film.  One is never quite sure how much of her own dream she achieved, but she is able to reach across the generations to nurture and encourage the talent she sees in young Alex.  Can there be a better legacy than that?
