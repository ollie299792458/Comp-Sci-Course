I'm not familiar with the original text this movie is based off of but after watching this rendition I want to get my hands on it. If a movie could capture my imagination, suck me into the macro plot and keep the suspense going like this did then the book(s) have have to be fantastic.

I thought the directing well done. Some camera shots added to the mood and I appreciated that the camera wasn't always static but creative, but not MTV music video bouncing either.

For mostly unknown actors (as far as my movie watching experience goes) the acting was well done and believable.

Special effects were what I expected of tv made movie. Thus I had fair expectations and wasn't disappointed. The special effects fulfilled thier role.

As already mentioned the movie macro plot was well done especially transitioning between the "real world" and that of the stories toled by the sultana.

My 7, 5 and 3 year old all watched this with me and other than one "scary" scene and one adult comment they didn't get, this was good family entertainment.

The movie is a good 3hrs but we were glued to it the whole time and never felt like "when is this thing going to end?!" Overall a very, very pleasant experience and definitely worth the rental if not to own.
