Withnail And I captures the desperation of two out of work actors set against the backdrop of London at the end of the sixties.
Living in the horrendous squalor of a brutally cold flat their only escape is through alcohol and drugs. Things get so desperate at one point that one of them covers his body in "Deep Heat" just to get warm. Eventually both realise that they must escape the dull griminess of the city or they will surely go mad.
Withnails uncle Monty provides an escape route when he allows them to spend some time getting away from it all in his county house. Things do not look promising however when it looks as if they have swapped the dull grey of London for the dull wet grey of the countryside.
What follows is a story of survival as two city dwellers attempt to feed and warm themselves in the middle of nowhere. In one scene a chicken proves to be a worthy adversary just by being a chicken.
Throughout the adventure Withnail struggles heroically to do as little as possible and to persuade Marwood (the "I" of the film) to do all of the legwork. The fun really starts when uncle Monty turns up and attempts to get to know Marwood in the Biblical sense.
The performance of Richard E. Grant as Withnail is breathtaking. Paul McGann is wonderful as Marwood and Richard Griffiths plays Uncle Monty to perfection.
