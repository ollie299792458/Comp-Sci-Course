With marvelous photography, a majestic John William's soundtrack, impressive locations and convincing action scenes, as well as lots handsome horseflesh, this movie could stand on those legs alone. However, THE COWBOYS is a film that spins a classic tale of young men coming of age and old men learning deep lessons. The Duke puts in one of his finest performances-- better perhaps than THE SHOOTIST where he portrays another doomed, old westerner. In an early role by Bruce Dern we see an impressive and terrifying piece of method acting. He embodies the post-Civil War Western badman with Southern origins. He is pure anger, frustration and evil.
  This movie is one I hold dear-- I was 6 years old when I first sat in a matinee at the old Fox theater in Bakersfield, CA, rooted to my seat and watching good battling evil, youth coming of age, and beautiful horses galloping across the Montana countryside under clear Rocky Mountain skies.
  There is some uneven acting, especially by the 11 boy actors that include Robert Carradine, A. Martinez and others. Some of the lines seem a bit stiff and artificial, and the killing at the end seems to take place without the moral and ethical introspection found in the novel, but all in all this is a fine movie and one that should be seen by any fan of the western genre.
