The "nice" Americans went to the middle-east to liberate the "poor" Kuwait people from the "bad" guys. That's what the US government wanted us to think and that's what CNN tried to show.  But how far is this from the truth? Miles away! The movie reveals to us the  true purpose of the war, which was to prevent Iraq from controlling the oil  supply. Simple as that! But the movie also digs a little into the ugliness  of the American society, much like American Beauty (ugliness) did. For  example, it shows the Rodney King beating on TV, as the three US soldiers  enter one of the bunkers. The black soldier of the group freezes for a  moment, probably questioning his own loyalty to a coutry that treats blacks  with disrespect.  Americans sitting comfortably at home, watching this war  and the Kosovo war on CNN were selectively fed the news that would make  them support their government's actions. Similarly, the soldiers in this  movie thought they were doing the right thing leaving the Iraqui people to  deal with Sadam on their own. Fortunately in this movie, at least, the  soldiers got a close look at the suffering of the people and in the end  they did the right thing, which was against the orders of the US  government.
