Emily Blunt shows why Meryl Streep said that she was the most talented young actress that she's ever worked with in this intimate look into one of England's most famous monarchs.  Blunt gives us a well rounded and well researched performance, something missing from our recent movie history. In scenes that display a 17 year old Victoria backhandedly snubbing the man who would later become the love of her life, she somehow manages to win our understanding and sympathy.
Most people only see Queen Victoria as she was in her later life, as a recluse widow, solemn and gaunt, but this production brings life and vivid color to her little talked of beginnings. As Rupert Friend (Prince Albert) said in the special features, "we forget that she was once a 16 year old girl who loved to dance." The production also throws into light how much Victoria and Albert needed eachother to make the era one of the greatest in Britain's history. She needed his coolheaded logic and gentle reassurance to temper her stubbornness, and he needed her energy and drive to get his plans off the drawing board (hinted at quite literally in one scene).
All in all, a beautifully done film that isn't the traditional love story. Most romantic dramas nowadays end when the young couple finally gets together after a long suffering, but in The Young Victoria, the wedding is only the midway point. It guides us through the daze of the honeymoon to the first unintentional insult, the first disagreement, down to the first blowout fight, but always returns to the fact of their mutual all-encompassing love for eachother.
