I have loved this movie since I was a kid and kept meaning to buy it once DVD's were invented(yes I am OLD) anyhow, its a heartwarming and funny tale and its something the whole family can watch with no embarassment and though its an old black and white film movie( some of the best ones are) its timeless in its application of human reactions and life situations.  Yes you can tell it was made long ago, and yet, it surprisingly is fresh and very focused on the human condition which never really changes.  In the end, you are always wondering, did he exist? or was it just a mental aberration?  I like that the film makers left that to it's audience.  Its about a magical puka ( Harvey) a 6ft tall rabbit who accompanies a man of many complexities, though he seems simple, he is clearly deep and thoughtful.  I only wish I knew someone like that and even if they did have questionable mental state, what a pleasant person to be around. Jimmy Stewart was a great actor and though gone, never forgotten, this was to me, clearly one of his best efforts.  Get it and enjoy, I know I did.
