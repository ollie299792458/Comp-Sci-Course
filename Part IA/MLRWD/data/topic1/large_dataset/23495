This movie depicted some valuable and interesting viewpoints during the power hungrytime of the Nazis. It showed Solomon, a Jewish boy who invoked on a treacherous journey of escaping the Germans and staying alive. He had schemes and ideas all shown throughout the movie, which were surprising and sometimes even miraculous. Parts of the movie I did not quite enjoy was that at times, it was quite explicit. However, it is an original German film and they customarily find the explicit details more open than for myself. It seems to be one of those films that you would watch once, never forget it, and never want to view it again. The film was filled with satire on how Nazi ideology was just a bunch of egregious and blunder ideas. One scene that I found hysterical was a scene when Solomon, as known as Jupp with the Germans, was having his head measured in the "best Nazi school for training boys". The professor told the class that Solomon's features carried inevitably strong traits of a purebreed aryan. Overall, I personally found this movie with details that felt outstretched, but was covered with many good proofs how a lot of things were through WWII. For that, the movie deserves four stars.
