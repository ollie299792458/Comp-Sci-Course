I just want everyone to know that I have 2 DVD players and I have not seen the problems that others here have mentioned.  I have all 4 seasons and have really enjoyed them.  I am looking forward season 5 coming out.  On season 1, I had one problem on one episode with it skipping.  I am not sure if it was the DVD or some dust on the DVD.  I have had zero problems with all other seasons and all other episodes.

My understanding is that some DVD players have better error checking than others.  My DVD players are a couple of years old and are both combination DVD/VHS players.  One is a Panasonic and one is a Sony.  My guess is that if you have a newer or higher quality DVD player (not the $99 special) that you will probably not have the problems that others have been complaining about.

Regardless, the manufacturer should be dealing with these problems and especially not putting episodes on both sides of the DVD.  At least the packaging in the last couple seasons was improved from the bad packaging of season 1 where it was impossible to get the DVD's out of the case and some people broke the DVD because it stuck to the center tabs.

My recommendation:  If you are a hard-core Magnum Fan like me AND you have a newer DVD player, don't hesitate ordering the Magnum P.I. series.  I have had hours of enjoyment reliving this incredible series.  Great action, characters, storylines, Hawaiian scenary, and of course that hot Farrari.
