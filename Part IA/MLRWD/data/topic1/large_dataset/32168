I applaud this film for actually taking the time to establish the characters, which rarely happens in this type of genre. Usually, we get a brief glimpse of their lives before they are ultimately killed off one by one. However, I really wish it didnt waste 3/4 of the film with a boring plot.
If you love the torture/horror genre, then this will be a dissapointment for you. The true action doesn't beging until about 20 minutes from the end of the movie and by then you are already bored out of your mind. The torture scenes are quite brief actually and while effective, they are nothing truly gut wrenchingly grotesque or even flinching, especially if you are used to watching films like this. Any of the Saw films easily beat Hostel in the blood and gore department and they do it in a wicked and tortureous way. Hostel is not even remotely scary or chilling. There are no jumpy moments. There are no spooky or clever moments. For those who are not used to or dislike this genre, then perhaps this film may affect you. Otherwise, its a forgettable and overrated film.
