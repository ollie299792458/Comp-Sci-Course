This movie is absolutely my favorite movie in the world! It's romantic, funny, and so sweet. The actors and actresses are awesome. Lindsay Lohan is wonderful; she plays the roles of the twins (Annie and Hallie) who try to  get their parents back together. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson play  Annie and Hallie's divorced parents (Nick and Liz) who still have feelings  for each other. Elaine Hendrix plays the role of Nick's fiancee (evil  Meredith Blake). Ronnie Stevens (Grandfather), Lisa Ann Walter (Chessy) and  Simon Kunz (Martin) lovingly help the twins with their plan to get their  parents back together. This remake of The Parent Trap is way better than  the original. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson (Nick and Liz) are more  romantic than the couple in the original Parent Trap. You can see the  sparks in Nick and Elizabeth's eyes. Quaid and Richardson make a really  cute/nice couple in this movie. Simon Kunz is definitely the best  supporting actor and Lisa Ann Walter is definitely the best supporting  actress in the world; they are so cute together in this movie, too. I  seriously can't watch enough of The Parent Trap (1998). I've watched it  more than 100 times. If you ask me, I think the best part of the movie is  the last 30 minutes of it; this is where things start getting really sweet.
