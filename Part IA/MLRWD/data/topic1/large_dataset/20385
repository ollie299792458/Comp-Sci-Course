This movie was a hit in its day with good reason.  Somehow, it doesn't play well these days.  Peter Sellers, one of the most brialliant actors ever, does his best here and there are some funny moments but mostly even his act falls flat.  I don't know if this was a fault of the director or if the things we thought were hilarious then just aren't as funny anymore.  Paula Prentiss, too, whom I remember a wonderful comedienne, was simply silly here.  Maybe being gawky and neurotic was funny then...?

The story is really about two supposedly pre-pubescent girls (although they are played by actresses who are 16 and 17, which shows).  As another reviewer suggested this would be a great Disney type film aimed at young girls.  Bringing Sellers and Prentiss into it just confuses the aim of the film. They were big stars at the time so they brought people to the theaters.

Angela Landsbury and Tom Bosley appear and perform their roles adequately. It's sort of interesting to see Landsbury in her younger days.  Bosley plays the same good dad that he did on Happy Days. The star of the film, in my opinion, is Tippy Walker whose natural charm light up every scene in which she appears.  The other actress, whose name I've forgotten is dull and dreay compared to her, but that serves the story.

New York looks good and it's interesting to see the clothes of the time.  Beyond that, there's not much of value here.  For Sellers and Prentiss fans, look eleswhere.
