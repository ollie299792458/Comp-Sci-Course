This film has been a part of the fabric of my family since the birth of my first child. It is a story based upon the true life of Saint Bernadette and the role she played in bringing unbelievers to Our Lord. It is also a film that is absent of any hidden political agenda which, alone makes it a true joy to watch. The first time I saw this movie I fell in love with it. I have now watched it with my children at least once a year for the last 15 years and I never tire of it! The film is full of famous actors such as Vincent Price, Charles Bickford, Lee J. Cobb and of course the beautiful Jennifer Jones. I can't recommend this film enough for parents of young children. Two of my children's favorite films growing up were this and "The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima". For years I had only the video of the film, and when I saw the fully restored DVD I wasted no time in purchasing it. The restoration done on the film is OUTSTANDING and the extras on the DVD are pure pleasure for fans such as myself. I loved hearing all the behind-the-scenes info offered about the actors and the movie's production. Sadly films such as The Song of Bernadette, Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments are no longer being made as "God" is increasingly being funneled out of our schools, our towns and our lives by the liberal leftists and their lawsuits. My highest recommendations for a film you'll truly enjoy!
