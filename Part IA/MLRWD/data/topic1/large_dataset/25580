This movie was amazing!  It is action packed and a beautiful movie.  The movie is part 1 of the last book and has such a great cliffhanger that it is sad when the movie ends, I cannot wait to see the next movie!!!  --I do not want to give anything away (it is hard to talk about this movie without giving away an important aspect).

On another note, the movie looks great in HD, but they left such large bars at the top and the bottom of the screen.  It is not bad, but it is like the old days when you would watch a Widescreen movie on a full screen unit.

I have a question about what the special features (mainly the trailer for the next movie) are...  After watching the movie on the  "Movie: Blu-Ray" disk, I went to Special Features and there was only an option for watching the movie in different manners.  I put the second disk "Special Features: Blu-Ray" in and it loaded and went to the main menu, but there was no option except Language and Special Features (which had no options other than language and subtitles).  It was strange, because the player would not move normal, I had to use inverted controls to move.

In all this was a great movie, and a must watch, I was hoping to see the trailer for the new movie, however, I guess it is time to start surfing the net looking for it myself.  :)
