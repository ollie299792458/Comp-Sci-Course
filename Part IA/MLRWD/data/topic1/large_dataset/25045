You know, I wasn't expecting a perfect movie with this one, but good would help.

A lot of people are wanting to see this (or already have) because it's supposed to be a big action movie. It's not. The action starts late, lags, and ends quick. Honestly: People do not mind watching long (i.e. Lord of the Rings) movies if the story is good, or at least has some king of redeeming values. Unfortunatly, this film has neither.

To Alien fans: You will be angry. The chest-bursters come out in five minutes (give or take a few seconds). Also, the aliens have more of a "Alien: Resurrection" look instead of an "Aliens" look to them.

To Predator fans: You will be angry. The predators look bulky football players, not tall, peak-condition humanoids. They are written as chumps, who get taken out in no time (Seriously. ONE alien killed two predators within 10 minutes of each other). Aren't predators supposed to be the ultimate in hunters.

Now, if you want to see this movie, go ahead. Most people who want to in the first place won't be stopped by any bad publicity. Just know this: it's not perfect in the least. The fight scenes are sloppily shot, the lighting is bad (it's not like in the "Alien" movies where it's supposed to be creepy, it's just bad), the creatures don't look as good as their predecesors, and the humans cannot act to save their lives.

Most people would not recomment this movie, and I don't either. But if you do watch it, know that you will most likely be disappointed.
