Just got a chance to see "The Immortal Edition".  To say that this is a better transfer than the initial DVD release is an incredible understatement.  Unlike the first DVD (where the MPEG artifacts had MPEG artifacts), this is a nice, clean anamorphic transfer that looks quite good on my 120" screen.
The main menu is peculiar and has a somewhat irritating a/v segue between the top-level menus and the sub-menus, but it's usable.
My principal gripe with this disc is the "director's cut" edit.  In some ways, this edit improves the original US release by providing additional back story for some of the characters.  However, this cut also adds some other footage which, in my opinion, detracts heavily from the mysterious nature of the beginning of the movie.  They've also "touched up" some of the effects work in a couple of the battle scenes in a way that didn't add much.
The 5.1 remix (DD and DTS) also adds some gratuitous sound effects which I find distracting and actually (in the climactic sequence) detrimental to the movie.
So, in sum, this disc is a mixed bag.  I have ordered it after viewing a rental copy because the quality if the transfer is the best so far.  However, I wish I could have this transfer quality with the original edit (plus the WW-II sequence) and a true-to-the-original 5.1 mix.
