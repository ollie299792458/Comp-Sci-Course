When I saw the previews for this film it looked hilarious, well boy was I wrong. I should have known an ex-Kill Bill star(uma therman) an entertainer(Cedric) and a wrestler(The Rock), the singer(Christina Milian) as well as the 57 year old face lifted John Travolta would only make a horrible film. Technically I can really see why it's named "Be Cool" to calm down it's audience from wasting money on the film. I must admit it's not a bad film but it could have been alot funnier. There is no conflict in the film, and basically you just follow John Travolta around like a puppy (which is definetly what I felt like watching the film.) There are a few "humorous" moments, but not the type where you will roll on the floor laughing your arse off. It really seems that the director just put some actors together, got a loan, and made a movie out of the blue with old/action/wrestler/singer stars. Technially this movie is definetly if you are bored out of your skull. It's not worth seeing but if you want to see any of those stars again I guess it's ok...
