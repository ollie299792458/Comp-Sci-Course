I watched this movie, once upon a time while still a resident in Malaysia in 1960s (though the movie was made in 1958).  I continue to like it and am glad it is now available on DVD and be brought into many homes throughout Canada and the United States, including European Union.

Made in England and based on the simple yet admirable English woman, a servant of His Almighty God, named Gladys Aylward, who eventually, due to her tenacity and persistent, was sent to war-torn China to save souls. This story occurred at a time when China was beset by a tragic civil war (Nationlists vs. Communist) and confronting the barbaric invaders from militant Japan.

The Inn of the Sixth Happiness is both a story of missionary work as well as  invasion by the alien Jap army into a politically-divided and militarily-weak  China - 1937 - the advent of the Second World War, in which ultimately climaxed in the Rape of Nanking, where more than 300,000 innocent Chinese became the  victims  of the Japanese armies...!

This made-in-England movie was based on the book, titled: THE SMALL WOMAN by British writer, Alan Burgess.

The entire  city for the film had to be created from scratched on English soil and the realism of the scenes are indeed worthy of acclaim and commendation, even to this day.

I am particularly moved by the missionary Glady's saving of the 100 Chinese orphans from the brutal, alien invaders who were hell-bent on murdering them or stopped  them from running away from being slaughtered in cold blood by the contesting samurai swords...!

This powerful and historical film now availabe on DVD should deserve to be viewed again and again  in the context of bring the Word of Christ to the people of China when they were experiencing  the worst tragedy of being tortured and summarily executed by the Imperial "bungsai" Japanese armies....

Please go for this DVD before supply runs out, and happy viewing folks. Cbeers and thanks.
