Ok. This will probably be the strangest rave Tom Petty review you ever read.

I don't like Tom Petty's music. I have never owned a Tom Petty album, and am highly unlikely to ever own one. Yet I think this was one of the best rock documentaries ever made,and I was fascinated throughout.

You see, this is not a concert, but the story of a band. Just because you're not a fan of an artists music doesn't mean they don't have a great story to tell, and this one does. It was directed by 70's wunderkind Peter Bogdonovich, and he does a beautiful job at giving Tom's 35 year career the epic scope that he, and the audience deserved. For once, a film is able to go into the depth of detail that you wanted to know. Why did the drummer get fired? They actually tell you. There's nothing more frustrating than a film that doesn't tell you what you want to know, but this one does.

The band itself, is not terribly charismatic, and there isn't much in the "Motley Crue" vein of wild stories of excess or soap opera-style conflict and controversy, they are just some quiet guys who like to play easy-listening roots-rock without any gimmicks or sensationalism. But it's rarely boring, especially for musicians, since there's lots of detail given on the making and recording of the albums.

I may not be a Tom Petty fan, and did find myself fast-forwarding through some of the extended music performances, but look at it this way, if I was interested and entertained throughout, than a Petty fan is sure to be in heaven. Now if only someone would make a film this good about a band I like... Highly Highly recommended.
