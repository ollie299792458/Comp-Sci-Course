I love this movie!!  It was my favorite as a pre-teen.  Victor Franco was my first movie crush.  This is at heart an action film with a perfect cast.  As I get older I realize just how great.  Major Reisman (a marvolous Lee Marvin) is assigned (he "volunteers") to lead a group of hardened war criminals on a suicide mission across emeny lines as a preparation for D-Day.  He is half-way to becoming a criminal himself - he has more citations against him than any five officers - and is the only man who could possibly turn those 12 men into war heros.  He understands how they think and what it is going to take to make them obey his orders.

Donald Sutherland and John Cassevantes are the major stand outs.  I actually became a huge Donald Sutherland fan based on his performance here as a retarded killer.  The relationships between the men are only briefly touched on.  I would have liked to see more of them learning to trust and rely on each other.  As an adult I have discovered that I can no longer bear to watch all the way to the end.  I am not a fan of war movies, I hate watching people die after the writers have made me love them.

Give this movie a try.  It is a little dated, but the capture of Breed's headquarters and Sutherland as a general (He has one of the best lines in movie history) are worth all your time and effort.
