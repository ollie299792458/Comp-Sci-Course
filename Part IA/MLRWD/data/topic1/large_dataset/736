This story is about a still mostly well-hidden and very ugly secret of humanity: the brutal abuse of defenseless young children by sexually devious adults, even in their own homes, not just by strangers. This is the thread that ties all the characters together. Our heroine, however, has one advantage over so many other victims: she is a survivor and draws strength from her ordeal. She also tries to heal herself, despite the ongoing suffering that she receives at the hands of those who are supposed to help her. Her gruesome life has prepared her to be the ideal hunter to track down honest appearing perverts, because she understands the psychology of both victim and aggressor.
Her counterpart and other hero, a journalist whose mission it is to uncover shoddy, corrupt businesses hiding under the cloak of honesty, also will experience the suffering of being punished for his righteous work. He will find Lisbeth, the girl, despite his wishing, but they will come to understand each other better than they both could have imagined.
This story will churn up your sense of justice and your fighting spirits, and make you see the crimes committed through the eyes of the victim. And I hope you will feel just as I did that Lisbeth is doing the right thing.
Be courageous, let yourself go and slide into the story!
