You would benefit from in-person training with an experienced Pilates trainer to fully understand some of the movements that Ana explains.

Ana explains the basics of proper form well, but she speaks a little too quickly sometimes, and people who are totally new to Pilates may find themselves rewinding every now and then to listen to what she just said or to get another view of the movement she's demonstrating.

It is a good idea to rewind if you do not understand something Ana says\demonstrates because if you do not use proper form, you can end up either not getting the full benefit of the exercise or straining your back.

I bought this DVD for my girlfriend who is looking to get in shape this year.  She is a beginner, but with some rewinding and my help (I've been part of a Pilates Mat Class for 3 months now), she was able to make it through most of the workout on her first try.

After repeated viewings of Ana's videos and adding cardio to our exercise regimen, my lady and I look forward to making significant progress over the next 3-4 months.
