Nathaniel Kahn's semi-touching/semi-nebbishy account of trying to "discover" his famous father, architect Louis Kahn, was of great interest to me. But then, I've always wanted to be an architect (does the name "Art Vandalay" ring a bell?), so I'm not sure if my opinion of this movie is representative of general perceptions of this movie.

Even so, I've never been that amazed by Louis Kahn's work; it always seemed too cold and brutal for my tastes. But after watching this film and understanding that Kahn was striving for genuine monuments that stood the test of time, I can see them in a new, more appreciative light. And learning of Kahn's circumstances -- a scarred Estonian immigrant eventually rising to a position of great repute -- humanized for me a man whose style always seemed impersonal and distant.

While the film does meander, it was particularly interesting for me was to hear famous architects speak firsthand. They include Philip Johnson (charming and funny), Frank O. Gehry (not much to say, really), and I.M. Pei (warm and polite). And in marked contrast, there's Philadelphia city planner Edmund Bacon (father of actor Kevin Bacon) who comes across as a near-violent creep. Oy vey!
