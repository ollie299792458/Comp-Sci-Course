At first I thought "are they crazy?" Then I thought, "Hmmm, I'd actually like to see that." Then I saw it. &lt;YAWN&gt; What would have been REALLY interesting would have been if Gus Van Sant made good on a rumor that he would change the ending based on something the original screenwriter, Joe Stefano himself, revised for the remake. Imagine this: The weakest thing about Hitchcock's masterpiece (which, don't get me wrong, I love, but it had this one flaw) is the ending, wherein the shrink has one, long, boring speech about what he learned from interviewing Norman Bates, ostencibly to explain his psychology to us, the audience. Stefano reportedly SCRAPPED that scene and REPLACED it with re-enacting the actual interview between Norman and the shrink, as it might have happened. Then the shrink leaves the room to explain it to everyone, but we stay with Norman for his/mother's famous lastr words.
Unfortunately, that scene did not occur, and is arguably the only thing Van Sant might have done to improve on Hitchcock's narrative. Instead, he inserted weird nonsequitors into the shower murder and other extraneous self-indulgences. &lt;YAWN&gt;
I wouldn't buy this DVD, but it is worth renting for the curiosity of it all.
