I am not a big fan of Woody Allen, but this movie definately shows that he is one of the funniest men involved with the "silver screen."  Small Time Crooks is one hilarious film.
The plot line is quite simple.  Allen plays an ex-con named Ray who, along with his buddies, sets up to tunnel underground and rob a bank.  His wife, Frenchy, sets up a cookie shop as the cover, but when the robbery attempt is spoiled, the cookie business takes off.
Woody Allen brought together an amazing cast including Jon Lovitz who was absolutely perfect for his role, Michael Rappaport, and Hugh Grant.  Allen was perfect in the movie, as his one-liners are hysterical and pretty well-timed.  Tracy Ullman plays his wife, and is the perfect compliment to him.  However, Elaine May clearly stole the show, as the dim-witted cousin, May.  She was simply fantastic.
The film was quite enjoyable, as it was a well-written story.  The acting was superb, and the humor was incredibly witty, and seemed to allow the movie to flow rather well.  This film will "steal" your attention.
