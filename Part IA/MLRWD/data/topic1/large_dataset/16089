Hardly a vase is left unsmashed. Every great movie hit is parodied, even some movies made long after.  Everything associated with the Peter Sellers/Inspector Clouseau series comes to a full and glorious peak.  What is surprising is that this movie remains fresh even after all these years.

When Clouseau's servant Kato attacks him as he enters his apartment the resulting martial arts send-up is like a Jackie Chan outtake.  There's even a glamorous Russian assassin wearing little more than a fur coat to outdo all the Bond girls.

Herbert Lom plays the insane Former Chief Inspector Dreyfus with the manic glee of a little boy running amok, cheerfully reprising bits of his role in "Phantom of the Opera".  It has to be mentioned that Lom takes a pratfall with as much grace and panache as Sellers.  The scenes where both appear together are comic masterpieces.

This is the movie where Sellers destroys the audience merely by saying, "Room" in Inspector Clouseau's ridiculous and phony French accent. It might be an old dog by now, but the trick still works, as does the joke.

President Gerald Ford is memorialized in this 1976 movie, with a look-alike actor stumbling over his feet in the mock Oval Office. I think the real Ford only fell once getting out of the Presidential helicopter, but the comics feasted on it for years.  Another scene in this movie that no longer feels the same is the one in which the madman Dreyfus erases the UN Building in New York -- people running through the streets unfortunately called to mind the events in 2001.  When this movie was filmed the skyline of New York did not have the twin towers of the WTC. The little flashback this scene engendered in my mind is not the fault of the movie.  It was the world that changed...That the movie could still make me laugh after that is a testament to its comic power.  Five stars still...the world needs to laugh.  The clueless innocence of Inspector Clouseau is still a potent remedy for what ails us.
