I grew up watching old episodes of Fawlty Towers on PBS with my dad.

I got this as a gift a few years ago and have watched them over and over again.  We continually quote lines from this show as we're doing things together even to this day.

I decided to replace my dad's VHS tapes this year (2007) for Christmas. He has had them for about 15 years or so, so they are pretty worn out.  He was really happy to get this.  Now we can revive some of our daily quotes to each other as we talk on the phone or when I visit their house.

It's too bad that BBC only made 12 episodes.  This could've been as great and well known as Monty Python had it continued for a few more years.

The DVDs are great quality.  There are a lot of interviews with the cast and behind the scenes looks at how this show came about.  I actually couldn't find it in stock in any stores in my area (Portland, Oregon)...no one bothers to carry this great show anymore!!!  Not Best Buy, Target, Fred Meyer, Borders, or Suncoast Movie Company.  Thank you Amazon!
