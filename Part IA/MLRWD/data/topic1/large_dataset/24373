This is another unnecessary remake starring Jaden Smith. The first was "Day the Earth Stood Still."

While the choreography was decent and the viewer got to see some decent Kung Fu., I had many problems with this movie.
First the title. KARATE KID which had NO karate. More like the Kung Fu kid.
Why is this set in China?? It came across as a big ad for tourism to China.

This movie was basically a pale immitation of the original movie with the original lines "forced" into different scenes of this movie that did not capture the magic and drama of the original.
Jackie Chan was not charming but was simply bland. Pat Morita gave great charisma to his character. Every scene with Morita was memorable.
Jaden would not be in this dreck of a movie if his parents weren't bankrolling him. He is unlikable and his character is a punk.
The original character was a decent kid who was placed in a challenging situation.
The friendship theme seemed so pale in comparison to the original
Every thing seemed so scripted and just simply a carbon copy of the original.
The love interest scene was weak because the characters were too young. It would have worked a little better if the actors were older.
The bad guy instructor should have spoken some english. He also had no presence either.
The final winning point scene was much better in the original. The famous crane kick.
This version had some video game style kick that looked too flashy.
Again, the choreography was decent for the most part. It was the scripted acting and ripped lines that made this movie a blah fest.
Again hollywoood takes classic movies and remakes them into crap.
Another movie to add the the long list of bad remakes.
Next time, save us the money and simply re release the original into theaters.
