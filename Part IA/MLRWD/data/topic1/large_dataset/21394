George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino star in this gangster/vampire crossbread that is, without a doubt, the best movie ever made. What sets this horror movie aside from others is that rather than killing off central characters from the start Scream style, it dedicates the entire first half to character development. This allows the audience to begin to actually care if a character dies or not. The story centers around a violent pair of outlaw brothers named Seth and Richard Gecko and an unwitting family they kidinap to help get them and their loot across the Mexican border. Once they get their they go to hide out in a sleazy bar where they stumble across an ancient den of vampires. Clooney and Tarantino, who spent the summer before shooting began together so they could interact in a believable way are one of the best on-screen duos in history. They are very diffrent and Clooney's(Seth) charm and charisma are the exact opposite of Tarantino's(Richard) menacing and creepy performance as a sex-offending dork from hell but even though the opening sequence characterizes the two as unrepentant killers the viewer still can't help but root for them. This is one of the rare movies that you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it. I would highly recommend you check this movie out as long as you can stand a little violence and bad language.
