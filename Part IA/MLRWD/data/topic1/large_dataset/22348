Being a hockey player I went into this movie a little biased and knew I was going to like it no matter what, and I did.  Though I was fairly young at the time this event took place it's nice to know that I can say that I was around when it happened.
Even though you know what the outcome of the final game is going to be, the moive makers did a very good job of creating the suspense of the slow moving clock in the last game.  I'm a little dissappointed in the ending and how they just kind of glossed over the Gold Medal game against Finland like it was less important.  There was probably just as much drama in that game that could've been shown as there was in the USA vs USSR game.
If you ever get a chance, watch the HBO documentary special on the 1980 USA hockey team.  That has interviews with Herb Brooks and a handful of the players and press people from both sides.  It brings tears to my eyes each time I see the US players discribing for themselves how they beat the Soviets.  In the HBO special, Herb Brooks talks about being cut from the 1960 USA hockey team at the last hours before the Olympics and how he was sitting with his Dad watching the US win the gold.  His dad turned to him and said "It looks like the cut the right guy".
To me, a little flash back in the beginning of the movie showing that would have really played up that stoyline better then the 1980 players just talking about it the locker room.
