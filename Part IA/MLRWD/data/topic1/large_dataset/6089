One might dismiss a movie like "Pumpkinhead" as an example of a low budget, low quality spooker that is so common in the horror genre.  But this movie is a pleasant surprise.  Thanks to an interesting premise and a well-used creepy and atmospheric setting, there is a lot to enjoy about this film for fans of 80's horror films.

What really sets this film ahead of most of the pack are the two main stars- Lance Hendricksen and Pumpkinhead.  Mr. Hendricksen's performance is at the core of the story, and he does a great job.  From being a loving father, to being a backwoods store keeper, to being an angry man bent on revenge, etc., he give the film life through his performance and screen presence.  I imagine he would be a great person to tell stories around a campfire.

Pumpkinhead also is an extraordinary character.  He is scary, creepy, and vengeful, which is to be expected.  But he also shows a bit of personality as he goes about doing his business.  Cudos to the designers and operators of this creature.  They went a step beyond what is normally a part of these creatures.

All in all, this is not a perfect film, but it is much better than you probably would expect if you haven't seen it before.  Enjoy!
