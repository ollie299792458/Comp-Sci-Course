Of the three, Veronika Voss is the only one I very much wanted to see again. The week I rented it, I watched it upwards of three times, and ended up bringing it back late. The plot has great momentum, the mood is well-sustained and echoes that of Sunset Boulevard, the lead actress is very charismatic, and there's just a lot going on all the time to keep you interested: fun patter in the dialogue between the hero and his girlfriend; a beautiful, expressionist set for the office of the evil, morphine-dealing psychiatrist; a pretty, melancholy soundtrack; and so on.

Lola, by contrast, made me fall asleep towards the end. There's at least one great set piece, and the male lead is well-drawn and provides a strong critique of the Adenauer period, but mostly this film is populated by caricatures and is very dry, academic/didactic, and boring.

I'd say Maria Braun is somewhere in between the two. I haven't seen it in a while, and I had less of a basis for making judgements because I knew much less at the time about Germany and especially about Fassbinder. However, I remember the plot and characters keeping me mostly interested, but some of the scenes coming off a bit mannered in a way that was jarring.
