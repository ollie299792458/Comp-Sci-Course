I had read a great many reviews of this dvd on the SOSH message board for weeks before getting it as a present.  I expected the worst because generally speaking the posters over at SOSH have taken complaining to emperical levels.  I had worries in my head.  Was it going to play the curse angle to death?  Was it going to ridicule the tragic october history of my team?  Would it refresh those amazing memories of this year's magical run?  Ultimately none of my concerns where warranted.  I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of this dvd.  Certainly the curse is mentioned but it wasn't super sensationalized or patronizing.  Hell, I never believed in it, but I'm not going to put my fingers in my ears whenever I hear it mentioned by another fan or player, and so I thought it was tasteful in those regards.  I loved the frequent and short interviews with players, coaches and management and certainly issued many tears and deep laughs at certain candid moments involving Johnny Pesky and players from the past.  I recommend this disc with no reservations for every Red Sox fan out there and truly believe that if you're going to complain about something as pleasantlly evocative as this, then you're just too damn uptight.  Personally, I'm just looking to enjoy every moment of what has been a 27 year dream come true.
