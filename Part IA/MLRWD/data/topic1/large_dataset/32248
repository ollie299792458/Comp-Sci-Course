I have never seen a stage production of Phantom and since I am becoming a Phantom junkie, I down loaded this production which is marvelous and beautiful.  Mr. Karimloo and Ms Boggess have wonderful voices - as good as Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman from the original cast album.  This is as close to perfect as I have ever seen any musical done.

Anyone who likes great music and fantastic singing really should get this production which, besides The Phantom itself, includes a tribute to The Phantom and to Lloyd Webber with many people from other productions.  Sarah Brightman sings and four other Phantoms sing also.  The Royal Albert Hall and the staging were almost enough by themselves to watch it.

However I have two small maybe picky things I did not like.
The Phantoms costumes looked like something Oscar Wilde would have enjoyed wearing, and I really hated wharever it was supposed to be that he played on the organ.  It didn't sound like music, it sounded like an assault on the ears.  Stupid complaints maybe, but they both seemed to detract something from the aura of the Phantom.

That's the 1% I didn't like, but the other 99% is wonderful.
