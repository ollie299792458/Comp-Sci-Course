Having never seen Cat on a Hot Tin Roof I wasn't sure of what I was getting myself into.  A lover of classic movies, but denied the pleasure of viewing Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, I eagerly awaited the film.  The movie did not disappoint!  Tennessee Williams was a brilliant playwright and the dialogue he brought to the play crackled with raw emotion and simmering anger.  Knowing a little about Williams I was ready for his southern landscapes, misogynistic undertones, and hidden homosexual tendencies.  Cat definitely brought all of these things, but would have been nothing without the staggering performances by Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor, Burl Ives, and Judith Anderson.  The film has a haunting and mysterious tone that stays with it throughout the whole film.  The actions and reactions of the main characters keep the audience riveted while the screen crackles with pent up sexual energy.  The cinematography was magnificent gibing the film it's southern twang.  This film has all the stamps necessary for a classic.  Like A Streetcar Named Desire before it, it continues to dig deep into the turbulent relationships between men and women and the frailty of the human spirit.  I cannot give this film enough applause.
