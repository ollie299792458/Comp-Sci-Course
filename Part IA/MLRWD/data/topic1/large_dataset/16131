Before Sunrise is far from a polished movie.  It doesn't involved carfully choreographed explosion sequences, and whiz-bang car chase shoot-outs.  Though some would consider this a fault, I find this especially why I love the movie.
For those who haven't seen, the movie essentially takes place during one night in Europe.  Hawke has to exit a train after having briefly conversed with Delpy, and invites her to come with him and keep him company for the night while he waits for his transfer.  She adventurously accepts, and the night is spent walking the city as the two probe each other's minds and discover they like what they find.
Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy's performances are so raw and realistic that you get the feeling a truly romantic and intelligent movie without the help of a James Horner score.  More than being just a romantic movie, in illustrates the beauty of conversation, the thrill of doing something foolish, the beauty of finding wonder in the commonplace, and the wonder of finding beauty in another.
This movie is not a sappy emotional mess, like many of the pathetic excuses for movies we see these days.  I am a guy, and even I enjoyed this movie for its incredible ingenuity.  If you want to see an intelligent, interesting, different movie, see this completely underappreciated sleeper and tell your friends about it.
