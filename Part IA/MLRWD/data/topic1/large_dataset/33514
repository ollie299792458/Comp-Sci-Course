Set in 1907 a struggling musicologist fights against male dominated academia but ultimately finds gold in the the Appalachian mountains when she visits her sister and gets caught up in the spell binding whirlwind of mountain music.  Iris Dement has a short cameo as well as Taj Mahal which affords the discerning listener earthy cries and a true-bluesy guitar not lost in electronic jungle of equalizers and amplifiers.  The music will dwell in your chest for long after you hear it and for some it will be a sweet reminder of a distant home.  This movie won a Sundance award for ensemble cast but unfortunately due to one of the side elements of the story it did not come to the greatness that O Brother, Where Art Thou? did. The best moment was found in the duality that life always reeks of:  The pseudoprude Penleric informs her younger sister that her less-than-perfect ways are a detriment to the new found school--to say nothing of the Penleric's rompus room cover up she left back at the university amidst all those impressionable young minds.  Oh, death  . . .
