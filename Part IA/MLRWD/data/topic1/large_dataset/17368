Probably one of the most gleefully sick cult films to surface for sometime, Something Weird has packaged together the ultimate special edition of this wonderfully twisted comedy/horror gem. The extras for this disc are a lot of fun, starting with the commentary (by director Frank Henenlotter, co-star (the wonderful) Beverly Bonner and producer Edgar Ievins), behind-the-scenes footage, photos and artwork, a couple odd radio interviews with actress Terri Susan Smith and clips from Beverly Bonner's NYC television comedy show. There is also a video update hosted by Frank Henenlotter visiting some of the various locations they shot at and what they look like today. But the real star of this disc is the film itself which looks wonderful and clear and is still extremely funny and features some great background characters, creepy synth music and of course, in my favorite scene of all, the hilarious fate of the evil veternarian, Dr. Judith Kutter. What ever happened to that actress? Now let's see Something Weird do the same loving treatment for Henenlotter's equally brain-damaged Frankenhooker!
