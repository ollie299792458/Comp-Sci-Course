Nabokov's "Lolita" is a masterwork of psychological fiction of such complexity that one marvels that it could be rendered into film, but Adrian Lyne's version is a splendid success.  Jeremy Irons is perfectly  cast as Humbert. His superb portrayals of obsession include: Damage, Dead  Ringers, M. Butterfly, Swann in Love, and Betrayal, so it is not surprising  that he is so convincing as Humbert.  What is astounding is the chemistry  between Irons and Dominique Swain as Lolita.  Swain who had no previous  acting experience simply either cues off Irons or puts her own natural  instincts as a fourteen year old in Director Lyne's hands and delivers not  only a stunning nymphet portrayal, but its destructive effect upon her  life.
In the novel Humbert maintained he, "...had the utmost respect  for ordinary children with their purity and vulnerability....But how his  heart beat when, among the innocent throng, he espied a demon  child...maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many time  older than they, reveal their true nature which is not human, but nymphic  (that is demoniac)". It is this delusional obsession of his that traps  Lolita.  Ultimately in the depths of his remorse and self-hatred for what  he has done to her,and to cleanse himself of his obsession, he murders the  debauched Quilty,who has "cheated me of my redemption".  Viewers  will want to read the novel to experience Nabokov's marvelous art and the  full range of Humbert's ironic intricate character.
