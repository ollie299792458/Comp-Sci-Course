The other night, after seeing "A Simple Plan", I decided I had to see the other Raimi movie that I'd somehow missed when it originally came out.  "The Quick and the Dead" was absolutely great.  Unlike  the previously aforementioned film (in which the director was far more  reserved, and perhaps - dare I say - more refined), this was Raimi  unleashed, the spurs thrown off of him (no pun intended).  The shots were  amazing... I'm referring to the film shots, not the gun shots (which were  also pretty keen).  There is simply no way to describe some of those  camera angles.  The action was sharp, swift, and relentless.  Sharon Stone  was great... the "dark lone stranger coming to town".  It was  refreshing to see a woman in this role.  And Leanardo was actually  bearable.  Honest.  I couldn't believe it.  But I have to warn you.  This  film is not for everyone.  Some of the violence can be shocking, some of  the sequences absurd,... and,... well, if you're not used to Mr. Raimi's  visual flare, it may not be your cup of tea.  But I loved it.  And darn  tootin', that's what counts.
