This extended version of Kingdom of Heaven is a much deeper experience. There's alot mroe character depth, especially with many of the characters who we loved in the original film but who were there too briefly. Also this is alot more historically accurate, portraying the people and the times the way it should have been. This is definitely the definitive edition of this film, and to me the original is just a trailer. This changes everything about the story, even if it's no more than half an hour or so of extra footage, each extra scene is crucial and does change the perspective of the narrative. Plus, as a muslim, it is an excellent feeling to see one of our greatest and fairest leaders in history portrayed in the right manner, as a just loving person who taught his people how to respect all religions, especially that of christianity and judaism for they were all the same religion in the end under the same god. Entertaining, emotional, and highly political, I recomend this film to all.
