I started learning photography about 3 years ago and since then I've read several books, watched several DVD programs along with hundreds of youtube photography videos and took more than 20,000 pictures, some are posted here on Amazon's Canon 60D page..
I found this DVD series on Amazon and just finished watching it, it is GREAT for beginners, I sure wish I had it when I started learning photography..
In the first DVD, Manny talks in details about composition and gives some valuable tips on how to make your photo looks much better " The dominant subject, formal & informal composition ", then he talks about exposure in the second DVD explaining shutter speed, Aperture and ISO, in a simple and easy to understand way, he also explains lens types and when to use them.
In the third DVD he talks about different lighting situations, benefits of shooting during golden hour, and gives some examples about closeup and product photography..
The thing I liked the most about this set was the hands on shooting, as Manny filmed the shooting and explained step by step how to do it " Choosing location, Posing your subject, Holding the cam... " and showed pictures of before and after making some changes to get the perfect photo.

It's also worth mentioning that Manny uses a layman language and avoids difficult terms which makes these DVDs easier to understand for beginners!!

Get this DVD set, it's informative, and fun to watch!!
