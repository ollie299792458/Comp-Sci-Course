I found Matrix Reloaded to be thoroughly engrossing.  The feeling the movie generates (albeit a little heavy on the cliche war movie side) is so deep, so impactful, that I found myself dealing with the largest disappointment only upon leaving the theatre and realizing it was over.  The imagery of the movie is breathtaking, and while the acting is far from oscar material (Keanu, I love ya as Neo, but you could be out-acted by a inanimate carbon rod), it nevertheless pulls the movie through.  I especially liked the far more artistic and impactful manner the final neo-smith battle is executed in (I'm not ruining anything here... you KNEW they were going to fight) as "wire-fu" can only go so far before it plateaus on the excitement-meter.  While the movie does leave many questions unanswered, it ends the trilogy in an oddly satisfying and permanent manner.  I only hope that if there are ever any more matrix movies, they think hard about the idea before going forwards... the pure magic of this trilogy is a special thing, and I'd hate to see it go the way of batman (we ALL know what I'm talking about).  
This movie, in my opinion, is utterly forgiven for its faults.  Watch it for the art, immerse yourself in the story... and enjoy what it has to offer.  It offers quite a lot.
