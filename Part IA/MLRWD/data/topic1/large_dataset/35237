I think it is.
When a movie come showing us the simple and in the same time fascinating side of the life, living in harmony with the nature, playing sports with family and friends, without all that complicated and grotesque felling of trying to be so profounde and in the same time scarying people so many movies did. The only thing I'm sure this is a innocent movie. People are humans, they work, they smile and they cry, and they could be happy in the most coomns moments of their life, that's all this movie is about. In the metter fact, the story is so simple, it make you think what's this movie is trying to tell you, and doing only this, you already knew this movie isn't  here for money, it's here to be a truly masterpiece without trying to be for itself. Thinking of this, the answer about "is this heaven?" is, yes, it is. Heaven pure and clear.
Looking into the movie in the other side, you find a wonderful soundtrack that help you fell more grateful with the movie in the most touching moments, like in the end, in particullar. Good actors and a beautiful landscape that make you wish you were there, in the middle of all that magic.
The movie have great morals that goes along with the story, and right after seeing it, when the credits come, you only fell how simple was this movie and how honest and brilliant it was too.
