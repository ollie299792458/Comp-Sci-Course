A wonderful movie about the relationship between a woman, Ruby(Marisa Tomei), who has a bad history with men and Sam(Vincent D'Onofrio).  Ruby usually becomes connected to men who have problems.  She is the consumate enabler until she gets to a breaking  point.  Sam is a quirky young man who works in a hospice.  He is always drawing on a large tablet.  Ruby finds Sam gentle and spontaneous.  He will drop everything to buy her flowers even though he didn't know a carnation from a rose.
  Ruby finds Sam's tablet by accident and it reveals the name Christie DeLancey along with a picture of a pretty woman.  Devastated, Ruby now beleives that Sam is cheating on her.  Instead of the old lies all woman/men have heard, Sam tells her that he is from the year 2470 AD.  He has traveled into the past to find her.  Christie DeLancey is another "back traveler" and his contact in 1996.  She gets him his phoney documents and show him how to "flag" a cab.  Though I think all "back traveler" contacts should enclude a tour of the public library in their tour of the past.  But I suppose that would make the character of Sam less charming.  In an effort to show her how "back travel" works, he slides his hands on her leg
  Ruby then decides he is crazy and that he is yet another misfit that she "should" take care of.  She prepares to end the relationship, but her best friend, Gretchen(Nadia Danjani) tells her it's all about sex.  She is told it's a sex game and play along.
  In the end we learn whether Sam is crazy or not, but whether he is or not this is a romantic comedy that anyone might enjoy.  I own it and have watched it several times since I got it.
