What a great film.

"Twelve Angry Men" tells the story of twelve jurors selected to decide the fate of a young man accused of murder.  At the start of the film, everyone but one of the jurors in convinced of the young man's guilt.  But the sole juror refuse to budge until he's gotten the other jurors to at least consider that the young man really MIGHT be innocent.

Almost the entire black-and-white movie takes place in a small room around a table, and is obviously based on a play.  However, the story and the dialogue are so suspenseful, and the themes of guilt and innocence and judgement so skillfully explored, that the movie never feels long or boring.

And the end--the end is a classic, every moment of it.  You will finish it feeling great.

This is one of my very favorite movies, and I would recommend it to almost anyone.  To anyone cool, anyway.  You're cool, right?

It shows that you don't need car chases or sex appeal or anything beside a room and some people to absolutely saturate a film with suspense and tension.  The characters are fully realized, and their interaction is better than real life.

Do yourself a favor and watch it immediately.
