I am a big Agatha Christie fan, but most movies made from her books are disappointing. This one is not, however. The suspense is really good, and it's actually a very witty movie. One would think that it would be hard to laugh at a movie that has several murders in it, but you will find yourself doing just that on more than one occasion.

While there are no Clark Gable or Cary Grant-level stars in this, if you like old movies you will recognize almost everyone. It has many character actors that do a great job overall. In reality, I would say the only weak spot about this movie is the fact that the quality of the sound and picture isn't very good. It is an old movie that has not been remastered, so it is slightly distracting on that level at times. Overall, though, the quality of the movie itself removes those concerns.

As for the extras on this DVD, I laughed out loud at a couple of them. They are quite ridiculous, really, but very, very amusing.  One of the extras is a movie quiz about "And Then There Were None." There are about five questions that are really easy multiple choice questions. The amusing part comes when you get one wrong! Also, there are some "movie bloopers" included. Unfortunately, they are not bloopers from this movie, but they are amusing nonetheless--especially the first one!
