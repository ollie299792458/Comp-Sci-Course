It happens on many shows that when one or more of the principal characters transitions from high school to college, the series sometimes loses its footing. Gilmore Girls did lose some of what made it loveable from previous seasons in their fourth season.  Though good as always, the fourth season was lacking and it was a new dynamic to get used to.  However, any charm and wit that were lost in the fourth season are reclaimed in Gilmore's fifth and strongest season to date.

Season 5 explores Rory's journey into adulthood as she begins to embrace the life that her mother ran away from. Rory's relationship with the wealthy Logan Huntzberger unnerves her mother as much as it thrills and pleases her grandparents. We also see the long-awaited blossoming (and often tested) romance of Lorelai and Luke.  The audience is also exposed to a side of Richard and Emily that was only hinted at in previous seasons; their obsession with class, breeding and appearances. It manifests itself in horrible ways, driving a wedge between both Rory and Lorelai, as well as Lorelai and her mother with whom she had been on relatively good terms with in season 4.

The bonds between mother and daughter are tested both at the end and the beginning of season 5, in ways never before seen on this loveable, relatable and well-written season. Gilmore Girls has definitely emerged as a series that transcends all ages, races and genders.
