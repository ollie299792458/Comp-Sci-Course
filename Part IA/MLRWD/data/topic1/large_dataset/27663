After seeing trailers for the movie Chloe with Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried, my interest was sparked.  I read a few of the local movie reviews only to find that Chloe is actually a remake of the French film Nathalie.  I was unable to find a copy of this movie anywhere, so I took a chance and ordered from Amazon.  Needless to say, it was not a disappointment.  The idea for the movie was original: a wife with a professional career is concerned that her husband is cheating on her.  She hires a local "dancer" (i.e call girl) to try to attract her husband's attention and see if he will be unfaithful.  The wife gets what she is paying for, and soon finds out from "Nathalie" what her husband does behind her back.  The movie takes a few twists and turns and the two women seem to form a type of frienship.  How far it actually goes is left up to the viewers imagination.  This is where Nathalie differs from Chloe.  In Chloe the relationship is right there in the viewers face, which is fine, but some may prefer to ponder it for themselves.

The film is French with English subtitles and is pretty spicey.  Nothing too taboo, and I think it shows a little less than the naughty American version, Chloe! Emmanuelle Beart is never hard to watch, and Fanny Ardant was wonderful as the paranoid wife.  Gerard Depardieu played the cheating(?!?) husband, and the city of Paris set a pretty background for the whole movie.  All in all, I think it was worth buying the DVD. I never ended up going to the theater to see our version, I guess Nathalie took care of my curiosity.
