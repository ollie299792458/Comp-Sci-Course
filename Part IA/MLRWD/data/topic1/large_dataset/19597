The ominious black dvd cover almost made me bypass this one by.  However, I am a great fan of Naomi Watts so I decided to watch it figuring I could always eject.  This is two movies in one-a violent western and a charming romance-but it works really well.

This movie owes its fish-out-of-water plot to the 1950s Angel and the Badman which first recounted the story as a gunslinger and a Quaker lass.  The plot reappears in the early 1980s as Witness with a big city cop and a lovely Amish widow and son.  The Outsider has a beautiful Amish widow Rebecca Yoder(Watts), whose husband is murdered by cattleman who want their land, who develops feelings for a gravely wounded "shootist" named Johnny Gault (Tim Daly) whom she nurses him back to health to the disapproval of almost everyone.

The bearded and very sexy Daly nails his character perfectly, Watts is wonderful and their chemistry is just great!  The movie is filmed on location in New Zealand which passes nicely for Montana (ironically Australian Peter Weir came to the US to direct Witness).

The movie compelled me to read the Penelope Williamson novel.  Overall the movie is better edited than the book.  However (and these are minor quibbles), there some plot omissions that in my opinion would add richness to the film.  The viewer never learns the circumstances that led up to Gault being severely wounded and stumbling up on the Yoder farm in the first place! The movie's finale has been motified somewhat and I think that the novel gives a stronger character arc to the shootist.  I am sure the plot will be recycled again, its a sure winner.
