I hate to echo what so many other reviewers have stated here, but I really must.  Warners has pulled this nonsense before (namely, The OC Season 1)..."Standard Version - Presented In A Format Preserving The Aspect Ratio Of Its Original Television Exhibition".  This is a total load of BS.  Just because someone is watching a non-HD presentation does not mean it is the "original exhibition".  TNT HD broadcasts The Closer in high definition people!  As far as I know no other studio puts out second-rate releases like this.  I will give you a prime example that is relatable back to this situation...Battlestar Galactica.  Most people watch first-run episodes of BSG on Sci-Fi in standard definition with black bars all around because there simply is no available HD presentation (I don't have Univeral HD on my cable system and I don't even think they show first-run episodes at the same time Sci-Fi does).  However, Universal presents BSG in anamorphic widescreen on the DVD release!!  Fox (i.e. 24, Arrested Development), HBO (i.e. Six Feet Under, Deadwood), Disney (i.e. Alias, Desperate Housewives), etc. all release shows in anamorphic.  Welcome to the 21st Century Warners!  Get your head in the game.
