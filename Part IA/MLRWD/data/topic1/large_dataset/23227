I have most of the Bond films, and this one is excellent.  Make no mistake: we all lost out due to Brosnan's Remington Steele contract which kept him away from Bond for years.  Don't get me wrong: Timothy Dalton was a good Bond, for my money, better than Roger Moore in his later flicks, but Brosnan is great.
"Tomorrow" has everything we've come to expect, but a new twist is added by throwing in someone from Bond's past with Terri Hatcher's character of Paris.  The great thing about this element is actual character development for Bond, which is something we really haven't seen in decades.  The regret, the pain that James shows is becoming something of a trademark for Brosnan's Bond.  (See the entire relationship with Electra King in "The World is Not Enough".)
At long last, we're getting Bond with a soul.  Brosnan also brings a quiet air of menace that Bond hasn't had since Connery carried the Walther, which only makes the films better.  Sadly, I fear we may not get more than two or three more out of Brosnan before he decides to pass on the mantle.  "Tomorrow" has plenty of action, and one of the greatest Bond chase sequences ever.  Lots of cool gadgets, and pretty good screen time for Michelle Yeoh, who's a great counterpart for James.  Grab some popcorn (or perhaps a martini) and settle in for real entertainment.
