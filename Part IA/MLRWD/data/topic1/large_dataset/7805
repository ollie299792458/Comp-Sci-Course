It's amazing to me that so many people liked this movie because I just don't get it..., so you know that the story is basically the rise and fall of a drug dealing fool.  I found it hard to sympathize with George Jung's predicament because he's so completely responsible for it.  Am I supposed to feel for a man who sold drugs?  It's not like he was the man stealing bread to feed his family.  Johnny Depp is a great actor, but I wonder how many of these horrible roles he's going to take on.  Even with his charm, I could not bring myself to 1) like George as a character, or 2) like the movie.  The story was pretty standard, something I've seen a dozen times before... only not as good.  All you have to do nowadays is have a thin story, a nice soundtrack with old songs to reminisce by, and to set the time period, and a couple of montages, and your done.  Oh, I hear Cream, then it must be the 60s!  Wait, is that Wham?  Must be the 80's!  I suggest "Goodfellas" if you want to see a good movie on the criminal lifestyle.  Blow is a retread of better movies... though some might call that an homage.  Yea, right, an homage... that's what Blow wanted to be.  (I'm being sarcastic)  Better just pass this one by, unless your a uber Johnny Depp fan.  And even then, he's made better movies than this... go get those instead.
