Seinfeld was supposedly a show about nothing, which is partly what made it so funny.  The four main characters were involved in humorously exaggerated observations, situations, and experiences that often occur in everyday life.
This was a successful formula, so Larry David thought he'd use it for his own show, Curb Your Enthusiasm.  The problem is, Larry David's observations, situations, and experiences aren't funny; they're annoying.  Larry David makes a big dumb stink about every little thing, like a shirt or a fork.  Every ten seconds, we have to hear him complain about something else and it comes across as being calculated and forced.
When the characters in Seinfeld would talk about dating, the postal service, etc., it was genuinely funny.  When Larry David nitpicks nonsense like eating utensils or birthdays, it's irritating.
Perhaps worst of all is Larry David's unbelievably poor acting.  He has absolutely no comedic timing or charisma whatsoever.  He comes across as being some crotchety old guy with a stiff neck, which *could* actually be funny, but it just isn't with him.
If your idea of amazing comedy is an old bald guy studdering and constantly throwing his hands in the air in disgust, then by all means, watch Curb Your Enthusiasm and buy this set of DVD's.
