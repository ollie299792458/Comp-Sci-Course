Corman's World is, without a doubt, one of the best documentaries I've ever seen on film making.  It traces the man known as "King of the B's" from his beginnings as a messenger at Fox through his directorial exploits and on to his efforts with his own mini-studios, producing some of the most legendary exploitation movies ever made.

Perhaps the most telling thing that comes out of this documentary is the sheer number of interviews with legends whom Corman started.  Peter Fonda, Ron Howard, Joe Dante, Jonathan Demme, Pam Grier, and of course, Jack Nicholson, just to name a few of the luminaries contained in these frames.  The interviews with Howard and Nicholson are particularly funny and moving.  Howard's stories about Grand Theft Auto<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NJC0J8">The Ron Howard Action Pack (Eat My Dust! / Grand Theft Auto) [Roger Corman's Cult Classics</a>] are priceless, and Nicholson's interviews are both funny and moving.  At one moment, Nicholson recounts how Corman was the only person who would hire him for the first decade of his career...the next, he says 'Is Roger feeling unappreciated?  I'll go over there right now!'

There's an unexpected warmth at the heart of the documentary.  Through the lens of the filmmakers, we learn that Corman is a man with true passion for film, even while cranking out exploitation by the ton...and his friends, followers, and proteges share this same passion.

Even if you don't like movies from the Corman side of the aisle (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317LM8S">Piranha [Roger Corman's Cult Classics</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CNQPOC">Galaxy Of Terror (Roger Corman's Cult Classics)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038SUBEG">Death Race 2000 (Roger Corman's Cult Classics)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FUHUM">Big Bad Mama / Big Bad Mama II (Roger Corman's Cult Classics)</a>, to name just a few), you owe it to yourself to watch this fascinating documentary on a director/producer who did it his way.

The late David Carradine mentions that people would insult Corman, calling him "the King of the B's."  As a fan of the genre, I can't imagine a higher compliment.  Wonderful.
