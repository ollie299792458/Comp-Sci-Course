I am a pretty solid John Carpenter fan (Halloween, The Thing, Escape from New York, etc.), so I'll say that up front.  This film, though, is not among his better works.  It really does start out fairly interesting (the acting and costumes and even the models/sets are pretty good - note the train, especially, which really isn't bad and is semi-believable), but then really just descends into an us-or-them battle that drags out for the rest of the movie. The plot is really as simple as it gets (NOTE: SPOILER FOLLOWS)... a cloud of some kind of microorganism is released and possesses the local humans.  That's the plot, in a nutshell.  The rest is just a running gun battle.  Jason Statham and Natasha Henstridge are the acting high points (though his unrequited attempts at her get old pretty quickly) Sorry - I wish there was more to tell you, but it really is as straighforward as that.  If you like Carpenter and his films, you will probably like this to some degree.  Though I don't think that even sci-fi or horror fans will find much here to enjoy.

Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...
