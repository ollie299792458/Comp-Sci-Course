SUPER GRUESOME AND BLOODY ALL THE WAY THROUGH!  Save your money on the purchase.  Rent it first.  Then decide if you want to own it; that is - if you just can't pass it up.  If you're like me, your interest in this film was piqued after hearing raving reviews saying how it was the best action film in decades.  You watch the trailer and aren't quite sure what to think?  It sounds like there will be excellent fight scenes.  You too, are hoping to be entertained from start to finish in the same way that historic epic Kung Fu movies have mastered.  I absolutely love a good martial arts film; Kung Fu especially.  This was far from it.  Truly a let down.

What was the SIZZLE that made me think this would be a good film?  It's being marketed as created by the same creators from the top notch films 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' and 'Kung Fu Hustle'.  Two of the most excellent martial arts films ever!  You don't say?  Hmm... it's odd how I am struggling to find out exactly what part of the "creation team" earned the credit used by marketing?  Oh, I know!  It must of been the graphic artist that worked on the title splash.  *cough*  *cough*  I apologize if I have missed some key connection here somehow.

*MILD SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE DOWN*

There are three good hand-to-hand combat scenes that end in extremely disgusting, very graphic and disturbing death scenes.  That is the film in a nutshell.  Very graphic violence.  Amazon didn't miss this point.  I should have listened.  Just... yuck!  It's a full out slaughter fest from start to finish.  It's a low budget film?  Yeah, it shows.  I do give props to the camera and lighting crew.  They did an excellent job managing with what they had to work with on the set of some sleazy, rat-hole, junkie-infested slum building/set that was filmed somewhere in Indonesia?  Ugh.  I wish I had my money & time back that I wasted on this one.
