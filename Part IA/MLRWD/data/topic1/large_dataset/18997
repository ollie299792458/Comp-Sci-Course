I understand that its a foreign film and that they are viewed differently from American products, but I picked this up at the local video store without realizing this and was very unhappy. 
The slow slow credits punctuated with a very obnoxious video static effect gives a taste of whats to come. Virtually no musical score, what I consider very poor acting and it drags and drags and drags! 
The ship crashes on Mars, I don't really know why, I was already fast-forwarding the DVD by this time (10 minutes into the movie).. you don't see much of a crash, just the aftermath with astronauts being incredibly unprofessional and standing around saying "that was horrible".. the movie lost all credibility for me. In a real emergency astronauts follow checklists to shut down critical systems, look for problems like air leaking and stay in contact with Earth. They don't take off all their suits snd stand around and talk about how "horrible" the crash was.
fastforwarding through the movie, it seems to be endless wandering around and talking in the one room of the spaceship. Obviously this was the big dramatic scene where they figure out that there isn't enough air for all of them and some go off to die. Since a rescue mission is more than 2 years away it seems pretty amazing that they would have 1 year of air for all of them (so that half can leave and the rest have enough air) but anyway they wander off and find a cave. I won't spoil it for you in case you watch but it does feature an incredibly unemotional death scene and a bizarre and totally unbelievable ending.
I can't recommend this one unless your really into the slow artsy foreign films.
