When I finally saw this DVD in the store after YEARS of waiting - I literally "yelped" as my hand snatched it from the shelf. The DVD was a must-buy and should be for any fan of this all-time great show. I spent hours that night relishing over every episode I could fit in. There were even some episodes I had never been able to see prior, and that, alone, was priceless. However, there is something that must be mentioned. Soon after the episodes get going; in the "preludes" and "prologues"; I began to notice scenes that were referred to having occurred, but I did not get to view in the episode I just watched. For example, When Danny is hiding from the mob, he frequently changes costumes as part of a running gag. The voiceover refers to Danny dressing as an elderly Jewish man. But the scene was cut from the episode for some reason and is not viewable. Once or twice is forgivable, but the more episodes that played the more I realized I am still missing out on little scenes that were not included on this DVD. Which means that hopefully someone will come out with the "really complete" version one day. To title this DVD as "Complete" is truly false advertising, as there are many small scenes which are edited out. Nevertheless, it is extremely enjoyable and further DVDs will be purchased from me. So if you are a fan of this Television Classic, by all means, purchase it and ride the roller coaster of Soap all over again. If you are a truly hard-core Soap fan, however, buy it - but be ready to experience that nagging feeling like you've missed something that might seem trivial to some, but vital to the collector. Plus, would it kill 'em to add some special features such as commentaries or interviews by some of the surviving cast?
