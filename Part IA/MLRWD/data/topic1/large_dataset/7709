First Blood: First Artisan Entertainment has done and outstanding job bringing this to DVD.  The wide-screen format changes this entire movie, if you have only seen it on the standard Pan &amp; Scan on video you are  missing out.  Sound quality is also outstanding.  However forget the  documentary: A look back.  Now about the movie: Why the hell to people say  this movie is so violent!  There is only one death caused in the movie  (watch it and count for yourself)!  This movie is full of action, but if  you watch it and really think about who and what John Rambo is, you will  find that this movie is emotional too.  Just think of how isolated Rambo  most feel with all his friends from the war dead.  Then returning home to a  country that judged and hating him for fighting in a war.  So returned home  a killing machine that can't hold down a job and is now a drifter.  Trying  to find an old war buddy.  Then harassed and abused by the local sheriff  deparment cause of the way he looks! He is also suffering from Post  Dramatic Stress Disorder, which is why he snaps in the jail.  Just watch  the end of this movie 2 or 3 times when Rambo brakes down in front of the  colonel.  If you don't start to feel emotional then something is wrong with  you.  Read the book too!
