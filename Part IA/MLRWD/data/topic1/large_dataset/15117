My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and has a speech disorder (her delay at the time of this writing is about 12 months). She is talking a lot more lately and signing less but still found this DVD interesting.

She is not the only toddler I have heard of recently who has learned not only new signs from this DVD but actual verbal words. I have had to specifically teach her most of the words that she now speaks but after viewing this DVD she spoke words that I have previously tried to get her to say (i.e., clock, cup, couch, etc.) and failed!

I also appreciated the variety of signs presented as well. There are so many baby signing DVD's on the market today and a lot of them show the same basic signs - which is perfectly fine, as children need to start somewhere, and there are a certain amount of signs that most children start with. But within the 25 signs shown on this DVD were ones she hadn't been exposed to, which prompted her making the sign as well as speaking the word.

I hope this DVD brings signing with babies a lot more exposure, because I think that it is such a wonderful thing to start with children.
