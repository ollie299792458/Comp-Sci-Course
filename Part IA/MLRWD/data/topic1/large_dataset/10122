I remember seeing "House By The Cemetery" at a San Diego movie theatre back in 1985; I can't remember under what title it was under, but I never forgot this movie. The special effects were low-budget, but influential (the knife in the back of the head would appear again in "Pieces"). I'm sure I would have appreciated the acting a lot more if there were a version available in the original language. I rather enjoyed the children: the hapless Bob and the unfortunate, but helpful, Mae. I would agree that whoever provided the voice-over dub for Bob did not do him justice. Still, this was a creepy movie. Over the past two months I've seen it about 5 times and developed a deeper appreciation for it and Fulci's work in general. If you think that horror began with the "Saw" series, then this one isn't for you. But if you can get past low-budget special effects and marginal dubbing and acting, then you'll enjoy this. NOTE:  "House By The Cemetery" appears in low-budget collections as "Zombie Hell House"; stay away from that poor version.
