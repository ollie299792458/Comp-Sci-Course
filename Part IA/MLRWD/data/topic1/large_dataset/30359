OK! There are some sticks-in-the-mud who would say that this season is corny or boring compared with the first two seasons, however, it is my favorite season, probably BECAUSE of some of the corny episodes which make the season fun to watch. The episode, "Turnabout Intruder" actually required MORE acting skills on Shatner's part than fewer skills since he had to convince the audience he was actually an evil woman inhabiting Kirk's body. I think Shatner did such a good job behaving like an evil woman he was almost embarrassing to watch. This is definitely the best laugh-out-loud episode of this season.

The episode "For The World is Hollow and I Hath Touched The Sky" has the most poetic title of any episode and was a wonderful story on how governments can keep the masses in darkness and live a lie. The episode "The Paradise Syndrome" was one of the best love stories on the entire series and was extremely sad in the end. The episode "The Tholian Web" was one of the greatest episodes of all time which not only had great special effects but was the best one in terms of the usual verbal battle between Dr. McCoy and Spock.

All in all, it is the best season to watch if you watch just for the fun of it. You don't watch for deep hidden meaning and moral messages - that's in the first two seasons - you watch it just to sit back and enjoy yourself.
