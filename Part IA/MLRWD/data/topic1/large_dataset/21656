In this film, Maggie Cheung plays Emily, a drug-addicted rock singer whose husband dies of an overdose. She decides to rebuild her life so she can take care of her son.

Not a plot out of the ordinary, but this film delivers brilliantly thanks to great acting all around, especially from Cheung and Nick Nolte as her father in law, and to the moderation with which it portrays emotion. No histrionic bursts, no big cathartic revelations of childhood complexes or other typical paraphernalia.

In one scene, Emily sees her son for the first time in over a year. He tells her he blames her for his father's death, and she explains that drugs are more complicated than he's been told. Not a trace of condescension while she speaks, not a trace of cuteness from the boy. What a relief!

This is Assayas and Cheung's second collaboration after Irma Vep. I find this one a fuller and much more interesting film. The cinematography and soundtrack are also very nice, and by the way, Brian Eno's "An Ending" keeps playing in the background. A nod to Traffic?

A pleasure to watch.
