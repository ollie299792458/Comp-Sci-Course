I LOVE THIS SERIES!
I can NOT say enough good things
about this show and it's star, the fantastic,
adorable, amazing, talented, wonderful, funny,
beautiful PATTY DUKE!!!!!!
I have been waiting for this release
to happen for so many years!
I watched reruns every weekday
afternoon for many years (didn't
really see the initial run being born
in 1962...I remember it being on and my
parents and older siblings watching it)
It hasn't been shown for years (Thanks TV Land
and Nick At Night...you were great AT ONE TIME...
not anymore)
I am so excited for this release!
I can say without a doubt that when I receive
this set, I will sit in front of my television
set, ignore the phone, knocks on my door and
probably even my cat's (she can sit on my lap during the viewing)
desire to play while I watch EVERY SINGLE episode! Good Grief, I may
even have to call off work! LOL
THANK YOU!!!!!
I'm going to celebrate the release by
playing my Patty Duke vinyl! I realize that
she was not the best singer in the world but I
enjoy them!!!!!
I'm also going to get my Patty Duke Board game out
and make my friends play! They will just NEED TO DEAL!
I do hope the other seasons are released quickly!
YEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
