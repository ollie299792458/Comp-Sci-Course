If you love Hitchcock or if you love golden screen star Laurence Olivier, you will fall head over heals in love with this film! I came across REBECCA while I was in college, majoring in English Literature. I first read the book, which by the way is an excellent read. Then, I viewed this film and was required to write a long paper on a comparison of the two. On a whole, the screenplay remains true to the book, so if you want the ending of this film to maintain its shock value, read the book last. 
REBECCA is mysterious and haunting. The second Mrs. de Winter, played by Joan Fontaine, is plain, timid and shy. While on vacation with her overbearing employer, she meets the wealthy, handsome and intriguing Max de Winter, played by Laurence Olivier. She is awe-struck by him and even more surprised when he begins to pursue her. In a matter of days, they marry. She hardly knows anything about this man, except that he loves his beloved estate. However, when he takes his new bride home, she discovers that the huge mansion has some dark secrets and that his late wife, Rebecca, still lives in spirit at the estate. And Rebecca isn't exactly  . . . hospitable.
