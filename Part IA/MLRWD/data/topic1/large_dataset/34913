As a Runaways fan, I would've loved to see a documentary featuring their music and a VH-1 Behind the Music Treatment. Joan Jett's refusal to license her music or cooperate with filmmaker Vickie Blue nixed that possibility.

However, the film that resulted is a far more interesting, psychologically rich documentary that is as much a study of how different people process early trauma as it is a study of a bunch of starry-eyed American girls who truly believed that if they just worked hard enough, they could achieve their rock 'n' roll dream.

In some ways, this movie reminded me of the Tibetan film Windhorse, which was about three childhood friends who took very different roads after witnessing a murder. The Runaways were taken away from their parents at a young age and not just neglected, but abused as producer Kim Fowley cynically exploited their dreams and talents, and treated them to a psychologically, verbally, sexually abusive boot camp. One girl never got over it, one girl nearly killed herself before getting out, and one girl just "won't go there." I was fascinated to see that another reviewer pegs Lita Ford as the Scarlett O'Hara survivor. Like Scarlett, Lita Ford may have saved Tara, but she seems to have sacrified grace and compassion, and large blocks of memory too. She survived, but at what cost?

This is one of those movies to own, to watch with friends and family members and start a dialogue about how in our naivite, we can fall victim to divide and conquer, and yet if we allow ourselves to face the pain of our past, we can also access some wonderful memories. The trick is, how do you stop living in the past, or repressing it, and instead incorporate it into your life, and move forward, transcending the pain?

Absolutely riveting.
