I first saw this show on the History channel last year and was fascinated mostly with the way television covered it in those early days of the medium itself.
Compared to today's high tech way with its immediate, live style, the technology back then was virtually tin cans & string.
I remember hearing the late Walter Cronkite describe why, when he interrupted the soap opera "As The World Turns", he was not seen in the CBS Newsroom but instead a slide appeared saying simply "CBS News Bulletin" was because they had to wait several minutes for a camera to warm up.
Another fsacinating thing to see was during the reports from the Dallas police headquarters with the gaggle of reporters in the hallway, there was but one pool camera that the reporters had to wait their turns to use. One camera, several reporters.
This is the best documentary on that weekend I've seen yet. Part one is the best. Part two is mostly a collection of various other shows and documentaries talking about the various conspiracies and also the first time anywhere on TV the broadcast of the famed Zapruder film which was introduced by Geraldo Rivera which included gasps of shock from his studio audience who had until then never seen it.
