The joy of this musical is that it takes a playful take on a somewhat satirical source <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451627092">How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying: With a New Introduction by Stanley Bing</a>.  Watching it today is a delightful romp in political incorrectness that was very much tongue in cheek even in its day. Robert Morse successfully brings his (Tony award winning) Broadway production with all the mania and effervescent energy to the large screen. Crooner Rudy Vallee brings such charm to his portrayal that we forget that he's a dirty old (philandering) man who really isn't very good at his job, which happens to be presiding over a large and presumably successful conglomerate. Michelle Lee shows through her performance as the single steadying influence how she can be sexy, sincere, and still act as the straight woman to all of the craziness surrounding her.

Watch only if you: have a sense of humor, or don't mind seeing "how things used to be". Actually, watch it no matter who you are. It's like cotton candy at the fair: light, airy, and there simply for enjoyment without pretending to nourish.
