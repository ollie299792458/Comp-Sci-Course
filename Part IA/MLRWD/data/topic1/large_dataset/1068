My parents rented this on VHS and I didn't really wanna watch it becuz it didn't seem like my kind of movie. But I watched it anyway, and I loved it. (This was when I had no idea who Ben was) The next day I watched it again and again. The next week my parents bought it on VHS for me. I watched it so many times the tape turned out to be so scratched up. With my own money I went to the local video store and bought the DVD of Reindeer Games. Without knowing, I had bought the Director's Cut and when I was watching it I was like, "Whoa! This is new." I like the Director's Cut better becuz you see Ben's great tattoos, he gets hit with 5 darts instead of 2, and Ben gets a bigger attitude towards Charlize in the movie. He hecka yells at her! I was laughing at that part. I love this movie. Both the original theatrical and the Director's Cut! On the Director's Cut, they even show the original scenes as Bonus Material. So you still have the other scenes. I love this and I'll probably end up ruining the DVD too, but Ben's worth it.
