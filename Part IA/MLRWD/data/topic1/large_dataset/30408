I believe Monty Python had an impact on comedy that was so all-pervasive, it staggers the mind to consider the magnitude of it. This movie, their first, became a classic and my all-time favorite comedy the very first time I saw it. I left the theater thinking to myself, "That flick will never be surpassed in its own genre of comedy." And, I was right.
I have probably watched this film at least 45 - 50 times, and yet, I still catch something new everytime. Some new funny line that I never picked up before.
I know a review should give some hint as to what the plot is all about, so I will tell you this: The plot borrows a little from the ancient story of King Arthur. Arthur and his men are given instructions by God to find the Holy Grail. They must overcome many harrowing experiences to achieve this goal. For instance, they have to appease the dreaded "Knights Who Say Nee!" (Hint: Just don't use the word, "it" in front of them!) Arthur is forced to fight the Black Knight - this scene is very bloody -- not for children. Then, there is the bridge of death. "He who wishes to pass this bridge must answer me these questions three," says the bridge-keeper, a very scary individual, indeed.
Arthur and his men prove themselves to be very courageous - well, except for Robin.
I won't tell you if they achieve their goal, but I will say the ending is quite a twist in the plot.
