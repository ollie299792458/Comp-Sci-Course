I wonder why, whenever Hitchcock made a film with Peck, it was devoid of the atmosphere that marked so many of his "classics." This is not to say, however, that *Spellbound* is not an enjoyable movie with hints of Hitchcock flair.
Don't take the psychology seriously. If it's going to ruin the film, then just put it aside. Concentrate on the chemistry between Peck and Bergman. Contrary to what some may think, I do believe there is a distinct chemistry between these two actors. It's in the way she touches his face as he lays sleeping on the couch, in the way he looks at her as he tries to convince himself that he is normal. There is a certain quietude to it that underlies the tension nicely.
And, I must admit, the stark terror on Peck's face as he begins to remember is humorous. It shouldn't be, it's really not meant to be, I know, but it is. It's so stupidly charming that you have to smile. In some strange way this added to the appeal of the film.
This may not be the best film that Hitchcock ever made, but I still liked it and would watch it more than once. Bergman was suitably lovely, Peck steadfastly sexy(despite the goofy terror shots,) and the plot, for the time it was made, wasn't all that poor. Just prepare to have the remote in hand with your finger on the volume. You'll be needing to adjust throughout.
