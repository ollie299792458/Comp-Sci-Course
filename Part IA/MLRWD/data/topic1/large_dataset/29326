Hellraiser is a true classic. This is truely one of the most original horror films around. Forget some of the horror films out today, quite frankly they don't cut it for me. Hellraiser is a highly original, scary, exciting film. This should be in any horror fans collection. There's something special about 'Hellraiser'. Out of all the years I've constantly watched 'Hellraiser', it's never lost it's appeal to me. There's a high originality about it. The story line between the Cenobites and the Puzzle Box(the lament configeration) are compellingly mesmerizing and so fasinating. A definite must have for all horror fans. The musicial score by composer Christopher Young is compelling and mesmerizing. It makes it each scene more memorable. The extras on the DVD are what the real fans have been waiting for. The commentary track by Clive Barker, Ashley Laurence and Pete Atkins is superb(it's one of my favourite commentary tracks), the featurette is excellent and informative in  the process of the film.There's a nice photo gallery and a trailer, and I love the menu on the DVD. This a excellent movie that every horror fan must see and own. by Justine Ryan
