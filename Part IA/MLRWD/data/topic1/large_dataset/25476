just one complaint but it's a big one.  under the blurb on the hollywood bowl it states clearly that the "incomparable parrot sketch" is one performed along with the lumberjack song and the philosophers song.  the only reason i bought the set was for the parrot sketch.  CAVEAT EMPTOR---THE PARROT SKETCH IS NOT ON EITHER DISC! there is about a 2 minute clip of the parrot sketch included in the aspen part of disc 1.  but that is all.  terribly disappointed not to have the parrot sketch!  but there is a bit in the aspen discussion group involving GRAHAM CHAPMAN'S ASHES that is worth the price of the 2-disc set.  i saw it on tv when it initially aired and laughed probably as hard as i did the first time i heard the parrot sketch.  when i saw it these 5 years later i was surprised that i laughed just as hard and as long as i did the first time. you have to see it to believe it.
just be aware of what you are and are not getting.  would have given it 5 plus stars if the parrot sketch were included.
