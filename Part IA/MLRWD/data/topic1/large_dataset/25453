Back in 1975 I first saw Andy Kaufman on Saturday Night Live. He did Foriegn Man singing along to the chorus of the Mighty Mouse theme on a cheap portable record player. I was laughing hystericaly through the entire bit. Then he did Elvis. I recognized him to be the genius that he was. Andy challenged us as fans of his performance art. We didn't always "Get it" and just when we did he would tweak our noses again. We the informed, the elite, the insiders on the joke KNEW he was Tony Clifton as well. The disgusting, untallented and obnoxius lounge singer. It was FUNNY because of the shocked and confused reactions of the audience arround us who didn't know. Then Andy came out on stage beside Clifton. We were as shocked and confused as the uninitiated. Andy had fooled us to. It was amazingly funny and timeless.  Staged fights on live TV. Staged "inter-gender" wrestleing. TV appearances on Letterman in the morning as a near homeless hasbeen panhandling the audience.

Jim Carey was the ONLY choice to play Andy. No one else could do as accurite portrayal. Carey nailed Andy, his expressions and his mania. Andy didn't always make us laugh. But he made us feel. Carey's performance makes me feel the same things I did 30 years ago and more when I saw Andy perform.

Thank you very much.......
