Santa Buddies is your usual Christmas romp and takes no risks. Kids will love the talking dogs but adults will probably not. Santa Buddies is intended for kids, not adults, so whether you can sit through a viewing of this with your kids totally depends on your tolerance for inane children's programming, cutesy stuff, and cynicism. All the dogs are voiced by child actors 10-15 years old. The story itself is safe, standard Disney family-friendly fare that sticks to a well-trodden formula, featuring no surprises or shocks of any kind. It's the same story of the "true meaning of Christmas" (which is that the holiday is not about presents, but about friends helping each other), which you've seen a thousand times. It's mostly <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416534784">A Christmas Carol</a> with canines, down to the dog catcher (Christopher Lloyd) named "S. Cruge" (Scrooge), and a tiny pipsqueak of a dog later in the movie named, rather imaginatively, "Tiny".

At the North Pole, the magical Christmas Icicle is melting because people don't believe in Christmas anymore. For adults, the eye-rolling starts now. Christmas spirit powers Santa's workshop and his sleigh, like it does in so many movies, including the adult-friendly Will Ferrel comedy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5CH0G">Elf</a>. The main character is Puppy Paws, the mischievous son of Santa Paws, who is the dog version of Santa Claus. Puppy Paws is grounded after causing havoc to the workshop. He wishes that "Christmas would just disappear" and wants to be an ordinary pup. He then hides in one of the elves' USPS mail trucks and runs away to the real world, the town of Fernfield, an idyllic representation of small Anytown, USA.

Here he meets the buddies, each a character stereotype. We have the surfer dude who ends every sentence with "dude", the b-boy who says "dawg" and "fo'shizzle" a lot (named B-Dawg, naturally), a fashionista (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Rosebud</a>), and a super-chill dog who speaks in more complicated sentences (named Buddha). Puppy Paws gets into more trouble with each of them. Eventually, they save Christmas and turn S. Cruge around, just like A Christmas Carol. It's all very predictable family-oriented stuff that you can expect from Disney. You can leave your kids alone with this if you can't tolerate the onscreen antics.

One criticism from another reviewer is that this movie kills the magic of Christmas for kids who still believe in Santa, but I disagree. Near the beginning, some dogs talk about Santa being their dads dressed up with a beard and a red suit. In a later scene, a mall Santa is shown being grumpy and taking off his beard. The movie makes it clear in dialog that such mall Santas and elves are Santa's helpers. The real Santa Claus (portrayed by a comatose George Wendt) is at the North Pole busy preparing for Christmas and can't be everywhere at once. To a kid, this would be a logical and plausible explanation for seeing Santas all over the place, or their dads dressing up as the jolly fat man.

Blu-Ray Disc Features:

The disc itself is only average. This is a straight-to-DVD release and it shows. The transfer is excellent, crisp, and detailed, but some of the CG is very fake looking (like Puppy Paws tumbling out of the chimney and him break-dancing). The reindeer and North Pole landscape also look fake, but kids are unlikely to notice. Special features are thin. Included are 3 sing-alongs ("Deck the Halls", "We Wish You a Merry Christmas", "Santa Paws is Comin' to Town"). The music video by Steve Rushton is very irritating and I had to turn it off after 30 seconds. If this is part of the "never-before-seen bonus material" advertised, it should not be seen. The Sneak Peeks (upcoming Blu-ray and theatrical releases) is probably the most interesting part of this disc for adults! There's about 8 of them (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZTQVBQ">Ponyo</a>, Dumbo 70th Anniversary Blu-ray, The Princess and the Frog, Toy Story 3, etc). BD-Live continues to be a nearly worthless feature. It took more than 2 minutes to load and is just trailers. The only purpose I see for the cumbersome interface is just to frustrate kids and adults alike.

I'm giving this movie a 4, considering the age target. Kids'll likely enjoy it if they like talking animals and cutesy stuff. I was able to tolerate it and sit through one viewing, but you might not. Mercifully, this video is only 88 minutes long, which may be 88 minutes too long for some parents. I don't think I laughed once, except at the bad CG. Fans of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IYEQR4">Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut</a> film will recognize Danny Woodburn (Eli the Elf). The disc itself is only average, but a DVD version is included, so it's a good value.
