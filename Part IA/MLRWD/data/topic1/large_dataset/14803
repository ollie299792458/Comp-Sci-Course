Yes, conditions at Andersoville were horrible, food in short supply, once proud uniforms now simply rags, however, the ones to blame for the conditons are the northern leadership not the cash strapped southern goverment. The blockake of Southern ports was strangling the Southern economy (and most of the ag land in the South was for cash crops NOT foodstuffs)The civilans of the South and thier armies were short of everything especially food, its not like they were withholding supplies out of malice but they barely had any for themselves. The north knew this and stopped the prisoner exhange system to further deny the South released prisoners but also to stretch Southern resources to the breaking point. Southern POW's in Northern prison camps suffered the same hardships, however, the North did not suffer from the economic shortages the South. Oh and when Sherman was running all over GErogia with no resistance why didn't he liberate Andersonville, hmmmm perhaps it was to further stretch Southern mand power and resrouces till the very end point.
