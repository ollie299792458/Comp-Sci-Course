There is no doubt that America was/is a great ally to the UK and their contribution in WW2 was outstanding.  However, this movie stretches to the extreme Hollywood's self given right to bend the truth as it depicts Bon Jovi and his US forces chums capturing the first Enigma machine, this despite the fact that it was actually the Royal Navy who captured the first Enigma on April 15th 1940.  This was of course three years before the USA joined the European conflict.  Shame on you Hollywood.

In 2006, screenwriter David Ayer admitted that U-571 distorted history and stated that he would not do it again.  Ayer told BBC Radio 4's The Film Programme that he "did not feel good" about suggesting Americans captured the Naval Enigma cipher rather than the British.  " It was a distortion...a mercenary decision...to create this parallel history in order to drive the movie for an American audience. Both my grandparents were officers in World War II, and I would be personally offended if somebody distorted their achievements.
