Me and Rambo are so much alike, before I ever saw this movie, I would usually say "Yes I fired few shots from my ass".  I think somebody stoled this phrase from me and I know the guy who did it

Rambo. Uncut virsion actually says above line not what they show in the movie.  Oh yeah this movie is so silly, those people who played freedom fighters are so funny and stupid, I like when one of them asks Rambo, "What's a football, you play for a food"? My answer would be yes you stinking muharajee.  Throughout the movie I just wanted to guide those russian choppers to these "freedom fighters".  Yeah Rambo is an idiot, this stupid country thinks it could control everybody and act like Rambo as an answer to every problem, listen to what I say to that "I fired a few shots from my ass". It gets better, when Rambo comes to Afganistan he says I'm no tourist with a straight face, I laughed till I pooped. Throughout this movie I dropped my pants many times to moon those freedom fighters, they can't even build a school but they can run around like goats all day long and fight

Those people who play Afganeese look like italians without suits hahahaha.  I liked when russian soldier was dragging one of the afganeese by his hair, it turned out to be a lesson in ethics, the only language those muharajees understand. After, helping those people Rambo deserves a special treatment from russian tanks, russians should of tied his arms to one tank and his legs to another and start driving in different directions, see how tough he is... yes this movie taught us a great lessons - nothing
