"My son and I can write that in a month" Wes Craven, on being asked to write this script.
Well Wes....we could tell. Tons of plot flaws, so pay attention, you'll have fun pointing them all out. Subtle anti war anti Bush overtones. Weak pushover becomes hero clich&eacute;. I could go on and on about the negatives.

What saves this film, and makes it somewhat entertaining is the spectacular special effects. Incredible make up artistry, from prosthetic make-up to set design, this film is visually stunning. The actors do a nice job, especially the mutants. The action is fast paced and the violence and gore factors are through the roof.

This version of the film has some very nice Special features, including gag reel, alternate ending, deleted scenes, a nice making of, a making of the graphic novel prequel and a section called MUTANT attacks, which gives us some insights into the mutants and their creation and makeup. It also has a cool "life after film school" section which has 3 students interviewing Wes craven about the film.

I gave this film 3 stars because it is beautifully filmed, the action and special effects are first rate, and the actors do a nice job. I say this one is a one to rent, or buy used...probably not one you'll watch more then once.
