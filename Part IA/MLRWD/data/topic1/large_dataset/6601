Prior to watching "High Noon", I watched several very good westerns:  "The Broken Arrow" and "The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance".

Then comes along "High Noon."  All I can say is WOW!

This is not only a great western, it is one of the best movies ever made.

Be sure to watch film historian Leonard Maltin's segment at the end of the film where you will have the privilege of seeing some of the main artists involved in the making of the film talk about it.  It is fascinating.

Without Gary Cooper, I don't believe this film could or would have been made.  It required an actor who was an ambivert - not totally introverted or he could not have portrayed the role, but not totally extroverted either, or we would not have the nuances of an inner life which shown through Cooper's performance.  His was the academy award that year, and it was wholly deserved.

If you haven't seen this film, don't hesitate.  I somehow compare it to another great film, "Grand Illusion," also filmed in black and white with a low budget.  When the talent, intelligence and integrity are there on the part of every important member of the creative team, these films show us that frills are just what they are:  frills.

Don't miss this one and deprive yourself.
