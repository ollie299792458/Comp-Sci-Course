"Marooned" (1969), starring some heavy-hitting talent (including Gregory Peck, Gene Hackman, David Janseen, and James Fransicuss) shows how a slow, measured, methodical pace with each frame filled with intelligence can succeed brilliantly where so many of today's short-attention-span-geared films fail miserably.  The nicely-serviceable special effects, the attention to detail that rivals/surpasses that of "2001: a space odyssey" (the hardware is firmly-grounded on then-present day technology), the slow, plodding nail-biter pace, and the fine acting all make for a great film.  While there are those who think that the slow pace makes this a boring film, I submit that these critics are more often than not of the "raw-meat/15-minute-maximum attention span/Rambo" school of film fandom.  However, if you are aching for an intellectual gem of a film that acknowledges that you've actually got a brain -- case in point: this film portrays the Russian space effort (which was, back in '69, the only other manned space game in our global village) in a respectful light -- then "Marooned" is just what the doctor ordered.
