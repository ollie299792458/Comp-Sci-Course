Thunderheart is one those rare films that takes real life events and strings them together in a short space of time so that viewers get a clear picture of the people and the issues faced. Based off of a number of events that happened in the mid seventies, you see the Leonard Peltier incident, the siege at Wounded Knee between Indians and Federal Agents and you see an approximation regarding the murder of Anna Mae Aquash because she was talking about uranium.  Graham Greene plays Walter Crow Horse, Val Kilmer is Agent Lavoi and former AIM Chairman, John Trudell - who was there for many of these events and then some - plays Jimmy Loooks Twice.  All are fabulous in their respective roles. This film gives a very good synopsis as to what First Nations peoples face to this day with regard to sovereignty, land rights, and just outright survival of both their culture and the People themselves.

When you grow up in an Indigenous household and you saw these events being reported in the various tribal newspapers of the era as well as on the news or hearing your relatives talk about them, it realy hits home in a big way.  These are images and events that will be with me my entire life because some of us were keenly awre of them.  It is refreshing to see the story be told in a way that is not pure Hollywood hype as some reviewers have charged. I am not sure that the movie was meant to be entertainment as much as to be a cinematic record of these events that have gotten far less attention than what they deserve.
