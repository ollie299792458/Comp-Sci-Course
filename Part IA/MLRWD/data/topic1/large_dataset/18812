I can understand why a lot of people don't like this movie. It's a very black comedy, often hard to laugh at for some and hard to swallow. But if you have an open mind and like movies that are daring in subject matter and offbeat, then CHUCK &amp; BUCK is a good one.  Chuck and Buck were boyhood friends.  Chuck grew up and Buck remained at the emotional level of a care-free momma's boy. But when Buck's mom dies, he goes in search of his old friend.
The strongest part of this movie is Mike White's flawless (and overlooked by the Academy) performance as Buck. Fully in character, his Buck is creepy, freaky, and downright hysterical. His inabiltiy to fit in and act like a clear-headed adult and his need to reconnect with Buck by reminiscing is jawdropping. Clearly mentally disturbed Buck eventually becomes Chuck's stalker. 
The only flaw in the movie -- besides a sometime wooden cast of extras -- is that it's hard to believe that Chuck wouldn't just fully tell Buck off or explain how messed up he is to his (Chuck's) girlfriend. 
All in all, CHUCK &amp; BUCK is a surprising hit that -- if you watch it in the dark -- will have you looking over your shoulder.
