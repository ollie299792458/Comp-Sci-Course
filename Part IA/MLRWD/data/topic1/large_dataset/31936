The Matrix opened my mind up to new things. The Matrix Reloaded continued that, in a way i'll never forget. I loved this movie, and i honestly don't see why so many people didnt like it, because of particular scenes, (Zion, Fight Scenes) which i just guess i felt were powerful or meaningful in certain metaphorical depths, whereas some people felt empty for some reason. I think that the fight scenes were incredible, and the fact that they were long, made me like them more than the few in the first movie, since those weren't as long, but still good. I only tell those who see it to be prepared for the cliffhanger ending of this film to The Matrix Revolutions, which is coming out in November.
If you want to enjoy this movie, view it as its own movie, continuing from the same story-line, not the same storyline itself. I think too many people expect the same things over and over again, yet when they get THAT, are they really happy?
if you are too much of a critic about certain things, this may not be for you, but it has been my favorite action/sci-fi movie this year. (Revolutions may change that however)
Sorry no-one else saw the same movie i did. lol
