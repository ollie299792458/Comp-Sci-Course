When I rented this movie, people were talking about the big twist ending.... unfortunately I am one of the few people who actually paid attention to the beginning of the movie, so for me there was absolutely no twist.  I seriously thought that everyone knew what I knew right from the beginning, so by the time the so called "twist" was revealed I was completely confused.  If you are an observant person, you will think this movie is a bit boring waiting for everyone else to figure out what you knew right from the start.  An extra star because I like the actors in this movie.

Stop reading here if you haven't seen the movie.
SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER:

The give away is in the first 10 minutes of the film... How could you NOT notice that, first of all the beginning of wedding footage never directly showed the bride and grooms faces, giving one cause to wonder why, thus making you pay more attention to the wedding footage.  So after more wedding footage is shown we actually see enough of the faces of the bride and groom to see, that it is NOT Mila Jovovich or Steve Zahn as the bride and groom, but someone totally different.  Therefore when you see they have the camera of the couple, and the information about the slain couple is revealed, it's a given that they were the one's who killed and replaced the bride and groom.  It was obvious to me anyway.  That's why when they revealed them as the killers I couldn't figure out how that was twisty in any way whatsoever.  This made the movie a bit boring for me.  Then I thought, maybe the twist was Mila saying it was okay to kill Steve... but that wasn't a big surprise either, after their talk on the beach.  Whatever..... if you are observant this movie will be a bit boring.
