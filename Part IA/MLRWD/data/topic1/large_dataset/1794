I am VERY fond of this musical.  I first saw it on stage 4 years ago without knowing the plot, and I was thoroughly delighted by the musical's humor, catchy tunes, and interesting characters.

The movie version of Guys and Dolls was enjoyable too, but I do have a few "qualms" about it, if you will.  First of all, the movie dragged just a little bit.  Some Hotbox scenes were unnecessary (especially since "Bushel and a Peck" was replaced by "Pet Me Poppa."  And "Take Back Your Mink" was pointless.), and I found that any scene with just music and dancing with no dialogue just got too long for my taste.  On stage it works for me because the cast is performing live, but in a movie it slows down the action.

Second, the vocal performances were only adequate.  I love Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons's portrayals of Sky Masterson and Sarah Brown, and their energy and acting are delightful to watch.  However, they are not trained singers, and it shows.  Brandon's rendition of "Luck be a Lady" held none of the excitement and energy needed for a song of that nature, and "I'll Know" I'm afraid was a little too melodically difficult for Simmons to handle.  However, they are by no means bad singers, and I absolutely love their performance of "A Woman in Love," which I enjoy more than "I've Never Been in Love Before."

And then other than the fact that they cut out "Marry the Man Today," that's about all the "qualms" I have about the movie version of Guys and Dolls.  I felt that all the actors did excellent in their roles, especially Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, though I had always thought of Nathan Detroit as a more macho, beefy character, rather than a thin, gangly fellow that Sinatra was.  But what a voice!

All in all, a wonderful, funny, and dare I say it again - delightful - film of one of my favorite musicals.
