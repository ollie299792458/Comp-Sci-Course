I realize almost all movies have a few plot holes or unlikely events, but there is a line that can be crossed where the film becomes pure buffoonery.  This movie crossed that line and kept going.  One of the bigger plot holes is that Ludlow is buried in a desk job to keep out of the spotlight temporarily, yet he finds tons of time every day to scour the city tracking down his ex-partners killers.  I guess in LA, they give REALLY long lunch breaks.  Ludlow shouldnt have even been alive at that point.  The racial tongue lashing he dished out to the Koreans at the beginning of the film would have gotten him shot.  And does anyone really believe that if cops are going to tamper with evidence, they would do it so shoddily?  Did anyone see how bad Lundlow was at staging the crime scene so it appeared he was defending himself.  A fifth grade science class could have seen it was doctored.
 There is a remote chance that good acting could have covered up the poorly written script.  But choosing Keanu Reeves pretty much axed that idea.  Any part that requires more than a few lines or moving facial muscles just seems to be too much for him.  Forest Whitaker horribly overacted his role.  Watching him act this role was like watching a lobster trying to escape a boiling pot.  Lets just hope his career survives this stinker.
