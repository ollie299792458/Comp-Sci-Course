Watching this movie on DVD last night, I realized that I have been flooded with my favorite actors as of late, so much so that I don't appreciate them as much.  Re-watching Zoolander, which has been rewarding for years, has become humdrum, because Ben Stiller is everywhere, he should consider focusing in on one funny movie instead of trying to chuck out a million of them...Dodgeball really wasn't that funny, and neither is this film.  Even his cameo in Anchorman didn't excite me, but how could this be when I love Zoolander and Tenenbaums so dearly?  Quality over Quantity people.  Vince Vaughn, the saving grace in any movie, is also somehow seen too much now, post-Old School, my once personal favorite underground hero from Swingers is seen everywhere with these clowns, I think its just too relaxed, they're expecting you to laugh at their mere presence in a movie, only Will Farrell has this ability, well, and Vince, but its slipping...I need time to soak these all in, I don't want them to just stop being funny, it isn't fair, being that all of these men are hilarious.  Hollywood and these movies are just too predictable, we need variety.
