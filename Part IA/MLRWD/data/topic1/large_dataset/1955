This is Robinson's bravura performance and he steals the show utterly from  Bogie, who is outstanding but not shown to his best advantage here. Bogie  has a more supporting role here, and Robinson's characterization of the  nasty Johnny Rocco is one of the great villainous performance in screen  history. How can anyone forget when Robinson sneers to Bogie, "Rocco  wants more. Yeah, that's right, MORE!"
The under-rated but always  superb Lionel Barrymore gives a marvelous performance as Bacall's  father-in-law. His scenes with Bogie and Robinson are all tour de force.  Claire Trevor's pathetically drunken singing scene is touching, as she  belts out a torch song just to get her drink refilled because Johnny Rocco  promised her. At the conclusion of her song, she grabs for the bourbon,  only to have Rocco take it from her. 
"But Johnny," she wails,  "You promised!" Rocco sneers, "Too bad. You were  lousy." 
The only slight criticism is Bacall, who gives a lackluster  performance. Her character is not essential to the screeplay and one senses  Huston just threw her onboard in order to be near Bogie. No matter,  Barrymore and Robinson carry this picture, which is a deserved classic.
