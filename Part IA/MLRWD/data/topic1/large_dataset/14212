Well, this was a pretty good movie... I rented it and watched it with my landlord last Thursday. I still have a lot of unanswered questions after seeing it, though. If the two main characters have such successful jobs as a magazine writer and advertising agent, how do they have time to play this silly dating game, plus have time to hang out with friends, get groceries, work out (as they are obviously in great shape), pick out and purchase a small dog, all in the span of 10 days? I come home after work and I'm exhausted. 
After the "game" is revealed and the two characters look like they aren't going to get together, a very vulgar word is used by one character to stir up thoughts of a fun time they had together playing a game of the very same vulgar name.  I felt that the use of the word probably wouldn't have convinced the second character to get back together with him, as she didn't seem particularly fond of profanity. However, this probably wouldn't have made for a good movie.
Some of the movie is shot on what is supposed to be Staten Island. Now, I have not been there, and perhaps they didn't actually shoot the house and street scenes on Staten Island, but I found it to be quite nice.  I wish I knew if that was what it was really like there, what with the nice views of the city and all.
Finally, I was particular impressed at the choice the use "Follow You Down" by Gin Blossoms for the climactic motorcycle scene in the end.  It was a choice that was obviously well-thought out by the director. Now, whenever I hear that song, I think about driving my motorcycle over a bridge out of Manhattan. Except that I don't own a motorcycle, nor have I ever driven on a bridge out of Manhattan.
In closing, Kate Hudson is really cute, that helps the viewer to really get attached to her and want to see if she gets her guy in the end, and Chris Robinson should hold on to her like a black crow on a carcass.
