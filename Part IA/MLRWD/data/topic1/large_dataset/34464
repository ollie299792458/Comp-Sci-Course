**SPOILERS**
(which is not really a big deal as no one should have to sit through this movie anyway)

The premise is that "European Christians" came to the new world centuries before Columbus and that the Mayans were really Christians and the end of the Mayan calendar coordinates with the Rapture, Armageddon, the Apocalypse, and who knows what else. In fact, inside a Mayan temple at Chichen Itza, there is an inscription that prophesied a child would be born on the temple altar at the end of days. A character in the film reads off the prophecy like it was English but apparently no one else in the world has ever bothered to look at it (the word "Christ" appearing carved in a Mayan temple would be a monumental discovery!).

The Rapture occurs somewhere along the way, and the faithful disappear, though at least a couple of the main characters are believers (one is actually a missionary) and they get left behind (I'd be a bit disappointed in their shoes) to carry the Word to the rest of those left behind.

Which apparently will include only the people who are living in and around Chichen Itza, because we see the West Coast of the US get wiped out and the entire continent go dark, so our band of heroes aren't going anywhere for a while and will be much busier trying to stay alive in the middle of the jungle, far away from any sort of civilization.

Overall, a ridiculous story, horrible acting, and seems almost an anti-Christian film as it is generally unscriptural and attempts to reconcile pagan Mayan practices (those altars were used for human sacrifice!) with Christianity.

Not recommended for Bible-believing Christians, out-and-out atheists, friends, neighbors or anyone at all, not even your worst enemies. Absolutely no redeeming elements in this movie whatsoever.
