Baseball is one of my favorite sports, and so I'm a sucker for a good baseball movie. That this movie is based on the real-life series of events that significantly changed how Major League Baseball teams evaluate, sign and hire talent, made it all the more interesting for me.

Do not buy this movie if you're looking for stirring on-screen action, tense scenes of the pitcher on the mound staring down batters, and exciting scenes of come-from-behind victories etc. This isn't that movie, it's not Major League of even the Natural. The story of Moneyball is about what it takes to put together an organization that has a chance to win, and so the on-field action is ancillary to the film, and treated as such. We see it, but the action on the field is a result of the real drama happening behind the scenes.

Anyone who follows MLB knows that sabermetrics and the philosophies that Billy Beane took a flyer on, had lasting impact on the game of baseball. Even though his team hasn't been able to win using those theories, other teams have. What's more it kicked the game into the modern world, so the question is now no longer 'Why look at the game in new ways?' but instead 'Why NOT look at the game in new ways?' It doesn't always work out, but change has come to MLB, and there's no going back.

This is the story of how it came to be, and is well worth watching if you're a true fan.
