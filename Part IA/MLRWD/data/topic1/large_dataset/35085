Explosive action and adrinlene pumping rush in John Woo's High uptain final farewell film with spectacular endless gunfights and herionic-bloodshed witch was inspired by the creators of Desporado, Last Man Standing and The Matrix. 
A die-hard hong Kong cop Tequila (Chow-Yun-Fat)take on arms deals that then explodes into a bloody shoot-out at a teahouse with his partner getting brutaly gunned-down by a gun totting hitman sent by the arms mafia leader Johnny Wong a mob kingpin who will kill anyone who gets in his way. Tequila later encounters a undercover cop (Tony Leung)doing deeds for johnny wong and bond together to take down wong arms operation in a local hospital. 
HARD BOILED is a wildly outragous,bloody and ultra-violent film wich doesn't let up the plot line in the film. The gunfights in the teahouse, the gun garage, and the hospital turn out to a one-film-trilogy which Chow Yun Fat himself is a one man die-hard. 
Jonn Woo delivers spectacular action and suspenses in his highly uptain film witch ending sequences in the hospitl is just like  the bloody shoot-out from the action packed A Better Tommorow II witch is woo's best film ever. The dvd version of HARD BOILED has a better video transfer the the vhs does so perchus the dvd for better tansfers.
