The trouble with all the fancy menus and extras on DVDs is that you come to expect them. So when you see a DVD with boring menus and extras, it comes as a disappointment. Even when you bought it for the film.
There's a "behind the scenes featurette" which consists of about 5 minutes of interviews with the stars (just the "stars"... it would have been interesting to hear something from Amanda Plummer or Nathan Lane), and clips from the movie you just watched, obviously taken straight from the presspack.  There's a cringeworthy music video, and a "Cast &amp; Crew" page that only bothers to provide filmographies for Tom Hanks &amp; Mag Ryan (hello? did they see the rest of the cast list?). The menus are workable but pedestrian.
I think the worst thing is the packaging. It's really dull and tacky looking. It just shouts out "leave me in a corner to gather dust". I know re-releasing their back catalogues on DVD isn't exactly an exciting activity for the studios, but they could at least pretend to care. It's the worst-looking DVD I own.
While I'm being negative, it also has the worst compression artifacts of any DVD I own. This was most annoying during the title sequence, it didn't bother me during the body of the film, but I think it shows a lack of care taken.
So why did I give it 5 stars? It's the film, stupid! Joe versus the Volcano is my all-time favourite movie. All the other reviewers have done a better job than I ever could of saying how great it is. This is Tom Hanks' best movie. Meg Ryan is electrifying, what has she been playing at in all those other films? This film should have won Oscars. I haven't been able to see this movie AT ALL for about 5 years! I am so excited to finally have it on DVD! It's even better than I remembered.
