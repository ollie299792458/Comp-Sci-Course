In the Depression-Era, America was a lost land, swallowed by depression and poverty, but citizens found a hero in an unlikely place, an awkward race horse named Seabiscuit, who, along with a few flawed men, raced into the winner's circle and people's hearts. Tobey Maguire ("Spider-Man"), Chris Cooper ("Adaptation."), Jeff Bridges ("K-Pax"), and William H. Macy ("Magnolia") all star in old-fashioned filmmaker Gary Ross' ("Pleasantville") winning drama, "Seabiscuit," which is now available on DVD.
Complete with PBS-esque narration, a beautiful Randy Newman score, and a set of ace performances, "Seabiscuit" is a family film with enough horses to please little girls, enough heart to please the boys, and is so well-made even the hardened adult film geek will find themselves with a lump in their throat and tears in their eyes. "Seabiscuit," though running a tad long, is a film that you can watch again and again and always cheer as the horse who could captures a lost nation's imagination and hearts!
