This is little too much that people say a word, Gay, on this movie. Yeah, well, this movie is about two gay boys meeting on night at subway and tripped to gay community just to get off for one night sex. But, it has  much more charming attractions such as witty scripts and sweet but very  realistic love story and excellent acting by Christian Campbell, Jp pitoc  and Tori spelling, and good music too (did I say good music? Ever romantic  piano and musical tunes that I've heard) that can not be overlooked simply  because of gay nature and I guarantee that this movie will make you feel  good whatever your sexualities are after watching.
Personally, I loved  this movie very much. I rented and watched more than 10 times a week and  reluctantly returned it to video shop . ..and finally, I bought three of  these movies and give as a present to my brother and a best friend of mine  who always forced me to watch straight people's love story, for example,  wedding singer or never been kissed, making me all the time squirming.  
One of the best movies. Don't buy it. First rent it watch with your girl  or boy friend and then decide it. You'll love this one.
