This movie has ruined cape-wearing for me. Who knew they were such health hazards?

In this Pixar movie, a family of undercover superheroes are living quietly in suburbia but are forced into action to save the world.

Bob Paar was once Mr. Incredible, one of the world's greatest superheroes, known for saving lives and fighting evil.  He and his wife, Elastigirl, have been ordered to give up their superhero careers and are living in a witness protection program as if they are just your average humans.  Then Bob is approached about a top-secret assignment and everything changes.

This story is well written and the characters are more human than a lot of characters who are actually human.  They have emotions and big hearts and they love, make sacrifices, discover truths about each other and themselves, suffer, and feel loss.  They also argue about which is the right turn on the freeway and deal with unruly kids who have strong wills and their own minds about how things should work.  The animation and visuals are glorious and stunning, and the story itself is inspiring, unbeliebably creative, and downright extraordinary.  I especially love the scene where dash is running with a layer of Violet's force field all around him, so he's like a gerbil in a plastic ball!

My entire family loved this movie when it was in the theatre and we had to have the DVD as soon as possible (which is rare in this penny-pinching household) so we could experience it all over again.  See it, and you'll be entertained, get charged up, be inspired, and laugh and laugh and laugh.
