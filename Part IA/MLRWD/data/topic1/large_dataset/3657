I missed it when it was current and only recently saw a couple of episodes, but I didn't see it from the beginning.  I quickly realized that I wanted to see it in sequence and I ordered the set.  This was a spectacular show with a tremendous balance of mystery, revelations, great acting performances, superb casting and terrific story development.

Rebecca de Mornay may have provided her best performance ever.  You probably have never seen someone who allows her ball-busting demons such free reign.  Her bitch roots might startle you, but they are presented quickly and then left behind in the dust of yet another set of revelations.

I couldn't decide how I felt about Greyson Fletcher's performance.  It was either a very weak performance, or Shaun was supposed to be a blank slate and character development was cut off by the premature cancelling of the show.

Willie Garzon, Luiz Guzman, Dayton Callie, Paul Ben-Victor and especially Ed O'Neill form a brilliant tribe of support characters for this story line.

Unfortunately it was cancelled and we are left hanging.  I would very much like the show's creators to provide some sort of wrap up for the project for clarification.  The show's last episode started with the brilliant John and Shaun sequence, but seemed to fade to grey shortly after that.  It ended with a limp and a whimper, but everything up to that was well worth seeing.
