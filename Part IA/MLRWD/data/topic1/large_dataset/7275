Ok, I admit I watched too many Underdog cartoons as a child. Much to my wife's dismay I flip this movie into the DVD player just after midnight on new years (hey, it's fair game I had to sit through Sweeney Todd for her). Were lounged across the living room floor, and I have the home theatre system up way too loud as usual (Yes, I still like to play my music way too loud too).

  The opening moments of the film were a little disappointing for me. It starts slow, and there are some tawdry moments in this script for sure. That being said it's a super hero movie!!! I mean do you really expect superb scripts and shakespearian acting? There is no plot, the acting is very disney channel in delivery, and there were a few lines children won't get that weren't funny to adults (and I felt a little inappropriate for a childrens movie). That all being said I actually enjoyed the movie. The cheesy lines were actually funny to me. The generic plot actually works for the movie, and the super hero dog is cute. I give it 3.8 stars. It really is a shame they didn't clean up the movie just a little. They could have made this a G film and it would have gotten 4.5 stars from me. As it stands it has some inappropriate innuendo I don't feel is appropriate for a childrens film. They just didn't target the right audience. Parents bring their children to these movies for the children. No need for secret innuendo in a failed attempt to entertain the parents as well. As I said 3.8 stars.
