Let's just quickly get past the already stated History Channel paying for and then rejecting this miniseries for whatever reason we all want to believe; Kennedy family pressure, etc.

Now, down to the critique - This series was created with knowledge of real events, true enough, but there is so much drama in it that you might roll the eyes.  The rush through the events from World War II to the ending with Bobby's death is just too much time to cover properly even in a miniseries.  The series is entertaining but it is NOT a documentary and maybe that is the real reason for the History Channel rejection and the reason so many Historians bashed it.

So, remember "miniseries" not "documentary".  Unfortunately a large part of the series did show a rather unflattering view of each family member, but I would not say it was a "smear job".  There was tragedy in the Kennedy family, but also many wonderful times as well, but would that sell?  So they chose to show more of a negative slant, but there are volumes written and numerous shows of the positive regarding this American "Royal Family" and one should see those as well.

As for the actors, I would note that Greg Kinnear did a very good performance as JFK and I enjoyed watching that.  There have been reviews of Katie Holmes being stiff, but take a look at reels of a young Jackie and you will see that she was that way.

All in all, I would say that this is a slightly above average movie and an interesting and entertaining series to watch but just don't expect it to be a true documentary that follows the history of the times.  Just sit back and enjoy and don't roll those eyes because you just might miss something.
