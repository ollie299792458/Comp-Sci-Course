I just have to say that I will never listen to critics EVER again.  I based my decision to not catch Wolverine in theatres solely on what I was reading online and how bad this film was reported as being.  I now regret that decision after deciding to purchase the blu ray. I just finished watching it and I actually thought it was fantastic. I'm not an X-Men expert by any stretch of the imagination so I am not able to offer any comparisons from this movie to it's original comic book source material. Strictly from a cinematic/entertainment standpoint, this movie succeeded  on every level for me. Great story (from my point of view), great characters, great action sequences and special effects. It's just loads of fun to watch and I hope they continue with the Origins series. Never again will I trust critics or even what I hear from family and friends. It's always best to make your own decisions because you never know when you could be missing out on a highly entertaining "movie theatre" experience.
