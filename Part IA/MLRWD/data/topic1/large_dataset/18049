I went to see this movie when it first came out.. why? because my late father invested $5,000 in Tucker and he and a friend were going to have a dealership! I wanted to get a bit more of the story than I ever heard about. My mother had nothing good to say about Preston Tucker. While I am sure the movie whitewashed certain aspects of the story, I did come away with a different outlook. Mom gave to me the stock, and other priceless ( to me anyway)items associated with the dealership my father and his friend were going to start. All this was going on the summer before I was born. I have looked at it and had tears thinking how excited he must have been and how sad to see it all go for nothing.
The movie is wonderful and I laughed and cried right along with all of them. Preston Tucker was human and bigger than life and Bridges brings him to life in a forceful way. Was he always right? NO, was he a crook?
I don't think so..but time has a way of changing our preceptions and Tucker was way ahead of his time and would be amazed at the auto industry today. Bottom line.. good movie for anyone who loves cars and the nostalga for the time when men could and did dream big.
