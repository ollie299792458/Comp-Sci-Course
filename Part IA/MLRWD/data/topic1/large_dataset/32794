Hysteria becomes Nicole Kidman.  Her eyes widen, her skin glows with perspiration, and her voice gets to employ everything from terror-stricken whispers to roof-rattling screams.  "The Others" gives her quite the workout, as a widow (or is she?) whose husband is lost in the mists of war, and whose young children are deathly allergic to sunlight.  And who keeps creeping about, opening the drapes and mysteriously closing the doors in the big old house, when no one else is supposedly around?  All this, and creepy servants too!  The ingredients are stock, and the big twist isn't terribly revolutionary if you've seen A Certain Other Film About Seeing Dead People.  But Kidman, rising Phoenix-like from the ashes of Mrs. Tom Cruise, proves her star-making turn in "Moulin Rouge!" was no fluke; she gives this genre piece every bit of her intelligence and possibly crazed integrity, and it works you over like a thresher.  You emerge, gratefully, into daylight, mildly surprised and creeped-out by the film, but stunned by Kidman's ferocious talent.
