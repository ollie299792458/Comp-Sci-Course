I bought this movie so I could play it on my PS3 and I was blown away at how good it looks! I remember seeing this movie when I was little on my recorded straight from TV VHS tape, and playing it over and over again until the tape wore out. I watched again over the weekend on blueray and I was amazed at the clarity of the transfer, the saturation of the colors and the punch of the soundtrack.

You do have to be aware of one thing though. If you are playing blueray movies using your Playstation 3, and do not have an HD TV with an input capable of taking in a 1080i signal (at least), the playstation will send a 480p signal instead of downconverting to 720p. That is because all bluerays are native 1080p, and the playstation seems incapable of downcoverting the signal (for now) to 720p.

I have a Samsung DLP TV, and its true native resolution is 720p, therefore i told my PS3 to always send a 720p signal to my TV. Well, when I played Terminator instead of sending a high def signal to my TV, it sent a 480p signal, making the quality of the movie no better than DVD. I was confused and thought the blueray looked crappy, but it reality it was the signal that was crappy. I told my PS3 to send a 1080i signal, and this time the blueray finally came to life. Even though my TV is native 720p resolution, it is capable to taking a 1080i signal and showing it.

Anyway, just wanted to make that point clear, since some people complain the movie doesnt look any better than a DVD, but it really does... if you have your configuration right.
