This movie was known to be (right from the beginning) a film where a family was kidnapped and held hostage in their own home. Not a problem with the movie plot; we like the action and felt like seein it to see how these particular ppl wouild get out of their situation (Harrison Ford starred in one lately, as well: "Firewall"). With that said, we noticed the rating was an "R" and when I heard the credits begin to roll I was certain this movie was going to be good.Not all "R" ratings are the same and this one did not describe in detail or even in partial(that I can find) that the language was pervasive...strongly pervasive. When words like this are so repetitive they actually destroy the picture. I don't know a single person who goes to a movie and says to himself,

"hey buddy, I can't wait to see that new picture showing this weekend that is loaded with pervasive foul language."

On the other hand, I HAVE heard ppl say to themselves, "I've heard the story line (or plot, etc) is really great and I want to see that movie this weekend!"

Film Directors and Producers: do the world a favor and produce some movies with a few less lines of the foul stuff that is so over done that one groans and has to leave the theatre or take their DVD back and ask for a refund.

Great story line with far too much language to make it realistic. I give it 3 stars for the movie plot alone.
