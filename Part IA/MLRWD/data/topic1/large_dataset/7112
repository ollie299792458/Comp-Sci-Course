If you are familiar with the classic children's novel of the same title, you may find this film adaptation to be lacking. But, when you watch the movie on its own, it is an absolutely lovely and charming film that is  appropriate for any age. I originally skipped this movie in the theatres  because it was billed as a "children's film" and I'm sorry I  missed it on the big screen. 
Some other reviewers have remarked upon  some problems with the acting. With the exception of some caricatures in  characterization with the adult roles, I didn't have any problems with that  aspect of the production. Liesel Matthews does a bang up job in the lead as  Sara Crewe and I hope she has a long and successful career.
As far as  extras are concerned, there aren't a lot on this DVD. There's no commentary  track but you do get both a pan &amp; scan and a widescreen version. There  are both French and Spanish soundtracks and captioning as well as three  theatrical trailers and some production notes. This is a very well produced  disc for the price and a good value.
