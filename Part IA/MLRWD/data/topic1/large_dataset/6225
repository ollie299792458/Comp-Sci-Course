This is a very entertaining French romantic comedy about... very shallow characters. The locations are certainly splendid, the acting is adequate and the script is good (much less trivial than most movies in this category). Overall, I really enjoyed watching this movie.

However, I couldn't help feeling very little sympathy for the two main characters. Irene may be a charming character, but she is as shallow as they come, spending her life after older rich men who (shallow themselves) buy her youth with endless gifts. And while Jean shows throughout the story a more complex personality and much deeper ability to care about others, the fact remains that the only reason why he is in love with Irene is that she is beautiful, despite her being shallow and manipulative (until she finds, predictably, some redemption). Maybe what "saves" his character at the end is that he succeeds in making her a better person.

I still recommend this movie to aficionados of romantic comedies. This one is far above the average. But you can easily find movie characters out there that "deserve" more sympathy!
