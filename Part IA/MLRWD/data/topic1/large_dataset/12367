This is my favorite Kubrick film to watch because it is his most "extreme"- in language, violence, and subject matter.What makes this movie so much better than all other war movies is the fact that it doesnt concentrate on one facet of war, such as a battle, man or mission.  It focuses on the complete process of dehumanization of men in war.From  drilling it into their heads in basic training, to "pacifist"  Joker wasting the sniper, and thus, completing the process.Kubrick really  seems to capture the essence of men in the Vietnam War. Commanders only  intent on creating killing machines, soldiers simply killing for amusement,  and no one thinking of the consequences for anyone. I've read a lot of  criticism of the second half of this movie-the battle scenes-for being  boring(compared to the first half) and unrealistic. I feel I must point out  that the first half is so savagely brutal that the revelation of the  meaning of life would probably  be a letdown. As for it being unrealistic,  Vietnam is not just one big jungle, and war is not made up simply of planes  flying overhead and bombs being dropped. These scenes, I feel, capture the  isolation and  sense of terror  in being in a situation in which you have  little or no control, and can be killed at any moment. I hope that those of  you who don't lile the second half will go back and rewatch it. It is  certainly worth the extra effort, for it is what makes the film a classic.
