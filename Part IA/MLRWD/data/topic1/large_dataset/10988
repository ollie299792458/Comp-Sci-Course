The most frustrating thing about this story is that all humans have lost their humanity and it's wasted a beautiful concept for a movie by asking us to believe that all humans would really live their entire lives through a robot without considering the obvious drawbacks of such a lifestyle.  The moral grounds make this interesting at first, but then I'm thinking, come on!  Do I need to be blunted over the head with the message that living your life through a robot is bad?  If this script had some restraint and wove a more intricate tale of the mystery behind the murders then it could have been very good.  But what we have is an obvious morality tale with a redundant message and a murder mystery with a very unsatisfying resolution.  Visual effects were good.  I like to escape in sci-fi movies like these, but not when they depict all of humanity gone way stupid over technology.  Give me a break!  Ridiculous and not very thrilling either.
p.s. Bad cliche character with the fat computer-guy also. (Seen this character in Transformers and Live Free or Die Hard.)
