Clint Eastwood directs and acts in this portrayal of a 31yr old young lady (Maggie Fitzgerald - Played by Hilary Swank) trying to get a break into the world of female boxing.Eastwood plays the boxing coach/manager who gets unwittingly coaxed into managing Maggie, by his gym caretaker and ex-pro boxer (Morgan Freeman)...Swank's performance is 'special' as she guides us through the trials of a troubled upbringing, to the desire to succeed both personally and professionally. She is totally believable in the role as she draws you into her life. The movie is really centred around Eastwood, Freeman and Swank to the point where you do not notice anyone else - but this is not a bad thing, as the characters and performances of all three command that attention. This movie is a little slow-paced at the beginning with Freeman narrating the story to set the scene but stay with it, as it draws you in as good compelling moviemaking should. Eastwoods character is the father-figure, scarred by events of the past, and as a result, afraid to take risks. His female prodigy lifts him out of this and soon they are fighting their way to the top. Finally, they face the biggest fight of their careers, where there is no winner. Remarkable movie, superbly acted and worthy of the oscars it received...(It lost one star because of the slow start, some may be prepared to switch off before the movie really begins).
