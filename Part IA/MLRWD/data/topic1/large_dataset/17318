the action in The Losers is great, but in story will have you shaking your head with disgust.

My biggest issue was the theme that the CIA is evil, operates like a crime syndicate, and murders innocent children for no reason. Secondly, the CIA agent who acts as the movie's villain buys "environmentally friendly" nuclear bombs (no joke, it's in there) from Indian scientists, to sell to ... China. No mention of Islamic terrorists, or even Islamic nations. In fact the Indian scientist who's involved goes on a rant to make SURE the audience knows that he is Hindu and NOT a Muslim.

This movie has great action scenes, and hits all the right points; lots of explosions, special effects, and good camera-work. However, the Leftist propaganda ruins this film for me. The writers obviously have no problem casting our intelligence agencies as the moral equivalent of Satanic child molesters, but take pains to not offend Muslim audiences (although they're apparently not worried about offending Indian audiences).
