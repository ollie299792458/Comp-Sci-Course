The beginning is extremely confusing with the characters making references to their own world, of which we know nothing in the beginning, and the darkness of the setting shrouds much of their actions. As the story continues, we learn that science is researching a creature called Proxy, which apparently was not man-made. We see this world as being one of routine, discouraging individuality, and only accepting immigrants if they choose to comply with crushing their 'self'.

Vincent Law is one such immigrant, and it is made clear within the first three episodes that he is a key character, along with Real.

The series contains a lot of symbolism, historical references, religious comparisons, along with a plot just complicated enough to confuse unless close attention is payed. A lot like a musical, the scenes which Vincent is forced to come to terms with his 'Self' are key in the movement of the story, and cannot be ignored. Ergo Proxy contains a lot of theorizing that stretches for entire episodes, and would become boring to someone who cannot sit through it. Think the end of 'Evangelion', minus repetitive dialogue. It's convoluted at times, and often has foot notes at the end of an episode when almost composed entirely of character development.

The animation is very similar to Ghost in the Shell, but it can hardly be compared in terms of story--It's dramatically different, and the fight scenes are lacking, but not at all necessary to the enjoyment.

Ergo Proxy requires patience, as it doesn't throw you in to the story immediately. It's air of mystery with its introduction to Ergo Proxy's world, keeps you wondering just long enough before it finally sends you reeling with plot and action, and really, there's a just enough of everything to satisfy the pickiest of anime collectors.

The whole thing blew me away.
