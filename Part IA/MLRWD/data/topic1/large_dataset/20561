If you're an "extras" hound like me, "Toy Story &amp; Toy Story 2 - The Ultimate Toy Box" is the promised land.  Hands down the best goodies of any DVD to this date.  Oh yeah, and you get two excellent movies too!  :)
I won't spend time on the movies themselves, except to say that they're two of the most entertaining films ever made.  Instead, let's focus on why to get the 3-DVD set instead of the 2-DVD set.  
The third DVD is truly impressive.  You'll find fully-animated deleted scenes; funny &amp; interesting interviews with cast, crew, animators, etc.; an absolutly hysterical debate on "Who's the best character?" with Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and the whole cast; some very detailed explanations of the techniques used to create the movies; and so much more.  I've spent over three hours on Disc 3 alone so far, and there's a lot more to go!
There are even cool hidden features.  For example, on Disc 3 choose 'Toy Story 2.' Under the 'Story' section, choose 'Jesse's Song.' On the next screen that appears, press the 'Left' arrow key on your remote control &amp; you'll see a question mark. With the question mark highlighted, hit 'Enter' for a outtake with an introduction by the directors. 
The sound &amp; picture quality on all three discs are the best I've seen on DVD.  Helps when the whole movie was CREATED digitally, eh?  :)
All in all "The Ultimate Toy Box" is the best DVD set around, bar none.  Well worth the extra money!
