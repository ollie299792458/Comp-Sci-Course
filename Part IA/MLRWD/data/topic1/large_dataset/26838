Personally, I don't like seeing unsuspecting people humiliated or embarrassed - so clearly this movie was not for me.  That said, I did appreciate the moments where the humor was not at the expense of making another person look like an idiot.

If you're not sensitive to those issues as I am, I can really see how it's an enjoyable film.  My mom, dad and brother really laughed their shorts off and most of my friends regularly quote it.  I laughed too (I just happened to cringe more than I do at your standard hack and slash horror.)  There are a lot of uncomfortable moments, so beware.

Undoubtedly, Sascha Baron Cohen is an incredible comedian and the team of writers and producers were not throwing together some hack piece of work here.  Take your tastes into consideration when deciding to watch this.  I didn't purchase this for myself, but my family enjoyed it, so it was worth it for them.

As far as re-watch ability, with all the hype and the Borat-wannabees quoting all the time, the DVD has sat on our shelf unwatched since it was originally opened.  We're all a little Borat-ed Out.  I expect however that in a few years when the Borat quoting completely fades away, it will be enjoyable again to those who enjoyed it in the first place.
