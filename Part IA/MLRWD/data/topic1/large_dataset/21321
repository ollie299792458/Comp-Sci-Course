I've seen Uwe's other works and he must be crapping out money or has Kevin Reynolds as an investor(ala, Costner for Waterworld,Postman,etc..) because he is able to come out with not so great movies that are epically long, but has great actors in them.

Alone in the Dark? Don't get me started, that movie had nothing to do with what the franchise was about.

However, This movie actually wasn't really all that bad. Yea, the fight scenes could have gone on for an additions 80 min. or so. /sarcasm. But to be honest, it was not a bad film to just sit and watch.

And believe it or not, this script has followed the Game that it represents a lot more closely than his other movies. So I guess that is something.

Did This movie have a lot of reference to LOTR? You bet it did. But so did the story line/feel/atmosphere of the Original Game Dungeon Siege. Just a few things changed here and there.

SPOILERS(if you care)

Some of the things that stood out for me were:
Good:
-The story was cliche but, so are a lot of stories in Hollywood.

-Great location. Props were good. Great scenery and decent special effects. Much better then some of the indie films that you see. And really the directing was pretty decent for as big of a project as this was.

-The Actors did as good as they could. And the Krugs were no more ridicules then the ground creatures from the movie "The Time Machine".

-I liked the fact that he(Uwe) didn't try to make it one big blood bath. The kids got to see it and enjoyed it.

Not so good:
-Ray Liota? No, he's a great actor. But his "Bad Guy" performance was kind of stiff. I think they should have gotten Tim Curry to be the bad guy. Way better.

-Tried to cram and do WAY to much story wise. Instead of just taking some of the story and making it a movie, It seems as if they(production) looked at the script and said "It's all good, so it must all stay!!!" As this movie is long. And if he(Uwe)wanted it to be long. He could have made it a mini-series or had a sequel done with it instead of cramming.

-Different accents, yet related? Didn't get that..

-Yes, the Ninja thing I didn't get. At first I thought they were the women of the forest in their respective armor. But I'm not so sure. Not a lot of detail on that.

-There was just a lot going on and a lot of characters to keep track of. Farmers band that fought with him in the first war, are pretty much absent from the 2nd half of the movie. For obvious story reasons, but it felt like(or was presented as)they were going to be the posse for the whole movie....but I guess not.

-Fight scenes way too long. nuff said.

-Music...This might have been out of his hands, but there were times when it was decent. But sometimes it was way to loud and didn't fit the mood, especially during some of the many fighting scenes.

-The Ending.....what the hell? Money run out? Couldn't do a follow up to the final fight scene. "I want to tell you, that I love you."....Then.....credits role? huh? What happens afterward. What characters were still alive? What happened to Matt Lillard's character? I mean, surly just a quick followup/closing should have been in order. And I think, it's because of this quick no closure ending, is what cheapens the movie even more. I mean, would it kill them to add just a scene that says. "Thank you for watching till the end of this movie, here is what happened to the characters." type of thing. It is what they call in the movie business a "Conclusion".

Well, these are my opinions. Others will disagree. But, it wasn't horrible, the pay and script must have been halfway good on paper for these higher actors to be in it. In the end, it all depends on how it gets edited though. And in that respect the movie speaks for itself.

Again, not horrible. And not a bloodbath, so you can sit with your kids and watch it. The Blu-Ray looks pretty darn good though. Is it LOTR? No, but it's a movie that you can watch and not take seriously and have fun with.
