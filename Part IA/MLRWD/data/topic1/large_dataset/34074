I understand that most people would like this movie to be all about the fantastical side of moviemaking, however that is not the point of this film. The point is that as children, we do believe in the possibilities of magic,fairies, beautiful kingdoms in far away lands (I suppose you could say as children we believe in any possibility), however the 'harsher' brutalities of life (can, and sadly usually do) erode our sense of wonderment. Adults confirm and transmit limitations of thought (onto children and themselves) and these thoughts and actions  'create' the world around them.

The balancing of this, I believe, is brilliantly portrayed through this film. For instance, the serene beauty of the woodlands(I'm refering to the way this is shot with the petals blowing through the air, and the rich sepias and greens) is not even noticed by the adults, and it is only the child who 'notices' the stone markers. Honestly, Pan's Labyrinth is not a 'feelgood' movie, yet it is not intended to be. Pan's Labyrinth is a darkly entwined reflection upon the force of belief and what some refer to as morality, the 'reality' we choose to believe in and participate in. As far as the movie being 'slow' or 'boring', I found the movie anything but that, as the charachters were engrossing and the balance of the 'fantasy' and the 'reality' well paced.
