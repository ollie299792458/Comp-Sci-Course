Skip the lame "sliced and diced" US version and get the full 2 hour & 57 minute UK version from Amazon in the UK. It's awesome! It comes with 2 DVDs, and though it's Region 2 in PAL format, I had no problem running it on my Mac using the free VLC media player; no need to mess with DVD region settings. (Also only cost me $8 including shipping). :)

Besides what others have written, unrequited romance dominates the storyline and rivets your eyes to the screen, needing to know what comes next! To whit, Xanten has one of the strongest female leads in Kristanna Loken of any fantasy movie ever.  She oozes chemistry and power, and her look just screams "untamed."  Alicia Witt provided a believable and passionate supporting actress as well.  And yes, for you guys out there they are both gorgeous. :D

The budget is not huge but big enough so it doesn't get in the way, and there is some excellent directing nonetheless.  Some of the scenes are actually quite beautiful and memorable, especially at the beginning and end.  The music is decent, and the story quite engaging and involving.  Characters progress and develop naturally, as one scene leads to the next and the story grows.  And the slower scenes are just as fascinating and fun to watch as the battle scenes, which is hard to achieve!

Without spoiling anything, if you're looking for light and happy family fantasy, keep in mind the entire movie centers centers around the cost of scheming to get what you want, so... I'll leave it at that.  I imagine for those familiar with the original legend you know that, but I'm not.  I once saw the first cycle in opera form at the National Theater in Prague, but as it was all singing in German I didn't exactly follow the story too well!  ;D
