Even though the movie had been released nearly 2 years ago, I still hadnt seen it. It came on tv about 2 weeks ago, and since I sat down and watched it that first time, I've bought the dvd and watched it about 10 times over. Usually PG-13 movies dont do much for me, but when a movie comes along with a great story, great characters, and great writing and directing, its destined for....well, greatness. This movie deserved at least one Oscar, and in my opinion, O Brother is a better, more enjoyable movie than The Coen Brothers' other success, Fargo. This movie has the same cooky style to it, focusing on a culture and region, and exaggerating that. Fargo made hilarious the already wacky accent of Minnesotans, this time around the Coens' made hilarious the already wacky lingo of the south, and bringing light to a dark time known as the depression. I've heard people were offended by the KKK scene, when all the Coen Brothers did was poke fun at the clan the whole time. If you get offended at that, I pray you dont turn on the tv or walk out youre front door, cause reality is much more offensive than a humorous PG-13 movie. George Clooney shows a whole different side of his ability as an actor, and I have new respect for him as a comedic actor, because I know not just anyone could pull off what he has as the dapper man he portrays. If you havent seen this movie yet, you REALLY should. Bravo to the Coens' for having the guts, brains and imagination, to make a movie based around the great Odyssey. Oh, and this is a review of the dvd..... Dolby Digital's good, but DTS is better, and this dvd has it, that's a plus. There's a neat little behind the scenes featurette, featuring the stars and the Brothers, and a cool little extra about the post production process, which talks about the things they were able to do to the movie since it was shot digitally, rather than on regular film. Love this DVD!!
