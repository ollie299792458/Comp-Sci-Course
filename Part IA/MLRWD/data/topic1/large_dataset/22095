This is a film you will want to watch again and again.  This wide-screen version allows you to see it as it was originally shown in theaters in all of its spendor.  So grab your popcorn and settle in for a great motion  picture treat. Adam (Howard Keel) brings home his bride (Jane Powell), who  thinks she is finally going "to cook for just one man", to a  mountain cabin filled with his six younger brothers.  The six boys, naive  due to lack of education in the finer things of life, are taught by their  new "big sister" how to dance and court a girl.  Adam read in one  of his new wife's two books about the Sabine women who were carried off by  the Romans.  When he told his brothers about this, they decided to try this  method of betrothal for themselves.  So they went on a bride roundup.  They  ended up snowed in for the winter with the girls, but no brides.  Somebody  forgot to bring the parson! The story is full of fun, frolic, singing and  dancing galore.  Everyone in the family has a treat in store when they  watch "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers."
