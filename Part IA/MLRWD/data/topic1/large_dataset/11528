Just before I first saw this movie, I had the good fortune to pick up and read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401207553">The Best of the Spirit</a>, a collection of the best of Will Eisner's groundbreaking comic series, and I fell in love with his deceptively simple style, with it's strong understanding of human nature, its colorful and Dickensianly named characters, and above all, it's hero, the likeable yet enigmatic Denny Colt, a detective better known to Central City as "The Spirit"

I always approach a movie I haven't seen as a blank slate, perhaps a little hard to do with Eisner's storytelling in mind. I came away pleased, but a bit disappointed. Frank Miller and his production crew managed to capture some of the quirky humor and the film noir feel of Eisner's comic, but some of the strong sense of morality: of strong heroes working for justice and criminal masterminds who still have a touch of humanity hidden away, some of that felt a bit missing. I love the black and white with touches of color, brought in from Miller's Sin City, but somehow it doesn't quite fit Eisner's creation.

It's uneven, yes, but it's nowhere as bad as some have made it out to be. I had fun watching it, it was entertaining; it could have been better, and it may not have fully captured the spirit of Eisner's work, but it was definitely worth the time to watch it.
