"Big" is funny. Tom Hanks in "Big" is as funny as in Forrest Gump, as touching as "Sleepless in Seattle," and as goofy as "Turner and Hooch." You see the beginnings of the star of "Castaway," "Apollo 13," and "Catch Me If You Can." Hanks took on a solid movie and made it a great one.

The story is simple, based on classic plotlines that extend back through fairy tales. Josh, the boy, is bummed his life is dictated by his small size and young age. He is unexpectedly granted his wish to be 'big', which means 30 years old. He then faces the adventures of being a grown-up.

Scenes from this movie are famous, including the FAO Schwarz toy store dance on the keyboard floor mat. It has everything a vaudeville skit would have, from music to dance to the mix of an old and young man. It works incredibly well. Chopsticks has never been as entertaining.

Josh becomes by serendipity the VP of toy development. Despite his immaturity, the owner feels Josh is tuned into the pulse of youth, unlike the lackeys cranking out marketing reports. His colleagues become jealous of his fast rise and unsuccessfully try to root him out. One of those trying to learn his game is Susan, but he wins her over in a confusing escapade of love.

The movie is an overall pile of fun, but lacks in a few areas. It is dated, very stuck in the 1980s. That is tolerable. Had Josh been kidnapped, why wasn't his boyhood friend interviewed by police? Why didn't Josh ever confide in Susan while they fell in love? A number of other unanswered questions develop at the end dealing with his job, his apartment, his bank account.

Even though I have questions, the movie is still a keeper. It is funny, makes strong statements about good parenting, and has a charm only Tom Hanks could bring. Good, clean fun... a perfect date movie.
