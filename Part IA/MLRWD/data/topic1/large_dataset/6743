Where Eagles Dare is, quite simply, the best piece of WWII Nazi action ever made. The Allistair Maclean plots are generally excellent, but only came out well on film in Where Eagles Dare and the Guns of Navarone. Don't waste your time with Force 10 or Bear Island, they just don't live up to expectations. But Where Eagles Dare sports an unbelievably good performance by Richard Burton. Just look at his expression in the pub when he says "is that understood". He threw in an all-time performance. Clint Eastwood's presence added to the film, but I didn't like the way he didn't show nerves. He walks into a bunch of life-threatening scenes for Lieutenant Schaeffer, and acts like its just like ordering a burger at Mickey-Dees. For the purists, the helicopter scene might be unsettling, but overall, the quality of the soundtrack, scenery, costumes, and vehicles used was top-notch. There are plenty of great twists in the storyline, and a wide range of scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. It is one of those rare movies you can watch over and over again. This film is the best kept secret around, astound your friends by showing them this - it will not dissapoint; it's a must-have!
