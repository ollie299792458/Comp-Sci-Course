This DVD has already received very good reviews that I can only echo. All I would add is just how important it is for any Christian, regardless of denomination, to understand the Biblical basis for any theological doctrine. This DVD explains step by step, the Reformed doctrine of salvation; and does so clearly and concisly, so that a laymen can understand it. It describes particularly well the Scriptural term, ELECTION. That God the Father, in His sovereignty, elects certain ones of the lost throughout mankind, from every tongue and nation, to salvation.

This Biblical truth is evident to any person who reads the Scriptures. Both Testaments expound on it at length. But people twist the plain understanding of the text to support their own religious philosphy that insists on the glory of man and his decision to be saved. We hear this preached all the time by educated preachers who should know better. Then it is repeated over and over by our trusted family and friends and think it must be true, because they are smart and sincere people, even though we realize decisional salvation is plainly unsupported by the Bible. We wind up expousing philosophy instead of Scriptural truth. What a mind bender this contradiction becomes as the years turn into decades, and the power of our salvation is stifled by confusion and delusion. There seems no end to the Arminian heresy all around us today.

That's why this DVD is so important to have and share with others. It clarifies the fundamental issues underpinning theological doctrines. It shows where wrong turns have been made in church history, and why orthodoxy matters. Get your fundamentals correct and build on solid ground. This DVD is a powerful tool to evangelize, not only to the unsaved, but maybe even more so to the saved. Set the captives free!
