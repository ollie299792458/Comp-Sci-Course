I am not a "paid reviewer' as one commentator suggests is true of anyone who criticizes this film.  This film was made under the auspices of the United States Army Air Force to recruit crew for bombers, and to dissuade young men from thinking that the only truly worthy way to serve in the air force was to be a combat pilot in a single seater combat plane.  The racist references in the film were strongly protested against by the civilian propaganda agency, the Office of War Information.  The Military wanted to arouse audience hatred for the Japanese as a people, not just the government of Japan, which serves the interests of bombing urban targets.  This film is therefore a "MUST SEE" for anyone who wants gain an understanding of how the military appealed to the public and to potential recruits during World War II; for instance, the two crew members who have family are either killed (the Captain) or their family member is killed (the son of the engineer).  The lesson:  The USAAF wanted young men with no strong attachments "on the ground."
