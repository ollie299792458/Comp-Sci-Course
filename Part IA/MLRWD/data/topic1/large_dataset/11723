** SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT FOR THE LAST PARAGRAPH **

I saw this on Comedy Central and it was funny. I heard that this one was uncut, and since I needed something to bring my amazon cart up to free shipping, gave this a shot. There were quite a few things I either didn't notice before, or was cut on the TV version. The timing on the jokes were definitely better on the DVD.

I had problems playing this DVD on PowerDVD using an SPDIF. Switching PowerDVD to stereo fixed it so that I can watch it. Not a huge problem since a comedy show isn't exactly Star Wars.

Overall, this was hilarious, much more than I expected. I bought a few other DVDs of comedy routines but not that much material was cut compared to what was on Comedy Central. This DVD had a good amount of cut material, and it isn't like the cut material from a lot of (non-comedy) DVDs I've rented (which usually deserved to be cut). This stuff is good.

The menus were horrible. You select an option and there'd be audio and it'd take a while for it to run through. However, it's only a one-time deal before watching the DVD, so it wasn't bad overall (except in my case with the PowerDVD issue where I tried to debug the audio).

There were Sweet Daddy Dee moments popping in on the act and commenting. It wasn't that funny, but just keep watching the rest of the video because it's worth it. It happens a lot less over the length of the video.
