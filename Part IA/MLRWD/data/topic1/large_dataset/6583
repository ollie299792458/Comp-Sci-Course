I wasn't expecting much, and I was mostly happy as such.
I received "Mysterious Island" for X-mas when I was 11, and it is one of my favorite reads after Michael Strogoff.
The Harryhausen movie was a television staple at the time, and I saw it and was disappointed at the changes.  This time, I expected the changes and was less disappointed.
Patrick Stewart, Kyle McLachlan and Gabrielle Anwar put in solid performances, as I expected.  The cast was part of the reason I bought the DVD.  The story was revised in an interesting way, with Stewart appearing almost immediately.  My major disappointments were: 1) the occasional poor integration between live shots and scenery CGI, especially in the flying scenes; and 2) the cookie-cutter pirates taken right out the Caribbean, despite the movies South Pacific location and Southeast Asian scenery.  The soundtrack is definitely a flashback to the 60's/70's B-movie tracks and it occasionally illiceted a laugh, detracting from the movie itself.
Accept the movie for what it is and enjoy, but keep in mind that it might be a little scary for the younger kids.
