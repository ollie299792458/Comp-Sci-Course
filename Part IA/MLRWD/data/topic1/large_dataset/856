Full Metal Panic! centers around Souske Sagara, a 16 year old mercenary for MITHRIL, and 16 year old Kaname Chidori, the girl he was sent to protect. Kaname needs protection because she is a Whispered, which means that she has had top secret information locked away inside her mind since she was born. Therefore, MITHRIL sent Souske and his two comrades Melissa Mao and Kurz Weber to gaurd Kaname without her knowing.  Can Souske gaurd Kaname and keep her safe or will his growing feelings for her jeopardize his mission.

I LOVE this anime.  It is a MUST for any anime collection.  This show has it all!  It has humor, action, romance, suspense, and giant robots!  What more could you ask for.  FMP does not dissapoint.  The characters are amazing and the plot will have you on the edge of your seat.  I highly recommend this show to both males and females.  From beginning to end, this anime will captivate your attention.  I especially love the opening theme song "Tomorrow" by Mikuni Shimokawa.  If your looking for heart stopping action and an awesome plot, look no further than Full Metal Panic!
