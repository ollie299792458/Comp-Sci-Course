This is definitely one of my favorite vampire movies.  True, it doesn't stack up to Interview, but hey, Interview was made from a novel, and a very stunning novel at that.  The comparison isn't fair.  What strikes me the  most about The Lost Boys is the mood and atmosphere generated by the film.  The ocean wind, the crashing waves, mist gently swirling below the railroad  trestle, the eerie music integrated seamlessly into the scenes, the  simultaneous decadence and horror of the Boys' existence.  Michael  struggling with his own golden-eyed beast as the Boys ruthlessly tear apart  the beach party.  David, on top of the bluff, "How far are you willing  to go?"  Now, it's true that the humor can get a little old,  especially if the Coreys irritate you.  And it's true that there are a  few(only a few) painfully horrid lines uttered by said Coreys.  However,  Kiefer Sutherland more than makes up for it, and after you see the  shimmering blue-black ocean flying by beneath you and hear the swishing of  long coats and the demonic laughter that is uniquely David's, you may just  feel tempted to put on a dark coat and skulk around on your local carousel,  and you will almost certainly think twice before heading to the amusement  park after sundown...
