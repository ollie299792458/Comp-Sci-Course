After hearing much praise for this film, my girlfriend and I rented it one bored Sunday night.  After seeing it, I ask myself what Hollywood means when it says it 'only wants the best scripts'.

A History of Violence is an ironic movie that mocks its supposed message.  At least what I thought was the message.

-Possible spoiler alert below-

Viggo Mortensen plays Tom Stall, a reluctant hero with a violent past he left behind long ago.  Or so he thought.  After saving a waitress in his diner from thugs, he is put in the spotlight and people show up to collect on his old debts.  Enter Ed Harris, the only interesting character in the entire movie.  Watch him while you can, because sadly, his part is short.  Tom constantly reminds his son that violence is bad, but it seems that violence is Tom's only means of solving all his problems.

After a ridiculous sex scene with his wife, Tom gets a call from his brother.  He decides it's time to end all his troubles... with violence.  In keeping with his message to his son that violence solves nothing, he seeks out his brother, a crime lord in Philadelphia, and kills EVERYBODY... VIOLENTLY.  What was the lesson/message in the movie?  I think it was that violence solves nothing... I think?
