There is maybe 20 minutes of unique interesting footage in 3 hours of video here.  It was unbelievably repetitive.  There are definitely some interesting explanations, and the animations were great, but how many times to do we need to see the same animation or quote from a physicist?

I kept waiting for it to get into the meat of string theory, and it never did.  Obviously the math is very complex, so there's a limit to what they could get into on a TV show.  However, all the information given here on the actual theory could be easily summarized in about 5 sentences.  3 hours is a lot to watch for that much information.

** Edit: **  To be fair, I watched this on PBS, not the DVD.  The PBS version was probably much more repetitive because of segment lead-ins and other promos ("Next time on Elegant Universe...").  This is probably why I saw the same clips over and over.  Still, I stand by my statment that there is very little informaton here.  This is nothing more than a teaser on string theory.
