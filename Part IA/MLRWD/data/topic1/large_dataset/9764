Well, at long last...
...as an OCH (Old China Hand) for those of you who do not know, having read the preceding reviews of "underrated" S. Spielberg and "competing with" Bertollucci:]
My God! Thank you indeed for the DVD of "Empire of the Sun"!
A film I have only witnessed on asian TV broadcasts over the last 10 years or so, I guarentee it stands alone with the likes of Sir David Lean (Bridge Over etc., etc.!) and of course its compatriot "Last Emperor" (BB) as a singular and definitive view of life and death and rebirth on this war torn earth.
To all of you at home: Consider yourselves fortunate.
Never let us take for granted the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of freedom.
That is invested in all of us and all our loved ones, preciously inherited perhaps, but never granted, always won.
I only wonder why it has taken so long to reissue this piece de la resistance in universally accessible DVD format. 
If Mr. Spielberg is available, would he please take a bow, just about...right now!...
