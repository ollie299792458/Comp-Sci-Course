About 5 years ago, at my health club, a bunch of us got to talking about movies, and some guy I barely knew grabbed me by both collars of my shirt and said, "You HAVE to see this movie!!! You just HAVE to!!"  So OK.  So I did.  So it's truly brilliant, and on my list of fave flics.  This film is one of those "fatal decision" stories, where the character, without due consideration, unwittingly makes that irrevocable and irretrievable committment to alter the course of his life, and in doing so, comes to the horrid realization that the choice made was, in fact, the wrong one, and maybe life before the decision to change wasn't that bad after all.  Too late! Frankenheimer does a brilliant job of powerfully conveying that moment of gut-wrenching realization that the character can't go back, can't change his mind.  Camera angles are used very effectively to impart a sense of skewed reality that the main character experiences.  In all, a gem of a film. Definitely worth a watch.  Would pair well as a double feature with Terry Gilliam's "Brazil", or "Me, Myself, and I", starring Rachael Griffis.
