" The Dam Busters "  The original moving starring Richard Todd as lead pilot " Guy Gibson ". I care not to remember how many years ago I viewed this movie for the first time but I enjoyed it as much now as I did then ! Watch for Robert Shaw of the movies " Battle of Britain " & " Jaws " as Guy Gibson's co/pilot. I once watched a TV review of this movie & one of the questions the host asked the special effects man was: " How did you make some of the Flak scenes so realistic as the German gunners fired at the A/ C " ? His reply was we had very limited special effects as in today's world but we could fudge the film with a little Hollywood trickery & angles but for some scenes we used actual artillery fire with ex-gunners from WW2 ,
of course they knew how to lead or follow the A/C while placing the rounds harmlessly away from the A/C but with proper camera angles & a little trickery we got it pretty close. I found that pretty interesting as my Dad was an anti/aircraft gunner on the front during WW2. My Dad took me to see the movie as he was quite familiar with the raid. He commented on how real some of the tracer shells looked as the German's fired the Flak up at the A/C. Something to think about while you're viewing this great movie & where else are you going to see that many Lancaster A/C in the air all at once. A good historical , true story ! AND if you're going to obtain the 3-disc set " The Ultimate DAM BUSTERS Collection " this DVD " The Dam Busters " is a must own companion. Genuine Air Bases , genuine A/C, all bases covered for a ring-side view of a most very famous raid. 5 STARS !
