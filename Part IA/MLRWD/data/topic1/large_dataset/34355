It is wonderful that this landmark drama is finally available on dvd and video.Galsworthy's Saga was brilliantly adapted for the BBC in 1969,and no series has since matched it's achievement.All of the grandeur and pathos of the books is superbly expressed in this adaptation.The characters come vividly alive on the screen,and the era through which they pass is shown with all of it's faults and virtues.The acting is first rate, and all of the actors,from lead roles to small parts,are cast to perfection.
Kenneth More as Young Jolyon,Eric Porter as Soames,Nyree Dawn Porter as Irene,and Susan Hampshire as Fleur all give inspired performances,deep emotional characterizations that will move you greatly.In my opinion,they BECAME these characters.In addition,Margaret Tyzack as Winifred,Nicholas Pennell as Michael,Dalia Penn as Annette,and Caroline Blakiston as Marjorie Farrar give outstanding performances.The series was shot in black and white,but somehow that seems to add to the atmosphere,like old tintypes and photos of the era.I cannot praise this series high enough.It is sublime.
