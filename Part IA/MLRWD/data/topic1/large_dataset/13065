For One, those that whine about, being demoralizing towards women, please, as men, we all know women can be the ultimate evil, maneaters, I mean his wife cheats on him, with his boss, that's some saddistic evilness if I've  ever heard it, he handles it so well, besides forget this line? " I  wish I Still didn't love my wife" he still did after all she did to  him,and when wayons told the football player, to let the girl up, he didn't  so wayans, mashed him in the nose with a football, seriously cool, this is  a very unique film, seriously how many Sports-Action Films, are there? -  Willis is "Soooo" Cool in this Film, it Should be Illegal, he's  just the ultimate toughguy like I Said, aside from of Course, Joe Pesci,  Sorry bruce, your amongst my favorite actors, but you aren't a wiseguy,  yet, maybe sometime, see this movie, I give it my highest recomendation,  this is the sleeper hit of the 90's, wayans is a great actor,and deserves  more pub, in this side of the entertainment industry, these two play  marvelous off each other, it's the ultimate buddy movie, I prefer this  "FAR" Over Lethal Weapon Series,and I Dig them as well, Willis is  One Cool Cat, See this Film, Nuff Said..
