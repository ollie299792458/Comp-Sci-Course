Don't Look Back presents a portrait of an artist going through his adolescence about 10 years too late.  For those who have seen No Direction Home and want a more in-depth look at the tumultous Dylan personality of 1965-66 this is the place to look.

Pennebaker follows Dylan from stage to green room to hotel picking up on an increasingly isolated man seeking to continue his transformation from folk hero to pop star while being confronted with a public ready only for Donovan and a small fan base wanting only the issues-oriented troubadour they'd become comfortable with.

Dylan is depicted here being both tired and on edge at the same time.  Comedy comes in the form of Dylan's continued lambasting of Donovan (a running joke throughout the movie) and his confrontation or brushing-off of virtually every journalist assigned to cover him.

Performances are generally not shown in their entirety in the documentary itself.  But what performances are shown are remarkable for the fact that so many of the lyrics seem to be addressed to the fans who were not willing or were unable to follow Dylan into his blues/rock/pop phase: "Something's happening but you don't know what it is...", "I know that you know something's tearing up your mind...", Any lyric from Like a Rolling Stone.

Simply put, this documentary gives a great deal of insight on a man who wants to be accepted yet remain an outsider at the same time.  A man who wanted to be the center of the scene and pushing the boundaries of the scene at the same time.  It's truly an American story and the scenes of Dylan and the Hawks playing on a foreign stage in front of the American flag while playing blues and being booed is almost exhilirating.
