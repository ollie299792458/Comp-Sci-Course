When I bought my DVD player 5 years ago there were only 2 movies that I wanted to own.  Star Wars and Superman.  Well, I got one down.  This DVD is truly something special.  I had heard rumors that there were extra scenes never seen before and that those scenes would be on the DVD.  But I thought to my self, "would they be inserted into the film or simply pushed off onto a side menu" (ala Austin Powers).  I was delighted to see the answer was both.  The movie is presented in its spectacular, original form.  Deleted scenes added in.  The quality of the transfer is breath taking.  And John Williams score comes through in beautiful digital clarity.  The movie flows so much nicer with the added scenes.  Another treat are the 3 "making of..." documentaries.  Ever wondered how they made Christopher Reeve fly almost 15 years ago.  The secret is at long last revealed.  However, I think the best part of the DVD is the interview with Christopher Reeve.  He truly is a "SUPERMAN".  Enjoy!
