I had a great time watching the first season via this DVD set. I have seen the last two seasons and loved them but I had never seen the first season. I thought I'd get this to see how it was and I wanted to see how the first winner was, (while being a candidate). I have to say that it was amazing. I loved the whole series. The candidates were very unique and entertaining to watch. Even Mr. Trump is a little more laid back in this season than others.

The bonus disk is also very fun. It has more info on the candidates, a music video, deleted scenes, career advice from Trump's advisors George and Carolyn, an exclusive sneak peak of season 2, "Donald-isms", unseen footage from the ending title taxi rides, new interviews with Donald Trump and the contestants, and creator Mark Burnett on The Apprentice. A lot to offer, really.

I really recommend this set to those who like reality shows (like survivor). Even if you haven't seen the first season, or even if you haven't seen any of the seasons. This is really a great set.

I hope to see the second season on DVD soon.
