For diehards only--the plot is a thinly-veiled ripoff of the original anime: bad guy (a biologist this time!) collects data on street fighters while planning to take over the world.  What's worse is that the story barely holds together.  Yes, the film is Ryu-centric, but even so we get little character development, only scenes of him uttering the same lines repetitively.  Ken acts younger in this one (recall the flashback scenes from the original) and is just comic relief.  The original SFII art was not consistent, but Alpha cannot compare: the colors are washed out and the art lacks detail.  In the DVD extras, the animator even admits to having difficulty drawing Chun Li--perhaps this is why the movie so often resorts to odd camera angles (predominantly crotch shots) and it is frustrating when the fighting takes place outside of the viewer's perspective.  You'll have nothing to match the likes of Ryu vs. Fei Long, for instance.  The trailer and box might have you believe Akuma is the villain here--if only it were so.  The character design on the last two "bosses" is a joke.  A disappointing release celebrating the 10th anniversary of an excellent anime movie . . . Let the buyer beware.
