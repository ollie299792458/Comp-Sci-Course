Lets see...in about the first five minutes:

1. A male flight attendant shows himself to be a total jerk

2. A male terrorist is easily overpowered by a woman wearing a mask

3. A male drill seargeant is knocked out cold with a single punch by a woman

4. A man is told by a woman that he's not fit for sex, and then promptly commits suicide

Notice a pattern here?

This movie is so misandrist* it makes Thelma and Louise look positively pro-male.

"So what? It's just a movie," you say? Well consider a movie that consistently put down and ridiculed women. Would that be okay? How about a movie that put down black people, unrelentingly portraying them as brutes, weaklings and mental deficients. Would that be okay? After all, it's "just entertainment."

Any guy who thinks this is a swell movie is too stupid to realize he's being insulted.

*Misandrist (one who hates persons of the male sex, the opposite of a misogynist)
