This movie has it all; zombies with exploding heads, plenty of guns, naked chicks, naked guys, (only chests are visible) love interests, Rock and Roll, aliens, guys combing their hair, guitars with weapons, and a really good time.  Despite being a zombie flick the gore in this film is kept to an incredibly tasteful minimum; I've played fighting games with more guts.
This is what "KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park" should have been, and any other movie in which zombies explode and Rock and Roll saves the earth.  Ace, Guitar Wolf's biggest fan, assists them and becomes a Rock and Roll blood brother.  The next day, he meets a girl and is attacked by zombies.  There's no plot as to WHY the zombies or the aliens are there; invasion, accident, first contact?  Who really cares, however, when you've got true love to save and Rock and Roll to spread?
I'm inclined to place this in my Comedy section, but it fits Sci-Fi quite well: it's not scary, so Horror is out.  If you love Rock and Roll, zombies, or just plain cheesy-good movies that are a blast to watch with friends (this includes a drinking game!) Wild Zero is better then new strings for your Gibson!
