"Oh, yes...there will be blood," Jigsaw informs us.  You know what?  He's right.  A police detective finds that a serial killer has his son.  He has placed the boy into a house full of "tests" with a group of hardcore criminals.  Just to make sure there is enough pressure, he has filled the house with a slow acting nerve agent that will kill the occupants if they stay in the house to long.  There are anecdotes but the participants have to pass a series of tests designed to make them face their crimes against humanity to find them.  Yeah, that sounds like a good time for all concerned.

There are plenty of twists and turns in this one.  I thought I had it figured out no less than six times and was wrong to the very end.

Here's the thing, you expect it to be gory, but what you don't expect is the way it gets under your skin.  It is psychologically disturbing on a level I only wish I could attain in my own creative endeavors.  It is a sneaky kind of scary, the kind that you don't notice while you are watching the movie.  No, it waits until you are alone with your thoughts and haunts you mercilessly.  Luckily, the effects aren't lasting.  Once you realize what is causing your...discomfort, you can easily (relatively) shrug it off and move on.  I haven't watched a movie that truly got to me since I was a child.  I now own this one.

It is a rare event when a sequel meets or exceeds the quality of the original, but I have to say this one fits the bill.  I intended to watch them both back to back at some point in the near future.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of horror.  Hell, I recommend it to anyone who isn't, if nothing else just for the experience of it.
