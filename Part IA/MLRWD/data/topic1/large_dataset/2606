This film captures the themes of loneliness and poverty better than any film.  John Voight (Joe Buck) and Dustin Hoffman (Ratzo) give stellar performances, bringing life to two characters that could have been spoiled  if other actors had assumed their roles.  Coming off the unforgettable  character of college graduate Benjamin Braddock in "The  Graduate," Hoffman demonstrates his versatility by offering a  convincing portrayal of an ill pick-pocket in this film.  Many people write  about how the film-making techniques appear dated in this day and age.  However, films like "Midnight Cowboy" help to inform later  generations of the vision of film-makers from previous generations.  This  movie violated any sort of mold or pattern that film-makers may have  followed, marching to the beat of it's own drum.  The most disturbing event  in this movie is the ending, sure to surprise anyone who is used to fairy  tale endings evident in most American films.  This film is not just a great  story, but also a great criticism of the state of poverty in the richest  country in the world.
