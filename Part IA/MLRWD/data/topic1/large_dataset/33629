This is one of those European movies that were not marketed in the U.S. market properly, thus was not seen by many viewers when it was first released. Writen and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore from Italy with an American and English based cast of actors, it's cinematography, superb acting and beautifully scripted storyline, its an intelligent film that leaves you spellbound.

I read numerous reviews on Amazon with regards to this film before buying it, and as one customer previously wrote..."I remember having a guest over one evening who was seeing it for the very first time. His reaction (after wiping a tear from his eye) was to exclaim "what a wonderful movie! How did anyone even get a film that quirky made?" There is no Hollywood 'formula' to this film. It proceeds without any of the usual conventions: no good guy vs. bad guy struggles, no sex, no violence, and no crude jokes. It is like that really good book that you start reading one night when it is already too late but are unable to put down until you have turned the last page"... So in summary: It is that good!
