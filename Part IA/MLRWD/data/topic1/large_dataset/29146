Im a big horror movie fan. This movie was ok. Nothing real special. To me, there was more suspense than actual horror. When i looked at the cover on this movie i thought it would be real scary, but once i saw it was nothing like that.

So movie is about this [...] kid who is afraid of the dark because he sees the "dark things" better known as the ugly, trenchcoat, hat wearing mummy looking things. One night, the parents leave him alone with his big brother and of course, theres a storm, all the lights go out, and the dark things start coming out.

Plot is ok. Seen it more than several times, but it was a little more modernized. Ok acting. Not too many characters so that was good. A lot of suspense in the film, that was nicely done. However, the actual scary things are shown about 2 or 3 times in the entire movie and its not that scary.

Overall, if you are a horror fan, be aware that this isnt going to freak you out to point where you cant sleep at night. Its more jumpy than anything. Ok movie, but nothing else.
