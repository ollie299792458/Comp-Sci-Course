For what it is, (a low budget, theater/movie channel nonentity) "I, Madman," is pound for pound the best movie of it's genre from the late 80's and early to mid 90's. One can tell that this movie was a labor of love, if not from the actors themselves, then from those behind the scenes. Jenny Wright is hit or miss in her scenes, as is Clayton Rohner. Not that this really detracts from the movie, they both do an adequate job. The real star of this show is the "Madman" himself, Randall William Cook. Cook, (Dr. Kessler/Malcomb Brand?) steals every scene he is in. There has not been, in my opinion, a villian of his caliber since Dr. Hannibal Lector. Now, about the DVD itself. There are no extras other than one movie trailer, which bills the movie as "Hardcover," and subtitles in French, English, and Spanish. If you want to watch an innovative movie that is rich on suspense, with a good portion of horror, buy this movie. You will not be disappointed. Plus, the cover looks pretty cool, in a pulpy kind of way.
