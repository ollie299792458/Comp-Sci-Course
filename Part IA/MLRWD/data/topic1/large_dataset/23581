I've seen every "Heights" that has been filmed so far and this one remeins my favorite. I read the book aabout 30 times when I was in college. (I still remember a dorm-mate asking me if I was reading it for a class and exclaiming when I said no, "You're reading for FUN?")

I love most versions I've seen for one reason or another. But the 1939 story was too melodramatic and over acted. (Lightning strikes behind Merle Oberon when she declares "I AM Heathcliff!"with her eys bugged out.  And they are way too virtuous! These are PASSIONATE people! Passion is not always pretty.

Timothy Dalton was great as Heathcliff but his leading lady was homely and the entire story wasn't told.

The most recent Masterpiece Theatre production was good, but the actors were a little long in the tooth to be the Cathy and Heathcliff of my imagination and Nelly was not given the role written for her, in my opinion.

The foreign language versions just aren't "ENGLISH" enough! This is the story of Celts and Angles!

Anyhow this is the onw that catches the characters for me!

This is the ine that makes me cry and the actors say the lines closest to the way I imagined they shoud be said when I read them during my romantic college days!

I love it!
