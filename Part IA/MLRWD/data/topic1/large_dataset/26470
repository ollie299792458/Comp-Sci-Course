And not only that, but a great and powerful film.  This film you change your outlook on life.  It's the story of Tevye, a Orthodox Jew in Russia around the time of the Red Revolution.  Tevye, who is a poor milk man, struggles with keeping the Jewish faith, all in the face of overwhelming prejudice, changing moral codes, and sweeping political ideas.  But all he wishes is to be left alone to read the holy scriptures and keep his family around him, and maybe have a little money in his pocket.  But time after time he is forced to compromise his values, until all that he wishes for is gone.  And he realizes that he lost it because he compromised his values.  An important lesson, especially today.

I saw the play on Broadway three years ago.  Alfred Molina played Tevye and I loved it.  But there is no one better suited for the role than Topel.  He is Tevye.

I've waited for an edition like this for a long time.  The old special edition was double sided and I can't stand that.  I finally get to own one of my favorite films of all-time.  I recommend it for everyone.
