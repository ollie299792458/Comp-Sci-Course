"The Sound of Music" may have been the greatest Musical of the twentieth century.  By the time the musical appeared in This movie, colleges every where were producing their versions of this musical.  And, some of the songs have become classics that are still heard as separate songs in serious musical vocal performances.

First; this DVD is not quite as good as the original movie.  The images are somewhat duller and the sound is not quite as good.  However, it seems to be the best version now available.

Next: If you do not know the story, a young nun, Maria, in pre-WWII Austria becomes a nanny to the Von Trapp children.  The nun enjoys singing and starts to teach the children some songs.  Baron Von Trapp is suprised at this development.  The Baron was about to re-marry, but complications set in.  Worse, WWII is about to break out.  However, life continues.  The movie does have a good ending.

During the movie, we are treated to several very excellent songs and very good performances.  This was Julie Andrews second magnificent movie in a row.  To this day, there are very magical moments in this film.
