This film is catching. It provides an insight from a German guy, living changes in the "gay" lifestyle at the begining of the Nazi Period. Although not being a documentary, it is a "could be" movie. At the begining of the film we are in a wild club with fancy and trendy people flirts, watch "modern" performances and enjoy and industrial envoiromen. It reproduces the mood of early 30's Berlin, were "gay life" was active in clubs like EL DORADO, bistros and even gay and lesbian magazines like Die Freundschaft. Life is a party for Max, the main character. However, Nazi politics, which includes homosexuals witch-hunt, is the end of that golden era. It is not mentioned in the film, but although that active gay life, there were a law against homosexuality (Paragraph 173). That is a reminder for us now, it is not only important to have social tolerance or acceptance, but to be sure laws are changed for not raising among the dead and haunt us in the most unexpected moment. Max meeting a self-confident guy at a concentration camp will make him understand the differences between sex and love. Although being a similar theme to A LOVE TO HIDE, the French film is more oriented on external situations of being gay in France, focusing on police activity, concentration camps abuses and even mentioning castration, hormones experiments and cerebral interventions with homosexuals. BENT is more introspective about being gay in a hostile envoiroment, as well as personal evolution from egocentrism to commitment. A touching film to see and talk about with friends.
