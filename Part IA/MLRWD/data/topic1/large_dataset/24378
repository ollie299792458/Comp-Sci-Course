I came here today to write a review of this movie after watching it last night - but, after reading Robert Moore's review, I feel like I'd just sound repetative. I felt the exact same way.

I knew as soon as the movie opened up (conveniently with the Scrubs style narrating from the lovable Dr. Dorian) that we were in for a depressing 90 minutes. "That's not Rachel Bilson" I thought immediately of the girl at the table with him "and this girl is pregnant, this is going to be a bummer".

My girlfriend and I bought this movie at Blockbuster during a "4 for $20" sale because of the cast.  It seemed like it'd be a great movie for us to watch together. Instead, I ended up feeling uncomfortable because I knew that it was putting upsetting thoughts into her head; "what if he does this kind of stuff to me?" "what if we get married and it fails?" etc...and I was right.

We're big Scrubs fans and I was very much in to the O.C. (what a loser, I'm 26 ha!) so I was definitely excited to see this, but just like many others, I was fooled by the marketing and very disappointed.
