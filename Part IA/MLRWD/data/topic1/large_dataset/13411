Criterion has done an excellent job in remastering Charade into DVD for the first time.  The DVD menu is great, especially the "jump scene" option with moving slides.  Most of all the commentaries by Donen and Stone are very entertaining and informative about this  masterpiece and the early 60's.  I really enjoy DVDs because of all these  behind the scene material and insights provided by the makers of a  masterpiece such as this.  The video and sound quality is superior, and it  feels as if it was filmed recently.  I really was surprised about the high  definition, especially since I read that the available copies were of poor  quality.  
"Charade" is usually compared to and put at the same  level than "North by Northwest according to some critics."  But I  think "Charade is far better because its story flows more naturally  and stylishly.  In "Charade", as the title suggests, the deceptions were very realistic and credible and they are my major reason to prefer it over the other. 
"Charade" is very unique, as most critics agree, because it combines several elements in one film: two most glamourous stars in a thriller that combines suspense, murder, comedy, romance and smart dialogue.
