As a big time Dark Shadows fan from the days of the original TV show, I was pleasantly surprised by Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's new take on an old story. Great acting, great cinematography! It left me wanting more. Maybe a sequel in the near future?

Now onto the Combo Pack that I purchased. "ULTRAVIOLET"? WTF? The DVD and Blu-Ray also came in the package. Why would I want to take up space on my computer when I can pop in the disc? So, watch a movie on your iPhone? What do you do, use a magnifying glass so that you can see it?

As to the content, the "Special Features" could have been more. You've got a new take movie on an old established story. You've got short cameo appearances by four of the stars of the original TV show, one, Jonathan "Barnabas" Frid, not living to see the release of the movie. How nice it would have been to see interviews with these original TV show actors. Being one of the people who went to the theater to see this movie, and of those movie-goers, most being the gray-haired variety bringing their grandkids, I had high hopes for the DVD release of the movie and seeing, in the "Special Features", the original TV actors talking about the good ol' days and how nice it was for Tim Burton to include them in his movie.

My advice, if you liked the original TV series, if you liked this movie, Buy It!
