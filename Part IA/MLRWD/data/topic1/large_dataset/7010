It's Sat. morning and I just stumbled onto this awesome movie!  What more could you want besides Pancakes and sausage served up with real maple syrup, black coffee.  After watching Dinner Rush, I am ready for Lunch!!! Its a great cast acting in a very well written script!  Danny Aiello's portrayal of "ol' Tony" in The Professional could be a side script to Dinner Rush.  Old Dog on the block that will not be pushed around.  Its every Italian restaurant in NYC with that one table that the owner reserves for himself.  From the front of the house to back of the house, the restaurant is real!!!  The conversations could take place anywhere fine dining is hustled.  The stress and pressure is a big part of the food service industry and you can see the realism in this movie.  When you see that server being tortured by a overly demanding customer, understand that they work hard for every penny!!!  Food, food, and more food!!!  As movies of food go this one should come with a recipe book. Finally, I suggest no dieters watch this movie, you can gain weight from just watching it!!!
