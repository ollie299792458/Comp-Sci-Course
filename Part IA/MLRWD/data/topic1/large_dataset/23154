Fans of the movie "Carousel" be prepared, at last the two disc anniversary edition is on its way. It was released three weeks ago in Australia and must surely be available at Amazon within the next few weeks. It has been released with two disc special editions here of "the King and I" and "South Pacific"(the best of the set) and of course "Oklahoma" and "State Fair" which have been available in the States for some time. Why three of these musicals were kept from release in the States is one of the mysteries of the age. Regardless "Carousel" is finally in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen and unlike the current print available is a beautifully remastered, clear as bell color print finally restoring this movie to its long overdue glory. Two discs have several features (not as many as the other R&H movies)some nice tidy specials and sequences from the 1954 Ford Anniversary special with the Original Broadway cast doing the entire 14 minute bench scene. The big disappointment is the audio commentary, for even though it has Shirley Jones and Nick Redman chatting away merrily (as in "Oklahoma") their knowledge of the movie is scant to say the least. They have to struggle to remember Robert Rounseville and Gene Lockhart's names(did not anyone supply them with a cast list) and even though there are some interesting vignettes along the way (such as how Barbara Ruick died so young and was married to John Williams the movie composer),they need some more info on the script of the musical itself.For instance, Shirley has played in the movie and when recording the commentary was playing Cousin Nettie on stage, yet no one seemed to ever tell her that Billy Bigelow always committed suicide in the stage versions and his falling on his knife was a cop out for the movie version to soften the darkness of the script and his intent. She says she loved the Lincoln Centre production, but clearly missed the lines about suicide and makes an idiotic comment about the falling on the knife being an idea they copied from "Oklahoma" (only the screenwriters, Shirley).This takes away from an otherwise delightful release, hopefully you will get it in the States soon.
