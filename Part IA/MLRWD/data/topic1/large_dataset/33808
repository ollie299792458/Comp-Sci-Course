Ok, so obviously this isn't the best movie in the world, but it sure isn't the worst. It's a fun b-movie romp. If you were expecting Shakespeare, then I'm sure you were a little disappointed. But I mean, seriously, it's about a talking duck! How anyone could've been misled by this film is beyond me, so I've never quite understood why everyone hated it. I grew up in the 80's, and this was one of my favorite films when it came out, because it was fun. Years later, probably 1997 or 1998, I found a new VHS copy and I've all but wore it out now. It's still just as fun to watch! Tim Robbins is hilarious in this early comedic role, Lea Thompson is hotter than ever, and this is hands down my favorite Jeffrey Jones performance, outshining "Ferris Beuller's Day Off," "Beetlejuice," and (another underrated and fun b-movie) "Mom and Dad Save the World." I've been pretty vocal about pushing for this film, signing petitions and such for almost ten years now, joining the fight to persuade His Lucasness to finally release it (cuz seriously, it's no worse than any of the new "Star Wars" films), and it's so good to see that after all this time, it's finally here. Again, just have fun with the film, judge i for exactly what it is, and not what it isn't,a nd it's a great film.
