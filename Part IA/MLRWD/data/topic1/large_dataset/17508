This is a movie that drips with cheese.
Silly special effects, basic plot, one dimensional characters.

And it's one of my favorite movies of all time.

It's hard to describe why I like this movie so much. Maybe it's because I grew up watching Kung Fu Theater as a kid, and so have a special place in my heart for bad effects with guys flying around on wires and the like.

Maybe it's because Jack Burton is such a doofus, you can't help but like him.

Maybe it's my deep interest in the Chinese culture?

It's probably just that it's a fun movie. From the start, it grabs you and doesn't let go. There is no "down time" in this show, just non-stop action with some really, really funny lines thrown in for good measure.

Don't watch this movie expecting great acting or stunning visual effects (although there are some pretty cool scenes), but if you are looking for a couple of hours of pure fun, I can't think of a movie I could recommend more. I hope you enjoy it.
