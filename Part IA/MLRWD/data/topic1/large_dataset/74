&lt;&lt;&lt; A few continuity errors (spoilers?) follow the Octothorpes >>>

Earlier this year I enjoyed "Terminator Salvation" on a big-screen digital theater with a group of sci-fi friends and we all loved it. Then, being a huge fan of the Terminator franchise, I jumped at the chance to buy the 2-disc Blu-ray release. I just finished watching the "Director's Cut" and must admit to you all that "I Forgot How Good This Movie Is". It is a good sci-fi story, as well as a good sci-fi movie.

But let's be realistic, it was the only sci-fi movie of 2009. "Transformers 2" was a fantasy and "Star Trek (reboot)" was a futuristic soap opera with one of the poorest sci-fi plots I've ever seen in a movie theater.

&lt;&lt;&lt; Tiny Continuity Errors >>>

1) in both releases, there is a noticeable annoying gap between the time that John Connor "exits the rescue plane" then "enters the submarine". This could have been easily fixed.

2) in the Director's Cut, the rain mysteriously stops between the time that John Connor leaves Blair Williams then returns to save her from attack by three men. This could have been easily fixed.

3) one possible plot weakness: all throughout the movie, people (including John Connor) are using two-way radios. You would think that Skynet would have been able to home-in upon these signal sources, and maybe Skynet did. Now if you think of Skynet as a chess-playing gaming system (TSCC fans know what I am talking about here), then even the voice of John Connor on the radio may not have been as valuable to Skynet as the destruction of the submarine which represented the top of the Resistance's command-control system. (think of a gambit in chess when one piece is bypassed in favor of a possible superior future outcome)

4) This is not a complaint, just a statement: Many people think the naked Terminator seen in the last part of the movie was played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The actor was really Roland Kickinger with Arnold's face tweaked onto Roland's body via CGI.

Two Blu-ray discs along with a digital-rights DVD (to download a Digital Copy to your PC) for less than $20. I hope bargain prices like this remain after the economy recovers.
