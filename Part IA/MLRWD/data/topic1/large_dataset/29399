Before discussing the film per se, I must say that I wish this movie had been called "John: Portrait of a Serial Killer" because I am tired of reading about it not being an accurate representation of Henry Lee Lucas' life.  Repeat after me: it is not a biography...it is not a biography.  With that said, this is not a typical serial killer movie.  There are no forensic psychologists and there's no cliched detective fighting his personal demons.  This movie captures several episodes in the life of Henry, which is rather banal outside of the murders.  Nothing begins or ends in this film, the characters aren't changed by its conclusion, even if most of them are dead.  Basically, Henry does odd jobs in Chicago and occasionally commits brutal murders.  He draws his dimwitted, drug-dealing housemate, Otis, into his exploits and enters an intimate relationship with Otis' sister.  As you can see, the plot is simple, but effective.  The film is shot in a grainy, bleak fashion that is more like a documentary than a big-budget film.  The acting is more than adequate; the titular character is especially well-played.  Beware that no punches are pulled and nothing is added to lighten the mood(except, perhaps, the line about the Bears, which had me in stitches).  In actuality, this movie is not very gory; it just seems that way.  My one bone to pick is with the distracting music, which detracts from the matter of fact direction and pacing.  This one is a classic in my eyes and I have watched it more times than I care to count.
