I get very frightened over seeing these types of films when they are well done.  Boy, did this one succeed.  I had trouble sleeping for several nights despite having a husband and dog with me in the room!  Frankly, I would have had to leave a theater if that had been my viewing venue because I would have been too scared to stay.  I only made it through this because I could see it at home.  The scenario involves a Victorian London solicitor (lawyer) who goes to the English countryside area to work on a legal matter.  There he first sees a woman dressed in black who wordlessly stares at him.  He then finds out she is the local ghost.  If he's seen her, he's told, then he has been singled out by her for haunting.  And, man, can this woman haunt!  She is not confined to this locale either and can follow him wherever he goes. I don't want to tell you any more because I may ruin it for you. I first saw this film several years ago but recently had it brought to my attention again by my friend Ellen M.  She finally was able to see it at home too.  It scared her so much that she screamed out loud at one point, even though utterly secure and safe in her own home!  Believe me, I knew how she felt.  If you've been looking for a top flight ghost film, look no further.
