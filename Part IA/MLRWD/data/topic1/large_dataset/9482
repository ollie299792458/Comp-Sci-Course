Actually, I give the movie 5-stars and the DVD 2-stars.  So actually that would average out to 3.5 stars.  Since I love the movie itself, I was generous and rounded up to 4 stars.  
While I am a great, great fan of Grease (I must have seen it at least 20 times during the summer of '78), I must say that the DVD release of this wonderful film is somewhat disappointing.  The fact of having Grease now on DVD is terrific, but for the length of time us fans have been waiting for it, you would have figured we would get a DVD packed with extra features, not just a watered-down interview from VH-1 and a theatrical trailer.  Like George from 2 posts ago mentioned, there could have been deleted scenes, outtakes, commentaries - all pretty standard DVD fare.  At the very least there could have been a cast bio page so we could all at least know what all our favorite Greast cast members have done since then.  With the lean-ness of this DVD, Paramount could have released both the Widescreen and Fullscreen versions of the movie on the same disc rather than 2 separate ones.  It looks like they just put together these DVDs because of fan pressure to release them and didn't put much effort into them.  Heck, I have some old Clint Eastwood westerns like Hang 'Em High and A Fistful of Dollars that have more content on them than Grease does.  And they've been out for a while and only cost me $9.99.  One other note, I don't really care for the cardboard case that the DVD comes in, rather would have preferred the plastic keeper case that most DVDs come in.
I guess I shouldn't get my hopes up too much for Saturday Night Fever - due out next week and also from Paramount - to be much better.  Maybe Paramount will go the way many others do and re-release it as a 2-disc set in a couple of years.  But I wouldn't hold my breath for that, judging by how long it took for the first release.  Way to go Paramount.
