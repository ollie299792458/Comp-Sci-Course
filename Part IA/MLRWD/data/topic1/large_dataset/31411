When i first saw this movie I had heard of monty python by people who said if you like kids in the hall and south park you'll like them. So when i was in the comedy section of my local block buster and there were all the movies and episoids on tape I looked right at the cover and of coarse said I gotta see this one and it wasn't a bad dicsion (totally the opposite a perfect choice for myself). In this movie the pythons totaly stretch the limits of comedy to were some may go "What the bloody hell are they doing?" while I go "That's brilliant and funny!" with of coarse sections of the film such as find the fish and the talking fish (wow they must really be into fish i'm just kidding but it makes you think) may put people into either loving this film or hating it. If you want a sure bet at being funny while wanting to be introduced to the pythons get monty pythons' the holy grail and if you want something that is commenting on religion than the life of brian. But if you want to see a comedy totaly off the wall and unpredictable get the meaning of life right away!
