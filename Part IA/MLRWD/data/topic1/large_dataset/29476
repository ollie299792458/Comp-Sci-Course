Everyone has a film that comes along once in a lifetime and forever endears itself to their heart. For myself, Elizabethtown was that film. No longer do I have to defend my favourite film selections against comparisons with the golden era classics such as Casablanca and Breakfast At Tiffany's, Elizabethtown in my opinion for it's time is the equal of both. Although director Cameron Crowe's past films include my previous all-time favourite Jerry Maguire, I believe he has raised the bar with Elizabethtown. If ever a movie is to be made from one of my novels, then Cameron Crowe would be the man I would want calling the shots. From it's eclectic yet refreshingly beautiful soundtrack, to the raw emotional presentation of life that exists around us, Elizabethtown rises above. Kirsten Dunst is fabulous as the unstoppably positive airline hostess Claire and although Orlando Bloom starred in bigger blockbusters such as the Lord Of The Rings trilogy and the Pirates Of The Carribean films, I hope he holds the role of Drew Baylor as one of the finest performances of his career. Throw in a talented support cast of Susan Sarandon, Jessica Biel, Bruce McGill and Alec Baldwin and you have a highly enjoyable movie. I could spend the rest of my life waiting for a film to top Cameron Crowe's loveable walk through Louisville, Kentucky only to be disappointed when all others fail to compare. So it's safe to say I'll leave Elizabethtown in a class of its own, as a stand alone masterpiece!
