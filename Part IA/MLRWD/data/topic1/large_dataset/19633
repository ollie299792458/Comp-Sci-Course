How can you not like this movie? This movie was not meant to be a serious drama or not even a hardcore action movie...it was meant to be fun! Once that is in your mind, you will thouroghly enjoy this movie that made history with its live action characters. If you were a little kid  when this movie came out, you did not care about little things like the plot or the script. And for grown-ups, the movie awakened the little child in all of us and we found ourselves remembering the days of yesteryear, when we were watching Saturday morning cartoons, rooting for the good guys to kick the bad guys butts.  The movie is good, so if you don't take this movie too seriously, you will enjoy it. The way the live action characters interact with their environment is really something. The turtles are a brilliant creation of Jim Henson, whose legacy still lives. If you are in the mood to just enjoy a simpler movie without all the expensive special  effects, go watch this movie and forget about your troubles for about 90 minutes.
