From an ugly palette of ghetto life--pimping, dealing, and violence--writer-director Craig Brewer, star Terrence Dashon Howard, and the talented supporting cast have created a compelling and often beautiful portrait of desperation and hope. The product is not a film that glorifies pimping, that degrades women, or even that glamorizes rap music. Instead, it is an archetypal story of trying to make it against all odds. This has led to critics sneering at Hustle & Flow's cliched storyline, but the sneers are too quick and misguided. The story arc may be conventional, but it's the boldness of the vision as a whole--capturing the truth of Memphis and DJay's life--and plotting it out with the necessary commercial compromises to make it happen. The film deserves more than knee-jerk dismissal on grounds of being a retread, portraying blacks poorly, or being evil towards women. These criticisms can be briefly addressed. Quick name all the movies that deal with a sensitive pimp trying to get out of poverty. As far as the portrayal of blacks, there are a number of very positive portrayals, from the character of the producer Keith, to the choir singer who inspires DJay, even the bar owner who encourages DJay. And ultimately, it's a movie about a pimp. It's hard to have a strong female character in a movie about a pimp. But note that Shug provides the hook for DJay's song and Nola is crucial too.

This dirty-beautiful movie should not be prejudged, it should be savored. It has something to say to anyone who has a dream and is trying to make it. Very compelling and far too short.
