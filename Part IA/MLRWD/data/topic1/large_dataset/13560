Starting right off we see Tom Hanks rushed and chaotic life come reeling out. This opening gives us just enough time to feel somewhat sypathetic for Helen Hunt, who plays Tom Hanks' girlfriend.  The real meat of the movie is of course Tom Hanks getting stranded, which happens when his plane ends up crashing.  The plane scene really stands out as being so incredibley intense and almost reaching the point of horrific that it stands alone among any other plane disasters. I won't give away too much about the majority of the movie, but if you haven't seen it yet...see it!  This movie is so fresh and well done that by the end of the movie you'll end up feeling sypathetic for a volleyball!  The very ending is my only gripe...with a story like this it just seemed difficult to find a descent ending, and have a feeling that things have wrapped up.  Although I must praise the writer of the script for not going the easy way out with a typical "Hollwood Movie" ending.  Overall, this is a must for any movie fan looking for an intense, dramatic, and well acted movie about man kind's will for survival.
