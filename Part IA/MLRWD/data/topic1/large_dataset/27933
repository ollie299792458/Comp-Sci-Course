Let's see... Oliver Twist as a heroin addicted prostitute.  Not much of a twist there.  I think we always imagined how homeless orphans made their living, but Dickens was Victorian enough to leave the details to our imagination.

All the elements of the original tale are here.  There's Nick, as the street-wise Dodger and Josh Close as Oliver, the innocent new arrival. There's a grotesque Fagin as the boy's keeper, and an oddly invisible Bill Sykes, who terrorizes everyone around him. There's even a rich old man, who in the end, never adopts Oliver, proving to the boy that some people were just never meant to fit into society.

Fans of Nick Stahl will watch him peel potatoes for two hours, and say how wonderful he was.  That's the essence of Hollywood. Stars sell movies.  Even bad stories can get sold if a popular actor's name appears in the credits.  I confess to being a fan of Nick Stahl.  I usually enjoy watching him work because he brings such unfiltered emotion to his parts, but watching him struggle through this movie was torture.  Ignore the poor sound quality, the lack of continuity, the odd color presentation, and the general lack of a script, and you have a half-told tale of life for street kids in any large city in the world. Nothing new, and unlike the original Dickens tale, nothing to stir your imagination.

So what's the twist?  This turns out to be a story about prostitutes without a single sex scene. Very Canadian I suppose.  Not even a quick shot of someone pulling up their pants after the deed is done.  Several deeds are implied, and a couple go undone, but as far as sex goes, I think I could show this to my grandmother without offending her.  It's a cowardly approach to the subject matter.

As I said before, fans of Nick Stahl will buy this because he's in it, no matter what it's about.  If you're looking for a good story, or even a bad story that's worth watching, this is not your movie.
