Corpse Bride is the Tim Burton movie I've been waiting for.

Since the wild success of The Nightmare Before Christmas in 1993, I'm a little surprised that Tim Burton hasn't made a movie like this sooner.  Corpse Bride is funny, unique, and just an all-around enjoyable film.

This movie tells the story of Victor Van Dolt, a shy young man who's about to be married to Victoria Everglot, a young woman whom he doesn't even know.  Lucky for them, it was love at first sight, but that doesn't prevent Victor from being any more nervous than he already was.  During the practice wedding he flees into the forest, where he accidentally marries the beautiful (but dead) Corpse Bride.  Now, Victor has to find some way to get out of the marriage and back to Victoria.

This movie is such a refreshing break from all the other movies that came out this year.  In my opinion, it is just as good, if not better, than The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Both have scary, Halloweenish sides, but aren't really dark at all.  And (though the rest of my family refuses to believe me), The Nightmare Before Christmas is indeed a Christmas movie, whereas Corpse Bride is more Halloween-oriented (though Halloween isn't mentioned in the movie).

Corpse Bride does have some songs, but not as much as The Nightmare Before Christmas, and not as good either.  However, Corpse Bride is funnier than the latter movie, probably because there's more talking and less singing.  Some humorous parts include a talking maggot that resides within the Corpse Bride, and a parody of the famous scene at the end of Gone with the Wind.

All in all, this is a magnificent piece of work that takes you away from reality for about 78 minutes.  I highly recommend it for people of all ages.
