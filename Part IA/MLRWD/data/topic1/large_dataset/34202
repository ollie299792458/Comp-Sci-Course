"Remains of the Day" is a classic film from the Merchant-Ivory team that lifted the English drama genre out of BBC and PBS obscurity. It works seemlessly and beautifully between past and present, and shows the depth of human emotion behind upper-crust gentility.
Anthony Hopkins is superb as Stevens, the head butler to an English lord whose naive sympathy for the Nazis lead to his downfall. Emma Thompson plays the head housekeeper who joins the manor staff and tries to shake Hopkins out of his emotional and political complacency. The attraction between the two grows out of the tension between doing one's duty and honoring one's feelings. As Thompson's character grows more restless, Hopkins' grows ever more resistant to her overtures. One excellent scene, where she invades his dark study, shows how the butler's training and detachment struggle against a growing affection: as Thompson tries to pry a book from Hopkins' fingers, you can hear the clench he maintains until the end.
The film covers a lot of themes at once: loyalty, sacrifice, unrequited love, and regret. When Hopkins travels to search out Thompson nearly twenty years after WWII, it's as much for the chance at reviving love as it is for asking her to return to the manor. The end scenes are heart-rending without being maudlin.
The other characters are also well done: James Fox as Lord Darlington, the old-fashioned aristocrat who plays the unwitting dupe for Nazi envoys in pre-Churchill Britain; Christopher Reeve as the realistic American politician who voices fear and dismay at the events in the manor (and becomes owner after the war); Peter Vaughan as Stevens' elderly father, and Hugh Grant as Darlington's nephew.
Location shots are sumptuous, from the grand interiors of Darlington Hall to the English countryside. This is a film I enjoy seeing over and over.
