Fellow Kubrick fans have been waiting for the Blu-ray version of this film for a long time.

I'm very pleased to say that this disc was well worth the wait.

The folks at The Criterion Collection have  had my allegiance since the great days of laser discs.
They set the high water mark for uncompromising restorations and digital transfers, not to mention
the exhaustive amounts of supplementary material included with every film.

This BR disc has been given the signature Criterion Collection treatment with wonderful results.
The PQ of the black and white images is awe-inspiring.  I had to stop watching it after the first 3
chapters on my 52" XBR in order to project it.  Even on a 150" screen ( using a Sony Pearl 1080P projector ) the beautiful images
are sharp, clear and crisp.  WOW!

I really liked the menu screen, its basically the signature Kirk Douglas trench walk-through scene tied in an endless loop.
As long as the menu screen is up,  Col. Dax will perpetually walk the endless miles of trenches and pass the countless faces of the mud covered soldiers...
very poetic and creative use of menu design.

The intensely informative supplementary material is full of goodies that keeps you entertained for hours.

Arguably one of the best war films ever made,  and quite possibly one of the best Blu-ray treatments to grace master Kubrick's work.

I can only hope that The Criterion boys can get their hands on Lolita and Barry Lyndon next.
