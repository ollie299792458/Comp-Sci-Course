This is a really good romantic comedy. I'm no baseball fan so you don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy it because I thoroughly did. The movie overall is about a Red Sox fan and a workaholic girl and their relationship even through baseball season.

There is good chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon. The movie does a good job of making Jimmy's character Ben enduring. You can see what Drew's character Lindsey sees in him even though his extreme love for the Boston Red Sox competes with his love for her. So many movies leave this out, you wonder why in the world the two are even attracted to each other anyway; but not in this movie.

I really enjoyed Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon together. Drew has had so many wonderful romantic movies (watch Music and Lyrics, its five star)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPE3">Music and Lyrics (Widescreen Edition)</a> but I really look forward to seeing Jimmy in more roles of this type. I thought he made a wonderful romantic lead.

For a truly charming, romantic comedy that will have your interest from the very first scene, watch Fever Pitch.
