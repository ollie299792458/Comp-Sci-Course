This film is perfect for fans of marching bands, Drum Corps International (DCI) and especially fans of drumlines. The storyline is predictable, of course: young, cocky upstart (Nick Cannon as Devon) challenges everyone around him, including his section leader Sean(Leonard Roberts) and the band director (Orlando Roberts), but the performances by Cannon and Roberts are convincing enough to keep the film entertaining. Cannon, in particular, has just the right touch of intensity for the film. Zoe Saldana is lovely as Laila, but she does not get to show her chops much as a peripheral character to the action. Orlando Brown does not fully get to show off his charisma. The key pieces, however, are the band performances (played by the real bands of Morris Brown College, Clark Atlanta University, Bethune-Cookman College, and Grambling State), the highlights without question being the drum breaks. Drumline is not one of those emotionally "deep" films, but it is highly entertaining: in the tradition of movies like Hoosiers and Rudy. The face off at the film's end between two drumlines for the fictional Big South Classic itself is worth the price of the film.
