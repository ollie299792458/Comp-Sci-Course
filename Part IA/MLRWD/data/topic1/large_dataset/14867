First,this is NOT the full movie of sleepaway camp the survivor found on the sleepaway camp box set. this is an original sleepaway camp by the original director,with the original cast and follows after the first movie,this disregaurd the second and third. i expected alot from this movie since im a huge fan of the original trilogy. I was a bit let down by this movie. the kills are good and some are very gory,ricky however was better in the first movie,dont know what happened to him in this one. the tried to recreate the who done it feeling of the first movie but fail since its pretty obvious the killer is angela(felicia rose returning in the role,not pamala springstein from 2 and 3). they try to disguise felica rose but its pretty obvious to the veiwer who shes is even with make up. some funny moments are there to be found,moves at a decent pace. if your a fan of the original like i am its worth seeing to see the original cast together again but after seeing it you feel how disapointing it is and think of how great it could have been.
