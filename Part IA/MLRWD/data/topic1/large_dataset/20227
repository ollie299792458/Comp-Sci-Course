Coraline tells the story of a young girl who moves into a country house with her parents and finds a doorway into another universe.  This other place has a house similar to her real one and a mother/father that look like her real parents, but things aren't quite right; the house is too beautiful and perfect, the "parents" are too loving, and all the people in this world have buttons instead of eyes.  Her new "other mother" wants her to stay in this perfect world forever.  Then things get spooky.

I haven't read the book by Neil Gaiman, who's a terrific author, but I thoroughly enjoyed this creepy movie.  The portrayal of the "other place" is just right: at first it looks beautiful and enchanting, but things just start getting a little wrong and wronger.  The other tenants (the country house is split into apartments) are terrific characters; the theater performance of the old ladies in the basement is a scream.

The movie was done in 3D stop-motion animation, and it's the best I've seen.  The settings are so colorful and imaginative that for a while I thought it was computer-generated animation designed to LOOK like stop-motion.  The blu-ray includes both a 2D and 3D version (with the 3D glasses), but I haven't looked at the 3D yet.  Home theaters can't replicate the same 3D technology used in theaters so instead they do the ol' red/green glasses thing.  This REALLY screws up the colors which would be a shame in this very colorful movie.  In watching it in 2D, there are clearly elements that were added for an in-your-face 3D effect, but you don't really need it or miss it.

Critics have said this movie is too scarey for children.  What do I care, I'm 54.  People are always underestimating children's ability to process scarey fantasy anyway.  I KNOW that when I was a kid, this movie would have scared the daylights out of me and I'd have loved it.
