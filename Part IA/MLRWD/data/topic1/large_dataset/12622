I have enjoyed reading the reviews of The Damned.  Some viewers/writers were shocked, some seemed to be amused, and others were disgusted.  In my opinion, all these views reflect the writer's circumstances as much, if not more, than the merits or flaws of the actual film.

I first saw The Leopard in a big movie theater, in Paris in 1971, in Italian with French subtitles.  My French, she is not so good, and my Italian, well, it is nonexistent!  But I got the point!  As the many reviewers of The Leopard point out, the film is beautiful, sweeping and grand, (a masterpiece!) the story of a nobleman faced with challenges brought on by changing times.  And with every new problem, the old cat deftly avoids catastrophe and steers his family into the future.  ... and the film is soooo boring!!!  Its beautiful, but the story goes nowhere.

The Damned is the flip side of The Leopard.  Same basic situation, but this time the old man is killed off right at the start, and the family then slides into degradation, perversion, etc. etc. until the most immoral member is left in charge, offering his mother poison as a wedding present.  Nice?  No. But not at all boring.

Perhaps I overstate the case, and maybe conflict and plot are less important in Visconti's films than character, music, sets, dialogue and costumes.  I'll let others argue those points.  What I do suggest is that neither The Damned or The Leopard should be praised or condemned too much without seeing, comparing and contrasting both of these remarkable films with each other.  Only then can Luchino Visconti's films be evaluated as expressions of a cinematic genius and/or a regional chauvinist.
