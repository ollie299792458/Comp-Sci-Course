I read the book "Point of Impact" before seeing this movie. The truth is if you don't read the book you will probably be OK.  I can't say because I did & therefore hated everything about this movie. The actors I have liked in other movies so I'm gonna guess most will also like them here.

I remember having read the Stephen King novel Cujo  before seeing the movie (we won't even talk about the Shinning).  It was actually pretty well done getting a St. Bernard to become a totally evil antagonist. But like all who read the book at the end of the movie was shocked & I actually mean literally shocked when the boy in the end turns out to be alive. It was almost audible in the theater how those who read the book were saying "yep the boy is dead" to all who came with them to the movie. The boy who dies in the end of this book dies in this movie also but, during the course of his mother shaking him & crying he suddenly winds up being alive. Now some will say bogus, rip off, or typical happy ending crap from the typical movie types who always put out typical stuff anyway. BUT the truth was I actually thought it was done well. The boy was dead so long it gave us King fans a smug feeling of being able to state "yep that is right he is dead" & an ending that was a shocker like Point of Impact. If you watch the flick & see how long he stays dead you would probably get it. The fact that it was intentionally done & even aimed at the King fans that came made it that much more of a gotcha moment by the creators of this film.

The point here is simple I don't mind some poetic license from movie makers but Shooter is just plain agony for Hunter fans! But the worst part is that some books just are perfect as they are, have not movie makers learned this simple lesson from the Godfather? I look at Shooter & wonder what they were thinking & as hard as I try the best I can come up with is NOTHING - NOTHING AT ALL....
