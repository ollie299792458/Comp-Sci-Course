This movie was so boring!  Thriller??-- Not even close!  There was no mystery, no chase and no excitement.  It was pretty much predictable until the ending.  Where did the ending go?  They don't tell us anything at the conclusion; it just comes to an end out of nowhere and that's it.  No idea what happened to the characters and story lines.

This millionaire accidentally kills a chick and purposely commits another big crime and yet the detectives have no way of pinning anything to him?  I don't believe that he covered up his tracks that well.  He covered up some stuff but I know he didn't think of everything and all the detectives do is just give up after one failed attempt at getting his accomplice.  It just wasn't believable and wasn't riveting either.

The story fell flat, I didn't feel anything for the characters.  I see it as a bad sign when I feel apathetic about the characters because that means the movie doesn't evoke any feelings in me.  I didn't feel any emotional attachment towards the characters one way or another.  What kind of movie is that?  I think the script was poorly written and the movie was poorly directed.
