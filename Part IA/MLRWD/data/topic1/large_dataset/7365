I had seen this movie in the theatre and now have seen it on video as well.  It was just as entertaining and sweet a story as it was the first time around.  I think Rosalba does feel sort of shafted by her family and in turn decides to take that time to really do something for herself for a change.  She sort of takes on a different lifestyle completely and in the process I think she finds herself.  The characters she encounters make the story all the more fun and entertaining and they each seem to relate to her and/or teach her in some fashion. I think the chemistry and hidden romance between her and Fernando is wonderful and sweetly displayed throughout the movie. I think she basically saved his life.  He had been trying to kill himself in a brief shot at least twice when he was interrupted by her.  I am NOT a middle aged housewife nor am I even married and I found this movie very touching and beautifully done.  The scenery in Venice and all around Italy really adds to the story and characters.  It is just a delightful film.  If you have love in your heart, a hint of magic in your soul, and a love of travel - this is a perfect movie!  Enjoy!
