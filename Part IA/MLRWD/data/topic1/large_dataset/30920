This is a great way to package Bilko rather than simply issuing all of the episodes.

This should have been the first season of Sgt. Bilko (not the Steve Martin movie) show starring Phil Silvers. But the folks at Paramount got cold feet about releasing Bilko with season sets. So what we're left with as an introduction is a sampler of 21 episodes from the four seasons (there were 142 episodes made).

From me to all of these DVD Companies
I DON'T do Best Ofs, Volumes, TV Shows MUST be COMPLETE and UNCUT, Just because it says COMPLETE doesn't mean it's UNCUT. See ALL 4 Seasons of ALF, Father of the Pride, Season 1 of Rosanne, ALL 5 Seasons of Two and a Half Men-One of the season 1 episodes was only 18:30.

It's either a Complete UnCut Season or i keep my money
Extras for me are Optional and NO big deal
The Show is pure Brilliance, The 2 Stars are for this Crummy 21 episode set.
Season 1 had 34 episodes
At least other companies know how to do it.
