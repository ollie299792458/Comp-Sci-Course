The "Predator"is the most mind blowing movie i have seen in the
last 20 years.To me it is like going to a football game and having fun,letting your hair down, and suddenly understanding that you yourself are the ball and that players of both teams are bearing down upon you to have possession of you.It has had an affect on me ever since I borrowed the video by chance off my sister in 1991.
I recently purchased the double disc special edition DVD and would like to road test it for you.
For those of you not aquainted with the film "Predator"I will quickly elaborate it for you.
Arnold Schwarzenegger,whose character in the movie is Dutch,is the leader of a crack task force which generally engage in affairs of extraordinary nature.They are not controlled by the government or any affiliated body and are like a very deadly but close knit family.Dutch and his men are given the mission to locate a terrorist stronghold in latin America and at the same time retrieve any maps or documentation about strategic targets of terrorism.They are also given the mission of finding out what happened to another team sent on that same mission only a few weeks previously.
Being the crack demolition/seek and destroy squad they are,we see them easily moving into top gear and rolling over the terrorists with a minimum of fuss or opposition.
It is then,upon withdrawing,after also already having solved the problem of finding the missing task force,that they are thenprivy to the fact that there is also another obstacle in their way.One which is neither assailable or comprehensible with human means.This happens to be a being which exists solely for the purpose of sport and sees the withdrawing task force as worthy competitors/trophies for his mantlepiece.This being has stealth technology and laser weaponry and is able to evade the high powered weapons of Dutch and his team.It picks off the combattants one by one and where the task force was seemingly invincible against a foe of which they understood and could calculate their every move,they are made to look weak and diminutive in comparison to a foe which knows no morals nor human emotion.It knows only victory and once a foe is vanquished it rips the skull and spinal column out,polishes it up and proudly eyes it up and down as one would a premiership cup or championship ring.
The unsuspecting and completely outgunned taskforce all fallby the wayside and it is left to Dutch to finally,by chance,work out that the creatures vision allows it to see the skin of its prey.Dutch can only then overcome the creature when he is able to accidentally camouflage his body and can see the creature as it turns off its stealth mode in trying to locate Dutch's movements.
Dutch does confront it in one of the most original and rivetting scenes in movie history with the predator at one stage grabbing Dutch by the throat and lifting him to his eyelevel(the Pedator is after all seven and a half feet tall).The movie ends as would a disaster movie with the survivors traumtised and wounded being picked up by helicopter and brought back to civilization.

The "special edition"DVD has many special features and it incorporates an hour long special on "predator"which in fact seems to be made recently although at the same time contains footage from the actual movie shoot,along with out takes and deleted scenes and special effects footage which contain the not widely known "red predator".
