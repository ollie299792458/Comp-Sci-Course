Please note:  Almost all of the reviews below give away the ending of this movie.  Yes, they have opinions and they have comments, but your best bet to watching this movie and enjoying it to the fullest is to not read any of  the reviews below.  85% of them GIVE AWAY THE ENDING.  It's as if someone  told you the ending to the movies "Sixth Sense" or  "Seven". Please be cautious reading any other review past this  one.
I enjoyed this movie.  Yes, there are some preposterous things that  would happen to have the movie end the way it does, but the impact of the  movie was enough to keep myself and those watching curious and enraptured  for the entire time.  Unfortunately, it's one of those movies you don't  really need to watch twice.
I do not have the DVD version, so I don't  know what the alternate ending is or if it is any good.  I have heard very  good things about the director's commentary.  That's about it.  Sorry I'm  not as helpful as you'd want.  You might want to rent this movie (it's one  of those "one time watches, then it sits on the shelf" movies),  and pick up the DVD version only if you want to see all the bonus stuff.  
It was time was well spent watching this movie... and no, I don't feel  "safe" after watching it: one of the feelings you're supposed to  get after watching the movie.  I consider that a good thing.  Go see it.
