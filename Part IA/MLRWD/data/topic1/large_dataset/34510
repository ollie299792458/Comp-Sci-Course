When I initially watched Proof of Life I was a little disappointed.  I thought that the romantic subplot between Russell Crowe's and Meg Ryan's characters was underdevelopped.  However, when I watched it again, I realized that there was more to this movie and the romance than I saw during my first viewing.  The romance and interaction between the two leads was subtle, but that lended itself to the story in ways that more obvious romantic moments would not have.  Terry (Crowe) is a man that gets a lot done without wasting words.  His feelings for Alice (Ryan) are obvious because the things he does not say are more important than the things he does say.  Understated is the word to describe the relationship between Terry and Alice, but that does not mean it's portrayal is ineffective.
In addition to excellent performances (espeically from Crowe and the supporting actors playing Dino and Peter - sorry, I can't remember their names at the moment) the action sequences are superb, and the insight into the relatively unheard of K&amp;R business is unique.  You don't find this information in any other films.
I've heard Proof of Life referred to as "the thinking man's action movie" and I'd have to agree.  It does make you think.  It has subtlety down to an art form and uses subtext as a key to unlocking the relationship between Terry and Alice.
On a side note, the DVD has a really interesting director's commentary.  I am generally not a fan of direcor's commentary, but this one is very insightful and gives more information on K&amp;R and the background of the story than could ever be put in a movie.  In my opinion, the Director's Commentary is one of the highlights of the DVD.
