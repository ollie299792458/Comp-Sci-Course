Who'd have thought that Andy Griffith could give such a dark, powerful performance as this?  And at the very beginning of his career?  He demonstrates such a depth of spirit in this film that it's quite moving.  His portrayal of Lonesome Rhodes as a cynical, bitter drifter is frightening at times, as he pushes himself toward the chords of psychotic frenzy.
There are many great scenes in this film, but one of my favorite parts is near the beginning of the movie... when offered his first job on radio, Lonesome leans on the car with a casual evil, and spits onto the dusty ground.  Man, this ain't Sheriff Andy Taylor of Mayberry!
The ONLY place where the film lags slightly is in the 3 - 4 minute "advertising" section (you'll see what I mean).  They run through a variety of silly ads with Lonesome Rhodes pushing product.  It just runs a couple minutes too long there.  But this is a very very minor complaint, and it's the ONLY one I can come up with.
Bottom line:  this movie reminds me of Hitchcock and Rod Serling stuff.  Very cool movie.  It's an absolute GEM! And I love the ending.
