With Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin, you know, even if the plot is lame, you will get the best acting possible.  Well, the story isn't lame, but is held together by the magic of Meryl Streep and her ability to crawl into her feelings of a divorced woman of 10 years is miraculous.  I know women like her; she is very capable, built a business after her husband marries a younger woman and becomes subservient, yet demanding, with her own chilren.  She is an interesting mother, she is her own woman yet she will dance around her children's plans and feel awful when she's not included.

The ex-husband, Alec Baldwin, who maintains a somewhat peripheral relationship with his three children, has found himself hotly attracted to his ex-wife.  His present wife wants more children and the fertility scenes are hilarious.  As a successful attorney, he knows how to argue and turn the case in his favor.  He believe he wants his ex-wife once again and is accustomed to getting what he wants. There is a marked physical difference between the present, sexy wife and the 50+ ex-wife who seems to be dressed in Eileen Fisher in every scene.  The most startling revelation is that ex-husband had never experienced the pain of loss, the loss of a great love. Steve Martin plays his role to a tee. He is the divorced architect, who has been shattered by his ex-wife, and is starting to rebuild his life (excuse the pun).  I enjoyed the movie but without the acting talents, it would have been a rather superficial chick flick.
