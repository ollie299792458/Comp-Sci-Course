This is the very best DVD, I have been wating for a special edtion of this  movie ever since i first saw this movie with a freind way back in 1986, and  let me tell all who love this film.- The DVD is a must have, the special  edition which features the best commentary track ever heard by director Rob  Reiner, it also features a isolated music score which rules, the very best  part is a documentary filmed specialy for this DVD, this is not some old  1986 promo behind the scenes that's shot to air on HBO when the movie was  first released, rather it is a film shot just for this DVD edition which is  very good!!! We get treated to being visted by Rob Reiner, Stephen King all  now in the year 2000 but also all the remaining actors from Richard Dryfus  recalling his time while filming, and Wil Wheaton, Cory Feldman, Jerry  O'connell, Keifer Southerland!!!! all discussing how the film affected them  recalling funny moments about the shoot, and a very touching tribute to the  very missed River Phoenix, all the actors fondly remember this fine actor  and how tragic his death was fortold in the last scene of the film..  The  special Documentry is 35min long and i promise you will love every second  of it!! So run and purchase this gem of a film finally done right on DVD!!  big thank you to columbia pictures!! your DVD's RULE!!!!!
