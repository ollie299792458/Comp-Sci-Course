this movie first came out when i was nine.  all any one could talk about was clueless.  our whole daily lingo was transformed by this movie. but i hadn't seen it because it was PG-13 and had to beg my dad to let me see it, which he did let me.  and then i started renting it all the time, and finally got enough sense to buy the movie.  and even now, at 16, one of my all time favorite movies.  if i recall, it was placed as 5 on the list of top 10 teen movies of all time, it was only beat by movies like american graffiti and ferris bueler's day off. 
in any case, the movie is worth watching, chock full of witty dialogue and pop culture references.  being the same age as cher, i have to agree with many of her problems. alicia silverstone is great.  i also have to love josh.  he is great and i love the great conversations cher and josh have.  
but all the one liners are great. i can quote most of the movie.  but clueless gave birth to a whole new pop culture.  after that the terms "whatever", "as if", "betty", etc. were all used so much of the time by my generation.  if you have not seen this movie, it is a MUST-SEE.  it's fun.  plain and simple fun.  but it gets you hooked and you can't help but see it over and over again. i ahve probably seen it 20 times, literally.  never gets old.  and if you like this movie, check out emma with gwyneth palthrow, it came out around the same time and clueless was loosely based on it.  its pretty interesting to compare the two.  well, in any case if you are above 9 years old you have to see this wonderful movie.
