This was a really awful movie. The whole premise is predictable and lame, with no surprises at all.

For most of the film she's just trying to convince the audience that her violent, but clumsy character is cute and lovable. But in the middle of the story, she brings her only love-interest of the film onstage for her talent show, of which she allegedly has none and thus has to improvise. For her improvised "talent" she elbows him in the solar plexus, stomps his foot, breaks his nose, and then, of course, assaults his testicles. She leaves him sprawled onstage crying in sexual agony and humiliation for absolutely no reason whatever. In order to even accept this scene as mildly humorous you have to believe that violent sexual abuse is cute and funny. But only when the victim is male, obviously. Sandra Bullock was so proud of this scene that she used it over and over in advertising this made-for-the-Lifetime-network film. To her credit, this sexist scene really does tell you all you need to know about the tone of the entire movie and it's sequel.

If you are a man and not Beavis or Butthead, or you are a woman who doesn't think sexual abuse is funny even when the victim is a man, then skip this film. It's weak and insulting.

Otherwise, even if you're Homer Simpson or Queen Latifah this movie still won't make you laugh much. And you'll leave with a lower opinion of Sandra Bullock than you ever thought you'd have. Much like Julia Roberts, she's not cute or funny anymore.
