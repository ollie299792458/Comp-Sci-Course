This is not a review of the film.  If it were, I would give it a 5 star rating.  But there are so many releases, I am confused which to own.  I currently own the single disc DVD 160 minute release but purchased a BD player for Christmas.  So I want to upgrade to the Blu-ray version, but which one?  Yes, I am confused.  There is a 2009 release of the directors cut of Amadeus with a run time of 180 minutes in an aspect ratio of 2.40:1 and the two disc version which comes with a book and now a 2010 release coming in February that is also listed as a directors cut but only 160 minutes in length.  The newer release is in aspect ratio 1.77:1 which I believe is more of a wide screen tv friendly size but I'm not sure.  Other than the aspect ratio and the different run time which I find confusing since they are all listed as "directors cuts", I don't see what justifies the release.  If anyone can explain the difference, I would really appreciate it. Will the newer 2010 release be worth waiting for or buying over the 2009 release and is it actually a 160 minute run time or is that a typo?  I sort of doubt that the IQ will be better or have there been improvements made there as well?  The price is within a dollar or two of each other so cost at this time is not much of a factor.
