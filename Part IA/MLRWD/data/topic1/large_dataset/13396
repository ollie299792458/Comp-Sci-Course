Some may say young people will not like this movie. I say, it is the best I have ever seen. I may be a "modern teenager," but I can still watch this movie 10+ times and cry every time.
The movie has such wonderful songs, acting, and yes, dancing. Do gangs really dance? No. Does this movie's choreography dazzle the viewer and create a dramatic atmosphere perfect in which to recreate one of the best love stories of all time? Yes.
This movie has never lost its appeal to me. I watch this movie and still find hidden meanings. The movie takes up racism so gracefully, yet powerfully, you can't help but feel sympathy for those who come to this country expecting a beacon of freedom and hope, and are instead met with discrimination and prejudice. 
Kids my age should all watch this movie, as should everyone. If you look past the gangs dancing (which, by the way, can be one of the purest and most beautiful forms of human expression ever), you will see a classic film, one that should be seen by everyone with a social conscience. West Side Story is one of the best films ever made.
