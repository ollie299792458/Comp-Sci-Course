The movie "Unforgiven" is a good movie verging on greatness. It is a depressing movie and is very dark, brooding kind of movie. The acting is top notch. Gene Hackman is excellent as the sheriff. Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood are also good. The cinematography is excellent. This is a movie to have in your DVD library. It is worth several viewings over a lifetime as is "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" with Clint Eastwood.

 However, I must admit that I have encountered friends/family that don't like this movie. However, it is usually that they don't care much for westerns and prefer other types of movies like romance movies. I have found that some women don't care for this movie and don't like it. This film is more of a film for men. The film is violent, but I didn't find it too graphic so I think it is okay for teenagers 13 and up. Most kids younger might find it boring. If you have never seen this movie, give it a viewing. It is worth your time and effort.
