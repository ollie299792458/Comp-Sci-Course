One of the more darker Bond films, this one delivered many spills and thrills to me. The chemistry this film had enough to be number one, but it is highly underrated.
 After saving the world from World War III in 1987's The Living Daylights, Bond needed a break. I don't blame him. After saving the world from global disaster in 1979's Moonraker, he needed his break in 1981's For Your Eyes Only.
 In this alternate version of Scarface meets The Man with the Golden Gun, James Bond (Timothy Dalton) wages a one man war against a ruthless druglord, Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi). The girls are steaming hot, the action is a little bit less deadly from what we saw on The Living Daylights. Of course, the action in the finale is nowhere to be found anymore now Bronsan became Bond.
 I personally consider Timothy Dalton to be the closest to recreating the Bond that Connery invented. Roger Moore was too happy-go-lucky, Pierce Bronsan is a mix between a happy Moore and a timid Connery. In this adventure, Dalton taps into his darker, grittier edge. I just wish Dalton would have continued being Bond. Dalton will remain my favorite James Bond after Sean Connery of course.
