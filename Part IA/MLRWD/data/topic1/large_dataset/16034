Caligula, one of the most controversial movies ever made, is now available on DVD.  This film was a real eye-opener for me, and the DVD is far superior to the VHS that was floating around a bit in the '80s (for all you  people complaining about the quality, just shudder to think of how it used  to be).  The story of Rome's infamous emperor was probably not this wild in  real life, but this is Penthouse and as a result is chockablock with sexual  scenes and graphic violence.  Because Caligula is basically in every single  scene, it's hard for the other characters to develop, but there are some  colorful supporting players, and McDowell really delivers.  It's hard to  believe his next film was to play the reserved, scholarly H.G. Wells  ("Time After Time.")  He is quite a talented actor.  The movie  drags on and on, and sometimes the cinematography is uncertain, but other  times it is dead on the money.  The film is a bit grainy on DVD, but as  someone else once said, this really contributes to the "gritty"  factor.  As far as realism, many of the sex scenes look real, but I doubt  the world has ever seen the likes of that purple-skinned four-eyed (or was  it three-eyed?) woman, plus the guy with all those extra digits and the  siamese twins joined at the head resting at Tiberius' palace.  And how  about the scene where Caligula "consecrates" that marriage...if  that's how it was, I'd never get married.  
The DVD has these things  going for it: the creepy music added to the menu (the same as the opening  title with the quote from Mark), the 30 chapters nicely divided up, the  documentary about the making of featuring Gore Vidal and Bob Guccione  (although in places everyone's face looked way too pale, but it was an old  '70s film), and the sound is far superior to the VHS from what I can  remember.  
But this is Caligula and I would definitely not let anyone  under 18 (or maybe even 21) watch it.
