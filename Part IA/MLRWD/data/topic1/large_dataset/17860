I'm new into the the whole Argento scene.  I went out and bought Tenebrae and Deep Red.  While both were very good films I would give Tenebrae a little bit of an edge for a couple reasons.  First, although I like stories that slowly develop and lead to an explosive climax, Deep Red moved a little too slowly in some parts, very slow I should say.  Second, I liked the ending of Tenebrae better, not to say that Deep Red's ending wasn't good but I just thought Tenebrae's ending was just awesome.  I will say one thing that I am learning about Argento, that he is an expert director.  His movies are an excellent combination of horror and mystery, imaginative camerawork, and a pulse raising soundtrack.  Another thing was that I was unable to guess the killer in each movie.  Also, unlike some of today's thrillers, the motive behind the killer is perfectly logical and fits the rest of the movie like a puzzle.  You finish watching the movie feeling satisfied with what you saw just transpire.  I will say that Deep Red was a genuinely creepy and occasionally suspenseful movie that horror and mystery fans alike should take a look at.  If you can get past the dubbing problems, have a strong stomach, week supporting actors (by the way the acting in either film wasn't that bad, the main characters gave strong performances), you're in for a treat.  Just bear with the slow pace and you'll be happy you stick around for the ending of "Deep Red".  I really dug the bathroom murder, I think Halloween 2 owes some credit to it.
