Most of the people I know of who love this film are among those who were old enough to have seen it at the time of its original release (or perhaps the 1970 re-issue). Those that aren't seem to prefer movies like RAT RACE.  Of course there must be exceptions; this is just my personal observation.  Of those who don't like it (whatever their age) I can only say it's too bad they don't appreciate this much-imitated, but still one-of-a-kind, picture.
My main purpose here is to comment on the recent DVD release.  I have owned the laserdisc box set for some years, and thought it was time I upgraded.  I should have read the fine print. Although the DVD contains almost a half-hour of additional scenes cut from the picture after its original "roadshow" engagements, they are included only as supplemental material on the "B" side of the disc, and not integrated into the film as they were on the laserdisc set.  The "movie" side of the DVD contains only the cut 161 minute version.
The DVD image, thanks to the superior technology, is an improvement over that of the last laserdisc release (although there is the teensiest bit less picture area, due to less-severe letterboxing on the DVD).  But next time I want to watch this film, I'll probably pull out the laserdisc instead of the DVD, despite the better picture, because I prefer to see the 188-minute version (which is as close to a full restoration as has yet been done for video release) all in one piece. (You folks did a great job, Rennie!)
So, all you owners of the "restored" version of this film on laserdisc (or even the semi-letterboxed VHS tape released at the same time) be warned: the DVD does not provide the same version.  You might want to take this into consideration if you plan on purchasing the DVD.
I still love this movie, and there's plenty to laugh at in whichever version you see or have. ("Right!  Except you, lady: may you just DRRRROP DEAD!")
