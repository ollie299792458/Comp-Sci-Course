True confession: I'm not an all in Brian De Palma film aficionado..Mr. De Palma has tossed too many stink bombs into theatres, ala "Bonfire of the Vanities" for an unqualified endorsement!..However, I do salute De Palma's grandiose gothic style of film-making -- the subliminal David Lynch inspired creep humor -- the Hitchcock influenced technicals: see "Vertigo", "North by Northwest", and "Rear Window", for references.."Body Double" released in 1984, is a deliciously wicked, voyeuristic potboiler, bordering on soft-porn, yet exceptionally well cast..The plot is both a tease, and simultaneously sentimental..I've seen the film countless times and applaud the film, despite multiple viewings..The film's soundtrack is central to its quixotic guilty pleasures, especially one hit wonder, Frankie Goes To Hollywood's, "Relax", the high-camp moment in the film, as Jake Scully, (Craig Wason), the film's red herring, adorned in argyle sweater, horn rimmed glasses, and penny loafers loiters in a 70's butch bar, purveying the androgynous action through his inner peephole, like a bi-curious preppy on a school outing, sampling for the first time the dark side of leather and feather basement bar culture, and becoming self-consciously aroused..I won't give the plot away, but see the film..It remains Brian De Palma's most original work..And, a far superior film to the "Untouchables"..No doubt, De Palma reigns supreme in the blue-tinted genre!..Melanie Griffin acts and looks terrific as Holly Body, the unsuspecting, well toned, dirty dancer, that sets Jake up for the drill-kill..And launches the film's parallel stalker plots.
