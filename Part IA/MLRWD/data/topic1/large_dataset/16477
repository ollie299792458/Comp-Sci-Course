The synopsis of this film's questionable plot has been posted by others, so I'll stick to opinion.  If I'd paid to see this movie, I would have wanted my money back.  Just so you'll all know how much excitement this movie stirs, my husband and I had to try three times before we could force ourselves to stay in the room for ninety-seven minutes to watch it.

Somebody having to do with the writing of this saw "The Princess Bride" and decided they could be a screenwriter, too.  They failed.  I want to say "Virgin Territory" is as if someone took characters from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" and threw them in a "Princess Bride" setting, but "Ferris" was actually cute.

If you like soft bad-comedy porn, nuns and priests completely devoid of ethics and wearing more makeup than a drag queen, cheesy teenage "humor," and stupid muttered comments meant to be witty, you'll love this.  Personally, I'm amazed it was ever made.

Yes, I gave this two stars.  Those stars go to Tim Roth, who was convincing and in character throughout the whole mess.  Tim, be more selective.  You have the talent.
