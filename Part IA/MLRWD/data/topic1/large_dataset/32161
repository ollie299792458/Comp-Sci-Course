If someone has to list the films of THE CROW in order of ... let's call it "palatability", I would definitely have to put THE CROW: SALVATION as #2 right behind the original film.

There are now four films in THE CROW series and each one brings something different to THE CROW legend.  Here, Alex Corvis (Eric Mabius in a tour-de-force of underplayed acting, which really works here) is legally executed in the electric chair after being framed, tried and sentenced for the murder of his love Lauren (usually, the protagonist is murdered right alongside and with the person he loves most), and after being resurrected the traditional facepaint is replaced by his own scarred skin from his electrocution.  Also, in this film Corvis must convince Erin (Kirsten Dunst), the sister of his lost love, of his innocence; previously, The Crow has found willing female allies (the young Sarah in THE CROW and the adult Sarah in THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS) right from the beginning.  THE CROW: SALVATION retains the darkness of the original film, but adds more than just a taste of corruption that the previous two films didn't have (the villains in those two were pure evil, whereas The Crow's victims here hide their evil under the guise of enforcers of the law/justice), and the main villain, (Fred Ward in a marvelously vicious portrayal) whom we don't meet until about one-third to halfway through the film, is probably the most monstrous of all THE CROW villains (without giving anything away, the scene in which the main villain gets his comeuppance is one of the most gripping moments from ANY of THE CROW films, and one which I keep replaying every time I watch this film!).

I have read a few reviews of this film here in AMAZON.COM in which people have complained about how it is that the villains in each film know the secret of The Crow; I answer them: unless the forces of evil know The Crow's weakness and are able to exploit it somehow, the hero loses his complexity and becomes a two-dimensional unstoppable killing machine like Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees; without some vulnerability, The Crow has no depth to him.  Many people also put this film down for being released direct-to-video rather than commercially, but that should not matter; it certainly doesn't detract from THE CROW: SALVATION's being a worthy addition to the franchise.
