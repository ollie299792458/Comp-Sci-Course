I never have time to go to the movies these days with my busy schedule. I usually enjoy the comfort of my home and refuse to pay the ridiculus prices at the theaters. I promised my wife I would take her to the movies when "Morning Glory" came out. My wife loves Rachel McAdams, ever since she made "The Notebook". I was expecting to be bored and asleep by the first half hour. I was surprised that I was really getting into this movie. I laughed at the poor anchorman who is put through hell to boost ratings. I also found myself enjoying Harrison Ford's character. Nobody plays a better grouch then Ford. I loved Rachel McAdam's characters spunk and refusal to give up. I'm surprised by many reviewers hating that about this character. I don't understand why everyone expects dedicated workers to be  unpleasent people. I am always joking around and having a good time. I put in over 14 hours of work a day and seldom get enough sleep. I work 7 days a week sometimes. I can relate with this character. Just because you put in a ton of hours of work doesn't mean you have to be a social outcast. If you like Harrison Ford, Rachel McAdams, Diane Keaton, or any of the other actors in this film. You are going to love them in this film. It is a funny film with great actors. I would watch this movie again and knowing my wife she will probably buy the dvd when it comes out.
