To be fair, most people reviewing this version HAVE seen the original classic. A good survey would be that of the 18-25 set that have no knowledge of the 1960 classic. Context can be everything sometimes.
One tip for the viewer of this remake is to change the TV's settings: Reduce 95% of the color to near black and white and then reduce 50% of the brightness. This changes the mood of the film almost completely. Well, after that, we should remove Vince Vaughn as the lead role. Perkins was not known as a comedy actor. Christian Bale, much better choice. Also, we should switch casting roles of Julianne Moore and Anne Heche. Moore, just has that more serious quality in her persona plus classic beauty which plays perfectly against an average looking wiry socially awkward male type. The other roles make no difference, but Crane's boyfriend does have that distracting southern drawl. So there, it's been said before,"Why mess with a classic?" Well, let's see, an excellant version of an updated classic is 'Cape Fear' with Robert Deniro.
