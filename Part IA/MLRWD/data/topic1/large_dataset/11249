This movie is tremendously funny!Refreshing!For once a comedy  with a all female line up.The sweetest thing is a compliment to  all women actors.This happens to be one of the first female movies w/ outstanding laughs!I have read some other reviews...to put it bluntly ,most were idiotic!Especially the women who said this movie was stupid & a insult to women.Most great comedies feature actors & headiners  such as Richard Pryor,Jim Carrey,Adam Sandler,Ben Stiller & Rob Schiender.All of the

 mainstream men's comedies consist of off beat,slap stick,vulger

jokes.All which we consider funny.What about the scene in Something about Mary where Ben Stiller is in the bathroon as an adult waiting for Cameron Diaz (Mary) to show up & he opens the door w/ a suprise hanging from his earlobe,which Mary assumes it is hair gel & uses?

 Most people love that scene in the movie & the movie itself. It is about time for women to get in on the laughs!

 Christina(Cameron Diaz) & Courtney (Christina Applegate)are at their best & funny as ever!If you want a real females perspective W/Alot of laughs check out THE SWEETEST THING!The movie begins in San Francisco.Where two women friends(Courtney&Christina)leave work & stop at Christina apartment to fine Christinas roomate Jane(selma Blair)crying because,her boyfriend dumped her.Christina & Courntey proceed to make Jane's woah's into a WOW by taking her to the hot night club in the city to dance & get her mind off of the rejection of being dumped.Dancing the night away Christina meets the man of her dreams but, doesnt want to give of the game,Afraid of being hurt.The night unfolds for all three women with laughter beyond capacity & fun.This is a awesome romantic comedy that will tickle the heart while making you laugh so hard you have to hold your sides.Regardless of other reviews if you love women & enjoy a good laugh then this is the movie for you!

Cristina Applegate is a hyterical friend ,Cameron Diaz is a fresh breath of laughter , Selma Blair shows her true acting talent & Jason Bateman is just plain hillarious!
