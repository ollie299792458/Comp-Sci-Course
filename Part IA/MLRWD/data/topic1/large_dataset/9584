OK I just rented the video.  Hadn't heard anything about the movie but like all 3 of the lead actors.  There are low budget movies that sometimes turn out to be little gems, and then there are the low budget movies that are so bad they are good in a perverted kind of way.  This one however, has absolutely no redeeming qualities of any kind.  First and foremost if you are going to make a movie that takes place on a train, then the least you should do is make it so viewers feel like you are actually on a train.  Not so here.  For the truly crappy exterior digitally created phony train, and lousy scale models, and the totally unbelievable interior sets, you never for one moment during the entire movie actually believe any of these people are on a train.  The story line, if you could call it that makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.  Not a clue, nothing is made clearer by the end, and the plot points along the way add to the confusion.  I for one think this might be right up there with the worst movies ever made.  Yes really that bad. zero stars, zero plot, zero plausibility, zero zero zero.  Be forewarned.  Final note: if we actually got to see Leelee Sobieski's breasts I would add 1/2 star, but we don't even get that cheap thrill.  Oh man was this a stinker of  the worst kind.  Yes it was.
