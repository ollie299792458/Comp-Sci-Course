I intially bought Highlander : Endgame simply because it was Highlander. I'm a great fan of  the series, however rocky the beginning two seasons are, and turned to the movies after I'd thoroughly tired the series out. The movies... Well, so far from what I've seen they're really not up to par. Engame had decent effects (which is an improvement from the series made in  the 90's) and the acting wasn't noticably bad. The script however could have been far more engaging, Lambert had far to much time which was for the most part wasted. The entire storyline was rather empty. There was a minor plot-line involving watchers that was left hanging with no clear explanation. One thing however that was very well done was the casting for the villian, Jacob Kell, he was very concinving. Adrian Paul was Adrian Paul but he needed supporting help which he really didn't have from Lambert and the one female character. Peter Wingfield as Methos appeared for all five minutes he might have had screentime along with Joe Dawson. The scenes including them were the best in the movie, of course.

If those two actors had had much more of a storyline the movie would probably have reached four and half stars instead of three. That's how much Highlander depends upon those two characters. Connner MacLeod is a rather old subject by now and it was apparant that the writers were having trouble finding something new and intersting with him. All in all buy the series and spend your time watching them instead of Engame. For  those of you who have already watched the series and are just looking for more Highlander material well then by all means go ahead and buy this movie. All in all when all is done and said it is still Highlander.
