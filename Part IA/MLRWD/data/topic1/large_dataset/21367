75 years after its initial release, this film is still a pleasure to watch.  It's as funny and charming today as it was back in 1934, when it won Best Picture and several other Academy Awards.  This is probably the first really great romantic comedy ever made, just a few years after the silent picture era.  What makes this film stand out (like most great films) is the writing brought to life with great performances.  The screenplay is excellent- funny, real, briskly paced, authentic.  And the leading actors- Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert- both turned in the best performances of their careers in this movie.  The result is a first-rate romantic comedy loaded with funny and memorable scenes.  Some stand outs:

- Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in their motor-camp room arguing when the detectives arrive to throw them off.
- The hitch-hiking scene with Colbert 'showing' Gable how it's done.
- The first scene with Gable getting fired on the phone but showing off to his buddies.
- Gable the gangster and 'Shapely'
- Gable telling Colbert about being a good piggy-backer.

But most of all the on-going dialogue between Gable and Colbert really entertains all the way through the movie. Funny, authentic, and entertaining from beginning to end.  Beyond that, there are period moments that really stand out and make the movie authentic without being dated.  The scene where the mother collapses on the bus next to her son is very touching without being over-the-top and reminds us that this is the depression; and the scene with Colbert walking through the motor-camp to the shower also gives a glimpse of real life at the time while being funny too.

The only negative I would add regarding this movie is the picture/audio quality on the DVD, which is not as good as some others of this era.  Generally, there is a bit of a drop-off in quality for movies in the early to mid-30s compared to late-30s.  In that regard, you can tell this is a 1934 film.  The DVD is a significant improvement over the VHS, particularly the video improvement.  If you like movies from this era, however, the quality issues are not a huge distraction by any means.  But, the soundtrack is a little scratchy and the video a little more grainy than some other DVDs of this era.

The general plot-line from this film has been imitated frequently over the years, equalled once perhaps (Roman Holiday) but never bested.  I am looking forward to the Blu-ray edition of this film, which I imagine will greatly improve both audio and video quality of what I consider one of the top 5 or so romantic comedies ever made (along with The Philadelphia Story, Roman Holiday, When Harry Met Sally, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill) and one of the best movies of all time.
