I waited for a long time to own The Rock in DVD, but I wanted an edition to do justice to the film. The Criterion edition comes close to what I expect of a special DVD edition, but it came a little short.
The sound is excellent, and the movie is a pleasure to hear, but the image is not as good, in some scenes one can look that it is a little bit grainy, I don't know what happened in the restoration process, but it certainly came short.
About the bonus material, they're just good. And one thing this edition lacks of is spanish subtitles, why is that important? Well, there's an important spanish-speaking community in the US and a growing one in Canada that would appreciate that! (and that goes for most of the Region 1 coded DVD's) and there are no criterion edition DVD's in Region 4 format.
The film is one of the best I've seen so far, it's an action rollercoaster and even when it is not very original in some parts and uses some clich&eacute;s, it is an excellent movie to watch over and over.
