The Disc Itself:
VCI Entertainment has a reputation as a cut-rate house, dealing primarily in public domain works, which made me wonder about picking up a blu-ray from them. I was pleasantly surprised -- the film is crystal clear, rock steady, and if there are any splices they weren't where I noticed them. This film has been beautifully restored and upgraded in image quality, and I hope we get to see more blu-rays of these classic films with this much attention paid to the transfer.

The Movie:
One of the best-known, definitely one of the most influential, and considered to be the best adaptation of A Christmas Carol ever committed to film. Alastair Sim's interpretation of Scrooge is lower-key and more realistic than a lot of the cinematic Scrooges have been, and this adaptation dares to touch on elements of the book that are usually skipped over. Also of particular note, where most modern adaptations focus on the Cratchit family's place in Scrooge's life, this adaptation treats them as a part of the whole. Where other adaptations spend almost the entirety of Christmas Present dwelling on Tiny Tim, this movie spends more time on Scrooge's past and on the present of other people around him. Finally, the Christmas Future segment is far ahead of its time. Anybody interested in the genres of horror and/or weird fiction would do well to study this segment and the chilling atmosphere it creates with little in the way of modern special effects.
