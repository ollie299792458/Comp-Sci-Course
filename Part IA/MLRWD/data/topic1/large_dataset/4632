After seeing The Wire on yet another 'Best TV Shows of the Decade' list I decided to grit my teeth and endure what I thought would be like consuming All Bran - one of those virtious good things that you feel like you have to do while wistfully looking over at the Coco Pops, which might shorten your life but is a hell of a lot more fun to have.

The Wire however isn't one of those ponderous, overly earnest dramas, but an accessable show that takes you into the lives of the various characters that make up this richly structured fictional world, and it's certainly never as pretentious as this sentence is. It does one of the very few things that 'realistic and gritty' tv shows often never do by not forgetting to bring the humour along for the ride.

The plot is relatively complex but it's never hard to follow due to the acting talents of the cast, stellar writing, and the fact that you can't help but become invested in the show. The writers make you feel like you're in safe hands and that they know where they're going, and whomever did the casting deserves a thumbs up and a pat on the head, the recessions answer to a payrise.

By the time I got half-way through the first season I ended up rushing out to buy the rest of the set and said goodbye to friends and family. Can't recommend this enough.
