Robin Williams used to be one of my favorite actors. I can't believe he has sunk so low as to be involved with this film. I should have read the DVD closer to discover that it was a Bobcat Goldthwaite film and I would not have bothered wasting my time or money. The movie is as perverse and twisted as he is. The fact that Robin Williams actually seems to enjoy what Goldthwaite does as a director makes RW pathetic also. I would never have believed it of him. The film features were crass and revolting. The entire crew and cast tossed filth vocabulary around and joked about the gutter language they all used. Not one cast or crew member had one good word to say or a clue what the movie was about. More to the point, they did not care.
This movie is advertised as a comedy. There is nothing comical about disturbed teenagers. There are teen actors who portray cutters, burners, closet gays and all manner of disturbed teens in a high school. This movie not only dismisses these very real issues, it mocks them. The teachers and adults are low life in their own behavior. Robin Williams as a parent attempts to capitalize on his son's suicide because he is embarrassed by the circumstances of it. Any suicide is tragic and should be acknowledged as such. The film consistently portrays parents and adults as useless, self-absorbed, uninvolved, cowardly and insipid. A scary message to send to our youth who need care, guidance, and genuine affection.
I threw the DVD out. It is trash. I don't want it in my home, nor do I want anyone to believe that I would condone such a travesty. The movie deserves a minus 100.
