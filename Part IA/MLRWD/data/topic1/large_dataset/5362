It took me a while to actually sit down and watch this movie, because I honestly thought it was going to be boring.

As you can tell from the 5-star rating, it is anything but dull!

Reviews here are mixed, but I found the film riveting from beginning to end, with truly amazing performances from the exceptional cast.

Yes, Helen Mirren is terrific, but IMHO, Chastain and Worthington are the real stars.

I've seen the former in quite a few movies already, and her versatility is positively astounding. Her turn as Rachel Singer is Oscar-worthy - a beautiful balance of courage and vulnerability.

Her on-screen chemistry with Worthington is breath-taking! Every scene they share is electrifying, and the part where they share a passionate, forbidden kiss is absolutely heartbreaking.

But Worthington blew my mind as David. I didn't enjoy his roles in Avatar and the Titans films, though he first impressed me in Terminator Salvation.

He undergoes a remarkable transformation here. I have never seen him look more tortured or lovelorn. Scenes with Chastain are sizzling hot, while those with Christensen sent chills down my spine.
And keep a lookout for the train station action sequence - it's the only high-octane bit in the entire film, but superbly executed.

I now have new-found respect for Worthington's abilities as an actor. I hope he'll be offered roles that are worthy of his talent. Get out of the Titans franchise, for pete's sake!
