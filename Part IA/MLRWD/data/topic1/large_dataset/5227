I know this movie by heart. I have watched it innumerable times: I know every scene, every second of it, every expression of each character, every look on their faces.
I've read the books after watching the movie, I didn't like the books too much because they seemed too childish to me(I didn't read the books as a child).
I think the movie really captures the soul and the atmosphere of Narnia. Andrew Adamson(the director) created the world of Narnia, the real Narnia, so that everyone can believe that Narnia really exists. All the actors are chosen just right: I see Lucy, Susan, Edmund and Peter in Georgie Henley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and William Moseley. Tilda Swinton, James McAvoy: there couldn't be better choice for the characters of the White Witch and Mr. Tumnus. The best voice actors were chosen as well for Mr.and Mrs. Beaver, Aslan, Fox, all the creatures.
The music is incredible. It seems Harry Gregson-Williams has actually been in Narnia.
After watching this movie the first time I was looking in all wardrobes and closets in the house trying to find a way to Narnia. And I believe that one day I will actually get there. The Narnia created by Andrew Adamson.
I wish he would create another part of the Chronicles, "The horse and his boy". We could see Pevensie children already grown in Narnia as kings and queens, we could see what Narnia looked like then.
