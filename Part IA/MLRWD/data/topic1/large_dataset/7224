I have to agree with the other review that said this was better than Paranormal Activity (PA) that just our opinion and you don't have to agree. Don't get me wrong i liked the PA movie and they were pretty scary when things actually starting happening. Usually felt like things didn't pick up until almost an hour into the movie. Not with this one. Things start happening on right away and will have you sayin WTF?! To me this movie is way scarier than people are saying it is on here. The only beef i have with this movie and the reason i only give it 4 stars is the ending. Not as good as it could have been. Alot of really scary build up with a less than stellar ending. Now again don't get me wrong the ending is scary still and good, just could have been a lil longer thus making it better. Can't spoil it for you but you will know what i mean when you watch it. And, please do, don't let all the bad reviews mislead you. people say its a rip off of PA, but PA is a rip off itself. Does no one remember The Blair Witch?
