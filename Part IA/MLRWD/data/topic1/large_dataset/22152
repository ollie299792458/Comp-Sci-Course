This 1978 film of Agatha Christe's "Death on the Nile" is a personal favorite of mine.  As a film, it is not what I would refer to as being great or definitive, but it is very good, and it is a lot of great  fun to watch.  This is the type of film with which to curl up on a  comfortable chair, with popcorn in hand, and to completely enjoy --- and  there is a lot to enjoy here.  The basic formula is not unlike other film  adaptions of Agatha Christe's books:  surround Hercule Poirot with an  outstanding supporting cast of actors, place them in an exotic and  picturesque locale, and let nature take it's course.  There are some  stunning location shots of Egypt here, and some very funny sequences as  well (the tango sequence at the hotel immediately prior to the departure of  the cruise boat down the Nile River), all of which add to the overall charm  of this movie.  When the film begins with the effective opening music, one  cannot but be impressed with the cast assembled for this movie, and what an  outstanding cast it is!  Peter Ustinov is an endearingly foxy Hercule  Poirot, and the ensemble performances of Mia Farrow, David Niven, Bette  Davis, Maggie Smith, Jon Finch, Angela Lansbury, and George Kennedy are all  first-rate.  The film is wonderfully reminiscent of the types of movies  Hollywood used to be so good at putting together.  There are  improbabilities in the script to be sure, but none of this matters at all.  It's an awful lot of fun, and isn't that what it's all about?
