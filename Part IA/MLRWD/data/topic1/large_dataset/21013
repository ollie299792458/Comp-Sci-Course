My boyfriend and I are movie fanatics, we constantly go to Blockbuster to get their 4 movies for $20 deal, Half Price Books, or Walmart for their five dollar movies, so we have a LOT of movies. We saw this particular movie at Blockbuster one day thought it looked pretty cool, so we bought it. Five dollars for this movie was even too much for me, I thought it was going to be awesome, boy was I wrong! I don't think this movie is even worth a penny!
All throughout the movie, we were just waiting for it to be over, it has a good enough story line, but with the bad acting, and all the stupid incidents, it just all seems so silly. The ending did it for me, I was so pissed off for buying this movie I could have broken the DVD. I thought with the cover looking like that and all, it would be awesome, but the cover is so misleading, we thought that would be an actual character in the story, but instead it's just when he wraps his face up for five minutes. STUPID! Don't waste your money. I don't even want to sell this to anyone, I'd just be a horrible person for wasting their time and money, too. I'm just going to throw it away in the garbage where it belongs.
