I viewed this DVD on my 53" Sony XBR videoscope television and was intially bracing myself for an average film due to the reviews I had read on this site.
Well I know now not to place too much faith in others opinions. The special effects in this movie were fantastic and rendered with an impressive sense of realism. Many said the character development in the first half of the film was boring. Well guess what folks, it was about as boring as your own lives. I say this because THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A PORTRAYAL OF A TRUE STORY. Of course its boring to those who just want to skip to scenes depicting montrous waves and boats sinking.
The depiction of the lives of the individuals involved in this human drama (the first third of the movie) was of far greater importance than the special effects towards the end of the movie. After all this was an enhanced documentary depicting a great human tragedy.
The entire movie was well balanced and skillfully directed by Wolfgang Petersen. I would easily place this movie in the top 3 picks of the summer alongside Gladiator and X-Men.
The extra features on this DVD were very interesting. This film is great entertainment and its quality makes it enjoyable for multiple viewings. Highly recommended for boat owners/enthusiasts, fishermen or anyone who has ever experienced the unsettling effects of large waves while boating.
