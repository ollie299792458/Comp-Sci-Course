Wow, this was the first anime series that I completed watching. Just wow. First, I want to point out that I found the MA rating disappointing and very misleading. MA?! Really?! There was no vaginal, nipple, or penal exposure, no gore content, no rape, no sodomy, etc. Infact there were no visible sex scenes in the film. The FCC would find much more "objectionable" material on network television with Family Guy (yea, I watch Family Guy, and no I'm not hating on it, I just wanted to point out there was no material in this film that many including the FCC can argue is adult-oriented). Clearly politics played some role in the rating it received. I kept hitting the play button with this movie and the primary reason for continuing to watch was that-I was still interested in Masane Amaha (aka "Melanie" the main character). She is for you all to discover. As for the film in general, this series had many of the elements that I prefer. There was an original story present (detailed by many here), there was an apparent explanation for every event that transpired in the film (not once in the 24 episodes viewed did I feel as though a circumstance either wasn't clearly explained or was concealed for the creators' convenience), and I didn't feel as though there was a constant and unyielding barrage of mayhem on my screen which would annoy just about anybody. Thankfully the ending was not predictable or clich&eacute;; it was very touching and occurred how it should have. Here's what I'd advise-watch all 24. The story progresses at a much more rapid flow towards the last several episodes, that's not to say that the rest aren't worth your time (to be honest I missed the calm and tranquil episodes before things picked up towards the end). I was definitely invested in the characters, especially Masane and her love for her daughter Rihoko. Damned emotions. Commit to the 24 episodes, in the end, you'll end up walking it down the aisle.
