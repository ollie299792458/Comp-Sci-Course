Sure, Samuel L. Jackson was a light in a dark place, but it was too dark a place! Shaft  was a lousy remake that could have been great. Samuel L. Jackson was the saving grace of the movie, but it still isn't worth watching. I was very disappointed in how poorly it was made. Christian Bale delivered a cheesy and stupid performance, Toni Collete had a flat character, Vanessa Williams had kindof a pointless role, Dan Hedaya has had much better roles (Ransom, The Hurricane), and the only thing that seemed to come out of Busta Rhymes mouth every time that he spoke was the F word. Sam Jackson had a few cool lines, and he did the best that he could have with what they gave him, but it still didn't really work. This was a cheesy action movie. Although your kids would probably feel cool saying that they watched it, it is not something that they should see. The R rating is due to strong violence, pervasive strong language, and a brief sexual encounter. It isn't worth your time. For a good Samuel L. Jackson action alternative, watch Die Hard with a Vengeance.
