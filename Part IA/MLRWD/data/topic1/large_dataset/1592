It's unfortunate that many don't demand much of movie-making and even less of themselves.  I for one demand a great deal from both.

This movie was complex in the sense that it didn't provide a neatly summarized and easily digestible answer to what is a very complicated question, mortality (i.e., how to get the best value out of ones life).

By interweaving the different plots it conveyed a contrast that couldn't have been accomplished otherwise.

But most importantly, this movie was about choices.  Whether your a journalist who realizes you are doing a disservice to your profession by going along to get along, or whether your a student that finds comfort in being cynical as opposed to buckling down to change things for the better or perhaps if you choose to put your safety in harms way for the greater good, these are all choices that may not fit easily in one's comfort zone.  Tough choices indeed, and as such should not be expected to be dealt with cavalierly.

This movie made its point abundantly clear.  Which is to say, we all have a part to play in making the world a better place.  We just need to determine which is the best way for us to do our respective part.
