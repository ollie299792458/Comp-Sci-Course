As an aviation writer with 113 published titles, including a current one on the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, I have specialized in naval aviation.  Generally, I get quite impatient with movies that are very inaccurate when it comes to technical details, but "The Final Countdown" is different. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000096IAC">The Final Countdown (Widescreen Edition)</a> With a storyline involving a time warp that takes a nuclear powered aircraft carrier back to December 1941 and the attack on Pearl Harbor, the basic premise is science fiction rather than anything historical or documentary.  Therefore, it really doesn't matter that there is little attention to the accuracy I usually like to see given respect by a film maker.  Instead, this movie is just easy entertainment that is enjoyable.  The acting isn't great.  Kirk Douglas was 63 when he made the movie, 15 to 20 years older than a carrier captian would be in real life, and the script leaves a lot to be desired in places.  But the film is still enjoyable if the viewer simply accepts it for what it is.  Perhaps the best part is the music score, while the worst is the narrative of the cinematographer in the "special features" section of the DVD.  Along with "Somewhere in Time," it is the best of the movies I have seen with a time warp theme.  Science fiction fans and naval aviation buffs will surely find it to their liking.
