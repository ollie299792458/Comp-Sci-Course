Talk about bad timing -- mere weeks after this encomium to the superiority of state socialism originally aired in Britain, the Berlin Wall fell, and we learned the full extent of that system's failure throughout Eastern Europe.

One of the film's delusions is that the Soviet Union was a prosperous nation able to lend reams of cash to the British government in the late '80s.  As we see now, it wasn't even capable of propping up its own economy, let alone anybody else's.

Aside from the outmoded political vision, the film fails on artistic grounds as well.  It's practically cartoonish in its depiction of good and bad guys.  This results in flat cardboard characterizations, with mustache-twirling villains on one side, and stout-hearted heroes on the other.  It completely lacks the subtlety and complexity of character and story that usually mark great British television such as "The House of Cards" and even "Yes, Minister."

Some say that the film's depictions of Americans as "bullies" and "prize fighters" is an indictment of the U.S.  Maybe it says more about them than about us.

I can see why it got the juices flowing at the New Yorker and other liberal arbiters of cultural taste.  It would be interesting to see how they would review this film if its politics were reversed.  But anybody whose politics is to the right of Ralph Nader will find this film to be practically unwatchable.
