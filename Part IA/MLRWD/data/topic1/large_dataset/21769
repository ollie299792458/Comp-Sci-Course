Below is an excellent horror film which I highly recommend!  It's also an often overlooked gem of a horror movie that's still out there for many future fans to discover.

The setting is World War II, in a U.S. submarine, at various depths in the Atlantic Ocean.  What else can one ask for in setting the stage for a voyage of supernatural scares?  Not much, I say.

Yes, Below is a great ghost story that very successfully delivers the scares, only picking up steam, as it dives to ever greater depths.  The story is genuinely creepy and even makes you look over your shoulders a few times for what else may be in the room with you.  It's also an original story, without the typical Hollywood plot holes in most films these days.  With all the predictable, clich&eacute;d, and just-like-all-the-other movies out there, Below surely stands out in the fleet.  It has high production values, lots of style, great acting, excellent special effects, outstanding cinematography, and everything else you'd expect from a premium horror film.

Below is also a ghost story with a good deal of mystery and suspense, culminating in an ending with a twist that satisfies.  What's better is that all this claustrophobic horror happens hundreds of feet beneath the ocean, during a war, in a submarine, with some not-so-happy ghosts as crew!  It's bad enough when you have plenty of room to run.  However, all of that in a submarine is about as bad as it gets!  So, make sure you check out Below.  Just make sure you're Above, when you do.
