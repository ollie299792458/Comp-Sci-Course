For the Fourth day of christmas I'm going to reivew...Twister. The only good thing about this film is the special effects. Everything else stinks. The acting,the story and the logic. The cast do alot of stupid things to get close to the twister like hiding under a brige even though it might collapse on you and/or turn into a wind tunnel of suction. Another dumb thing they do is use a belt,ties it to a heater to keep themself safe from the F-5. You make Odie look like Albert Einstein when you do dumb things like that. It would never work in real life. Flaw number 3: We see more of the couple arguing then the twister itself. When did this movie become "Mad About You"? The arguing couple storyline also slows the movie down. Did you also notice that there is more then one tornado in ONE DAY. HOW MANY TWISTERS CAN THERE BE IN 24 HOURS? Was this like the lost plague of Egypt? It does not happen in real life. Overall,If you like special effects,buy it. If not,burn it. I give this dvd a 1 out of 10.
