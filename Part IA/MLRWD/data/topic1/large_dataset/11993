There are two Truths about the Cube:  Everyone wakes up with the same questions (Who am I? and Why am I here?) and everyone dies in the Cube.  Some last longer than others, and some are killed by their fellow Cubists, but in the end the Cube always wins.  Everybody who enters the cube dies in it, and usually in horrifying ways.  Nobody gets out alive.  Ever.  Well, there might be one exception...

The Cube is a metaphore for Life, or the World, or Human Existance.  We're all here on earth with the same questions, and we all die in the end.  The key to the movie is at the exit scene:  "Do you believe in God?" - "What kind of God would do this to people?!?"  *bzzzt*  Wrong answer.  Burned alive in hell.  But what would happen if someone said yes?  Barbarash leaves this question unanswered and open to our own interpretations...

While I do not agree with Barbarash's conclusions and I'm really not into slasher/horror flicks I really did like this movie.  I don't think it'll ever be considered a great film by anyone, but I like movies that have deeper meanings (Donnie Darko or The Ninth Configuration) that are not readily apparent and this one took me a day to figure out.  Ultimately, Cube Zero is an inditement against God:  He either does not exist, or he's a sadist taking pleasure in tormenting people.  This is a common view, but just as far off base as those who think that God is nothing but Love - He is both Holy and Just AND Love and Mercy.  He is also not impressed that people simply 'believe in Him' or acknowledge His existance, but for the sake of the movie Barbarash's vision works.

Please note I did NOT see either Cube or Hypercube first, and I am reviewing this one as a standalone movie.  I will definitely check them out based on seeing this one, though.
