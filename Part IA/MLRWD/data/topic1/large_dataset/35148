I h8 when people try to compare a new movie with it's older version or book.  Try judging the movie for what it was.  I think a lot of the characters came across stronger than in the book.  Simon's just a retard in  the book.  In this movie, we at least get the point he's got something to  do.  And Jack comes across better as a leader instead of just the one who  likes hunting the most.  And in the most noticeable case, the twins aren't  just a couple of yes-men to everyone else when it comes to getting food or  watching fire.  Also better that they weren't just plain beaten into  submission at the end of the book and actually do stand up to Jack in a way  by lying about Ralph's hiding place.  One part looked kinda corny tho.  When Piggy had a boulder dropped on his head, it like bounced off.  Rrrright....
Back to a few other things.  I think that people who just  spend the whole story or movie looking for the metaphorical meaning in  everything need lives.  I hate when authors do that.  If Golding wanted to  say something, he should have said it, no written an entire story and then  buried the meaning in a pig's head.  Movies are meant to entertain and  enchant.  This is the movie, no book (which sucked)  As a movie, it does  it's job.
