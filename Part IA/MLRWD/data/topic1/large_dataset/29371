Last year TV Guide called The Rockford Files the greatest detective series ever.  Tall order that, considering all the detective shows in the history of American television.  I, for one, think such praise is truly deserved.  What sets this series apart, I believe, is the tone set by its leading man, James Garner.  You can just sit back and relax in knowing that Jim Rockford will solve the case in his own personal self-deprecating style.  You can count on at least one car chase, a fist fight or two, and a healthy dose of 'tongue in cheek' humor.  The show never takes itself too seriously, and that's a plus.  Great characters abound, from Rocky to Beth, Angel to Dennis, all built around the only actor that could've pulled off the lead role with charisma to spare.  Like Jack Klugman with 'Quincy' or Peter Falk's Lt Columbo, only Mister Garner could pull off Jim Rockford and make it work.

Season two, if anyting, is clearer than season one, and with better packaging.  The audio is crisp and clear.  Bring on season three of this landmark series.  Like another recent purchase, 'Wild Wild West, Season One', I never tire of it.
