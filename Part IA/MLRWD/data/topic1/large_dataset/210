For any Spag-western fan it's a hard choice between the best film in the Leone/Eastwood trilogy.  Most casual fans go for the epic final chapter, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, but I for one would choose this classic.  Though it's pretty much the same story as Yojimbo, I think the border-town of the wild west is a much better setting.  This movie is so great for a few reasons:

1. The cinematography is awesome, it pioneered the close-up, making each face a western landscape in itself.

2. Eastwood. This movie made him an international star, and for good reason.  He puts a lot of humor into the character with his few lines, the opening scene where Clint references his mule is so weird that is's one of the funniest scenes in cinema.

3.  The action is fast and furious, and the gun-slinging is unrivled, this is also the first appearence of Clint's famous poncho, which really makes him mysterious and menacing in the final gundown.

*Gian Maria Volonte is outstanding as the villain, although he's even better as the pot smoking lunatic in For A Few Dollars More
