From 1961 Shirley Booth stars as Hazel with Don Defore as George Baxter and Whitney Blake as Missy.  This sitcom was 10 years after the debut of "I Love Lucy" and 1 year after Lucy and Desi split up and ended their TV run together. The standard for sitcoms had really changed in 10 years.

Audiences were tired of slapstick and non-existent plots. TV watchers wanted something a little more sophisticated but they weren't all as hip suburban or Gotham cool as the Dick Van Dyke show.

Hazel fits the bill. Smart and brassy a little sentimental and always entertaining.  It may not be easy for some viewers to tell but Miss Booth had a ball with this character. Showing off her bowing prowess on TV or giving the vice grip to Mr. B.  Hazel was always minding someone else's business.  She makes comment's like "If we cant help each other what are we here for?" When was the last time you heard someone saying something like that on TV?

Hazel may not work for some viewers. There are no fart jokes, no erection problems, the Baxter's have no "late in life" unexpected births and the children on the show act like children not smart mouthed adults.

If you can enjoy something good and well made for it's `time Hazel is a gem right down to the booming voice at the end of each episode declaring "This has been a Screen Gems Production from the Hollywood Studios of Columbia Pictures".
