Brotherhood of the Wolf is best described as a period horror film like The Mummy or Bram Stoker's Dracula.
As a period drama the first half of Brotherhood is extremely successful. As a horror film like Jaws or Alien, Brotherhood is very well done. As a martial arts film Brotherhood is fantastic.
The question is; can one movie be all these things without becoming a jumbled mess?
Although it walks a thin line between sublime and absurd Brotherhood comes out looking pretty good especially if you don't take it too seriously. The danger is that a movie this beautifully shot and with so much historical baggage absolutely begs to be taken seriously.
I would have liked to see one or two of the plot twists at the end of the movie either surgically removed or expanded upon as they seem a little tacked on in their present state. More happens in the last 5 minutes of the film than in the first 2 hours!
Other than that Brotherhood of the Wolf is a shining spectacle that rivals even this year's Fellowship of the Ring. And is certainly one the most most interesting horror films ever made.
