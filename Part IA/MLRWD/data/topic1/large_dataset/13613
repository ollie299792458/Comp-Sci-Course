My girlfriend and I were 17 in 1987 when this show debuted - I'd race over to her house after work to watch thirtysomething at 10:00 pm every Tuesday...we were far from being thirtysomething, but we LOVED this show and couldn't wait for the DVD release!

We both turned 40 this year, and for my b-day she got me the first season - I was thrilled!  (And audio problems notwithstanding, this show is still awesome!)  When this show ran, we didn't have husbands, kids or the other issues thirtysomething dealt with, but we LOVED it - for it's incredible characters and their interactions, the whole feeling of the show...what is it about it that makes it so great?!?!

BTW, I am a very conservative, happily married woman of almost 18 years with three kids...althought many topics and situations on the show are pretty liberal, I can relate to so much of it...the kids/husband/parents/working/money, etc....

Also, I love the soundtrack and have owned it for years...

Thank you for finally releasing this for the fans!!  I want them all!  :)
