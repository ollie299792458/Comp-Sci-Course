I totally enjoyed this movie and will be watching it again. It was a horse story, and the love of a boy got him through the first year or two before he went off to war. It was an interesting concept from sort of, the horse's POV. What he went through with his companion or friend. The loss and scariness of the war was very well done. And so real in the way that horses were treated during the war, they were just to use and if they died so what, and the loss of so many horses and mules during WW1 was something else.
If you don't care for war stories you probably will be horrified over what these noble creatures had to endure, we usually don't see much of the horses in war movies, they are there, die and are gone. This shows what they went thru, and to survive was something else. It had a good ending that I was a little surprised to see.. I had an idea, but what happened, I was thrilled we got a bit more.
It was a good movie, heart stopping many times, but true to WW1 and the silent warriors who gave their lives for freedom.
