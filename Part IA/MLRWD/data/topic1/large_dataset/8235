I was mildly interested in this based on the trailer - the antics of the protagonists looked amusingly off beat. How wrong I was - the first act of the film is surprisingly mean spirited and drags for 45 minutes  -  I actually checked how far I was saying, there's another HOUR of this?! It had moments of pathos/interest like the pimp backstory and whenever SLJ and the Rock were onscreen, but their characters were SPOILER randomly killed off by the writers in the dumbest way possible. Mark Wahlberg has 1 or 2 scenes of cool fight moves - can't we just get Shooter 2 please? Will Ferrell's shtick is different here but it's so ridiculous and inconsistent that it just isn't humorous. Furthermore, the second act is just a series of mind-numbingly dumb smash cuts - the heroes accept bribes twice for a joke? What??? Time and space have no meaning - a trip to and from Vegas takes approximately 30 seconds screen time and is a throwaway joke. Climax is quite dull and unfulfilling. A major misfire, do NOT watch if you want to laugh or have a good time - I was eating buffalo chicken after completing a big essay on a Friday night - can't be much more in the mood than that, and it STILL SUCKED. Thumbs down. There's a reason we don't hear about The Other Guys, it's because they're boring and unfunny. I want a ridiculous 90 minute movie of The Rock and Samuel L Jackson cracking wise and causing property damage. Please.
