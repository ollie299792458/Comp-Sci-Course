There's nothing more I can add that hasn't been said. I liked the show as a child, but I honestly bought the movie out of curiosity alone (and the fact that it was only $3 in a bargain bin). I started watching it one day, and my two-year-old son became mesmerized. He still begs to watch "Thomas and Friends" and "Bob the Builder," but increasingly he asks for "Batman." Oh my god, he loves this movie. This morning, my wife and I heard him yelling "Hey, Batman!" before we got him out of bed. This is a good movie, but all good things come to an end. We have watched it repeatly, and now it's getting really boring. But, I still laugh when Burt Ward yells, "Support your local police! That's our message." Of course, that comment is not as funny without it being said in the context of when it was made -- 1966, Lyndon Johnson, Vietnam, drugs, and the anti-war protests. Oh yeah, watching Adam West kick a shark in the head is pretty funny also. And, let's not forget the Batcopter crashing on a foam-rubber convention. Now that I think about it, this movie is really quite funny. Yeah, it's pretty funny.
