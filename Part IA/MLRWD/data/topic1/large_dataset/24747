The first season of Eureka is funny, charming, and a little frustrating.
The show is funny and charming because of the delightfully quirky characters and their interactions, which are far more reasonable than one generally finds on this type of show.
The frustration comes with the introduction of major plot lines that are then just dropped, or barely dealt with, such as the information that one or more of the core characters may be acting against the interests of the community. The threat is introduced and then left by the wayside.
Another frustration comes from the teen-aged daughter who is interchangeable with every other annoying teen that you have ever seen on television.
That said, the other characters make sense within the universe that the writers have created, they have depth as people, their own agendas and a reason for being where they are and acting as they do (motivations that are missing from many television characters).
I think that even people who are not particularly fond of science fiction will enjoy this program and I highly recommend it to everyone.
