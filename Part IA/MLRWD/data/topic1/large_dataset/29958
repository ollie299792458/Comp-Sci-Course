It happens to be quite a coincidence that I found some Judge Dredd comic books in Spanish at a high school library mere months before it turned out that Sly Stallone would be playing this stern-faced cop of the distant  future. So my buddies and I all went to see it and boy, I was really blown  away by the very intoxicating ride through the high, tangled skyscrapers of  the futuristic New York City. Makes you feel like you're really there,  flying wildly through all those miles-high towers brightly flashing with  neon signs and obscene advertising. In fact, this is one of the most  powerful highlights of this dazzling sci-fi flick and the special effects  will truly explode right into your face as you hang on every fast-paced  action as Judge Dredd grimly chases all the bad guys! However, on the other  hand - there is a great deal of excessive violence, of course ... and yes,  even some grossness like that orge-like "Mean Machine" who would  GET MEAN every time the dial on his forehead is turned and there's this  scene where a man's arm gets stabbed with four syringe needles, causing  blood to gush right out all over the place! In addition, there are many  fans out there who complain about the title character taking his helmet  right off, thus disclosing his mysterious visage - but I don't really care.  In fact, I think "Judge Dredd" is one of the coolest movies I  have ever seen!
