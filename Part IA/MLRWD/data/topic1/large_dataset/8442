So ONE: the movie was HOT, HOT AND HOT
And TWO: the movie was HOT, HOT, HOT, AND HOT AGAIN.

There was so much to the characters. You fell in love with theM. The possessed a lot of depth. The humor in the movie popped as well. The parts the were meant to be funny, WERE FUNNY, and nothing was contrived, out of place or awkward. The acting, the action, the romance between Carl and Katrina, was just simply natural.

Death Race II is a must see. Why not know the origins of Frankenstein?! It was tempting to see this movie either way because I wanted to see WHO Frankenstein was. HOW he was, how he ACTED. Everything!!!

Luke Goss was brilliant as always. An actor that deserves the recognition for his talent. Deserves great reviews and positive energy for what he does. I loved him in this movie. He made Carl Lucas feel real. As in all his movies, Luke Goss gives his characters that depth, meaning, and a real soul, it seems. =)
Ving Rhames and Danny Trejo were hilarious and great, and they just gave so much more to the movie and their roles.
Sean Bean gave me chills! He gave the movie that edge, that betrayal aspect so well!

It wouldn't really make sense to pass this movie up. Really.
