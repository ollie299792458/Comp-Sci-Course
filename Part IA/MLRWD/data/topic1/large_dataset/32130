This movie "Secretariat" is one of the best, if not THE best movie I have seen in a very long time.  The acting was spectacular! The places where everything took place were sooo beautiful.  The horses were fantastic!  I did not see the name of the horse who played Secretariat, unless his name was "Big Red" but he was beautiful.  The costumes were authentic.  I loved everything about this film.  The trainer was terrific and of course Diane Lane was perfect.  I really liked the way they showed the actual races, horses running, dirt flying and everything. I also really liked the way they showed the connection between Big Red and Penny.  They way the horse observed her as if he could read her thoughts.  It was fabulous!

I also liked the way they showed the real Penny at the end of the film in the grand stands.  That was subtle and great.

I am very happy that I purchased this DVD.  You should also.

As far as what I would have wanted to know before purchasing,  I have always been interested in horese racing, just for viewing; although I would love to see a live race sometime.  I don't think it is necessary for any information other than the trailer for the film that we see on TV.  It was a great movie.

I have purchased many of my DVD collection from Amazon and have always been satisfied.
