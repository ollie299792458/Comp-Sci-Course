I must admit that I agree with Steven Hedge's review about the ending of the film.  It was like doing a film on the life of Einstein, where you talk about his childhood, then say, "By the way, he was a physicist, too.  The End."

But that said, I did love the film for all its other qualities.  The production values are cutting edge and fantastic.  The casting couldn't be better, and a great, last look at Sydney Pollack, who was a giant.  Tilda Swinton created a seriously creepy performance, too.

If you like lawyers, you'll like this movie.  If you hate lawyers, you'll love it even more.  I watched it several times on HBO.  The performances were terrific, especially Clooney's and most of all Tom Wilkinson (who is excellent in most of his movies, and fantastic as Benjamin Franklin in "John Adams," which I also recommend).

I've watched George Clooney since he was on "The Facts of Life," and I'm an admirer of his maturity as a film actor/maker; except for the last 'Oceans" movie, which I felt was a total rip-off for those of us who paid good money to see it.  I mean talk about predictable and impossible; it was totally ridiculous, just made to scoop-in the big money the producers knew they'd make from an unsuspecting public.  And, I also like hearing his loud voice on the side of the angels in many American/International Issues.

Keep'em coming, George.
