I tried three times to read the novel and at last am half-way through. The novel, while wonderfully well written, with artful sentences and beautifully stitched paragraphs, lacks suspense. The film, which I saw both in the theater and on DVD, sticks closely to the book and now there's no way one can read Grady Tripp's voice without hearing Michael Douglas, who here out-acts his charming performance as president in The American President. Michael captures Chabon's inflections perfectly. I've come to love this movie and feel that the characters are part of my life. For me, the acting throughout is matchless. Curtis Hanson deserves great credit for not trying to juice up the story. I think this will be one of those addictive movies with locked in pleasures I want to share with all my friends and will sit through ten times without tiring of the subtleties. Probably more than ten times over the years. When you have a can't miss DVD you just have to break it out for friends who haven't seen the film. By the way, the Bob Dylan video of the his Oscar-winning "Things Have Changed" is on the DVD and though I've watched it twice, and heard him sing it during the Academy Awards, and even have read the complete lyrics in Entertainment Weekly, well, it still eludes my ear. Aside from "I'm in love with a women who don't even appeal to me," I just can't get most of the lines. I wish I had saved the trot from EW. Pale and smileless as a clown, Bob no longer sells his lyrics the way he did as a youngster where one might savor every word and Rimbaud image. But then why should he sing the way he did forty years ago? Now I hear he's had three Nobel Prize nominations.
