Hi fellow nostalgia fans! I was born in 1980, about one year after the book was produced. I look exactly like Barret Oliver, even talk like he does and my hair has more German bouncy colorful curls than anyone and my skin is olive gold tan colored (I used to be VERY pale of course) from my Polish and long eyelashes, huge almond shaped brown eyes too, with a short tongue so I can not pronounce a lot of different words. My past is in the 80's, when people were into family and love. No one would believe it if I told them, but my eyes are highly reflective and glow in the right lighting and create a hall of mirrors when I look in the mirror. See, you don't believe me. There is not one doubt in my mind of who I am, I live in San Jose, and if you ever went there downtown, it is JUST like the books movie. Also, it is built on sacred land, do not ever think it is a false tail, I went to middle school and if a school bus satchel were in my hands, it would carry a PB sandwich with raisins, my grades were terrible all my youth and I was made fun of (still am, and my mother divorced my father too.) I had a crush on a brown eye girl who looked like Punky Brewster all my life, still unreal? Well never underestimate the real life truth of fantasy, you never know...
