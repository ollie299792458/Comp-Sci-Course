Yeah, okay I will admit there were some rip offs from other horror films, but people stop comparing films, almost all films made these days one can find elements from other films. And nine out of ten go back to William Shakespeare, but really, it is not what they take from others it is how the director presents his vision. I have to say in this case he did a great job. One reviewer said something about just creating an eerie atmosphere, okay, that is what attracted me to watch this little gem. The atmosphere is truly ambrosiac, and like some of the other positive reviewers have noted, he does it during the DAY. While most horror films rely on the dark, this one pulls it off during the day. One other thing that that was nice was to see Stan Kirsch in another role, I missed him from his years in Highlander, and John Kapelos was awesome as Schanke in Forever Knight, these genre shows gave the actors some great experience to pull this film off. Now everyone has an opinion, and mine is now more or less important than anyone elses, but I would be so bold as to compare this director to the work of Lucio Fulci, it is gutsy, gorey, and does provide some chills. Most movies I watch provide some catharsis from an active day of work, but don't really make you think. This film really makes you think, yeah it could have been the somewhat confusing plotlines, but so was JU-ON, and that movie was great. I really recommend watching this film at least once. I would also recommend the film THE VISITORS, it is a hearty scandanavinan film that also challenges the mind.....
