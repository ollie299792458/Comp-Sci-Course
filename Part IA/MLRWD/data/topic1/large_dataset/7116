It took me two viewings to understand what was going on in the first half of the film -- a dark and confusing period in the lives of the two artists. On a second viewing the whole thing came together for me.
I found the rendering of the historical period to be splendid --as convincing as Rossellini's "Louis XIV", though not otherwise similar in spirit or approach.
The actual creation and staging of the Mikado (in the second half of the film) is likely to delight anyone familiar with the works of G&amp;S -- or anyone who has ever struggled to put together an effective theatrical production.  The poignant illnesses and psychic suffering of the Savoy actors -- as well as the suffering of G&amp;S -- set one up for goosebumps when they soared triumphantly into song on opening night. 
The language and witty word play in many scenes were like the first stages of a multi-stage rocket that ultimately hurled Gilbert's wonderfully silly and witty libretto into artistic orbit.  (Forgive me.  I am an intellectual chap.)
