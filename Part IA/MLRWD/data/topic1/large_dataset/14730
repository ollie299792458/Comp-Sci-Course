...Watching the DVD I bought from Amazon, I was stunned.
The clarity of light on the cars in the famous opening sequence literally shines! There is one other scene in particular where Mastroianni stands in front of a light -- an effect I'm certain Fellini realized -- and you can literally see the light shine from his graying hair. Even the subtitles have been re-done. I can remember looking at the fuzzy subtitles on the VHS and struggling to concentrate. On this Criterion Collection DVD, they are crisp and clear as anything on the market.
Most significant to me, though: the commentary section! Though I've watched this film a few times (I can still remember getting chills up my spine the first time I saw the opening sequence) the commentary will blow you away with how complex this 2 hour film is. Though it is a film that is fun enough to watch for its own sake -- the commentary read like a guidebook to Picasso's cubist period, explaining the significance of casting certain characters, various symbols: for example, the watch given to Mastroianni by the Producer in the film echoes Fellini's own producer giving him a watch under similar circumstances after his filming La Dolce Vita. There are many like images and symbols explained. The depth of commentary made this film Ten Times more complex than without -- and yet, even realizing how much more complex and personal this film is, it's still the fun 2 hour film it'll always be! It's just that watching it now is watching a film with thirty years of wisdom packed into one DVD. Amazing. Nina Rota's score is a trip! I've only had time, so far, to browse over the interview section on Disc 2 (nearly three hours worth of interviews). My hope here is that this amazon.com review will give you an indication that: There's enough info, entertainment, and analysis on this DVD to keep you interested and entertained for plenty 'o time to come!
It is the best DVD I have ever bought...
