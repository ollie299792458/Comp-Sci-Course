Wrestlemainia 27, we start the show with the Rock stating that this will be the greatest Wrestlemania of all time, and when we see the stadium, the crowd and the the Rock in the ring setting the mood before the event starts you nearly feel like hey, this could be the greatest Wrestlemania ever.........then it starts and you realise in the first match that it's going to sadly be very poor indeed.

The trashing of the car in the finale of the first match, Cody and his plastic mask just made this feel like a joke, when I watch wrestling, as I've felt for the last 28 years I want to escape, I want to believe and get lost in thinking what I'm watching is really true, but these two moments for starters really hurt this show badly.

The squash 6 man tag, should have been the money in the bank, the taker, triple H match was infuriating, there were so many times in this match after a big spot that the game should have gone for a pinfall, but he just kept sitting around like it was a last man standing match, there was no flow, just one spot after another, and even the crowd was bored to death with how long the ending dragged on with an injured taker getting out of there.

The Miz and Del Rio are small time and had no buisness being in main events, and the cole and jerry match was aweful, austin looked out of it to be honest.

Being a huge, loyal wrestling fan, wwe, tna, roh, czw, pwg, ....this was a very sad show, but even worse the show had to be wrestlemania, and I'm sure like most people its the show I get excited about most, and when its done well it can be the greatest thing I've watched all year, but not this year, and how short is the hall of fame now, crazy.

Aside from all this its wrestling, its wwe, its wrestlemania and the rock, and for a few brief moments it does whats its meant to do, and thats feel big and entertain.

Its worth buying, but its just a shame it was one of the bad ones.
