Season one kicks off with strong characters, and the characters come as much from the writing as they do from the actors that play the parts. There's no mistaking where any character stands, and the conflicts between their personalities make the humor. It's so funny you can watch each episode several times and find a new joke in it every time!

I cannot say the same thing for season two. Jack (Alec Baldwin) as lost his edge for some inexplicable reason. Right from the get-go his comments aren't as snarky, nor are they really that funny. That's where it all starts falling apart. The writing wasn't written for the characters and I found that a lot of what was said is far too sincere for any character in the series.

I can't imagine that Tina Fey allowed anyone to 'sabotage' her baby. I could be wrong, but I like to give her the benefit of the doubt and think some NBC Executive came in to "take things that are all ready working and ... fix them!" I hope that's the case because it just goes to show you where focus group data gets you. If Jack's too 'mean' and makes very 'politically incorrect' remarks that are genuinely funny, then that needs to be stopped apparently. It's not just Jack though, it's the entire group dynamic of the show that's been lost, and for a show that is very dialog and character driven that loss doesn't make for good television.
