I guess what it comes down to is.....does the threat of aliens scare you?  I think some people are scared by gore, some by ghosts, some by aliens.  If you're the third this movie may be for you.  It is one of those movies that leaves a lot to the imagination, which, according to other reviews, scared the crap out of a lot of people - but bored the crap out of me.  It's a psychological thriller, fear of the unknown.  I was insanely bored, not because I can't imagine the existence of aliens, infact I accept the fact that they most likely exist.  I guess what bored me about this movie is that I'm okay with the fact that they exist, and I'm not scared of abduction.  If I get abducted by aliens, the known universe will not cease to exist on a grand scale.  The only thing that scares me is ever being forced to endure this calibre of boredeom again and paying four bucks for it.  If you live in constant fear of the unknown, watch the movie, otherwise, you may want to seek some therapy about your anxiety issues - and stop scaring the bejeezus out of yourself with horror flicks! :)
