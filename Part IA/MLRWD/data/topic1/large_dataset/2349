This movie was one of TV specials I could not wait to see every year. It was like a religious moment. Halloween was my favorite time of year right after Xmas and then when I became a teenager, Xmas didn't mean much to me anymore and Halloween moved right up into number one. Loved it.

Charlie Brown's "All I got was a rock" is classic line and I always felt so bad for the little round headed guy especially when the girls called him over and used the back of his head as a draft to draw what the pumpkin should look like when carved. LoL That and Snoopy's WW1 Flying Ace behind enemy lines.

One of the other best lines is Sally Brown's when she tells Linus out in the Pumpkin Patch, "If you try to kiss me, I'll slug you!" A lil five year old girl telling that to a six year old boy is hysterical.

The part I never understood came from Linus being Lucy's younger brother yet Lucy and Charlie Brown were in the same class with Linus? How? Obviously it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of Peanuts universe but the notion that these characters are there and will be for generations to come, are great.

GET THIS MOVIE!
