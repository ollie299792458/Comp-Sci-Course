The true story of Joe Simpson's miraculous survival is a testament to human endurance, determination and raw grit and is rightly one of the most widely recounted stories in the history of mountaineering. "Touching the Void," based on the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060730552">Touching the Void: The True Story of One Man's Miraculous Survival</a>, uses interviews with the principal protagonists, as well as re-enacted climbing sequences filmed in Peru and the Alps, to weave together the story of two ambitious, young British climbers attempting to scale the west face of Siula Grande (20,814 ft), a notoriously challenging peak in the Cordillera Huayhuash, in the Peruvian Andes. The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. The heart-pounding climbing sequences place the viewer in the boots of the two climbers, and the story is a face-paced, gut-retching, roller coaster from beginning to end. Touching the Void is a head-spinning, exhilarating, top-to-bottom adventure not to be underestimated. If you have any interest in the outdoors or extreme mountaineering, this film should be at the top of your must-see list.
