As a rule, I like romantic comedies.  But even I can admit that most of the time, the plots are somewhat lacking, if not out-and-out "redos" of some other movie.  However, not so with this movie; the storyline here a unique and charming twist.  Before I begin gushing, I'll discuss the one issue I had with this movie: the sexual references.  Totally inappropriate coming out of the mouth of an 8-yr old, and not what I would expect of a PG movie.  
Having said that, the story, if somewhat implausible, was definitely engaging.  Tom Hanks will break your heart as Sam, a widowed father trying to put the pieces of his life together--working hard to be a good father while depending on his son to help him "get out of bed in the morning, & breathe in & out all day".
Meg Ryan is always charming (well, except for in Top Gun), but Annie is probably her most charming role.  Her struggle between a stable, predictable life with her soon to be husband and what she begins to perceive as her "destiny" culminates with a trip to the Empire State Building and a very touching scene as Annie hits it off with Josh who badly needs a mother's love.
The ties it makes to "An Affair to Remember" add a humorous sentimentality to this movie, but in no way "copy" the plot of the old classic.  In fact, these scenes poke gentle fun at the movie, without being disrespectful or harsh.
Not necessarily a classic itself, but all in all a really good flick!
