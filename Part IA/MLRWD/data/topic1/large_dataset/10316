So, I get to work both sides of the street; reviewing something I know something about. Hanging out with the staff in the restaurants.

And I can honestly say, yup, that's pretty much restaurant folk down to a tee.

You've got your insecure guy who's never seen with a girl and who all the new girls learn right away to manipualte.

You've got your prankster who's fooled the boss into thinking he's a great employee so he gets to train all the new people, making them little clones of himself. He's also worked his way through most of the girls on staff.

The foul mouthed, always angry girl who gets down right scaring from time to time...and yet always is pretty dang funny.

The strung out busboys, the jerk-off cooks, really the only thing I've been missing out on is the game. That'd been great.

Here's the thing, 90% of the stuff in this movie happens in restaurants all the time. While I encourage you to continue to go out to eat (as it's how I make my livlihood), I also encourage you to remember the age old axims "Treat others as you would want to be treated", and "Ignorance is bliss"!
