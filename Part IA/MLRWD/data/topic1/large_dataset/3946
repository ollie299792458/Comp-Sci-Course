Having been a Beatles fan for many years, I have enjoyed all of the Beatles movies, and Help! is no exception. The restoration of the movie itself seems to be top notch (watch the behind the scenes of how they did some of the restoration of the film master, lots of painstaking work behind it!!). I am not giving it the 5 stars it so rightfully deserves because of the audio soundtrack, particularly when the Beatles break into song. This remastered Help! comes only in either 5.1 DTS (Digital Theater Sound), or 2-channel PCM stereo. Most home theater systems have Dolby Digital 5.1 instead of DTS 5.1, which doesn't make sense why this movie wasn't remastered in Dolby 5.1. The music is loud when the Beatles break into song, and I find myself turning down the sound for the songs, then turning up the audio again to hear the regular dialog from the movie. I used to have the MPI release of Help!, and while the picture wasn't quite the same as this version, at least the musical soundtrack was in Dolby 5.1, and wasn't hard on the ears between songs and movie dialog. I did like watching the second disc of interviews, restoration of the movie, etc. (great to see what Eleanor Bron looks like today versus 1965). Again, 4 stars, great picture restoration, questionable audio sound and no Dolby 5.1
