I just saw this movie last week on AMC and I was surprised at how good it was!  Normally I don't watch many movies from the 80's, because they're kind of dated (I mostly grew up in the 90s), but this one could have taken place in any year.  It's about a kid (C. Thomas Howell) who is driving from Chicago to San Diego.  Somewhere in the middle of nowhere, he picks up a hitch-hiker (Rutger Hauer) to keep himself from falling asleep at the wheel.  Almost as soon as the hitcher gets into the car, you know that something is not right.  You later find out that he cuts off the limbs of the people that pick him up.  The kid is able to throw him out of the car and thinks he is free of that psycho when a station wagon with the hitcher inside passes his car on the interstate.  Throughout the rest of the movie, the hitcher plays mind games with the kid and won't let him go until he is pushed to his breaking point.  This movie is so good because it keeps you on the edge of your seat, wanting to see what happens next.  What is also great is that you see hardly any blood and guts.  It is scarier when the gruesome scenes are only implied.  I absolutely love this movie!
