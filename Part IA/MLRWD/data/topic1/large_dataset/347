I was 12 when this came out. I was on a cruise with my mother and it played in the on board movie theater. At that age, it wasn't the kind of movie I would go and see, but on the ship, I was off doing my own thing and saw it out of lack of anything else to do. I was bored with the arcade and whatever else there was for a 12 year old boy to do.

I loved it! When I got home from the cruise it was on HBO quite a bit, and saw it a good number of times. But then it went away like so many films do. It left my memory over the years. Today is August 14, 2011, 30 years almost to the day I first saw it, and there it is on showtime. I'm 42 years old now.

The story is about getting old, being young and appreciating the smaller simpler things in life, a lake, nature, fishing, and the larger things like enjoying life and family, and getting the most out of the time we have here in this life.

Unless you have a cold heart, you will laugh, and if you are a sensitive person you may even cry. With the brilliant acting and sharp lines that jump out of nowhere to sometimes stab you, this movie is a classic for the ages. A must see for every human being. It's a 5 star movie to be revisited every once in a while, to remind us just what this life of ours is really worth.
