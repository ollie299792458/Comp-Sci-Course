I went to go see this Resident Evil Apocalypse this morning, I had seen the trailor and thought it looked cool, but after the first 10 minutes I didn't even blink, I was glued to my seat, it was just non-stop action to the very end. Now, I am a long time resident evil fan, and I was very critical of the first film, which could have been much better, but this film was 100 times better than it's predecessor. This movie just blew me away. The action was awesome with a good balance of karate action and gun fights. The sound was so loud my ears were bleeding. The special effects were great (much better than the first film). The story, although it did not follow the game, was still just as good. In my opinion, this is by far the best video game based movie made yet. And I don't go to the theater that often, due to a problem with migraines, so I don't go to the theater to see just any movie. I would definately go see RE Apocalypse again, and I would recommend this movie to any fans of the RE games, horror, and action movies.
