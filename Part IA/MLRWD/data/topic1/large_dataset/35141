There is something truly amazing about this DVD. Watching it reminds me of why I feel in love with Pearl Jam's music way back in 1991. This band has only gotten better with time. To the reviewers who say that Vedder's vocals have weakened, I have no idea what you were listening to. To the reviewers who complained about the picture quality, that was the effect that they were going for! This is the band who has embraced vinyl! In the DVD liner notes, Vedder even comments that it was very "Econo". Highlights include Eddie dancing with the woman signing during "Given To Fly". Just the smile on his face is priceless. The energy that Jeff Ament and Mike Mccready give during "Evenflow" is really great as well. Although I wish they would have used the Virginia Beach version, the Jones Beach version of "Daughter/It's Ok" is still good. The Seattle chant for Jeff, the fact that they put Leatherman->Betterman->Nothingman in order on the setlist, the fact that they played I Got ...(Id), the full version of Wishlist, and Parting Ways and RITFW are all excellent things that this DVD contains. The "Smile" video with the "Wash Lady", the band goofing off, and Ed and Jeff playing basketball are all awesome. This DVD really shows you a lot about Pearl Jam, hell the whole DVD is incredible. I get chills everytime I see it. I've seen Pearl Jam live twice and I pray that they tour again.
