Here's the story:  a bunch of obnoxious rubes get together in
New England for a wedding that never takes place. If you're
expecting any sort of genuine comedy, drama or depth of
character you will be very disappointed in this drab, boring,
mess of a film.

I can't believe this movie has actually been awarded 4 and 5 stars!
I'm also shocked by how many people are "shocked" and "disturbed"
 by the main character's behavior! Look around, people. The world
is full of crude, arrogant, self-centered, mean-spirited, substance-
addicted individuals. Sadly, many of them do give birth to children
and make miserable parents.

But don't watch this movie and make the erroneous assumption that
the character Margot has Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Today it's
popular to assign individuals who are the slightest bit rude, cruel, and
self-centered the "personality disorder du jour." As the child of a raging,
rabid, hardcore narcissist and the ex-fiance of another, those truly
afflicted with NPD make Margot look like a cremepuff by comparison.
(To explore the reality of NPD, I highly recommend Sam Vaknin's
"Malignant Self Love" and the reviews for the book posted on this
web site.)

Is the family portrayed in this movie dysfunctional? Highly. Are their
actions and behaviors disturbing? Maybe. But so are a lot of families,
so why should we care? Perhaps that's the most fundamental failure
of this film, which showcases the obvious flaws, quirks and blunders
of its characters without giving us any good reason to give a damn.
