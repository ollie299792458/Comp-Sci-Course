Don't get me wrong, this is a well made action picture.  If you like wall to wall violence and action, then you will probably love the film.  The acting is decent especially considering that some rookie actors have some big parts.  What bothered me is the realism.  I watched a gun pulled out in the middle of a basketball court in front of hundreds, then a gun battle in a nearby apartment, and not a single police siren to be heard.  Later on a high speed chase and gun battle through the streets and no police.  Finally a machine gun fight in the middle of a residencial neighborhood for 10 minutes and no police.  They do portray Detroit as a lawless town, but this was crazy.  The only other thing I didn't like was the images/ghost of the boy's mother popping up.  I would rather have had a brief story in the beginning of the movie to set up her character and the influence she had on the boys.  I think if you want a straight action film and don't think about it too much, this one is for you, it certainly is exciting.
