I have been a fan of Bill Maher's for awhile now. I find that our thoughts about religion and politics match almost 100%, so I try to follow on his work and make up for a lost time, ie time when I didn't know about him and his works. This disc is one of missing links so I bought it in a heartbeat.

PROs:

* Bill Maher in his usual mood to take on on religious nuts.
* Various religious figures being put through some hard questions they don't have answers for.
* Wit and humor striking against bigotry and ignorance. Hurray!

CONs:

* Too short. But I guess he needs to leave some material for other discs / shows.

In truth, Bill Maher is saying what everybody else should know instinctively - that religion is pulling us down in the muck and that humanity will never truly be free unless we stop turning to religion for answers instead looking for them ourselves.

Although short, this disc is something you will watch from start to end and over and over again. It's a good purchase folks.
