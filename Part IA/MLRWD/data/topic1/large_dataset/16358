John Woo has a definite directiong style.  Lots of slow-motion, and an  emphasis on guns.  For a viewer who usually dislikes slow-motion because it  is kinda hokey I think he uses it so well it adds a lot to the film, and  I'm not just talking about the minute count.  Watching the action sequences  there are times where a gun falling to the ground seems to be the only  thing happening.  Somehow Woo weaves these moments into the action so  artfully the viewer can believe he is an omnicient observer, able to see  and hear everything necessary to fully appreciate the action.  The framing  is superb -- the wide shot of Castor Troy as his jacket billows or the  shootout in the hangar, where Troy dives out of the plane with both guns  firing are both suitable to hang on the wall.
The acting is so well done  even the most cynical viewer would be lying to say he didn't believe every  second of the "no more drugs for that man" scene.  
This movie  is so solidly shot and acted it feels like it is more real than any other  movie this reviewer has seen.  Never mind the stupid face switching scene,  or the rediculous boat chase, this movie is masterfully made.
