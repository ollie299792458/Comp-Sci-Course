This was a good horror movie.  It was much better than the first.  The first movie was slow paced and boring.  The shocking moment of the first movie was silly and i was able to predict it.  In this movie i dont think the plot was the best horror plot ive ever seen but it was interesting.  Shu Qi was a great choice in this movie.  Unlike the actress in the first movie, Shu Qi was not so wooden.  I was shocked that the actress in the first won a award because it made me laugh how fake her crying was in the first eye.  But i did feel Shu Qi's characters pain in this movie and that is the entire reason im giving this movie a 5 star: because of character development.  also this movie is much more scary than the first.  In the first 'eye' i was not scared one time.  It was all perdictable scares.  In this movie i actually got scared because there were times that what i thought was going to happen didnt happen, something else happened instead and that added a fun factor to this movie.  I would say that although not the best horror movie, this one is much better than the first.
