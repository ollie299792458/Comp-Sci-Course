I won't bore you with a summary of the plot, which has already been outlined.  I would prefer to highlight how this movie and its aesthetics affected me.

This movie was tastefully directed and the script was witty and intelligent.  The comedy was surprising, in that you didn't expect it.  I mean, I knew it was a comedy, but I didn't expect the humor to have such intelligence - each laugh the movie evoked caught me off guard, because I wasn't expecting it.  And that's the best kind of humor there is.  I laughed and laughed, especially at Sam, who could make a serious situation funny with just the teensiest effort.  And Garner's "She's f'in p.o.'d" line was just awesome!  And on top of everything else, the cinematography and soundtrack beautifully captured the spirit of the film.  This movie is a work of art that captures all your senses - very well put together with wonderful chemistry between the actors.

And I have a new favorite actor:  Timothy Olyphant.  I saw him in Hitman, but it took me a while to put it together that this was the same guy.  He pulled off the easygoing, comedic peformance in this movie without a hitch, something I wouldn't have seen coming based on his Hitman performance, which was also way-cool!  And that kiss!  Whoa!  Well, I guess I should say "kissES" coz ol' Timothy knows how to add the sizzle and spice more than once in this movie.  I mean, I thought the kiss at the end of "The Lake House" was good, but the kissing scene in this movie put Keanu and Sandra to shame!  Is it gettin' hot in here or is it just me?

At any rate, I loved the story, I loved the humor, I loved the romance, I loved everything about this movie.  It wasn't a cliche, which was so refreshing.  This has become a staple in my movie library.
