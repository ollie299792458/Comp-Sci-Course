Simone was real. Real Funny. Real Cleaver. Real Great!!! ...
It was a refreshingly funny Hollywood satire. And it's also a
movie you should definately not give away the ending. What ya'll
think, didn't happen. It had thousands of funny lines. And really
funny and unforgettable performances.
 ... Al Pacino plays Viktor Taransky, a not famous film
director who's leading lady(Winona Ryder in a funny cameo) fired him because of her trailer. Even though it was reeeaaally big.
Well, that day, he meets a dying man named Hank, who has software
to digitally create actors (or as it's described in the movie,
Vactors) Though, he resists at first, he whips up a 110% sexy
totally believable cyber actress that he names SIMONE(Rachel Roberts (111). Her popularity started to naturally rise and rise, until it got out of control. Well, it was still rising,
until the public started verbally killing him. They just needed
her to appear in public. He develops software that lets her. But
never up close to the people. Because if they touch her, poof!
She's gone. Just like that. (Viktor can't even get too close to
his computor. Later in the movie, Viktor was starting to believe,
It's not fun being replaced by a computorized performer, so he
tries every way to destroy her, he even goes out on the Pacific
Ocean and throws her software in the water. Until he discovers
"She's Indestrutable!" ... I know Mr. Niccol
wouldn't give us a sad ending!!! ... It's very cool.
