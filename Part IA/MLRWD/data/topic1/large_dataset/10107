It's impossible for a real American not to like this movie.When it was released in 1985,it was a huge hit,and with good reason.It finally put the lie to the notion that America was the villan in Vietnam while the Vie Cong and their Soviet allies were the heroes.In this film,the latter are potrayed as sadistic scum,while Rambo,representing American values,is shown as brave,principled,and resourceful.When,at the beginning of this film,Rambo asks "Do we get to win this time?",he speaks for every American who felt betrayed,whether it was by self-serving goverment bureaucrats(represented by Murdock,Rambo's hateful commanding officer)or left-wing so-called intellectuals who stabbed America's fighting men in the back.The movie rips both types of scum while celebrating the ingenuity and sheer guts of the american fighting man."Rambo Part II" may not be added to the list of "great" war movies,but,in its own way,it helped shape our culture,and change America from a land of Alan Alda/Phil Donahue-type wimps to a self-confident nation that could kick the crap of Saddam Hussein and the Al-Qaida.*** out of ***
