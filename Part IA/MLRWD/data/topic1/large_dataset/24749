I watched "In the Electric Mist" on a whim, based upon nothing more than the two actors displayed on the cover.  I had no idea what to expect, or what I was getting into.  In all honesty, I can't think of a better way to describe my reaction to the film other than to tell you that I logged onto Amazon tonight to purchase a copy.
I loved this film.
From the very beginning, "In the Electric Mist" draws you into an irresistible embrace and never lets go.  Every acting performance is spot-on, and the dubious culture of the Louisiana Bayou ebbs from every facet of the story.  I also need to mention the excellent soundtrack by Marco Beltrami; it is so powerful that it should be considered a character unto itself. There is a song played during the end credits that is truly one of the most beautiful songs you will ever hear.
Seriously, a great movie.
That being said, when I logged onto Amazon, I was surprised to see many reviewers voicing the opinion that this film's appeal is limited mainly to fans of the book.  It's true that "In the Electric Mist" leaves a lot to the imagination, but ambiguity and convolution are two very different things.
Take a chance.
Watch the movie.
Decide for yourself.
