Very good movie but defintely read the book Ghost Soldiers also. Well worth watching especially due to the fact of how remarkable the story is.
Movie strengths:
1)Very well cast
2)Sticks pretty well to the story line
3)Very well acted
4)Great filming - especially of the country side and the actual raid.

Weaknesses:
1)A little jumbled as to when the events actually took place per the books.
2) The best subplot of the Real story involved the movie heroine which in reality disguised herself, opened a bar that catered to Japanese soldiers and stole secrets from them for the underground.  In the movie Dahl made her a nurse and dumbed her story down.  TOTALLY incorrect and BORING. And then of course introduced a fake love story.
3) The last scene is a travesty - instead of showing what really happened they Hollywoodized it and made it revolve around the phony love affair.  What makes it worse is that they ACTUALLY filmed the correct ending and deleted it - see deleted scenes where Dahl claims that this version was not correct - hey buddy - read the books and  get your facts straight - This is history that you are supposed to PORTRAY not betray. Wimp.

Overall a very good movie - too bad they couldn't have stuck completely with the truth as it made a better story.  Fact was much better than fiction in this story but unfortunately Hollywood got to it in their usual way.
