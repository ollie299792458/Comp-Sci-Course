This movie is easily one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. "Radio" is your typical movie that is supposed to make people feel better about themselves after watching it because they pity a disadvantaged person. The film is so sugar-coated it could make you diabetic - and did I mention predictable? I doubt anyone will be shocked when Radio:
- gets mistreated by the police
- gets mistreated by his peers
- suffers a personal tragedy
- overcomes adversity and bigotry to emerge a community hero!
I don't care if it's "based on a true story", nobody's life follows hollywood stereotypes and cliches this closely. But wait! There is one surprise: ***SPOLIER ALERT!*** The team loses the football season! Half-way through the film. That's right, althought the tagline is "His Courage Made them Champions", Radio never makes anyone the champion of anything! Team after team fails to win, even with Radio as their "aren't we nice to include the retarded guy and laugh at him while we do it" mascot. I was ready for Ed Harris to have the Gatorade dumped all over him by a victory-crazed Radio, but alas, I was to be denied that scene.
In short, this movie is awful, but I guess if you liked "Pay It Forward" (which I imagine is just as sappy and bad) or other such sentimental crap, then this is the movie for you! Otherwise it will just make you want to die.
