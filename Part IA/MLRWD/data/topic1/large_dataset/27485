Going into the theater, I expected a heart-pounding historical account of the Miracle On Ice. My expectations were met. My parents have told me many a time about how they sat on their couch together watching the acual game and how exciting it was. They told me how much national pride this movie instilled in the hearts of millions. This movie did the same for me. This movie was an accurate (and exciting) depiction of the single-greatest moment in the history of sports in the United States. It left my friends and I chanting "U-S-A! U-S-A!" by the conclusion. It gives the younger population a chance to see how crucial this moment was, not only for sports in the US, but for the entire nation in terms of esteem. Despite the fact that the Miracle On Ice occured seven years before I was born, I still have a great deal of appreciation for the moment as an achievement and as a story of national triumph. I would have probably given anything to see the actual game. Do you believe in Miracles? I do.
