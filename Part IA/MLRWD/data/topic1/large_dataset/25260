I have to admit this movie can be slow and strange. Hence minus 1 star. But TO ME, and this is just to ME, I was able to pay attention because of Gary Oldman, who is my all time #1 favorite actor. He's such a chameleon, and seeing as how he usually graces the screen as a bad guy in some way, shape, or form (or is just eccentric or crazy lol), he's just brilliantly funny in this.

It's interesting b/c Gary's character as 'Rosencrantz' (NOT Guildenstern lol) is a 'slow' fella but he's imaginative & inventive, but philosophical once he gets a grasp on what you're talking about.

Then to top it all off, you're thrust into HAMLET, but from another perspective. So you gotta get into the Shakespearian linguo, which I haven't done fully since 12th grade, and that was 6 years ago. Fortunately, Ros & Guild hardly have to talk in such a strange manner or AS THICKLY as the other regular HAMLET characters do. It's just worded strangely b/c it's like they're poets.

The chemistry between Roth & Oldman is wonderful, and the extra's are interviews with Dreyfus, Oldman, Roth, & Stoppard himself. Then they also have a photo gallery. That's it, but for me it was enough to hear Oldman talk for 58 minutes! :) (They're interviewed separately.)

The dvd I got came with 2 discs, I suppose this is the only release to DVD so far so they all will be 2 disc? Quality was very good. :)

If you're a big fan of Gary's, I HIGHLY recommend this flick. Very amusing, and interesting, and good Shakespearian fun :)
