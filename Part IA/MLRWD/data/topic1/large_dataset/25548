I'm not sure how those of us who were lucky enough to see this movie in theatres actually ^got^ to see it in theatres.  Reportedly grossing less than twenty mil during its quick run early this year, and attacked from several angles by self-indulgent critics, this wasn't a movie many people went to see because of its promotion in the media.  But instead, somehow, people saw it, and those who did stood by it with an almost unanimous verdict -- the juice was worth the squeeze.  I can't remember the last time I saw a movie where I laughed this hard, yet actually cared about the well-being of the characters, and worried as to how they'd end up in the end.  Eli and Elisha played their roles beautifully, balancing a mixture of awkwardness with the daring of youth, and a smooth sophistication in certain scenes that just made you smile when you saw them on screen.  Some parts of the movie were incredibly touching, while others were somewhere between hilarious and simply crazy - crazy in a good way.  Crazy in the best of ways.  I'm actually going to get the DVD for my older sister, who wasn't able to see the film while it was in theatres, because that's how much faith I have in the movie to make anyone smile.  I mean, look at the ratings here on Amazon.  When last did you see a teen comedy get a 4+ out of 5-star rating on Amazon?  As someone put it earlier, we can't all be wrong.  Look through the reveiews -- the vast majority are fours and fives, and well-written to boot.  This movie actually touched people -- it left an impact with them, to the level that they'd come on an online store to write about what it meant to them -- even though only 1 person saw it for every *20* that saw Spiderman II.  That's dedication.  That's the sign of something different, something deeper than the average.  To me at least, that's the sign of a cult classic in the making.

Go see it.  I can't promise you'll absolutely love it, but I almost can.  It's that good :^)
