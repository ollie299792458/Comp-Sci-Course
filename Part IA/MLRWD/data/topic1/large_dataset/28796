When the stagecoach first approaches John Wayne, as The Ringo Kid and he cocks his rifle in John Ford's immortal classic, Stagecoach, it never, and I really mean never, fails to send a shiver up my spine. This has to be one of the greatest film first-appearances ever. Right up there with Orson Welles' Harry Lime in Carol Reed's The Third Man.  Criterion is finally releasing one of my all-time favorite westerns; in Blu-Ray no less. Now, let's hope for quick releases of Red River, The Searchers (I own the Blu-ray, but it deserves the Criterion treatment) High Noon and Shane. Thank you Criterion!
UPDATE Review.
After viewing only the feature the other evening, I do have some observations that I would like to share.
First and foremost, the actual video quality of the blu-ray doesn't appear to my eyes to be a marked improvement over previous dvd versions; while Criterion has a proven track record of meticulous transfers, alas the newly discovered 1942 nitrate duplicate negative of Stagecoach, while an improvement over pre-existing negatives, still has so many scratches, nicks and debris, that viewers expecting a miracle on par with the blu-ray version of Casablanca, will be sorely disappointed. Indeed, I found myself paying more attention to the film source, rather than enjoying the film.
The good news is that Stagecoach still delivers. The dialogue, direction and scenery are still Ford's masterpiece. The extras, including a rare 1917 Ford silent feature, Bucking Broadway and an audio commentary by Jim Kitses and much, much more, make this version of Stagecoach a worthy addition to anyone's video library.
