I remember watching this on television when it first aired in 1994.  I've since purchased the collection on VHS and have watched it once almost every year since.

Ken Burns weaves a wonderful tapestry of nostalgia, emotion, photographs, newsreels and personal reflections into the history of 20th-Century America through the lens of baseball.  The American Pastime mirrors the social changes of our country - good and bad - and Burns demonstrates this throughout.

Burns probably needs to be forgiven for his 'obsession' with Babe Ruth and Jackie Robinson.  While both figures are dominant in the broadcasts, the stories are indeed moving and I remember shedding several tears during the original telecast during these sequences.  The New York and Boston teams are emphasized - which is fine; it would be impossible to encapsulate all of the rich history of baseball on just nine tapes or discs.  Although a strong Cardinals fan, I didn't feel 'slighted.'  Ken Burns is from the East Coast, anyway, so it's entirely understandable that his historical emphasis would reflect this.

To me, the highlights are the rare newsreel footage of both  Ruth and Robinson, the priceless reflections from Buck O'Neil, the perspectives from Dan Okrent, the 'Black Sox' Scandal, and the simultaneous interweaving of the Negro Leagues with the Major Leagues.  Burns has a tendency to make political points (at the expense of improving the production) in subtle and overt ways.  The only color footage shown in the production prior to the 1960's is that of the Negro Leagues and Ladies' Professional Leagues.  I can't believe that that wasn't deliberate - I'm sure that Burns had access to historic color footage of the Major Leagues, but chose not to incorporate it.

Overall, however, this set is a wonderful collection for the baseball fan of all ages - very intelligent and very moving.
