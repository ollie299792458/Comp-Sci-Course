I just purchased the DVD of A Hard Days Night by The Beatles. I've have been waiting with anticipation for this DVD for quite some time. I was appauled when I put the disc in and found that the top and bottom off of the film to make it appear as though it's in a widescreen format. I've been viewing this film for years and to see the tops of the Beatles heads cut off throughout the movie is frustrating, disappointing and quite unforgivable. The distributors could have simply offered the viewer a choice by placing both of the versions (the ...chopped version and the original full screen version) on the disc as is available with so many DVD's. Instead they've opted to change history and not for the better in my opinion. What were theye thinking. Did the Beatles approve this and feel it was a good idea to make a wonderful movie unwatchable?
I can't believe that I've read all of the other reviews on this site and no one has noticed this. I viewed my original video and compared it to the new improved DVD and there seems to be alot of the tops of the Beatles heads missing on the DVD. Appaulling!!!!!! My only hope is that they release a full screen version of the DVD at a later date. Otherwise about 25% of history has just been rewritten. I guess George Orwell was right, history is remanufatured everyday and no one even notices. Ah, the days of Oceana.
