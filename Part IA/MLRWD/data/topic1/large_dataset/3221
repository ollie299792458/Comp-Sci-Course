Beware of this set.  It has many DVD's that are scratched and damaged so that they cannot be used.

Amazon has reviews warning of this problem since 2007- Three years ago! They SHOULD have corrected the problem long ago.  Amazon must have had many returns, so they very well knew about it.

For most of us - time is valuable.  Amazon wants us to pack up, send it back, wait until they process the refund and then we have to reorder.  That's if we are lucky enough to find out in time for the return period.

If Amazon has known about this problem since 2007 - the least they could do is stop sending bad sets and just send new one's on people's word! This should be an exception to returns policy, as Amazon could have remedied this problem in 3 years!  They know they have been sending junk to customers.

AMAZON:  If you value your customers, you shouldn't make them go out of their way re-packaging 5 pounds of junk disks when you know that they are most likely defective!

JUST SEND US NEW ONES!  Sorry, but I have been a loyal customer for over 11 years, and shouldn't have to be stuck with all of this junk, nor be required to pack it and send it back  - just for you to put it into the trash.
