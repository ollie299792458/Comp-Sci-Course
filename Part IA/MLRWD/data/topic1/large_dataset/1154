Except for the cinematography, which is good, this is a total failure and not worth your time. I have seen 30,000 films in my life, and see them for several reasons: to feel, to laugh, to learn or all three. This is a film about a cold, selfish young man who is handsome and sexy, but without any redeeming qualities.  He lives with and hates his Greek family, and hates the Australia he lives in. He has no job and seeks none. He spends his days smoking pot, snorting lines or shooting heroin, or selling drugs for spending money, and if horny, pulls strange men off the street and sucks them off (Don't get excited - this is not a porno flick... You have six minutes total of on-screen statuesque nudity, and that's it.) He is bored and boring, lazy, cynical and his only talent is using people. His uneducated parents cannot seem to motivate him, and make things worse by badgering him about getting married. He wants to go to Greece and get a job, but his parents are not amused. This is a film about a limited guy who never grows or changes. The 95 minutes are excruciatingly boring and monotonous - jangly pounded notes pass for music and are 5 times louder than the dialogue, which, 60% of the time is in Greek - without subtitles. The dialogue is so soft, you have to crank up the volume. An acquaintance of his, Sean, is a sweet, lyrically beautiful young man, and we hope he will fall in love with him and grow through this love. At film's end they finally get together, but Ari's vulgarity, brutality and lack of feeling kill it all. After watching the film - with many breaks from the boredom - I threw it in the trash. The Greeks I have known were all warm, loving and generous. This film is insulting to them.
