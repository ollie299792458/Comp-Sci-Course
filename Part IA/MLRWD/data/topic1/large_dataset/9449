Persuasion is a slow paced movie, not for those who typically like fast-action flicks. Very little actually happens during the story, but it is rather a character-driven movie about a man and woman reforging their past love for each other; a love that never really died.

The story begins eight years after Ann has rejected the marriage proposal of Frederick because she was advised that he was beneath her station and had no prospects. Then, during their eight-year separation, he gains a fortune on the high seas and Ann's family is near bankruptcy because of their pompous father's financial extravagance.

Both main characters never married. Ann (played wonderfully by Amanda Root) is considered a dispirited, sad "old maid" and Frederick (played by Ciaran Hinds) is considered an eligible bachelor by all the young ladies who try their hand to win him, since he is newly returned from the Napoleonic war and ready to take a wife.

The story is predictable, with no major surprises. It is gentile and fun, though, and I found myself intrigued toward the end, even though I nearly turned it off in the beginning because it was paced so slowly, showing people walking, horse-drawn carts and carriages, countryside and so forth. There was lots that I would have cut in order to get on with the story, but much of the pacing WAS the story. It's a different era with an emphasis on quiet conversation. People talk and talk, and they walk and talk, but the talk is often delightful in its common curtesy and politeness. Many modern young women could learn much from watching this movie.

Let this be a possible gage: if my review seems dull, then the movie may also seem dull because this review reflects the pace of Persuasion.

To me, it was ultimately a "feel good" movie that produced a smile.
