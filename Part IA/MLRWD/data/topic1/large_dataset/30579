I became aware of Terrence Malick's work as a filmmaker after being stunned by his 1998 epic "The Thin Red Line".  In tracking down the rest of his work I was both dismayed and relieved (financially) to  learn he had directed just two other films. "Badlands", though  his debut, already is awash with his trademark style and may be his most  daring effort.  
That being said I don't think "Badlands" is a  film for everyone. Though the story is captivating and enjoyable, the  narrative is de-emphasized for complex themes and gorgeous visuals.  Malick  makes his points with incredible subtlety, perhaps even to a fault.  However, this makes "Badlands'" mystique only grow with repeated  viewings. The robustness of detail is absolutely mind-blowing.  Most  impressive is how Malick creates a paradoxical environment between the  images, sounds, and narrative. Sissy Spacek's naive narration is in direct  contrast to a relatively uninspiring romance we see.  Perhaps most stunning  is overwhelming trapped feeling the film evokes while being set in the  spartan, vast, and barren landscapes of the Great Plains.  These are just a  few examples of a film that endlessly confounds and intrigues. I rank it  with Chinatown and Taxi Driver as the pinnacle of US produced film in the  70's. If you want to explore the possibilities of film I can't think of  anything to recommend more highly.
