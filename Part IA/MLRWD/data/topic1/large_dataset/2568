Video Quality:
Overall, this season looks a lot better than the first season's episodes.  This isn't really because of the mastering of the discs, but is most likely the result of a better filming process that was used.  Still, you tend to notice some graininess on certain scenes (especially close up shots).  So far, I've watched 17 episodes and only one ("In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum") looked really bad...almost like I was playing a VCD instead of a DVD on that episode!  The rest were fine, and some were absolutely flawless in appearance.  
Audio:  
I think it sounds absolutely great!  Very clear on all channels and I think it is an improvement over the season one set with respect to Dolby Digital 5.1 mastering.  Some cooler surround effects and a wider dynamic range on the audio this time around.
Extras:  
A little better than the last set, especially the easter egg on disc 6 which has a 3 minute gag real.  Again, you get episode teasers for each episode which is a nice touch and some documentaries.  One of the best extras is a commentary on "The Geometry of Shadows" by Boxleitner, Christiansan, & Doyle.  Absolutely hilarious and something fans will love.
A not so good thing:
If you are new to the series, DO NOT listen to the 3 commentaries or it will ruin the series for you since they have a habit of discussing stuff that happens later on in the show...like the ultimate fate of certain characters (Oops!!)  No kidding, you listen to these and kiss all the big suprises for the rest of the series goodbye.  A shame.
Overall:  
A really good product and well worth buying.  They did a great job on this set and I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't be pleased with it.
