Like others I was beguiled into buying the DVD after hearing the CD of the marvelous one-man show that Stewart has done.  I found this to be a less than compelling re-make of the timeless classic. 
The enduring story of "A Christmas Carol" involves Ebenezer Scrooge, a greedy grasping businessman, who is untouched by human emotion.  Or so we think until he is visited one Christmas Eve by four sprits who show him the error of his ways.  In the end a redeemed Scrooge resolves to keep the Christmas spirit all the days of his life and to be good to his fellow men.  
In contrast to his one-man show, Stewart is here keeping company with actors of lesser abilities.  This is a dreadful problem.  Especially since so many of the characters are only thinly drawn in Dicken's story.  The Fianc&eacute;e who leaves him and the sister who once rescued him are both poorly portrayed in this rendition.  Even the beloved clerk, Crachit, is a weak shadow of the loving family man we have come to expect.  Stewart himself seems to be giving a less than peak performance but this might just be because he was unable to rise above the mediocre acting about him. 
I did not find that the special effects were in anyway well done.  All the advent of technology and computer-aided imaging was unable to create anything that could captive the viewer and cause him to suspend disbelief. 
I purchased the DVD edition of this movie, but I might as well have saved my money and gotten the VHS version (or saved more money and not gotten any version).  The special features are noting more than the little `squibs' used by TNT to promote the film none lasts for more than a minute or two.  
But do not despair if you simply must have Stewart as Scrooge, get a copy of his one-man show.  It is really magnificent.
