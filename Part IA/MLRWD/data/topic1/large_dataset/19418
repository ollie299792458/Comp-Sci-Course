First off, I'll say that I spent about a year at Dan's JP3 Page, anxiously anticipating this film.  I have always been a huge JP fan and believe it or not, I loved The Lost World.  After the long period of waiting and speculating, July 18th came and I rushed to theaters.  I sat in my seat, giddy as a schoolboy about the new addition to one of my two favorite series (along with Star Wars.)  Was the waiting worth it?  Was the movie even that good?  Could Joe Johnston make a movie worthy of the name "Jurassic Park"?
After seeing JP3 for the first time, I said to myself "eh...it was pretty good."  I thought it wasn't as good as the other two JPs, thought the plot was stupid, and missed the T-Rex.
I saw it again later.  I LOVED IT AFTER THAT.  When first watching this film, it is normal to expect something in perticular.  What many fail to recognize is this:
JP3 was a fantastic movie for being a sequel.
Sure, it doesn't match to awe and wonder of Steven Speilbergs original masterpeice, but it was a great sequel.  Everything in it was fresh: The new intelligent raptors, brand new characters, the Spinosaur, the pteranodons, the para-sailing.  EVERYTHING WAS FRESH.  I never expected it to lose all the things we had gotten so used to in the first 2 to be gone.  Plus, it had a different mood, which I didn't expect.
JP3 was an excellent sequel.  So many sequels are crap these days and JP3 was far better than that.  Keep that in mind while your watching it on DVD instead of thinking about how it compares to the original.  :D
