Burt Lancaster was a great actor who made many subpar movies.  'THE SCALPHUNTERS' certainly falls into this category. Lancaster plays 'Joe Bass' a trapper who spends the entire film trying to regain the furs that have been stolen from him -- first, by Indians (very original) and second, by a group of bandits known as scalphunters.  The way they are portrayed seems to make them be better suited to an episode of 'Wagon Train' than as villainous renegades. 
  Early on Lancaster ecounters Joseph Lee, a cultured runaway slave played by Ossie Davis - who is easily the best thing about this very nondescript film.  The two regularly engage in fistacuffs, generic discussions on race, and dialogue which is not as witty as the screenwriter thinks.  It's too bad. Lancaster and Davis are fine actors and their interplay had potential. Unfortunately the material lacked potential.
  Still, fans of westerns might enjoy this film. Telly Savalas makes a worthy villain and the action scenes are quite well done.  However, most would do well to check out a true overlooked classic western starring Lancaster -- 'THE PROFESSIONALS.'  A rare gem amid much of the rubbish that typified Lancaster's western flicks! Alas, these other reviewers are either western junkies or nostalgic revisionists.
