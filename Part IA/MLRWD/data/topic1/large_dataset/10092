I've bought this Blue Ray collection to inaugurate my Sony BDP S570. Besides at the time, Amazon had an unbeatable deal on it: a 26 bucks price tag, free shipping, & $5 credit to use on Amazon's VOD. Let alone that I'm a big fan of The Underworld Trilogy & Kate Beckinsale ;-)

Now that I've just finished watching the movie, I have a few words to share with fellow customers:

As for the movie itself, I think it is one of, if not, the best Vampires movie. A well-put together mosaic of cinematic artistry where acting, special effects & story telling techniques complement each other in an inseparable state of awesomeness! Part I left me puzzled with questions, whereas Part II left me breathless & desiring for more. Hence comes Part III which left me mesmerized on my couch. I almost thought I turned into a Lycan! A-Whooooooooo! Thankfully, my neighbors didn't suspect anything!!

As for the Blue Ray Discs, they deliver on quality in every aspect starting with the packaging (Very neat) through image & sound quality. The first disc is rated R. It comes loaded with prolong yet interesting documentary about the origins and/or traces of the ever-mystical Vampires & Werewolves in both history & science [Fang vs. Fiction]. The second disc is UNRATED (sure is a plus) [Parental advisory for sexual content] along with more added features about the making of the movie. The 3rd disc is rated R & comes bundled with a Digital Copy, sweet!

Now,whether I'm talking about the Blue Ray Discs or the artistic creations loaded onto them, I am sure to recommend them to a friend with projecting confidence. It sure is a must add-on to your home movie collection.
