Season Seven had some great adventures. It was sad to see Jonas leave, however was great to see Dr. Jackson return. I think we got to see a little of the lives of the characters on earth as well as offworld. SG1 has got to be one of the greatest Sci-Fi series ever. I look forward to each new episode weekly and dread the dead season waiting for the new one to begin. I agree with another review posted here there must be a place for Jonas? He brought alot to the show, I am not sure how they could get him to atlantis without the power source to achieve a connection to that gate, but its Sci-Fi they could work it out if needbe. But regardless i have already pre-ordered season 7, it will be the seventh box set in my collection and although season 8 seems to be a bit lame, i still tune in each week, knowing it will get better. Stargate Atlantis has proven to be better than expected, but would not exist if not for Col. Oneill and his team. The fact that they run 4 repeats every monday pm on the scifi channel lets those that have not been diehard fans get caught up. Howabout a marathon :) I say buy it, its worth every penny.
