I originally saw this movie at the cinema, and while I definitely enjoyed it, I did not find myself thoroughly satisfied.  However, the acting was of such a high calibre that I rented it to watch again and see what I missed  the first time.  The second viewing was somewhat of a revelation.  What an  amazing film!  I believe it plays better on the small screen. The  subtleties of the narrative and the acting are outstanding.  I was  completely absorbed in the story and, after purchasing the disc, have loved  it as much, if not more, on repeat viewings.  I think that The Insider can  be ranked, along with Being John Malkovich, as the best film of 1999. With  regards to the dvd, the picture quality is excellent but Disney has not  given this film the packing it deserves.  There are no extras worth  mentioning except for an all too brief "Inside a Scene".  However, as with The Sixth Sense, they did manage to put unavoidable  previews at the beginning of the disc.  Shame on you Disney for not giving  this remarkable film the kudos it deserves.
