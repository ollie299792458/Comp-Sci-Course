In all honesty I'm going a little high by giving it a 5 but I feel the need to make up for all the undeserved 1's it is receiving here. A truer rating for it would probably be about a 3.75, and a 4 for the DVD version when you include all the added goodies!
Dungeons &amp; Dragons while not being Academy Award material, is quite well-done and very fun to watch. The acting by our lead Justin Whalin (probably best known for his role as Jimmy in the Superman TV show Lois &amp; Clark) was captivating enough to have me completely empathetic with his character, our slightly reluctant hero, Ridley. The special effects were also well done. While I would have liked more exposition on the supporting characters and their motivations the movie pulled together fairly well by the end. 
I grew up on books by Tolken, Terry Brooks and the like. I graduated to PC Role Playing Games such as Diablo and Diablo II, and although I've never played D&amp;D I think that this movie stayed true to its fantasy roots.  If you're expecting absolute brilliance, innovation, and movie experience unlike any before you may be disappointed. If you are looking for an enjoyable escape from reality for a couple of hours, this is definitely your ticket!
