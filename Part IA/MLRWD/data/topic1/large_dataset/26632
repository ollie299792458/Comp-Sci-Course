If you liked "Best of Show", "A Mighty Wind" and "Waiting for Guffman" then you might be intersted in this movie.  It has a totally different set of cast and crew and does not include Christpher Guest. Notice I ignored "For Your Consideration."

This movie deals with a National Texas Hold Em winner take all tournment.  The main character is Woody Harrelson who plays a down and out addicted to every known drug and vice low life who is about to lose his casino that his uncle gave to him before he died.  Woody checks out of rehab where he has resided for the past two years to win the $10 million tournament and save his casino that he is about to lose to a shady real estate developer.

The movie is a fictional docu-drama developing the characters of the 6 finalists and their family.  They could have left Gabe Kaplan out of it!
There are guest appearances by mainstays in the Texas Hold em tournaments, however, there is no character development on them possible because they have already been over exposed on ESPN et al.

There were some instances where the spoofs failed but for the most part it was funny.  The two announcers were even funnier than the announcers on "Dodge Ball"

No Academy award winning performances but a great effort by all.  The ending was different than you expected.  The movie was just long enough to keep your attention.
