I'd never even heard of "The Good Fairy" until stumbling across it at Amazon.  Because of the other good reviews, and my own fondness for Preston Sturges comedies, I took a chance and purchased it and am not one whit sorry!

It has nothing to do with fairies or magic, by the way, but rather Margaret Sullavan's character's desire to be a sort of Secret Santa / anonymous benefactor to a man she picks out of the telephone book.  The image of Miss Sullavan on the DVD cover, which makes her look like a toy soldier, is a depiction of her character in her uniform as an usher at a movie palace.  I mention all this because the combination of that image and the title had me thinking this might be some sort of spin on Hans Christian Andersen, or something.  It's not!

This is a delightful film, with top-drawer performances by all concerned.  My husband and I were laughing aloud throughout the movie, and we're not an easy audience.  The story has heart and drama and delicious comedy.  It also has the best performance by Herbert Marshall I've seen, and while I'm no fan of Mr. Marshall's work, this performance is simply sterling.  His scene with Margaret Sullavan as he rhapsodizes over a pencil sharpener is mesmerizing.  His delight in that simple mechanism is priceless.

If you like Preston Sturges comedies such as "The Palm Beach Story" and "Unfaithfully Yours" then I do believe you'll find "The Good Fairy" worth your while.
