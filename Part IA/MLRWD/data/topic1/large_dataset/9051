I got this DVD set three days ago, and I finished watching all of it just now. It was my third time watching the series, but I had never watched the dubbed version before now. I'll have to admit: the dubbed rendition evoked more emotions out of me than the subbed one ever did. All of the English voice actors did a fantastic job in my opinion, something that I've found to be uncommon when it comes to anime. However, if you really just don't like hearing it in English for whatever reason, this set provides the original Japanese audio along with English subtitles.

The DVDs are all pretty much bare. There are 4 DVDs total, each DVD containing 6 episodes and a few trailers. No extra features here. They all come packed in a normal-sized DVD box, as you can see from the images, along with a nice reversible cover. Good video and audio quality, but then again, I'm not really picky about that kind of stuff too much.

This rich and supernatural story is full of characters who are all easy to relate to. If you haven't seen the series before, there are places to preview it online, so go check them out already! If you have and you enjoyed it, you should definitely add this to your collection. The complete Kanon series for this price? Totally worth it and more.
