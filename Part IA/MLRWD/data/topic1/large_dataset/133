Although I liked the movie (enough to buy the DVD), I was not expecting the hilarity of the menu screens.  In case it hasn't been mentioned much already, there was actually new content filmed for the DVD menus, specifically the Main menu and the Special Features menu.  The Main DVD menu, has Harold and Kumar sitting in the car, driving.  The sequence appears to repeat every minute or so, but in fact, the first 10 or so sequences are not repeats!  They even end up arguing over why the DVD watcher hasn't picked any menu choices yet, and that it's not that hard to do.  Very funny stuff, and an excellent addition to the movie.

The second menu, the Special Features menu, has Harold and Kumar in the car after going over the embankment.  The car won't start, and Kumar keeps trying it, and trying it, for probably up to 10 minutes or so.  All throughout it, he's talking and trying to get Harold to respond.  They eventually try to get some sleep, in the car.

All in all, very funny stuff...  Enjoy the movie, but don't forget to sit through those two menus!  They are one of the most interesting and innovative ideas I've seen on a DVD in some time.
