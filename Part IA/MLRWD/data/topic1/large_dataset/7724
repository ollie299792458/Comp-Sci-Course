Winding Refn is a young, talented director from Denmark. His first movies: Pusher, Bleeder, are among my favourites. Bronson is below expectations.

The movie is dull, if not boring. Tom Hardy is great as Bronson, no discussion there, but I don't know what to make of his character: Is he a psychopath? Is he just silly?

Probably two things (and that's it) are worth mentioning. First, the opening scene. Winding Refn has created an amazing opening scene (a fighting scene) where the colors black and red dominate the screen. These colors (and the music) create an atmosphere that is difficult to forget.

But after this scene the movie drags painfully and boringly on. (At some point I wondered whether this was another Am&eacute;lie Poulin).

The second thing that I wanted to mention is music. Probably this is a film where your dollars are better spent buying the soundtrack than the DVD.

I ordered the DVD from one of Amazon's European websites. It took only a few days for the package to cross the ocean and arrive at my door, the whole thing being very expedient. Indeed, purchasing this way turned out less expensive than having ordered from Amazon's American site.
