When I first saw this, it was time when Trekkies and such were out. Star Trek was hot as a flashback/pop culture thing, and this movie looked to be a cheap cash-in.

But that couldn't be farther from the truth. I was shocked at how good it was. The story is spot-on, making fun of all the aspects that deserve it (fans, plot devices, typecasting, James Tiberius Kirk and more) and the cast was a fantastic get for a movie that plays as just a spoof. When you can get Sam Rockwell (in his 2nd best Sci-Fi role) to play a bit part, you're doing very well. And Tim Allen, who so often turns out poorly instead shows us all that with a good script, he can hold his own against actors like Alan Rickman and Tony Shalhoub who would seem to far outclass him.

This movie is entertaining all the way, with only a very few short dead spots. All the characters are played well and it actually works as its own story, beyond being a Star Trek riff.

I could hardly imagine how this could be made better. Even making it actually mention Star Trek directly would only limit their ability to make light of the characters and actors.

I could not possibly recommend this more to fans of Star Trek, Sci-Fi or just good comedy. This movie is one of a select few that I watch over and over when I need entertainment (alongside Caddyshack, Trading Places and Office Space), it's just that good.
