I must admit that I am a great Bernardo Bertulluci fan.  I think that his films - even when they are good and not great("Stealing Beautey," for example)are interesting and have something substantial to say.  This  film is no exception to this mold, with the disapointing fact that it is  far from great - though it does have moments of greatness.
  On the  positive, most of the cast is good, with Bridge Fonda giving another grand  performance.  Yet, Reeves is not 100% fit for the role - though he does  give a worthy effort.
  What goes wrong here?  For one, the "back  and forth" angle of the movie is disapointing.  Most viewers care  little about the modern story and want to stay on the traditional story of  the Buddha, which is great for those who know nothing of it.  Another is  Reeves.  He partially hurts the high points of the film.  Another factor is  the timing.  By the end of the film, you are and worn out - not a good  sign.
  Yet, this film, once again, does have its high points.  Some  parts of the film show what a great director Bertulluci is and how high he  could fly.  
  If you want great Bertulluci, then try "Last  Tango in Paris," "The Last Emperor" and - my favorite -  "1900."
