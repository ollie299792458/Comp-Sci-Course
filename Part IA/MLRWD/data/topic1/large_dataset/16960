"A Little Princess" is, simply put, a beautiful film. The cinematography, sets, music and lighting are top-notch. The scenes in India are particularly gorgeous. The acting is, by and large, superb. As a film,  it works.
As an adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's beloved classic,  however, this film doesn't come very close. As the 1939 Shirley Temple  version, this "LP" simply appropriates the characters' names and  the vague situation. Most of the action in the second half of the  film--including the discovery of the attic room, the ashes incident, the  wild chase and the ending--are from the Temple picture, not the  book.
Similarly, the characters deviate significantly from those  described in the book. Liesel Matthews is excellent, but she does not have  the personality of Burnett's Sara Crewe. Amelia Minchin and Lavinia are  both given more sympathetic portrayals, and so forth.
This is a fine  movie, but it should be viewed as such, not as an adaptation of the fine  novel.
