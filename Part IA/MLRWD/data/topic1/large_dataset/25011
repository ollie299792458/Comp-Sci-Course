For all those folks who feel politics are a bore, you're about to receive a rude awakening.  Jimmy Stewart plays the young Jefferson Smith in this wonderful drama of a young boy-scout type who has been dropped into Daniel  Webster's seat in the Senate!  At first, Smith merely holds his seat  without saying much, but soon he begins to think of a great bill that would  change life for kids on the streets: a national boys' camp!  Little does he  know that a dam is about to go up where he wants his camp.  This movie  ends in a philibuster (sp?) with Smith standing for nearly 24 hours in the  Senate trying to prove his innocence after being framed by the people who  graphed the lands on Willet Creek (where camp is).  In the last few  dramatic moments, Smith feels all hope is lost, and faints dead away on the  congress floor.  At seeing this, the man who unwillingly framed him tries  to shoot himself.  Now everyone sees that Smith was right, and the camp  must go on!  This is my favorite movie and I recommend it to everyone.  If  you are planning a trip to Washington D.C., watch this movie, first.  It  will mean so much more to you.  It shows that truth, bravery, and  persistance are the only way that this great nation can survive.  I hope  that you will watch it with tears in your eyes and thank God for the great  nation that he has given you.  Thank you.
