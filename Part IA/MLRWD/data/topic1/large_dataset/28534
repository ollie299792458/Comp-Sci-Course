Normally, when a movie is redone 30 years later, the end result is worse than the original.  Not so in this case, as John McTiernan's version is highly superior.  This movie brings the elegance that was missing from the original.  The music is fantastic, and the aesthetic is that much better.  Also, instead of bank robbery, the film revolves around a much more elegant crime; the theft of a Monet worth 100 million dollars. 
Thomas Crown(Pierce Brosnan) is the fabulously wealthy owner of Crown Acquistions.  Supposedly, as his life is quite boring, he decides to steal a painting-not for the money, but for the thrill.  He sends some Eastern Europeans to attempt to steal 200 pounds of paintings, while sending them to fail and sneaking away to steal a painting from another area.  Catherine Banning(Rene Russo), an insurance "bounty hunter," comes from England to help the detective(Denis Leary) crack the case.  While Banning is investigating Crown, they fall more and more in love, leading to a very interesting competitor/lover relationship.
Pierce Brosnan plays Thomas Crown excellently.  He brings elegance and class to the role that Steve McQueen could not.  Rene Russo holds up as Catherine Banning.  Denis Leary, though funny as always, just should not be in this film.  He is somewhat of a comic relief character.  Along with the shameless product placement of Pepsi One, that is what keeps it from getting 5 stars.  However, the acting of Brosnan along with the fantastic score and unbelievably cool ending make this movie great fun. In regard to special features, they are lacking, but the movie is all too worth buying.
