Gettysburg is based on the book "Killer Angels", which is recommended reading for Marine and U.S. Army officers.  Both the book and the movie are riveting.  I believe that this battle shows clearly that Lee was much better at managing a defense and/or withdrawl, than he was at conducting an offensive campaign.  Had Union General Techumusa Sherman been in Lee's shoes, I doubt that the second and third day battles would not have been fought.  In the movie, General Longstreet pleads with General Lee on the second and third days to avoid attacking the high ground but instead to maneuver into a position that would require the Union to attack them instead.  Lee did not feel well at Gettysburg, and that may have affected his judgement.  In the movie, Lee does look tired and inattentive to what Longstreet is trying to convey.  Col Chamberlain's heroic stand on Little Round Top was the best part of the movie.

Unfortunately, Gods and Generals has way, way too much character development and not enough action.  Similarly, important campaigns such as Antietem and the Shenandoah Valley were left out, which were important to the development of the Stonewall Jackson legend.

Stephen Lang (Avatar's Colonel Miles Quaritch) gives a great acting performance as General George Pickett in Gettysburg and General Stonewall Jackson in Gods and Generals.  Jeff Daniels also does a masterful job in both movies as Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain.

Gettysburg is clealy 5 stars if you are a Civil War history buff.
Gods and Generals is 3 stars.

Since this set contains both 'Gettysburg' and 'Gods and Generals', I give this four stars.
