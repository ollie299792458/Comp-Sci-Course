I decided to give this new production a try, since I enjoy Dickens (Check out "Our Mutual Friend"-5 stars). After watching the first installment on Masterpiece, I said there's something missing here. Before the second installment, I decided to review an earlier production from the BBC from 2004. It had been many years since I read Great Expectations, and that production had left me wondering, how good was it?  After watching it again, I realized how good it was. For me, there is no comparison between the 2012 and the 2004. The Rampling/Waddell production is all Dickens, filled with turns and twists that naturally flow out of the story, nothing forced, nothing artificial. The acting is wonderful, the sets wonderful. All the elements are there for a great story.  Most of all, there are the wonderful Dickens characters, complex and human, people you care about for good or bad. It is richly Dickens, in only the way he can tell.
As for the other, it is flat, stale, cliched, and forced. I found the characters two dimensional and undeveloped with no depth or complexity, rather the production of a hurried Hollywood screenwriter on a timetable. No amount of good acting brings this story to life. Exploitive, rather, it seems. You can see this kind of production every night on a TV channel.
If you want Dicken's Great Expectations, stick to the 2004 BBC production. Wonderful.
The other, well, just plain terrible.
