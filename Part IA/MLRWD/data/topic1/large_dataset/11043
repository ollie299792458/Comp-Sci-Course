I tried everything, to no avail. When the film begins, it doesn't start with a Menu, where you can choose your options for Subtitles, Extras or anything else. The film automatically starts in French, without Subtitles. Using my remote control, I pressed Top Menu and Voila! a Menu appears at last! On that screen to the left side, is a vertical band in white, listing all the options in black type. There isn't a listed option to view the film with Subtitles in English. The top of this list begins with the Director's Spoken Commentary. To the immediate right of that is a small box, indicating Subtitles in English, or no Subtitles. The options don't move for English at all. UNTIL: I press Enter on the remote for the Director's Commentary, or any other Supplement. Then the smaller box lights up, and I can press the English Subtitles.
 The catch is, the Subtitles only work for the Supplements. You can't begin the film with Subtitles at all, unless you're prepared to listen to the running commentary by the Director. There's no Scene Selection to choose, where you can begin the film with Subtitles. I'm incredibly frustrated. If anyone knows what I'm doing wrong, I'll be very, very grateful for your input. You can write me at my Email address, provided here by Amazon.
 I saw this film in 2009 in L.A., on the big screen. Loved it! Now I hope to see it again on DVD, with Subtitles! Are all these wonderful posted reviews connected to the regular, non Blu-Ray DVD, which I now presume must have a different, easier Menu access? In my frustration, I'm guessing they are!
