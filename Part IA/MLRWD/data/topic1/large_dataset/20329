Of course a straight-to-video sequel is not going to be as polished or professional as the orignal, but even my dog could have written a better set of dialogue to go with the plot to Little Mermaid II.

The music stinks. I understand that for straight-to-video movies they aren't going to hire the big guns to come in and compose an Oscar worthy score, but really, a child could have written better music and more imaginative lyrics. Even children aren't going to take the songs seriously, they are that bad.

The wall thing was stupid, Ariel was almost senile wondering around the castle not knowing where the heck her brat is! Flounder is old and fat, and Prince Eric is a drain on society.

Melody is an ungrateful brat and if my daughter were like her, I would smack her silly. There are far better teenage girl role models who do not fit in that are way more pleasant than she is.

Then we also have the cheap token Timon and Pumbaa pair with the penguin and the walrus.

This movie is for Disney to make some quick cash, and for parents to get rid of having their kids underfoot for 75 minutes (though it might not even be good enough to do that)

It might be worth renting if you get severely drunk before watching it.
