I happened to see this movie in Blockbuster and decided to give it a try.  I didn't see any reviews for it before, and if I had, would have steered clear of it.

Do you like poorly done computer animation?  Then this is for you.  Do you hate seeing characters have facial expressions?  Again, then, this movie is for you.  Do you love really bad voice acting done by people who should have known better, and were probably phoning it in?  Yes, then, this is for you.

The best part of the movie was the end, because at least I could then watch a good movie.  I think there was one point in the film where I chuckled, but that could've just been because my cat rubbed against my foot. I can't be sure.

The plot, such as it was, would have been depressing if you could actually convince your brain to turn back on and think about it.  Apparently, "real" people in this town are stuck in some kind of time loop where they simply repeat events over and over while the rest of the world continues on.  At least, that's the kind of thing I had to think about to make it through this tired attempt at comedy.

It wasn't worth the price of a rental, so you can be sure it isn't worth the price of a purchase.  Consider yourself warned.
