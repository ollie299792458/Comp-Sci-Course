I cut my teeth on Robotech back in the 80's and have been disappointed it's not in syndication anywhere on cable. I jumped at the chance to buy the DVDs when they came out,and they haven't disappointed, really.. 
My 4 year old daughter is currently into Sailor Moon, and I've enjoyed watching the original Japanese versions of the movies on DVD. While I've got to read the subtitiles to understand, the dialogue and inflection is a better match to the action on the screen. I was hoping against hope that these DVDs would include an alternate Japanese version, but they don't. Sure, there are snipets of scenes in other languages, but for my money, that's not enough. 
While the production quality isn't as good as it could be, they still beat the old dusty VHS tapes that I made way back when. Fast forwarding through the commercials was a pain!
All in all, these DVDs are a great trip back to the past, and what's better, the stories still hold up. I just wish the final chapter in the Robotech saga had been completed.. We're still waiting for Rick and Lisa to come back to earth!
