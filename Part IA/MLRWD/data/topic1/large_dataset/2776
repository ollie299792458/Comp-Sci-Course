Warning:  this review contains a spoiler which is the last paragraph.

I love a good romantic comedy, I love Hugh Grant, and I like Drew Barrymore so this movie was a must-see for me.  But it fell flat.  The whole movie just felt so contrived.  But the main problem is that Hugh and Drew, as it turns out, really don't have any chemistry.  I couldn't get into it the movie at all.

I was surprised that Hugh Grant can sing (barely) and the lame-song duet with Cora (the movie's smattering of eye candy) was nice enough.  But buy the soundtrack?  No, you must be joking.

The good things about this movie are:  Hugh Grant (who has all the best lines which were well-written for him) and the fact that there's no cigarette smoking in the movie, as smoking (even on film) is repulsive to me.

To cap off this formulaic movie, it turns into a bad version of The Wedding Singer at the end, with Hugh Grant instead of Adam Sandler pouring his heart out in song to Drew Barrymore.  The scene in Music and Lyrics didn't move me at all whereas the scene in The Wedding Singer melted me.
