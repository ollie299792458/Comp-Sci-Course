I'm glad I rented the set at the video store.

I'll get to the sex part and go back to the rest.

It's a show about lesbians, then why so little sex between the women.  The lesbian sex (primarily with the Marina character and a flaky bi-airhead named Jenny) was non-threatening to any male viewing the show.  And in truth and boyfriend Tim have more sex between them than all the lesbians on the show combined.  I not looking for porn, but just as much passion and lust, and frequency, between the women.  The way the physical relations are between the women, make me think that this show is out to draw a lot of men.

I didn't expect to see stereotype 350lbs. dykes on bikes, but did every lead character have to be fashion model thin.

The stories were weak.  I read a review comparing this show to a soap opera, I think that's an insult to soaps.  This show walks a straight path of mediocrity.

I have HBO and watched The Wire, I also watched Six Feet Under for a while.  There was originality in those shows, L-W is stale from the word go.

BTW Pam Grier is in this show.  Guess she needed the work.  She was a token for 13 episodes-what a waste.
