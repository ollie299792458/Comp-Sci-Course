I love this movie, and refuse to apologize for that. No it's not a first rate horror movie, but it is a first rate science fiction fun fest. I will tell you that when I first watched this movie, back in the 80s as a child, it scared me. Not the "monster in the closet" or "ghost in the attic" or even the "zombies outside my window" scare, it was a whole new tingly kind the "I am afraid to go on the highway or plug anything in" scare. What Jaws did for the ocean, Maximum Overdrive did for outlets and I-75. I remember that before I saw the movie, I saw a Fangoria article about the makeup and effects and I was so excited to see it all in action, there is a good deal of blood and gore, and although its very tongue in cheek and there isn't any Oscar worthy performances I enjoyed all the interactions and dialogue anyway. The AC/DC soundtrack is awesome, and fits the whole killer machine storyline, the sounds of the trucks, and airplanes, and ice cream trucks and lawnmowers and electric knives add their own musical horror throughout.  I also have a soft spot for Emilio Estevez, he has such a presence on screen, his laughter is infectious, and him being in a bloodstained white t-shirt was enough for me to form a lifelong crush on him that still resonates to this day, sick I know but he is just hot. So don't go into this expecting a Horror movie, after all its about aliens who come in the tail of a comet and try to wipe out the human race with the very things we produced with our own hands. Watch it for its campy nature, its murderous walkmans, and Emilio's smile.
