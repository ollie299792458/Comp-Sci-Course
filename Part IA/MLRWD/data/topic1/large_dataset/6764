[Mild spoilers in this review:]

This is a unique movie.  The plot is relatively simple - Toy Store Owner prepares his assistant to take over the business.  There is no villain in the form of a character.  I suppose the "villain," or conflict in the plot, is "lack of imagination."  This is initially personified in the form of a dry, by-the-books accountant, however this character is by no means the villain in this story.  "Lack of imagination" is the force opposing Mr. Magorium and his whimsical store.

I suspect that mainstream America and the critics didn't respond favorably to this movie for two reasons:  marketing this movie was difficult; and much of mainstream America and the critics are guilty of exhibiting the same element that served as the conflict in the movie:  "lack of imagination."

For example, in one scene, the witless accountant finally gives in to others' use of imagination and tries being imaginative himself by wearing silly hats and pretending to be someone else.  He and a young boy act out fairy tale stories and let their imagination run wild.  The boy's mother discovers them and is immediately suspicious of the accountant's intentions.  It's as if the movie is commenting on some people that perhaps don't "get it."  Additionally, as if life were imitating art, there were some people that didn't "get" this movie.

My family (with two kids aged 6 and 3) thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and we could comfortably watch it without fear of "toilet gags" and without anxiety of seeing crude/vulgar moments.  And this movie also effectively addressed the potentially disturbing subject of "death."  I liked the approach here.

Like the characters in the movie, give Mr. Magorium a chance.  And let your imagination flow with the movie.

Favorite line:  "Light bulbs die.  I am departing."
