This movie is a dark and human story about criminals.  At times it hits you over the head with how bad they are, but it also shows you how they got sucked into crime.  It plays on subtle levels by juxtaposing how bad these people are with their human need to justify what they are doing.  All the characters lie to each other and to themselves.  Rarely does the movie spell this out for the viewer.  There is no voice-of-reason or voice-of-morality character to the movie.  It's left to the viewer to put the characters' behavior in a moral context.
The best part of the movie was the scene where Greg was driving Seth back to the office after their colleagues severely beat a man in bar brawl.  Greg criticizes their colleagues for blowing all their money, being violent, and having "no stability".  Just as he is saying this he yells at another driver who is slowing down, and he recklessly maneuvers his Porshe around the slower car.  
Later in the movie Seth, the main character, realizes what he's doing is wrong and tantamount to stealing.  He decides to do the right thing and get out of the criminal firm he works for.  First, however, he wants to find a way to make off with some of the firm's money before leaving.  No one in the movie points out how silly it is that Seth thinks he needs to steal some money now that his morals prevent him from stealing.  
This is very believable behavior for people who have gotten away with crimes so long that they think that they can get away with anything and that it's not really wrong.  Despite what some people have written, the juvenile and criminal behavior portrayed in this movie is not unheard of in the business world.
