I ordered this DVD on-line based on the amazing reviews it got here on Amazon.com without ever having seen it. I have to say, this is a very cute and wholesome story and I'm pleased to add it to my collection. However, I didn't see it as the 5 star film most everyone else did.

First of all- the good points. I thought Andrew McCarthy did a fine job of illustrating a broken widower. He was appropriately "manly" about his pain which was both tender and wrenching. Also, he played a rancher, which of course gave him an ever "manlier" edge. Not comfortable with sharing emotion, he is tough and rough and sharp.

Teri Polo was okay as the New Yorker who travels to the midwest based on a singles ad that her friend answered.

One of the things that bothered me was that neither character could accept the singles ad. Was that not PC enough for America? What's the problem there? She had to have a friend do it and he had to have a sister do it. I thought it would have been nice if one of them were actually responsible for being there. Both made a big deal of rejecting responsibility for wanting to be there. He didn't want her at all (it was a deal with his sister) and she was... what? On a fling to defy her boyfriend?

Long story short- the movie was great in many ways. The scenery was amazing. I loved the substory- the wild horses. (Even though the "taming" method was ridiculous.) I LOVED the sister and her story.

I guess it comes down to the biggest complaint. I felt zero chemistry from the two main characters. It was SO wholesome. I don't want to spoil the ending at all. But basically, I rolled my eyes. I didn't feel it at all or believe it. And trust me, I'm not asking for anything raunchy. (My fave movie is Anne of Green Gables!) But I'm saying I didn't feel the relationship between the two leads was strong enough.
