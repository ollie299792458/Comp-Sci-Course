Colin Farrell as Ray and Brendan Gleeson as Kenny, are marvelously outrageous in this dark comedy. Ralph Fiennes as Harry ("He swears a lot, doesn't he?"), adds his own darkness and humor to this excellent movie. The "Nooks and Crannies" or "Alcoves" dialogue with Ken and Yuri was particularly funny. As was Ray and Harry's conversational "shootout" scene at Marie's hotel.

There were also a few very sad and touching scenes of Ray; flashing back to his accidentally killing an innocent young boy in the church during his assassination of a priest. And the subsequent attempt to take his own life in the park as Ken stops him. Colin Farrell gives a convincing performance as he conveys to Ken, the need to end his life. Kenny in turn, trying to talk Ray out of it, by emphasizing it would serve no purpose and wouldn't bring back the life of the child he took. A real tear-jerker.

Thekla Reuten as Marie, is absolutely gorgeous. As is Clemence Poesy as Chloe, the only thing in Bruges that peaked Ray's interest and kept his mind off the boredom (and the dead boy). Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) the "racist midget" actor, was equally adept to bringing forth his own brand of humor and "off-color" points of view. Yes, there were some pretty bloody scenes in the movie, but not enough to detract from the overall comedy that shone through the darkness of this film.
