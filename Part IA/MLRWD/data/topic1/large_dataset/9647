Jeepers Creepers is one of the scarier movies to come out in the past few years. It may not have had the best storyline, but it was very suspenseful. The plot: Brother and sister (Trish and Darry) are travelling home from college taking the backroads and constantly bickering when they almost get run off the road by a strange truck. Later on they pass this truck parked at an old run down church and see a large person throwing what appears to be wrapped up bodies down a pipe. Soon after passing, the truck takes off after Darry and Trish again, this time running them off the road. At this point, the characters become almost typical naive horror cliches and decide to go back and see what he through down the pipe instead of just getting the heck out of there. The suspense really builds when he enters the pipe and what he finds is very freaky. The film builds a lot of suspense from this point on and doesn't have any real boring parts all the way through and the door is left wide open for the Creeper to become the next horror franchise. Overall I found the story to be ok, but the films ability to horrify is definately strong. 'Jeepers Creepers,' especially the last scene, freaked me out.
