I think the key to enjoying Timer is fully accepting its premise - that, in fact there is one and only one soul mate for each person and that the timer can tell you exactly when you are going to meet.  If you can't accept the premise, you may enjoy the comedic elements, but may not appreciate the thought provoking elements.

If you do accept the premise, it raises a number of questions - should one even get a timer?  How important is it to find a soul mate versus trusting your own instincts?  What if you don't meet your soul mate until your are 65?  How would you treat your relationships until that time?  Would you pursue anything long term?  If not are you just shallow?  What if your timer is blank?  What if you believe you are really in love but your timer says otherwise?  What if you meet your soul mate when your are only 12?  How do you appreciate a soul mate when you haven't lived through other relationships? In the end, do you trust what you feel in the moment or what you know to be "true" based on the timer?

I enjoyed the movie as I watched it and found I couldn't stop thinking about its themes after it was over.  Give it a "watch".
