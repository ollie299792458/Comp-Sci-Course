This movie represents all of the best of Woody Allen.  Irreverent, insightful, hilarious, touching, and beautifully idiosyncratic, this movie has everything a romance, comedy, and great work of cinema needs.  Allen's onscreen persona is better suited to this particular story than any other, and Diane Keaton is one of the most joyous personalities onscreen.  In addition to the wonderfully funny dialogue between the two leads, an abundance of walk-on performances, filled by a remarkable number of future stars (Jeff Goldblum, Sigourney Weaver, Christopher Walken) as well as unknowns, leave us with some of the most enduringly funny scenarios and one-liners in American comedy.  His renditions of New York, Los Angeles, the dating scene, and popular culture are still relevant and comedic.  And kudos to Allen for having the freshness to ask candid questions to people on the street, pull a real-life personality from offscreen, and bicker with the Evil Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

Allen may be guilty of reshuffling the same deck of observations and philosophies throughout all of his movies, but in this and other gems (Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Deconstructing Harry), we see why he's such a big deal.  Annie Hall has more useful things to say about life and relationships than any other movie I've seen.
