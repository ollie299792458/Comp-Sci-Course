First off, I want to clarify that I saw the R rated version, and not the unrated so forgive any incoherent wording here that does not go along with this particular film.
SPOILERS ARE GOING TO BE A COMMAN PART OF MY REVIEW FROM HERE FORTH! DONT READ IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY THE FILM AND NOT HAVE IT SPOILED IF YOU HAVENT SEEN IT!
I sat down on my couch tonight, expecting to flip the TV on and click through the DirecTV guide and see if anything good was on. Well, low and behold, this movie was on Encore, and was the first thing that came on as soon as the television setup came on, and it was right at the opening credits so I didn't miss much. Another thing you have to remember about me is that I am a college male, and the first opening scenes showed some good looking young women, so obviously, I was quickly captivated by it so to speak! I brought up the info menu to see what it was about, and after reading the brief description on the TV guide, I decided to give it a shot and see what it was all about.
About 2 hours later, there I was, mind-blown beyond my wildest dreams. I just couldn't believe what I had just saw! The way the characters were presented had me thinking all the alleged "good guys" like Ray were the protagonist themed characters! Little did I know, in the end, Suzie turns out to be the main protagonist! Not Kelly, Ray, or anybody else. This was what really got me, the film had a twisted way of events leading up to the final ending. It is a good film I think, and had a great cast to boot. I would recommend it to anyone that is into mystery/crime dramas. Only reason I gave it a 4 star rating was not getting to see the lesbian scene between Kelly and Suzie, and the fact that the sudden change of events toward the end really made my mind go crazy for a bit! But all in all, very good, and well thought out movie!
