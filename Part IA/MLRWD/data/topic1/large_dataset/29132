I know Val &amp; Earl, the lead chracters in "Tremors". I played country music professionaly for 10 years and Val &amp; Earl  were at every show. I've ridden in their truck, I've shot their guns, I've watched them  fight and make up and I'm proud to call them friends. As you can guess I  don't really know Val &amp; Earl but the characters brought to life by Fred  Ward and Kevin Bacon are a tribute to the superb ability that these actors  have. My brother and I have watched "Tremors" many times and each  time can't get past the dead-on portrayal of these two guys. Mannerisms,  body language, speech patterns, I saw it all and lost sight of the fact  that Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon were playing roles. "Tremors"  presents a vehicle of such reality in all the character portayals that  believing in the existence of the giant worms isn't such a stretch. It's  almost as if these were your friends telling you a fantastic story about  what happened to them. The naturalness of all the players and the remote  setting lend themselves the suspension of disbelief that is so necessary to  any fantastic story. Also the fact that not every question is answered  makes it seem much more plausible. Much applause goes to all involved for  presenting a tale of terror that doesn't rely on gore as its core, a story  with great humor that doesn't need to turn "blue" to reach you,  and a fable of misadventure in modern life that doesn't leave you depressed  and hopeless. Watch it... It's fun!
