Often critisized as a Hollywood remake of Wings of Desire, its more an updated version made in 1998. This screenpaly was also approved by the original writer/director Wim Wenders. Nicolas Cage stars as Seth an angel  who falls in love with Maggie(Meg Ryan)the cardiac surgeon he  "meets" while taking one of her patients.This movie has a number  of enormous strengths. Firstly, the story is interesting and plausible.  Secondly, the main characters are strong, believable and played to  perfection by Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan. Thirdly, the cinematography is  absolutely stunning. There are some remarkable shots in this movie - there  is often little need for dialogue, as the stunning visual imagery tells the  entire story. Fourthly, the musical score is superb in complementing the  on-screen action.Screenplay by Dana Stevens who also wrote Blink, and For  Love of the Game, Directed by Brad Siberling (Casper)&amp; Director of  Photography John Seale (The English Patient) combine to make one of the  most emotional movies that even a hardened critic cant deny will touch you  in ways that only this special film can.  The DVD Edition is a Collectors  favourite without doubt. The film is almost reference quality presented in  a 2.35:1 Aspect Ratio, combined with 5 Audio tracks, Dolby Digital 5.1 in  English and French, a music only track , and 2 commentaries (both worth a  listen, unlike some). Other extras include a 30 min Making of Featurette,  Deleted Scenes with and without commentary, a Special Effects feature with  John Seale and 2 Music videos. This is truly a Special Edition and other  studios and directors should take note, and make this type of disc the  standard for the future.
