The first three Stone films were awesome.
The next three were quite good.
The latest, Innocents Lost, was a big disappointment.

1) In this latest film they re-use lines from previous Stone films way too much.  It happens so often that it's kichy.  One use would be nice, two...maybe, but this became dumb after a dozen of them.  In this film, a young girl dies and we learn that supposedly, she and Jesse were very close friends in the past.  She calls Jesse her "best friend."  2) I'm all for adding new characters, but this felt forced and thrown in.  Why not just make it one of the young women Jesse was actually friends with in the earlier films??  3) The new chief was not the same actor as the last film when he was interviewing for a job.  That's okay, you can't always get the same actors to return.  But this guy is not even the same character--what happened there?  4) What happened to Molly Crane?  Did I miss something or is she still out of FMLA?  Viewers want her back (or at least we want to know what happened  5) The dialogue (what was a hallmark of these films) seems rushed and shallow in this latest film.  6) But perhaps the biggest disappointment is what's happening to Jesse.  He's a cop who has some problems, but he's always had something special where it really counts.  However, in this film, he is losing this.  The parts of Jesse that are pathetic are drowning out any inner strength he had.  We like the complicated nature of his character (in all the other movies), but if he's made into too much of a looser, we lose sight of his white hat.  When this happens, he's no longer complicated and thus, no longer interesting.
