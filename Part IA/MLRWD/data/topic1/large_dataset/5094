This movie was captivating.  Not because just of the story line, but because of the acting.  I am a huge Denzel fan, but this role casted a different light of his range of acting ability.  We have grown so accustomed to his heroic roles that this was like watching a new actor emerge from the depths of Hollywood.  It is a gripping drama of what goes on in the life of a dirty narcotic cop.  His analogy of the wolf and the sheep made sense.  The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the Vegas gambling situation with the Russian mob.  They could have visually tied that in somehow, maybe as a flashback or something.  Ethan Hawke was a bushy-eyed rookie who had good instincts to be a cop, but sometimes thought too much.  The streets are extremely different that what is shown on TV.  The only way to really know is by "hands on" training.  That's what Denzel was trying to give him.  His knowledge was tested throughout the day and he failed a few times.  Something about the ending didn't sit too well with me, but I couldn't think of any other possibilities.  Overall, it was a good movie.  I would recommend this flick to anyone that is a fan of Denzel and/or Ethan or if you like the dirty cop type of movies.  Guaranteed to be entertaining.
