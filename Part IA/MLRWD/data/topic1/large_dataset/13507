This film is not the worse of the series, that is the next Halloween movie. H-5 was ok before I saw Halloween- Curse of MM, and it explained all the confusing things in H-5. Now I look at H-5 and blame it for creating the trash to come.

The film is not as bad as I am making it sound. It has it's moments of being fun mindless entertainment, but nothing ground breaking or amazing. I think the film was rushed and it shows in the movie. The guy in black running around was just stupid, and the ending sucked to this movie. That is just saying it bluntly. It will have you wondering what the hell is going on. And you discover Michael's tattoo, when did he get that? I didn't like that in the film either. It was almost like they were hinting he was in a cult... oh no...

But if you love the Halloween series, and think you will miss something if you dont see this movie, you wont. You can skip 5 and 6. Halloween Resurrection ignores 4,5,and 6 anyways. But H-5 does have it fun moments, as I said. But don't expect the first three (ignoring H-3) Halloween films.
