This blu ray disk is a nice present for all lovers of the best Rosenkavalier ever filmed. We finally have a wide screen film with English sub-titiles at our disposition. Unfortunately there is not a major improvement in both the picture and sound quality, at least if we compare with the 2001 Reverso Musikproduktions Austrian release that I bought in the Amazon's German shop seven years ago. Maybe it is not possible to make a better job with a 1961 film like this, but Kulture producers could at least have made an effort to introduce further sub-titles for non English speakers. We truly hope that in the next future there will be a European release with a wider choice of languages.

It would be idle to discuss the virtues of the Salzburg Festival performance, most of all if we take into account the high quality of the comments posted by other reviewers. I have been particularly impressed by Paul Poringer's observation on the fact that the Marschallin, as a member of Viennese nobiliy, has to speak High-German with some Viennese dialect colorations, and how Elisabeth Schwarzkopf manages to sing the Countess lines with a perfection that other marvelous singers such as Renee Fleming,Kiri Te Kanawa, Felicity Lott, and even  a German soprano like Anne Schwanewilms, have not been able to surpass. On the other hand, as we all know, Sena Jurinac makes a magnificent Octavian with her wonderful voice and acting; Otto Edelman an arrogant  and  insensitive Baron Ochs, and Anneliese Rothenbergera a beautiful, delicate and charming  Sophie. Can we ask for more?
