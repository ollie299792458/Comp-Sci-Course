While this movie may stand out to some for the inclusion of Seth Rogen, his presence is classy, and the amount of comic relief he provides is pretty perfect and spot on. Apparently the story is based on the real life of a friend of his, so there is a strong basis for how the character of Will (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) acts. The movie really depicts a tough and sad situation (Will's struggle with cancer) while avoiding being depressing, but don't be surprised if you do wind up misty-eyed at a few scenes.

A good buddy story, but Gordon-Levitt does an amazing job of tackling this huge role in a very realistic way.

This story personally hit close to home, as I went through a long-term illness myself (which was not cancer) but dealt with an almost identical medical procedure as he goes through toward the end (not to give anything away). I can tell you the hollowness, the helplessness, and the realizations that while people are there to support you (and you realize who really is NOT), at the end of the day, you really do face medical issues on your own...the treatments, the tests, the surgeries. Very powerful.

The music is incredible. It's a shame that there is no official soundtrack for this, I had to painstakingly piece one together myself, but it was well worth it.

Overall, a great movie. Powerful, funny, sad, beautiful.
