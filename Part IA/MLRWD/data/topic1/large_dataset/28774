Pandaemonium is one of the better films I've seen in a long time.  Some of its themes are much like the ideas (ala Hassan i Sabbah &amp; assassins &amp; hunger for paradise) that have attracted me lately.  It is about the poets Wordsworth &amp; Samuel Taylor Coleridge (who wrote "Kubla Khan").  The exploration of the creative force, mingled with the seeking to see deep into reality is amazing (Coleridge tried to do it with opium, and both succeeded and kind of destroyed himself in the process).  The movie is based on real history but I think it took some liberties to make it a more powerful story.  Coleridge also wrote "The Ancient Mariner," and that poem is incredible, I've even more taken by it to see it so lushly explored in a visual sense in how the idea and language came to Coleridge.  There's some really funny parts too, like a time when they eat datura and almost fall up off the world (or their perceptions convince them they are about to, and then they start playing with it, realizing the joke, but still pretending that they can fall up.)  There's a scholarly literary study on Coleridge published in 1927 called "The Road to Xanadu - A Study in the Ways of the Imagination" by John Livingstone Lowes, a brilliant book, and I wonder if the filmmakers got many of their ideas and details from that book.
