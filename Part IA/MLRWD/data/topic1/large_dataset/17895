I just watched this film, and let me tell you, I would have liked to fast-forward through about half of this thing.  First i'll start off with what's good about this movie, and that is the amazing fighting skills of Tony Jaa.  Unfortunately, the guy couldn't act if his life depended on it.  The story is flimsy, and the movie would have been more interesting if they had just abandoned the plot altogether.  I mean, Tony Jaa's character is supposed to be a buddhist monk?  He has very little virtue, and comes off more stubborn than anything.  Why does it take him so long to rescue the guy fighting in the ring, and why doesn't the guy care about the girl lying there in the apartment about to die of an overdose.  And another thing, the directing was horrible.  I don't need to see every fighting move replayed 3 times in slow motion to see what the guy did.  And then there was that terribly long chase scene right in the middle that I had to fast-forward through.  This doen't compare to the work that Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan have done.  Oh yeah, and even at his age, Jackie Chan could still kick the shi# out of this newcomer.  The only people that will enjoy this film, are drunken idiots that like seeing guys getting their skulls' cracked.
