Ok, so Disney has brought us some movies that are far below par for their prestigous history, but if you think of the history and the image that Disney has always tried to present and the magic it has tried to create for young viewers, then you should be able to appreciate this movie. This movie takes a teen age girl who is going through all the teen angst and drama of not being one of the popular kids and throws her a curve ball...she's a princess! I'm sure you guessed that from the previews, and along those lines can probably guess the entire movie and tell yourself you don't need to go see it because you already know what's going to happen. Fine, think that and miss a fun movie. It's not a blockbuster, but it's good for entertainment and dreaming. Any young girl will love it, and any adult that doesn't go in with their mind set to criticize it will be thrilled. Now as I said, it should be Jr. High, not High School, because the kids in Jr. High are very mean and outwardly cruel to each other whereas the High School kids can be worse, but are more devious and less in your face about it, but all the same I'm sure many of use can think of our school years and sympathize. It address many young issues, and many older ones as she faces what it means to be a princess. Just sit back, and enjoy it!
