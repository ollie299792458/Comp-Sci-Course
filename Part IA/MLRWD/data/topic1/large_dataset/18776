The Hunt for Red October is an excellent movie that still is entertaining today. I grew up after the Cold War (I was alive when the wall fell, I just didn't care), but this film had me on the edge of my seat. The effects have withstood the test of time and even by today's standards are top notch. While most people associate Jack Ryan with Harrison Ford, Alec Baldwin gives Ryan more depth and character than Ford (although he's not as attractive!). Sean Connery, of course, dominates every scene he's in and the rest of the cast across the board give excellent performances. My one fault with Red October is the glaringly obvious plot 'twist' where the first mate is murdered. In the scene in Connery's cabin, the first mate describes the life he hopes to lead in America. I was like 'Oh he's so cute and he's totally going to die!' And, low and behold, boom. Predictable, eh comrade?

Aside from that one nitpick, The Hunt for Red October is a movie that is both timeless and endlessly rewatchable. The film transfers well to DVD, although it is slim on special features. However, the movie itself is worth the price of the DVD. This is a must own movie!
