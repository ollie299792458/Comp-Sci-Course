I bought this series for my wife as a gift at a very good price. She is a huge Cadfael fan and I must admit that I am, too after she dragged me kicking and screaming into watching one of them with her. We had been streaming some of them over Netflixs, and I noticed another reviewer talking about the DVD transfer - to me, the DVD's are far and away superior to streaming them over Netflixs. And it is TV, after all. The purchase arrived promptly and in good order.

Like most of the reviewers, I agree that the episodes with the actor who played the first Hugh Beringer are better as far as that character goes, although Derek Jacobi never disappoints. I also agree with the reviewers who liked the earlier episodes better in general. They were more like Agatha Christie, and as time went on they became less detailed and more artsy. It (almost) makes me want to buy the books, although I have little time for recreational reading.

Having spent some time around clergy in an orthodox church I can tell you that secular priests have as many different kinds of personalities as the monks in Cadfael, but the parts I liked best about these stories is the references to things like "Lauds" and "Compline", which, if you know when they were historically recited, add a great deal to the stories. Also, the altar settings appear to be accurate for both the hourly offices and things like funeral scenes. I was, however, amused at Cadfael's workbench, which appears to be a 19th century woodworker's bench.

My wife is quite an Anglophile and was very interested in how the civil war affected the lives of the population at the time.

In any case, it's great entertainment and you will find reasons to watch them again and again, just in case you missed something.
