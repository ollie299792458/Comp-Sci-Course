I read just about every review on here before buying this video. Ones stating it was a killer workout to the one's where people didn't feel like they got a workout at all. Let me say that I've done just about all of Jillians videos, plus many others. I'm in pretty good shape and try to exercise 5 times a week at least. I've really gotten into doing videos because I live in Boston and we've had a brutal winter so I can't run outside. I loved this video, but I think you have to do the full 40 minutes to really get a great workout, and push yourself. I agree a couple of the circuits are fairly easy, but if they were all as hard as circuit 6 (so hard!) then you'd never make it through the whole video. Plus one of the circuits is a strength one, so you're not supposed to get super winded, but your abs and arms should be working. I also found that with a couple of the lighter circuits I could just work extra hard or double time the moves if I wanted to really work hard that day. And some days I add weights to some of the arm moves. Your workout is what you make of it; anyone who did the full 40 minutes and thought it was easy probably wasn't giving it their all. I'd say if your looking for some good cardio, with a little strength this is a great video. I also bought the Billy's Bootcamp Cardio Inferno the other day; now that was a snooze of a workout. Barely even got breathless! And if you want a good mix of strength and cardio, do the 30 day shred (level 2 or 3) then circuits 4-7 of this video and you'll feel it!
