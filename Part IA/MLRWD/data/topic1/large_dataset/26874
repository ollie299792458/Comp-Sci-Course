cronicas is profoundly moving intense and real

it is a very hard movie to just walk away from

the actor damian alcazar who played the monster was beyond great

if charlize can get an academy award for monster he deserves one just as much for this

what  a role ... how hard must it be to play a role like that

all star latin cast in an excellent package by palm

we were fortunate to view it at sundance

im astonished it didnt win any awards

i guess for most americans its too real to fathom

poverty, people taking the law into their own hands

we like our news in a nice package, just the right sprinkling of human interest

a brutal depiction of horror and corruption by the american media

the money and fame driven chance of stardom

the ugliness that causes bad men to kill and good men to cover the truths

it is so socially relevant in these crazy times we live in now 911, katrina

and now the political system caused france riots not unlike america in the 60s

wow this is a good movie

just saw it for the 2nd time and noticed so much foreshadowing

again, great acting by latin americas top actors and our own john leguizamo

bravo
