Full Metal Jacket is the gritty, psychologically disturbing tale of the process that turns humans into trained killers. The film is essentially diveded into two halves, with the first taking part during marine recruit  training where the would-be soldiers are molded into remorseless killing  machines. The performance by Vincent D'onofrio highlights this intense  first half. The second half follows Private Joker to Vietnam and the combat  of Hue City. Surprisingly, the violence of war pales in comparison to the  dehumanization process and build-up of the recruit training. Despite losing  some momentum(which would have been almost impossibe to keep up) it  completes the story by showing how the training has effected them mentally.  The combat scenes feature great cinematography among the backdrop of  countless  burning buildings. This is a welcome change from the scenery  of the jungle of most nam films. The end is cold, calculated and  surprising, culminating in an extrordinary experience. The film also  contains a unique feel to it, credited to director Stanley Kubrick. The  acting of Mathew Modine carries the film and the now infamous character of  Sg. Hartman make this an unforgetable film. Definitely worth the purchase  for the fact that it can be viewed many times because of its deep layers of  meaning. The Stanley Kubrick Colection also features the origional  cinematic trailer. In short, if you're looking for a film about vietnam  then skip this, but if you're looking for a film about the dehumanization  of war then this classic fits the bill. The film was nominated for best  adapted screenplay and was voted second best picture of the year by the  late critic Gene Siskel.
