The Cat Returns is the sequel for the slow-moving Whisper of the Heart. The link between these two stories is the nattily dressed cat called The Baron. However, this story is much different than the one of Whisper of the Heart.

Haru is the girl in this story. She's a clumsy, stressed-out geek, and basically pitiable. But one day she sees a cat that's about to get hit by a car, and saves him. To her shock, he stands up on two paws, brushes himself off, and then politely bows, thanks her, and leaves!

This is the beginning of Haru's adventure. In the next few days she's showered with mice, cattails, catnip, and even an offer of marriage! In the end she has to confront the King of the Cat Kingdom to get her life back to normal.

The extent of the story is dotted with comedy and lightheartedness. Haru grows up tremendously over the course of time, and in the end we see a girl who's much happier with her life. This is a very enjoyable movie and, regretfully, I liked it much better than Whisper of the Heart.

(I have to say that Peter Boyle did a great job as Muta the irascible, portly cat. He brought the character to life perfectly. Sometimes Muta really makes the movie!)
