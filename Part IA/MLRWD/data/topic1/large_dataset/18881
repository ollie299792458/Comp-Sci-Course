I am not a movie goer. Up unil 3 weeks ago I had been in a movie theater 4 times in the last 30 years. I found myself stuck in town with nothing to do for a couple hours and decided to take myself, alone, to a movie. Something I had never done. The movie selection was based on the next movie to start in this 16 theater multi-plex.  The movie was 50 50, had never heard of it. There were a total of 3 people in the theater which was fine because all I wanted was some alone time.

This movie grabbed me. I don't know if it's the music or the story or what. I have seen this movie a total of 3 times in the last 3 weeks. The last time I went because I was in a panic that it was the last showing in town. I have pre-ordered the DVD.

There is too much of the f-word and reference to a sex act for my taste. But the movie got me. I would go see it again multiple times if it ever came back.  But since over my 3 viewings I shared the theater with a total of 6 other people, I doubt it will be back.  And it won't win any awards, though richly deserved, because of its box office performance.  That's a shame.
