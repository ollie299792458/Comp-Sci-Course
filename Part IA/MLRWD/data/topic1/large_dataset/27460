Better Than Chocolate describes itself in the title... a feel good, laugh a lot movie, BTC will hook you into the plot right from the first scene.  With an incredible array of characters, including a transgendered(male to female) woman named Judy, the movie is funny and heartfelt. The low budget filming makes it seem that much more real and the storyline is excellent, though the acting may be slightly amateur and the dialogue a little cheesy.  The main couple, Maggie and Kim are lesbians, but they represent any other couple going through real-life problems.  Wendy Crewson is wonderful as the lonely, unknowing mother, and she steals at least one of the hilarious scenes.  Anne-Marie MacDonald plays Frances, the boyish owner of Ten Percent books, where only ten percent of the merchandise is books.  Overall, it is a warm, feel good movie, predictable at times but for some reason, I keep watching it, and I find myself crying right along with the characters every time.  Definitely see this movie if it's the last thing you do...
