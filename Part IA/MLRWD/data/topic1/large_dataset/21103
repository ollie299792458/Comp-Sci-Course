Anyone who would watch Hello Dolly now might be confused why it was panned when it was made, particularly Streisand. Looking back it's just like the wonderful fluffy musicals that MGM made in the 40's and 50's, right? Just a bit silly with great sets and music. The problem is that it was made in the late 60's. A cultural revolution had taken place and this seemed quite hokey at the time. I was a kid at the time and thought it myself when I saw it in the theater. It's really a musical a decade too late. Rogers and Hammerstein, Leonard Bernstein and Steven Sondheim had made musicals on very serious topics since then and totally changed the landscape. Streisand was wonderful and played the role the only way it could have been played, broadly with whimsy and a bit of tongue in cheek. Some people hated her because Carol Channing didn't get the role. THANK GOD SHE DIDN'T!!! I've seen Carol Channing on Broadway and she is an unashamed HAM, as subtitle as a volcano, and no singing voice. The only really unfortunate thing about this movie is Walter Matthaus casting, just a very bad match for Streisand. She was a bit young for the role and he seems ancient compared to her. Even so, with the passage of time it's now just another good MGM musical with great music, sets and talent. It's not 'An American in Paris' more like 'In The Good Old Summertime' , Very amusing and beautiful to look at no matter when it was made.
