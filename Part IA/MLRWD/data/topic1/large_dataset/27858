Subsequent to weeks of hysteria that controlled the media publicity at the time of Baise-Moi&#65533;, I went to see the named film and view it in my own right. Based on former-prostitute Despentes&#65533; novel of the same name, the gaunt story follows characters Manu & Nadine and their single-handed fight against the men of France as they go an orgy of murder and sex.
After Manu is raped in a downtown garage by two men, where her friend was also present and treated to the same ordeal, she teams up with Nadine in an underpass of a train station and offers her the chance of wreaking havoc by her side. Nadine accepts and the wafer-thin plot begins to unravel to tragic effect. Sleeping around ad treating men like dirt is where the kicks are found, before callously butchering them in various places from blows to organs to unmentionable to say. A prime example of the films nature is in one of the opening scenes when Nadine is masturbating on her bed to a pornographic film and when her friend enters, she fails to stop. It&#65533;s with that the mentality of the films&#65533; language becomes blindingly clear. Explicit as well as boring, &#65533;Baise-Moi&#65533; (roughly translated to &#65533;Rape-Me&#65533; in English) leaves nothing to the imagination as clear-cut images of rape and other sexual shenanigans are left for us to endure in this hard-core rendition of Ridley Scotts&#65533; 1991 cult road-movie &#65533;Thelma & Louise&#65533;.
Originally filmed in 2000 on a shoestring budget, it took two years for &#65533;Baise-Moi&#65533; to finally reach our screens, although only a short amount of time was spent in England due to many cinema chains refusing to project the reels. Starring real-life porn actresses Anderson & Bach, the reason they were chosen was because they had both been raped for real in the past. Snipped by 7 seconds to excuse a now infamous penetration shot of Manus&#65533; rape scene, the BBFC left the rest in their new plans to relax the guidelines for the cinema industry. Directors Despentes & Tri must have seen that their plot less script and Blair-Witch type photography was nothing more than a would-be, home-made, straight-to-video, shabby porn flick that deserves nothing more than what it gets. But, &#65533;Baise-Moi&#65533; hit the big time breeding on its controversy alone. It should have been a sign to the BBFC when France and liberal countries banned it outright. Cult status looks a promising outlook. You will either love it or hate it.
One of 2002&#65533;s worst.
