Previous reviews have gone on at length about the plot, and made comparisons to other productions, so I'm just adding a few thoughts.
1) Yes, Gene Kelly is jaw-droppingly brilliant in his swashbuckling scenes. I don't think I've ever seen anyone top him, including Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. Unfortunately, he does have a tendency to smirk at the worst possible times, including June Bug's death scene.
2) As some others have suggested, Lana Turner and Angela Lansbury should
have traded parts, altho Lana's fake remorse scene, done with no make-up
and a modified fright wig, is better than I would have expected from The
Sweater Girl.
3) Did Miss Allyson have it in her contract that she would only wear costumes which included a Peter Pan collar? Her outfits are nearly as
funny as the Musketeers, almost all of which were in various shades of
pink, purple and puce. I've seen drag queens on Halloween who were less
flamboyant!
4) Was Robert Coote ever THAT YOUNG??
