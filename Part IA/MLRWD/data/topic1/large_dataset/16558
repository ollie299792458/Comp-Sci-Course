You know I love disturbing and confusing movies but this show takes both those concepts to the extreme. We have here a show about a shy girl who finds herself becoming increasingly fascinated by The Wired(a futuristic version of the internet). 
This in itself is something that many ppl can relate to.
What's different about it though, is that in the show you can actually project yourself into the Wired as a physical entity. 
The show begins with a girl jumping of an apartment building. This grisly event sets the mood for the rest of the show..
What's even more creepy is that a few days later all the girls in her class start getting email from her about how she 'merely abbandoned her body and how she is living in The Wired'. Everyone ofcourse is terribly upset about this but Lain being curious replies to the message...
That's the beginning of a terribly deep, confusing and fascinating tale. 
The overal question in the series is wether or not Lain is a real girl. Other topics covered are "what is reality" and "what exactly is God".
This isn't a cutesy and simple anime like Pokemon. this is how anime should be. Deep and intelligent. This makes you think and ponder about life. Plus it gives some interesting perspectives on what the internet is.
Highly reccomended
