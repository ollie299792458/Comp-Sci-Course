I hate to go against the flow (... did that sound convincing?), but I simply can't share in the general enthusiasm that Lodoss War seems to elicit amongst most viewers.  I was very much looking forward to seeing it given its outstanding reputation, but after doing so...well, whether the set was worth fifty bucks seems highly debatable.
Let's ignore the fact that somebody involved in the production of this series was obviously a reeeeeeally big fan of the Dragonlance Chronicles.  After all, that series is something of a fantasy classic; that Lodoss War shamelessly rips off large segments of the DLC story would not make it a bad thing--as long as it was entertaining.  
And that's the kicker: LW just isn't very much fun to watch.  Characters in anime don't have to be hugely deep to be likable, but most of the ones here are just blank slates who never really make up in charm what they lack in depth.  There are exceptions (Slayn, who looked cool enough to render any criticism moot; the berserker and his paramour; some of the villains), but it's really not enough, especially when there's something of an air of pointlessness about the whole story, culminating in a confused mess of an ending consisting largely of pointless combat with no real relevance to anything.
As far as fantasy anime goes, I'm sticking with Slayers, and that's my final answer. Lodoss War isn't wholly without merit, but in the end, anyone wanting more serious fare would do better to pick up copies of the DL Chronicles--more entertaining, and a helluva lot cheaper.
