This tepid remake of the cult classic "I Spit On Your Grave" is the very dictionary definition of the phrase "no reason to exist". The original is better in just about every conceivable way; from the low budget gritty quality, to the very plot itself, Meier Zarchi's original movie is so much better than this wanna-be torture porn entry that it renders THIS movie absolutely pointless. If you're going to watch one version of this film, make it the original, and save yourself the aggravation of the added stupidity that this rock-dumb retelling piles on by the barrel. I'd give specific examples, but I don't think Amazon allows that much room.

As for the Blu-Ray quality....that's actually moot here because movies like this one are actually better served by looking older and grittier, hence another advantage the original has over this "too slick by a MILE" remake. I just wonder when Hollywood is going to learn that when something becomes famous because it's sleazy, dirty feel makes people feel gross for having watched it, the right idea is NOT to then gloss up and beautify that film and remake it to look like a billion bucks....part of the appeal is the "grindhouse" look and feel, which is absolutely absent from this movie.
