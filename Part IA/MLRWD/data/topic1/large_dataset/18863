First of all let me tell you that this is nowhere near the Nightmare Before Christmas. That is true. So, if you are expecting the same depth, musicality, etc., you won't possibly like it. However, still I really think it is a great story. The animation is as good as Nightmare Before X-mas (Tim Burton, right!). However, there are only a few songs I really liked (the main theme song and the jazzy song that explains the story of Corpse Bride), so it is really nothing compared with Nightmare Before Christmas. As I said, it is still great, it even made me cry at the end.
The disc also comes with a lot of extras which is nice: from the production of the puppets to how the animation done, how the voice actors dubbed the animation, and Tim Burton's explanation of the whole thing.

I am repeating this once more because it really will affect your judgement: if you have watched and loved Nightmare Before X-mas, you will most probably love this one too, but just don't expect what you get from Nightmare Before X-mas. If you like this kind of animation, I really recommend this one.
