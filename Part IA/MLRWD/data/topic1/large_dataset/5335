I'm not buying this ladies story. The canvas this thing is painted on is worth a couple hundred bucks, so it is unlikely that any thrift store is going to sell it for five bucks. The funny thing is the old lady trucker, Teri, can't even prove where she bought it from because the "thrift store" looks like it's been closed for about a million years.
She's already been caught making up one elaborate lie after another in regards to the origin of the painting so any thing she says now becomes automatically suspect.
The real reason Teri is so willing to invest so much money and go to such great lengths to prove this painting is a Pollock is because she already knows it is.  If someone offered you nine million dollars for a painting that looks like it was done by a messy preschooler, would you turn it down? She knows how much this painting is worth and she's not willing to accept anything less.
In my opinion this painting was more than likely stolen from one of Pollocks early studios. As the film points out, Pollock, a hardcore alcoholic, was less than vigilant when it came to protecting his art work.

I don't know how she came to possess the painting, I seriously doubt she bought it from a thrift store. It's more likely that it was passed along to her by a relative or an acquaintance, someone who knew the thief. As the forensic evidence shows it's clearly a Pollock. A Pollock fingerprint is a thousand times better than a Pollock signature.

Anyway, that's my conspiracy nut theory.
