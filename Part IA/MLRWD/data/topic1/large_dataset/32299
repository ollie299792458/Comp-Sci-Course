It was postwar America.  Frank Capra, a legend in his own time, read a short story entitled "The Greatest Gift" by Phillip Van Doren Stern. With his team he wrote a screenplay based on the story, and It's A Wonderful Life was born.

There was a great deal of excitement on December 20, 1946 as the finished film premiered at New York's Globe Theatre. Reviews were mixed.  Perhaps it was because of the postwar mentality.

Audiences did not embrace it in the winter of 1947.  It did not break even at the box office. A fantasy film with so much wholesomeness was a bit hard to swallow after years of war with wounds still so fresh.

It was nominated for 5 Academy Awards (Best Actor, Best Film, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Sound).  The postwar drama, The Best Years of Our Lives, would take all the awards and all the praise as well as being the top grossing film.  Frank Capra did receive the Golden Globe for director.

As things tend to be over time, It's A Wonderful Life found a new audience and new generations on television in the 70's and 80's, even though the film copies were poor and edited badly.

Now in its restored version, it is viewed as the holiday favorite in December.  NBC has exclusive rights for its showing.

This 2 Disc DVD has a colorized version as well as the pristine black/white. The black and white version gives a vivid life to the characters and Bedford Falls.  There is a nice tribute to Frank Capra in this set.

It is a story of hope, love, redemption, and simple goodness.

If you had to choose as a neighbor and friend George Bailey or Henry Potter, who would be your choice? I think we all know people like Bailey and Potter. Of course, we all know a place like Bedford Falls.

I hope this brief history of the film has been of value to you.  I did not see the point in repeating what had been written about the characters and story.

Happy holidays!
