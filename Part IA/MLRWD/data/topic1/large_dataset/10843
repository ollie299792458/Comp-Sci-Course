I had a geat aniticipation about the movie as the previews seemeed to advertise with actions packed & intrigue... Great movie like this reminded me of D. Washington astonished performance in drama "Man of Fire" as far as acting goes. His performance here is no precedent not discarding other great cast-actors in this film were also perfect.
I give a 4 stars for the production itself as far as editing, casting and a minus one for the plotline coherence. I'd agree that the end was non-sense as far as seeing a deceased back from nowhere. The Fed's project Sat surveillance is cool as far as it parameters what it has access-datas-to, but foreseeing through walls and no-data-access angles is kind' of too unreal even to produce, and that mixed with time travel element. There's too much datas to reconcile into one data-work as seen in the movie.
The fact that the program could actually time travel could be too unrealistic, I think the end just shattered the whole plot apart and contradicted itself. Carlin should have been left dead, and that would of wrapped up the whole story line as if as nothing ever happened. In that, the only changes done, was Carlin's death and the terrorist's mission demise, but that nobody would ever know about but his other dogg who helped him out. Then, that would make the whole time travel idea more credible.
However, I give credits to the production as a whole, the director Tony Scott's guidance unshooked. I recommend the film but wished the end didn't violate the borrowed time tangent with Carlin's reappearance.
However, as a fan, with D. Washington acting just minimized the whole prejudice...
