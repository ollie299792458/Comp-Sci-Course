I'm the world's biggest Rat Pack fan, so I'd have been partial to this movie anyway.  And it is, essentially, a mediocre (if very good-looking) effort.  Still, it's given "platform shoes" by two SUPERB performances--by Joe Mantegna as Dean Martin and Don Cheadle as Sammy Davis Jr.  Also very impressive are Angus McFadyen's performance as Peter Lawford (a very subtle performance) and William Petersen's dead-on impersonation of JFK (you can't even tell it's William Petersen!).

As for Ray Liotta as the Chairman of the Board--granted, he really doesn't act or sound or look like Sinatra.  And his looks and demeanor are too young and petulant for the role of the mature Francis Albert.  But he is very good, nonetheless.  The problem is, Sinatra's looks and sound are too well-known, and the fact that Liotta can't even approximate them is too great an obstacle.  Martin's and Davis's looks and sounds are well-known, as well, and Mantegna and Cheadle aren't Xerox copies of the originals, granted, but they SUGGEST them with sufficient deftness that, at times, it's really hard to tell the difference.
