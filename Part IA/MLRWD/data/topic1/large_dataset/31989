There is nothing more comforting for a film viewer then to be in the hands of a master. unless it is to be in the hands of a master so confident of his abilties that he stops pushing, lets up on the throtle and just lets tumble out of him the instinctively great within him.
In to catch a thief you have a hitchcock at the hieght of his carreer, in between cinematic triumphs, and endowed with stars, and settings to compliment his impecable style. In thier roles of support in hitchcock movies actors and settings can easily be thought of as the orchestra undergirding the soloist in a brilliant violin concerto. In the case of to catch a thief the soloist has decided to let up on the more histrionic flourishes of his technical skill (which are always welcome but not always needed) and really let his orchestra shine without sacrificeing one iota of his own virtuosity.
You can definitely see hitchcock at work in this movie which one might guess would detract feom such relatively light subject matter but what actualy happens is that his ability with mood and suspense serves to bouy the subject matter far above the level of its tonal companion pieces.
His use of camera, music, economy of dialogue, veiled eccentricity of character really take the engine of the exotic romantic comedy and lifts it far beyond where had ever been before or is likely ever to go again.
Then of course there is, grace kelley...nuff said.
