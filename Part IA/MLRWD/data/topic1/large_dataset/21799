I'm shocked by all of the bad reviews of one of my FAVORITE films of 2001 (up there with "Mulholland Dr.," "Ghost World," and "Memento)... The story is redicously cheeky (which is always a good thing) and not pompous and superficial , like "RHPS." The music and the music scenes outshine anything "Moulin Rouge" attempted to do ... The acting and phototgraphy are beyond expectations for a LOW-BUDGET stage adaptation. My only problem is the storytelling. It has so many plot holes, is so short, and leaves so much to question, like how did Hedwig meet Yitzag? (which is explained in a deleted scene, that really shouldn't have be left out, on the DVD), What happens to Hedwig after the end of the film? Will (s)he ever regain he(r) career? Where did the Angry Inch (the band) come from? Do any members of the band have a persona? What happens to Tommy? Will he and Hedwig get back together? What happens to Hedwig's mother? What happened to the Korean wives? Does Hedwig win the lawsuit? These may sound off-the point compared to the deep "Origin oflove" themes of the film, but they still linger even after the metaphysical finale. While I still prefer the stage version for the obvious reasons of rapport and better live music and storytelling, the films still surpasses all expectations...
