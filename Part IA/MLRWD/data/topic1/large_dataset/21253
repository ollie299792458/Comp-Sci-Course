This is my first review, so please bear with me...

I read the reviews before purchasing this movie, so I knew what I was getting into.  Based on the reviews and the product description, I figured this movie would be similar to "Bridges of Madison County", but with younger actors and a diffrent orientation.  I was very pleastantly surprised at how right I was and how moved I was by this movie.

While I agree, some of the realism is a bit of stretch, I can attest that a love like this can happen this quickly, and be lost as quickly.  While I didn't find these actors terribly attractive and the characters were not as developed as I would have hoped, I totally bought their attraction and their passion.  I was moved to tears at the end and found myself hoping that at some point in my life, I will be lucky enough to have a love that strong.

I did get a bit lost in the supporting characters - never really figured out who Shane was and how he was associated - and those characters could have been developed as well.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie for its touching and tender story, nice scenery and emotional connection.
