Splendor in the Grass is a poignant love story set in a small Kansas town in the late 1920's. Two high school students, Bud (played by Warren Beatty) and Deanie (Natalie Wood)are hopelessly in love. Bud is the son of the richest man in town; Deenie is the daughter of the local butcher. Both of them are saddled with parental expectations that come close to destroying their lives.  Bud's father wants him to have the Ivy League education that he never had despite the fact that Bud wants nothing more than to marry Deanie and be a rancher; Deanie's mother wants her to stay a virgin (a "good girl") until marriage no matter what. On a deeper, more universal level, the film is about how we survive when our dreams are shattered.  The title comes from a verse in a poem by William Wordsworth that states, in part, "though nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower, we will grieve not but rather find strength in what remains behind". The film was written as an original screenplay by one of our greatest American playwrights, William Inge.  He makes a cameo appearance in the film as a chaplin.  The stars and supporting cast (particularly Deanie's mother and Bud's father) are excellent. This is a movie which never fails to make me cry and in spite of that or because of that I never miss the opportunity to watch it. Highly recommended.
