A FEW GOOD MEN was even better than I expected. I thought Tom (Cruise), Jack (Nicholson) and Demi (Moore) gave dazzling performances. This movie REALLY deeply and made me feel good. The most moving thing about it was the trial. This was because two Marines (whom I thought Wolfgang Bodison and James Marshall portrayed very movingly) were on trial for their lives. I got a little scared at some parts. I especially love the march that played at the beginning and end of the movie. My favorite quote of this movie is, "AAAAA. I'm sorry, your time's run out. What do we have for the losers, judge? Well, for our defendants, it's a lifetime in exotic Fort Leavenworth. And for defense counsel Kaffee... that's right... it's a court martial! Yes, Johnny! After falsely accusing a highly decorated marine officer of conspiracy and perjury, Lieutenant Kaffee will have a long and prosperous career teaching typewriter maintenance at the Rocko Club School for Women. Thank you for playing 'Should We Or Should We Not Follow The Advice Of The Galactically Stupid?'" I laughed my head off at that quote! This is a REALLY good courtroom drama. Having said that, I give A FEW GOOD MEN three out of four stars.
