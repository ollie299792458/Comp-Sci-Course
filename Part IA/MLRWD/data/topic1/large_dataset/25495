I've been a TransFan for as far back as I can remember.  I remember the good old days, watching Optimus Prime beat the living snot out of Megatron, and then reliving the battles with my worn out action figures...yes, those were the days.  Sadly, Transformers slowly faded from the airwaves and store shelves, and I was forced to move on to other hobbies.  Fast forward to the mid-to-late 90's.  I was entering middle school, and it was now that I heard some shocking news.  Transformers was returning in a new series known as "Beast Wars".  Needless to say, I was skeptical about the quality at first.  I wasn't too sure I liked the new designs, and to have all of my favorite Autobots and Decepticons scrapped was quite a gamble.  But then I saw the series premiere...and I was hooked.  The blend of CG action and amazing characters was magical.
As great as season 1 was however, season 2 blew it away.  These episodes contain the maturation of Transformers for a new audience.  From political trechery to death, the topics were a lot more complex and powerful.  This season contains the now classic "Code of Hero", which successfully killed off one of the most popular characters in the series while creating some of the most well crafted diologue in animated history.  Also contained in this season is the 3 part masterpiece known as "The Agenda", finally linking everything back to Generation 1 Transformers and giving the season a finale that is not often seen.  This is not only the best season of Beast Wars, but one of the greatest sets of animated features available, second only to the classic Generation 1 cartoon.  I don't think I need to say it, but I will anyway.  Buy this set.
