'Burnt Offerings' Is an excellent shocker... one of which you don't see now days.. I just had to give it the highest rating because.. I was truly terrified by the Chaffer in this movie... I thought I was the only one that had this problem till I read the other reviews... This guy is the most scarey image in any movie I have ever seen.. I don't know who he is.. and what it is about him but I get chills just thinking about him.. I can see his face and smile and glasses and hat.. the whole 9 yards and it terrifies me... 
Watch this movie for a big scare.. and don't go into it thinking about it being some gore-fest or some monster special effects movie.. because its not.. and thats what makes it all the more better.. Im glad to see other movies going back to their own roots when we all acually knew what sheer terror was... Evil People as Evil Imagery, Scarey Surroundings,Real Feeling Terror, and A Haunted House (?!?!!!??) .. It is all here.. and it has a ending to die for... 
*If anyone out there has had the same problem with being scared to death from this man (the Chaffer) contact me... cause your not alone.. and I would love to talk about it...
Later and Happy Haunting...
