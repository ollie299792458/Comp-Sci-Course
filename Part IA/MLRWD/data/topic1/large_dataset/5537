I've watched this movie three times just this week. It's going to be one of those movies I can watch again and again. The casting is marvelous as Owen Wilson as a man, Gil Pender, who glorifies 1920 Paris and all the literary greats who at one time or another, lived there. While in Paris on a midnight stroll at the stroke of midnight, a car shows up and takes him to a most extraordinary party, in attendance are The Fitzgeralds (Zelda and Scott) and Cole Porter who belts out tunes at the piano. Gil Pender is a screenwriter wannabe novelist who would rather live and work in an attic office in Paris than marry and move to Malibu like his snotty fiance, Inez (Rachel McAdams) would prefer and this party blows him away. Later he meets, (an amazing likeness of) Ernest Hemmingway, Gertrude Stein, and Picasso. He also rubs elbows with Dali, who is magnificently played by Adrian Brody (my favorite part of the film) and many other artists and writers from the 1920s. Woody Allen has created a work of genius in this understated film.

As Gil's personal relationships grows with the greats of the past, he comes to some realizations of his present life. For a while he bounces back and forth between his current vacation in Paris and Paris in the Golden Age. This is really a neat film and if you enjoy stories of such as A Moveable Feast, you will really enjoy this lighthearted comedy.

I enjoyed all of the performances in the movie and found the cast to be amazing and the script first rate. This is a really charming movie and I haven't been that interested in Woody Allen's movies in the last ten years or fifteen years, but this one has the old magic. It's like Manhattan in the way that you can watch it more than once.
