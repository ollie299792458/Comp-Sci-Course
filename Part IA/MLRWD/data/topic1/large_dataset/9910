Tornatore has made another wonderful evocation of Sicily during the war years.  This time a young teenager fixates on a gorgeous young woman who becomes a widow and falls into destitution and prostitution in his small town, all under the envious eyes of the women of the village -- and the salacious gaze of the men.  Only the boy sees through the gossip and follows her as she slowly loses her respectability and he becomes her guardian angel.  
This beautiful film has many similarities to Cinema Paradiso, and many scenes that harken back to Amercord, especially in the secondary scenes of the boy with his family.  Malena, the film, also contains an ending strong in emotion that leaves the audience enraptured and grabbing for handkerchiefs.
Once again, Tornatore spins a tale of yearning, tragedy, forgivenes, and remembrance that takes its place square in the middle of the great stream of fine Italian film stretching back to Open City.  If it doen't quite reach the heights of Cinema Paradiso, Malena remains a totally satisfying, tender, and highly emotional film that will delight any filmgoer looking for the finest in cinematic art.
