The back cover of this video proclaimed the movie as being a lot different to all of 'those teen slasher films' that you're so very sick of.  I guess you could say it was, but that is not to say that it was a fine piece of cinematic art!
You would think it was a blessing to receive a premonition of your death, and subsequently avoid that fate, also saving several of your classmates.  But no.  Death has been cheated and he is not happy about the situation.  So the Grim Reaper goes about claiming these 'lucky' teenagers in its own creatively gross ways, proving that it is more than just a force to be reckoned with.
A couple of the death scenes are laughable for how ridiculous they are.  This movie doesn't know whether it wants to be supernatural in a realistic way (such as The Sixth Sense) or just a bit far-fetched and crazy.  This is its downfall.
This may sound a little far-fetched itself, but I found the movie a little depressing.  I mean, these people just knew they were going to die, and that the form of their demise wouldn't be pretty.  Thus, the characters spent their whole time fearing death, concerning themselves over who was 'next'.  I don't like to think or worry about death, so this, to me, was the one disturbing aspect of the movie.
But hey, the guy who plays Stifler in 'American Pie' was a pleasant surprise to see.  I didn't know he was going to be in it!!
It is a good movie to watch for a bit of fun - it will make you jump, yet at the same time... I am still sick to death of teeny slasher films! (Modern ones anyway)
