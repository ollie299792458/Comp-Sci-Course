I like a good action flick, especially period pieces with lots of sword fights and axes flying, dismembered limbs and gushing blood, like in the Lord of the Rings movies.  Here is a movie with none of that, except in the emotional and verbal sense.  I didn't think I would like all that talking and lack of action, but I couldn't stop watching this film!
  The screen writer uses words as filet knives and we get to watch the English royal family cut each other to ribbons before our eyes! It is frightening and, at times, hilarious.  The manipulation and back stabbing are stunning.
  All the actors are terrific as King Henry (Peter O'Toole) and Eleanor of Aquitaine (Katherine Hepburn), his normally imprisoned wife, try to determine which of their three conniving sons will sit on throne once Henry dies. I've never had so much fun watching people skewer each other with words.  This is the best movie of its kind, with dialogue exceeding that found in Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf and even All About Eve.
  A top rate script with a top rate cast equals a very enjoyable time.  Absolutely riveting.
