I hated GH: NightShift. No! I dispise GH: NightShift and everything about it, but for the saving grace of Kimberly McCullough ( Robin ). Practicly everything Guza and his crew wrote for Robin, did to Robin and how unattractive tptb attempted to have Robin appear was horrible BUT failed because of Miss McCullough's undeniable talents as an actress. Miss McCullough shines no matter how bad the writing is and delivers no matter how awful the circumstances are. She is a true talent and a real beauty that cannot be denied or tossed aside. Kimberly McCullough( Robin Scorpio ) is a daytime legend, anyone whose grown-up with her and her character can atest to that. Guza and his crew really need to wake up and realize that trying to distroy Robin Scorpio on NightShift or on GH is one of the biggest mistakes he can and will ever make! Her fans and the loyal "Scrubs" fans WILL NOT STAND FOR IT. And if he and Frons want the ratings to rise than they should stop trying to hang Robin & Patrick out to dry.
