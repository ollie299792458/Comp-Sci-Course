GREATEST Peter Pan of ALL TIME!!!  When I told my family/friends that I finally received this, my cousin put it best, "It's our childhood!"  And it truly is!  My parents had recorded this as it played on TV on their very first VCR.  I remember watching it over and over when I was 3.  Apparently, my grandparents had also recorded it on their VCR at their house, because my cousins and I watched it over and over when we would stay at their house, too.  I knew the entire show by heart.  Each and every song.  There was no other Peter Pan.  I didn't even like the animated Disney version as much...I still don't, and I'm a Disney fanatic!  When the Cathy Ribgy version came out, I was hopeful, and my hopes were dashed.  I mean, I knew nothing could be as good as Mary Martin, but I thought it would compare.  It just doesn't.  Mary Martin is the epitome of what an actor should be.  As my cousin put it, "it's our childhood."

As far as the VHS goes, it was in excellent quality.  The picture was clear.  The sound was clear.
