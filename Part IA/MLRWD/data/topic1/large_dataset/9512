The first time that I saw this movie was in the 7th grade. I own the DVD now and everytime I see it I find something new to pay attention to. This isn't a movie for everyone. You either love it or hate it. I have many reasons for liking this movie:

1. It is a love story, and not just a run of the mill love story, but a great one. I am mush when it comes to this type of stuff.

2. I see beauty in ruoghness, destruction, pain, misery, and tragedy. By placing it in a modern time the effect of the roughness is much greater for me than it would have been in period costume. I think that the director did an amazing job in adapting the story to the modern scene.

3. Along with the roughness comes the contrasting beauty of love and of Romeao and Juliet. Esthetically, both DiCaprio and Danes make a beautiful pair. The acting could have been better, but this is not to say that it was bad. Just subpar.

4. Mercucio was amazing.

5. The old English hit me hard the first time I saw it. It didn't quite fit at first but after half the movie I got so used to it that after the movie I was speaking old English myself. Actually, I shouldn't call it old English since Shakespear is considered to have written in modern English. A technicality. I liked the contrast.

Overall, I loved the contrasts in this movie. They lingled my senses. Like I said, this movie is not for everyone. Some people are traditionalists and they might not like the modernization of the movie. On the other hand, this movie opens up the world of Shakespear to a crowd that would not have paid attention otherwise. I personally think that the movie was done beautifully. I think that maybe I would look at it more as I would at a painting than a movie. But it depends what you like. This movie is graphic and violent. Maybe a bit overly violent. I like that. Others might not. Make sure that you know what you are getting before watching this movie.
