...This is a Classic film starring Errol Flynn, David Niven, and Basil Rathbone.
It takes place during WWI in an airfield somewhere in France, and deals with the changes in attitudes that come with increased responsibilities..

...Rathbone is the Flight Commander, angry at his superiors for ordering him to constantly send out green pilots on certain suicide missions, and upset with his best pilots, Errol Flynn and David Niven, for disliking him because he has to order them to take out these new pilots and watch them get killed dawn after dawn.

...In spite of that, Flynn and Niven break the rules and enjoy themselves to the fullest between missions, something that Rathbone cannot engage in due to his position and rank, and he has a love/hate relationship with them for their
cavalier attitude of seasoned combat pilots who realize that any day could be their last.

...The tables get turned when Rathbone gets promoted to headquarters, and has the pleasure of handing over the command position to Flynn. The shoe is on the other foot kind of thing. Very Quickly, Flynn becomes the same character as Rathbone became under the burden of responsibility, and Niven becomes the Flynn character, despising his best buddy for making him take out green pilots to see them die on each mission.

...The plot gets more complicated when Niven's younger brother turns up one day as one of the green pilots...but you will have to watch the movie as I wont spoil it here by telling you the rest.

...This is classic Flynn...dashing, young, handsome and reckless...with plenty of lighter moments between him and Niven, who gives an outstanding performance in this role. It is a buddy movie with serious undertones, enhanced with some great flying sequences and biplane dog-fights.

...It is easy to watch this film and see it as the grand-daddy of modern adventure films like Indiana Jones, set against the carnage of the Great War.
