I loved this movie.  I think that any movie that stimulates emotion is great.  There are not many movies like that anymore.  I found myself laughing, crying (really crying), and feeling filled up inside during this movie.  It was worth every single cent I paid for it.  This movie, the actors and directors should receive awards for this one.  People from every walk of life can relate to Antwone Fisher's experience.  So many people find themselves in the same position.  I especially loved it when Antwone Fisher walked back into his aunt's home after seeing his natural mother and finding all his elder relatives there.  That was simply GREAT!  I also admired the respect given to his natural mother even though he was angry with her.  Honor thy Mother and Father....  Also, the way he handled his foster mother and the women that molested him as a child was awsome!  I also admired the effect that his relationship with the psychiatrist (Denzel Washington) even provided a source of healing for the good doctor.  Even though Antwone was attaching himself to the doctor's family, the doctor (and his wife) were also attaching themselves to Antwone.  Thereby allowing the doctor to recognize his own short-comings.  I think that people are able to relate to others better and have a better sense of self when they know from whence they came!  Hence, I was pleased to see that Antwone Fisher was able to forgive his mother and move on with his own life.  I highly recommend this movie.
