But my problem with this set if the image quality.  The rhino appeared to be taken from film masters or original negatives, and this looks like it was taken from the old video masters.

Some scenes seemed to be having lots of noise around characters, like artifacting or something not sure what term to use.

So there are positive and negative things to say about this release.  The animation really is not up to dvd quality though if taken from 1980's broadcast mastered that were interlaced.  So now i understand why there is no blu ray release as some have asked for because these are digitally cleaned up versions of what you had on vhs.

Me personally i would like to have the old rhino release again that i used to own and gave away.  That release with fixing the animation errors and audio fixed would have been the definitive version.

You know some transformers fan will take bot dvd and produce for themselves the ultimate version.

The audio seems a bit off too because they made a monaural track into fake stereo.  I would have preferred two channel mono instead of playing around with the sound levels and trying to force stereoization where none existed in the digital realm without having access to the original audio master session multi track tapes.

Optimus Prime's voice lacks the bombast i remember from the original broadcasts.  In one scene he sounded like his voice was sped up or something like i was watching a pal masterered dvd instead of ntsc.
