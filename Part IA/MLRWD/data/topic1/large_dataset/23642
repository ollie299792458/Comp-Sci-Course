This is a wonderful, heartwarming story starring Megan Follows as AnnE  an orphan that goes into this imaginary place in her heart with a window friend to comfort her as she endures a not so nice foster mom who works her hard and then when her husband dies suddenly, blames Anne and sends her back to the orphanage. Mistakenly, she is then sent to go and live with the Cuthberts and her real journey in life begins. She can talk the "hind leg off of a calf" and changes names of things to suite her fancy. She was supposed to be a he (meaning a boy) who was sent for to help work the farm. So upon arriving her hopes are dashed because she found the place an unbelievable, georgeous place to call home, but found she would be leaving the next morning to go back to the orphanage because she was a girl. But...I will leave the rest for the viewer to watch as a wonderful story begins. This is one of the best classic movies of all time and can you believe it is squeeky clean. All members of the family can watch without having to be embarrassed because of a scene that pops up. A very enjoyable movie that leaves you feeling good.
