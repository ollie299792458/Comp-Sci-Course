Darby O'Gill & the Little People is a lovely "family" movie.... BUT  only for a family with NO "wee ones".  The "banshee" who appears in the last half of the movie is  a green ghost-like flowing female apparition with no face, that flies at people and screams, literally "like a banshee" .  She shows up several times. Her appearance is something akin to a death angel.  The person she "gets" is going to die next.  It was VERY terrifying to my 5, & 7 yr old boys, and they ran from the room crying.  My 8yr olds bolted from the room right along with them , but didn't seem to be upset about it afterwords.  (No insistance on a night light or bad dreams, like the younger two)  My 10 yr old didn't seem to have any problems and never left the room.  Afterwords he did want to discuss how on earth they filmed the flying green ghost lady.  I think the technical details reassured him that it wasn't "real" and he had nothing to fear.

The other scary point in the movie is the "death coach" which  is a well appointed black stage coach pulled by all black horses with a driver who is conveniently lacking a head.  The coach gallops down from the clouds to collect the person who is dying.  Nothing a small child wants to see or think about.  Even so, without the banshee, I think the kids could have handled the death coach.  Once the deceased is inside the coach, you can see the person is comfortable and not afraid.  Of course the coach doesn't scream like a banshee either.

As an adult, I loved the movie.  It was like many older movies,  perhaps a bit predictable, but sweet and enjoyable.  The "good people" win and the ending is happy.  I would say for the age 10 and up crowd it makes a good family movie - but spare your younger folks.  It will just cause them tears and bad dreams - which probably means you aren't going to get a good night's sleep either.
