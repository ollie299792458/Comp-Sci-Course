I waited until now to watch the new Hulk movie.  Figgered a remake so soon after the last Hulk movie would be as close to straight to video as one could get.  However, the idea of Ed Norton playing half the lead character intrigued me.  I consider him one of the best actors of this generation - always convincing without overpowering his roles.

I am certainly glad I did watch this film. The pace was perfect - I loved rooting for the Hulk and despising the General.  My favorite part of the movie was its plug for the old show and especially seeing Lou Ferrigno treated with such respect.  For that alone it would get the five stars, but then they threw in a few more twists that just cracked me up.  A "stark" contrast from the seriousness of the previous movie!

So, over a hundred something reviews here... I am just adding my two cents and thoughts that this is a movie that you will enjoy watching, even with the kids!

I highly recommend!

All the best,

Jay
