I can't believe this movie eluded me for so long. I've seen all sorts of horror movies... slasher, goth, psychological, and zombie flicks. However, Fallen is easily one of the best I've ever seen. Seriously, I'd put it up there with The Exorcist,The Silence of the Lambs, and Se7en. Even though it clearly has religious themes in it, religion is not an important factor in order to enjoy the movie. Denzel Washington does an excellent job at portraying Detective Hobbes, who is bent on trying to find a copycat of the serial killer Reese. But we soon find out that Hobbes is not hunting a copycat serial killer, but a demon called Azazel, who can jump from person to person simply by touching them, which he uses to taunt and toy with Hobbes. Through discovering a person who Azazel possessed in order to kill people, he found a cop who sent out to kill him, but ultimately failed. He meets his daughter, an angelologist. Together, they try to find a way to kill Azazel. There's more to it than that, but that's all I'll get in to so as to not spoil it.

The last 15 or so minutes of the film are some of the most powerful I've seen in any film. The action, the dialogue, and the unveilment of Hobbes' plan. There's even a twist near the end which is very unexpected, yet still fits within the story. There is a theme here, which I believe is that there is evil in everyone, no matter how good or innocent we may consider them to be. Overall, this was an incredible film and I recommend it to anyone looking for an ingenious thriller.
