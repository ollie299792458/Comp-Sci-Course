As a proud bearer of the Y chromosome, I will freely admit that I wanted to gnaw my arm off and escape when my wife selected this movie to see on our date night.

"Sounds like fun", I heard myself mutter while inside I was begging for a movie that involved explosions, some action, and some laughs; I would have even settled for a foreign film documentary.  If we could have combined them into a movie of me laughing while I made a pile of foreign film documentaries explode...even better.

It has Katherine Heigl in it who is absolutely gorgeous with darker hair.  I commented on that when I saw the movie poster outside the theater.  My wife threatened to remove my ear with a staple gun if I mentioned it again.  Given that I was sure this movie was going to stink, I took my chances.

So walking in I smiled outside but sulked inside, complied with my wife's wishes and begrudgingly settled into my quasi-comfortable movie seat for what I expected to be 2 hours of retread "men suck" jokes and tired expositions about how "men just don't get women" and "I wish they'd take out the trash" and "What's their fascination with movies where things blow up?"

And you know what?  I was wrong.

The plot was good.  Heigl played the role well (even if her accent was atrocious) and the grandmother was comedy gold.  There's a few scenes with a lot of skin showing and lots of fun involving handcuffs so...there's that. :)  I was entertained for an hour-and-a-half and came out of that movie glad I went in.

So, guys, if you want to impress your spouse/girlfriend and let them feel like they're getting to watch a movie they want on a "date night in", this is not a bad way to go.  Just be sure when she asks you, "Am I prettier than she is?" you simply say, "Of course, my sweet."  I won't make that mistake again.

To that end, if you find an ear with staples in it close to a movie theater, it's probably mine.
