First of all, be very careful of some of the reviews written on this page. Mr. Dressler gives some spoiler information that robs the film of one of its' most shocking plot twists.
Next, let me say that as my husband and I popped this film in one rainy afternoon, we were unprepared for the absolute shock value of this film. It is frighteningly well made. The camera shots are very remniscent of Hitchock and Citizen Kane. The story line is deliciously twisted and enough to make the most peaceful mind paranoid for some time to come. No wonder Frank Sinatra bought the rights to this film and yanked it from print everywhere a year after it was released - the same year that John F. Kennedy was assasinated. The similarities were too uncanny to be ignored. JFK was assasinated by a man with a bizarre history involving a communist country, in fact, he was a card carrying member - and was said to have been in an almost trance like state. EEEEK. Twenty five years later, the public was once again allowed to indulge in this glorious piece of film making and conspiracy hysteria. It has stood the test of time and is ranked #67 by the American Film Institute. The performances by Angela Lansbury, Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh, and of course Laurence Harvey are superb. The use of black and white film seems symbolic of the story itself and makes good use of eery and intense lighting techniques. It simply would not have been the same in color. 
You owe it to yourself to check out one of the greatest additions to film history. Take a word of advice, don't watch it by yourself. You're going to want someone around to talk about it when it's all over. Hang on for the ride!
