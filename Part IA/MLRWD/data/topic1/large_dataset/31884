Words cannot do justice to this NG investigation.  It shows, with what I take to be an unbiased eye, just what life is like in North Korea.

No, let's take that back.  It shows the tip of the iceberg.

Since there's no plot to give away, I'll point to two specific passages.

First, a cameraman lies on the ground to take a picture of a statue of Kim Il-sung (or maybe it's Kim Jong-il).  It was something to do with portrait vs. landscape; apparently he could get the entire statue in frame if he rotated it that way.

For doing so, he was threatened with expulsion.  Something about not standing before the Beloved leader.

Second, the pretext for the program was for a camera crew to accompany a Nepalese opthalmologist who attempted (and succeeded!) to perform 1000 cataract surgeries in 10 days, and train NK drs in the technique.  A noble cause, by any estimation.

As the bandages were removed from the patients, all sitting in a room that looked like a bad bus terminal, each patient stood before portraits of the Great Leader and the Beloved Leader, and gave them praise for their restored eyesight.  It was religious in nature.  NK is ruled by a cult of personality; communism is just a lofty concept.

Just as this documentary scratches the surface, I've scratched the surface of what it reveals.
