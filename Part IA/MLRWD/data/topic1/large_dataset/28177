Bad Moon is no top notch film, but it has some charm to it. First off the cover art is awesome.  I remember that is why I wanted to see it when I was 16 so many moons ago.  The acting is pretty flat, but Thor is awesome.  The changing into a werewolf scene is just a joke, however the actual werewolf is pretty cool.  The movie opens pretty well with some brief nudity in a sex scene that turns into a bloodbath.  From there it is pretty much a family movie with a little gore.  A single mom living in Seattle with her young son and the family dog Thor the almost human German Sheperd.  A uncle comes into town with a secret, moves in with the family and does not get along to well with Thor.  Why you ask?  Well I don't want to spoil the movie for you so you will just have to watch to find out (wink wink).  It really is not a family movie like on Disney channel or ABC Family channel, but it does have its feel good family/family-dog elements, Old Yeller, My Dog Skip, Air Bud, Bingo and etc, with a vicious Werewolf, and some blood and guts.  Hard to imagine.  Well that is what makes Bad Moon, Bad Moon.  It is not a werewolf movie you remember like The Howling, or An American Werewolf in London.  It is a typical B horror movie with a amazing smart dog as the hero and the only character you will care about.  It is not a complete waste of time, but don't expect to come away with anything more than a film that passes the time.  I did buy this movie though because my son loves werewolfs and this movie is not to hardcore to really mess him up in the head.  What does that tell you about the movie, or maybe I'm a messed up dad letting my boy watch such nonsense.  But in my defense as a young boy back in the day I really loved the short lived T.V. series Werewolf.  Like father like son.
