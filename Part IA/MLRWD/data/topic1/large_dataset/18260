The last box set "1989" was the return of our favorite detective and pretty enjoyable (I did leave a positive review). But just a year later, now he's in 90s with his traditional 70s attire, it seems to me that killers have developed and "educated" mostly in terms of technology and knowledge that killers apply to their crimes. So Columbo has to go with these new stuffs. Yet, he still faces the cases with his experience and his own traditional style. For these high-tech & knowledgable killers, Columbo sets up lots of traps. All these episodes in this box set are a bit over 90 minutes so there are longer times that Columbo spends and talks with people (suspects, neighbors, etc) very very thoruoghly. And I really like this slow yet sure way of solving the mystery step by step. Then again he sets up a trap for each situation, which is not high-tech or far-fetched at all. Instead it is very fundamental yet too deceptive for killers to notice such as his wife's car, surgent's house, that sort.
Just one draw back to me was the first episode. It is good as some sort of a mystery movie but to me it is a bit too hokey and lavish for Columbo. Indeed the actual murder was too cheap at the end. Maybe it was how the 90s started...

So how many more DVDs are we expecting?? According to my research, there are 13 episodes left. So probably two more box sets?? I really want to see them as time goes by. But I don't want it to end.....

Also, though a bit too far-fetched, around this time Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh (Yes, Lethal Weapon) must have been running through the same town as homicide sergents of LAPD. I bet they are not working for or with Columbo......can you imagine a picture?
