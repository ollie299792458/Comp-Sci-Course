I watched Kramer vs. Kramer and came away laughing during most of the movie.
I have never seen people take themselves so seriously, trapped in a land of esoteric garble.

Hoffman's character, Ted, needs to grow some balls, and learn how to make coffee, as he is over the age of 40. Streep's character needs to refill her Prozac script and start reading Sylvia Plath, maybe that would make her somewhat interesting.
Sex is out of the question with such a placid, dull woman: just go to the morgue, it would have more passionate hunks of humanity, and probably smarter, too.

The most hilarious line was in the coutroom when Streep's character said:

 " Ted was unable to deal with my feelings and this lowered my self-esteem. I've worked very hard to be a whole human being. And I don't think I should be punished for that."

Woe is me! How is this idiotic woman being punished! Being forced to move from the Upper West side to the Upper East side or maybe the real punishment was switching from Espresso to Maxwell House coffee?
Oh, The Humanity of it ALL!!!!

And the child doesn't need his parents: he needs six to ten years of special ed.
