My sons (4.5 and 1.5) LOVE Laurie Berkner's music and music videos which air on the "Move to the Music" section of Cable TV channel Noggin. I have seen these videos and they are very engaging, fun. The beauty is that all the videos have children in them dancing or jumping to the music.
We went to a Laurie Berkner concert when my older son was 2.5 years old and the theatre was packed (sold out!) with toddlers, preschoolers, kindergarteners and some older children.
All the songs in the video (except O Susannah) are original songs written by Laurie Berkner. The DVD contains 10 videos:
1. I'm Gonna Catch You
2. We Are the Dinosaurs
3. Victor Vito
4. Walk Along The River
5. Under A Shady Tree
6. Bumblebee (Buzz Buzz)
7. O Susannah
8. The Goldfish
9. Pig On Her Head
10. Moon Moon Moon
There is a bonus CD that comes with it which has the following songs on it:
1. Walk Along The River (previously unreleased)
2. We Are The Dinosaurs
3. Telephone
4. I'm Gonna Catch You
5. The Happiest Song I Know (Tom Chapin w/Laurie Berkner)
