I miss these kinds of films. They are classics for the whole family. I put together a list to remind folks of some of the best ones out there that are family oriented interesting and full of great music. It blows me away when I meet a 10 year old who hasn't seen something like Sound of Music or Wizard of Oz. It's been a long time since Hollywood has come up with one of these!

Mary Poppins

Sound of Music

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

My Fair Lady

Wizard of OZ

Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory

Annie

Oliver

I am an advocate of good old fasion family fun. I try and take my kids to these and other live musicals as well. We even do voice lesson Cds: (I recommend them as well)

"Voice Lessons To Go" by Vaccarino, to prep before we sing through their sound tracks. It's just another alternative to regular television time. There is a wholesome quality to them that sadly is not very prevelent today.
