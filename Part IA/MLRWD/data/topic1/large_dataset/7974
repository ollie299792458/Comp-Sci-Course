In the film documentary included with the DVD version, we learn that the filmcrew screens "Psycho" and "The Birds" prior to making "Willard." The influence of these two movies is abundantly evident in "Willard." Like Norman Bates in "Psycho," Willard is a lonely mama's boy. Willard's rats, like "The Birds," seemingly appear by the thousands and have the intelligence to know exactly what they are doing when following Willard's training (or not). 
Willard's genuine rats are seamless blended with the animatronics and computer-generated rats. Yes, the rats are too cute for the audience to believe that they are scary, especially when Willard snuggles up with sweet Socrates, but they prove vicious enough to eat the boss's (Ermey's) tires and to eventually dispatch the boss in a cage elevator -- rats doing away with a bigger rat.
I watch R. Lee Ermey so often on "Mail Call" that I half-expected him to have a cartload of watermelons in his office to blow to bits with various automatic weapons. Ermey is ALWAYS over-the-top.
Crispin Glover's performance is appropriately macabre. Crispin moves the character of Willard from introvert to diabolical by adopting rodent mannerisms, but not to the point where it's corny. I had a pet rat as a teen, and tried hard to mimic the constantly-moving nose and whiskers -- it ain't easy.  Crispin's twitch goes from nervous to resolute and that's not an easy movement for a human. I absolutely adored Crispin's performance. "Be" the rat!
