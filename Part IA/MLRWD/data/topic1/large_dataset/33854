As a child of the '50s I can remember when the book came out, reading it and being terrified how the world could end at any minute. When the film was released it showed no softening of the message, but the impact was lost due to the release of Kubric's "Dr Strangelove". Somehow Peter Sellers humourous spin on things coupled with the superb final vision of Slim Pickens riding down on the bomb to the sounds of "We'll meet again" just had everyone I know crying with laughter at the stupidity of it all. Surely nobody would let this sort of thing happen, would they?

. Looking at this film again many years later and it seems to have regained it's power to depict the frighteningly easy way in which we can slip into the abyss. The superb acting of Henry Fonda and Walter Mathau bring a terse and well written script to life, with the young Larry Hagman totally believeable as the Presidential interpreter.

As we watch events unfolding in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the race of uncontrollable powers in the Third World to produce and stockpile nuclear weapons along with their delivery systems, "Fail Safes" chilling message becomes as relevant today as  it did so many years ago.

Watch this film, then look at our present day political leaders. Apart from the fashions, has anything changed? The starkness of black and white as opposed to colour filmstock only serves to underline the warning that there is no middle way, we have to choose now as we had to choose then.

A superb film that every thinking person will do well to watch and keep alongside "Schindlers List", both as a warning and a lesson.
