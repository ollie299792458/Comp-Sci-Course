Armenians, Jews, Kurdish and people from different cultures live in Turkey. Children and women are being killed in Gazze now by bombs. Hundred thousands of people have been killed in Bosnia.We have all seen movies made about the Nazis so what does it change? Nobody forgets anything but if you don't forgive mutually battles will never end. Armenians kidnapped and killed my grandfather's uncle torturing him when he was only a little child. During the First World War English used Greek, French used Armenians and Kurdish to colonise different parts of Turkey. Kurdish still kill Turkish people because they think the East and Southeast belongs to them.The Armenian terrorist group ASALA killed Turkish innocent people in the past.After ASALA vanished PKK came out. These are all planned agitations to weaken the Middle East(divide and rule). Plus millions of Armenians never lived in that region if you knew geography you would know why.If i were a history teacher i would watch the DVD before showing it to students and would prefer recent genocides still going on.Why was JFK,Martin Luther King assassinated?Native Americans have been killed now that they are almost in extinction.Why don't you mind your own business and do something for peace today instead of talking about the past?
