If you like drama with supernatural themes then "Witch Hunter Robin" is for you.

"Witch Hunter Robin" is a fascinating Japanese animation by Sunrise (of Cowboy Bebop and Gundam Wing fame).  I am not much into Anime, but this one was great. A cross between "X-men" and "The X-Files" with parts of the old TV show "The Others" and CJ Carella's "Witchcraft" thrown in for good measure.  A great tale of government conspiracy, occult themes, and witches. What is not to love about all of that?

Fifteen year old Robin is the newest hunter to be assigned to Solomon Toukatsu Nin'idantai (Solomon Executive Organization) - Japan, or STN-J.  Robin though  is different. Robin is a craft-user. A witch.

Now "Witch Hunter Robin" is different than most American fare. It is by it's nature, slower; it takes time to build up to the main plot. We need to see her reactions to the various day-to-day operations of STN-J. Like how she relates to fellow hunter Amon (is she crushing on him? does he want/need to kill her?), or what is the deal with Dojima anyway (great payoff there!). Or why she refuses to use the anti-Witch Orboro guns.

It lacks sex, T&A and some of the things that we have become accustom to on American TV, but the story is first rate.  I don't know much about anime really, but the visual style is fantastic. It is very easy to see this being remade as a live action drama.  The musical score is also reminiscent of "the X-files", haunting, dramatic and really just very, very good.

I highly recomend it and this complete collection looks fantastic.
