If you watched Pocahontas prior to the blu ray release, you know how spectacular the color is. It's BEAUTIFUL. Unfortunately, the Disney company played around too much with the color in this film. Some scenes the green is just off. For example in the scene where Chief Powhatan gives Pocahontas her necklace, the pendant is green. Characters like Thomas and even some clothing items from the Powhatans have become a weird green color that is not seen in the previous film releases. I think Disney should have spent more time focusing on the quality of the film more, making more crisp and high quality than in the color.

Overall I am extremely happy with this film. I also do not mind that it was released with the second film. But it can be argued that putting to films in one blu ray may take away some of the quality. I still don't know if Disney is planning on doing another release like a 20th anniversary edition where it focuses on the first film, but nonetheless I'm satisfied. This movie is greatly underrated, and it is a shame because of how great it is in animation and its message, and a reason why Disney does not pay attention to it as much. But if you are a fan of blu ray releases or Pocahontas, I 100% recommend you buy the blu ray!
