A crew of good actors is lost in the often swampy scenario of The Good Girl. The basic principle--that people can be moved to dumb acts by boredom/dissatisfaction--is good enough. But the film tries too hard to be too many things. At moments it's a comedy; at other moments, it's dark. The humor is brought along by Zooey Deschanel's terrifically irreverent performance--applying Kabuki-like makeup to hapless customers and delivering nutty, unheard PA announcements to store customers. John C. Reilly is sweetly unpredictable as Aniston's good-natured, ...smoking, clunkhead husband. The camera loves Aniston and she's intriguing to watch; it's just not entirely clear who she's supposed to be--she doesn't quite manage to inhabit the character of Justine to the extent that she's believably almost as much of a clunkhead as her husband. And unlike his astonishing performance in Donnie Darko, Gyllenhaal just doesn't pull it off this time. He's not at all sympathetic. Again, he plays off the surface of Holden, without burrowing in deep to bring enough to the character to make us care. See this film for Zooey; she's hilarious and delivers the only completely three-dimensional character.
