I enjoyed this entertaining and informative film.  The acting was done very well, and the characters were developed enough that you were pulled through the film's grittiest and most violent scenes.  I usually opt to fast-forward through the tough scenes in these types of movies because the gore always outweighed whatever dialogue I might miss.  That was not the case for me during this film.  It was heart wrenching watching little boys, some no older than my oldest daughter, carrying weapons, being forced into doing drugs and alcohol, and killing anyone who opposed the rebels in their attempts to overthrow the current government, all in the name of greed and tyranny.  I hope that people watch this film and takes its message about conflict diamonds to heart.  While this is a dramatization of the events during that time, the issues and the warfare that it caused, were real.

My one and only true complaint was that I wasn't able to watch in HD, even though I had purchased the HD version.  About 20 minutes into the film I started having difficulties with "buffering," which is not something I usually encounter, and Amazon has a screening feature when you purchase HD versions, to determine whether or not you are capable of viewing the items in HD.  My system passed the screening (and always does), but I still had problems once I really got into the film and had to switch to the non-HD version.

So, while this was a great film that I would recommend everyone to see, especially if you are interested in world affairs, I was not happy with the quality of the HD playback.  Purchase a hard-copy of the Blueray instead.
