Anaconda... A terrible movie.  But worth getting on blu-ray, why?  Jon Voight, Ice Cube, Owen Wilson (before famous) oh and did I mention jon voight playing a snake hunter named serone with his counter part MATEO!  Jon Voight's amazing one liners alone are enough to watch this terrible movie.  For example, "Maybe some other time."  A simple line that in text form seems unimportant.  However with Voight's Serone twist, this simple line becomes hilarious gold (if there is such a thing).  This movie is so ridiculous that it is hilarious... and those are my favorite movies.  Surprisingly enough, this movie actually looks pretty good on blu-ray and the upgrade makes jon voight's performance even more enjoyable.  I recommend that if you haven't seen this movie, you have to see it at least once.  Is it worth the buy on blu-ray?  Yes it is.  But wait till the price drops a little more.  They used to play this movie all the time on tv.  Now they don't play it as much.  So get it and enjoy the HD version of a classic film, Anaconda.
