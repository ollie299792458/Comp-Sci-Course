The Crime Syndicate has always been a favorite of mine since reading reprints of Fox's original Earth-Three version of JLA #29 (Aug 1964) and for a long time the only thing even close in attitude to them in animated form had been the SuperEnemies in the "Universe of Evil" episode of the 1979 "World's Greatest SuperFriends".  Morrison's Anti-matter Crime Syndicate of America in 2000 brought a re-imagined Crime Syndicate to a new generation of readers and the 2009 Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode "Deep Cover for Batman!" gave us the animated Injustice Syndicate which was again close but not quite there.

This Crime Syndicate captures elements seen in the versions that came before.  The public being against the Crime Syndicate as well as bomb Owlman is building (a variation of a right at the end plot twist) is nearly straight from Fox's 1964 version, the ruthlessness and tough attitude of the SuperEnemies and Injustice Syndicate is there, as is the mob like mentality seen in Morrison's version and expanded in the Syndicate Rules saga.

Unlike the Justice Lords of the JL episode "A Better World" this version of the Crime Syndicate like all the other versions does not see themselves as heroes doing what needs to be done for the betterment of all but as criminals taking what they feel they "deserve" and not above doing whatever they need to do to make sure they get it.

As long as you go into this with the mindset that this is NOT an an adaptation of any one story (even though the Morrison's version clearly has the largest influence) you should enjoy this.
