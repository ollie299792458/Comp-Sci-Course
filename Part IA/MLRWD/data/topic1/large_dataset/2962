First, the conclusion:  Don't buy this ersatz "Blu-Ray" disc from Warner Bros.  According to almost every technical standard, it stinks.  I should have learned by now that the combination of "Blu-Ray" and "Warner Bros." means that the video transfer is "Blu-Ray" only according to the box label.  That said, this transfer is bad even by Warner Bros pathetic standards.  To make sure my growing prejudice was not interfering with my judgment, I screened the Blu-Ray edition  side by side with the standard DVD version without comment to nine friends and neighbors.  Of nine viewers, five couldn't spot in difference in video quality, two liked the Blu-Ray marginally better, and two liked the regular DVD version better. Though less important than the video quality, the menu options and functionally are awful--cheap, clunky, and almost unbelievably limited.  I've seen better interactive menus on Hong Kong bootleg discs.  Rumors abound that Warner Bros is going to be redoing many of the lousy Blu-Ray selections they've issued in the last few years, but so far there is nothing except rumor.  Market dynamics are supposed to weed out inferior products, but my guess is that many consumers simply don't realize just how inferior some brand offerings are.  So, here's to the informed consumer:  Again, don't waste your money on this low-quality product and show Warner Bros. that we are all a bit smarter than they obviously  think we are.
