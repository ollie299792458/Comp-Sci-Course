The movie trailer told you everything you needed to know about this one. Scorching title track ("The Wolf" by Fever Ray), Amanda Seyfried and those "great big eyes" of hers, Gary Oldman trying (and failing, yet again) to make this movie cult, and two hot men with miraculously coifed hair despite the fact they live in a farming village, population: 250, location: The Woods. The women too are so packed with makeup I was waiting for the Avon lady to show up at any moment. (Perhaps Dianne Wiest from Edward Scissorhands?)

The dialogue is so supremely awful at times you have to hope director Catherine Hardwicke was aiming to make this film as much like a fairy tale as possible. If I remember right, old-time fables are not known for their witty banter. But saying that, Hardwicke failed to commit fully to the fairy tale theme. She's got the imagery down, but the themes cockeyed. This movie tries to be unique, yet stays within the boundaries of a Hollywood blockbuster. As a viewer, you feel like you're watching something that could be great, but somehow misses the mark because it quickly drags the story to fall within your expectations again. I wanted to be surprised - and sometimes I was - but overall, I'm disappointed this film wasn't better considering how amazingly fecking awesome it could have been.
