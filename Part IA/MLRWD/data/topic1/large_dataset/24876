Cheesy B-grade horror, alternately laughing and cringing, and one of the worst plots - but most entertaining movies - I've ever seen. That pretty much sums up Slither.

Okay, as far as the plot goes, an alein crashes to earth, 'infecting' a member of the town of Wheelsy (somewhere in America) and from there on proceeding to take over the town with worm-like symbiotic aliens that turn everyone into lurching zombies.

(teeheehee)

Nathan Fillion, of Firefly fame, plays the lead role of the sherriff, and does a damn good job. My one annoyance is that this role is almost exactly like his role in Firefly, and he plays it the same way - possible typecasting of himself? The other characters, short of the girl, are nicely introduced and rounded out, making you care about them.

All in all, it's a very cool movie - almost Evil Dead in not taking itself seriously, but at the same time - unlike Evil Dead - there's a great element of horror in there that becomes truly awful at certain stages of the film.

4.5 stars (of five).
