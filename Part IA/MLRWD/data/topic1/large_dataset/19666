Dodgeball - The movie that you and your friends talk about for weeks
If you want to laugh and laugh a lot, this movie is a must see! Dodgeball is an instant classic with some of the funniest stars in the business. Ben Stiller gives one of his best performances playing the role of a stuck up Fitness Guru (White Goodman) who wants to take over Peter LaFleur's (Vince Vaughn) Average Joe's Gym.  With Average Joes Gymnasium in the hole $50,000 it seems like an impossible situation with only one solution.....DODGEBALL!
Just like it claims, Dodgeball is a true underdog story with the overlooked characters of society taking on the perfect team of Globo gym. From the first ten seconds of the film to the very end, you are hit with an urge to break out in uncontrollable laughter.  Not only do you feel a knot in your stomach from all the laughing you will be doing, but you also feel a sense of pride in the team of Average Joes. This will become apparent when you notice yourself cheering at the television.
To my surprise, it's not just another comedy film that you see with no plot and just a bunch of jokes; it has substance and constant humor which combines to create an amazing comedy production.
This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Watch it with some friends and it's what you are going to be quoting all week!
The only flaw that this film has is that every detail isn't refined enough for me to give it 5 out of 5. For a comedy of this stature I can make an exception, especially when other films like "Epic Movie" can't even come close to the plot scheme and fantastic humor combination. That is why Dodgeball gets 4 out of 5 stars from me.
This is one of the funniest movies you'll ever see and the twists in the story keep you interested throughout the movie. You will want to show someone this after you see it. It's what a comedy movie should be. Watch it.
