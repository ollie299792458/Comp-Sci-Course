Some years back, a colorized version of "NOTLD" appeared on TV; the stark black and white zombies of one of my favorite independent films suddenly became green.
Yes, green.
I didn't watch more than ten minutes of that version, and I should've stopped at about the same minute count with this "30th Anniversary" version.
The added prologue, epilogue and additional scenes (which weren't cut from the original film, but recently filmed for inclusion here) not only fail to make any significant contribution to "NOTLD," they actually DETRACT from it.
For instance, why would you want to mute one of the most chilling openings in film history? I'm referring, of course, to the opening scene where the main undead character slowly ambles up to the bickering brother and sister, eventually killing the brother. 
That scene, however, no longer opens the movie. Now, we get a couple of country bumpkins going off to bury a corpse.
The new material is warped not only by poor writing -- the additional material serves NO PURPOSE to the story -- but abysmal acting.
Despite its budgetary constraints, the original "NOTLD" had some decent acting. Duane Jones in particular does a terrific job. This new version contains some performances so terrible as to incite its own form of terror: "NOTLBA" ("Night of the Living Bad Actors")
I haven't seen the definitive version of "NOTLD," though I suspect that version is the same one I saw on late night television over a decade ago.
I have, however, seen what is certainly NOT the definitive version. This one.
