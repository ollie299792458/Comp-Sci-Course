Everyone was so down on Arnold's first movie (End of days) since recovering from kidney problems. He was accused of rushing in and taking any part, regardless of the quality of the script. Well, I disagreed with the critics on "End of Days"; I thought the story was pretty good and it was a nice change to see him in the role of a vulnerable, fragile, average guy. The 6th Day puts Arnold back into a familiar character that we, the fans, are used to. He's back as the larger than life action hero! Performing death defying, super human feats and kicking everyone's butt along the way. This is the role that all Arnold fans (and critics for that matter) seem to be most comfortable seeing him in. That being said, I don't think this is a bad movie; on the contrary, I really liked this flick! When it come to this genre of movies, Arnold has a strangle hold on the industry. One quick note, If you look carefully, they use Arnold's stunt double allot in this movie...I guess he's not a 100% physically. Like most of my reviews, I won't describe the plot of the movie because you either read it before, or through one form or another, have been told the plot. What I will say about the movie is, the story has a great premise and touches on a current moral issue...Cloning, and the probably inevitable misuse of the technology. The movie has a nice flow to it; from beginning to end the story stays strong and keeps you hungry for the finality (that has a little twist to it). But what makes this a movie to buy, and not just rent, is the quality of the DVD. Along with Gladiator, The 6th day is a sign of the next generation of DVD's that are on the horizon; unbelievable audio and video that had little to no motion artifacts from the transfer! This movie is a dream for Home Theater enthusiasts!
