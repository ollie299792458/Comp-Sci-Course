I bought this movie thinking it was one I had already seen and wanted to watch again. Unfortunately(and fortunately)it was one that I hadn't seen.  Unfortunately the beginning is very slow paced with little time spent on building character in the main actor(s).  I began to wonder if I wanted to spend 2 hours at this pace.  But, like an old car entering a freeway ramp (not being able to keep up with newer models)the pace builds.  Eventually, the story begins to unfold and turns out to be interesting.  The symbolism (between cat and character-see other reviews)wasn't obvious.  After reading other reviews I can go back and watch Come Undone with a fresh perspective.  I was disappointed in the ending- pretty abrupt. As a north american I'm always amazed at how french dialouge never beat around the bush when it comes to discussing gay issues.  For me that is entertaining if somewhat unrealistic (by our standards). Also, the acting was well done and by the end of the movie I did relate to the characters. Overall, I'm glad Come Undone is part of my collection and I will watch it again.
