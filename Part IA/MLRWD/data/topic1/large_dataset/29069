On my list of all time greats that I watch over and over and over...Its Patton. I saw it at the theatre at release time, bought the VHS, bought another VHS (I suckered for one of those that claimed "extra scenes") bought the first CD and now I got the Blu Ray. Outstanding. You wont believe your watching a film done almost 40 years ago. Its real stuff of wartime (hollywood style) right in your face. On the opening sequence with Patton standing at attention with the U.S. flag as a back drop, you can see little beads of sweat coming down from underneath his helmet. The audio is wartime deafening. Louder than hell.. because it was. The Blu Ray version of this movie is outstanding. 10 stars on the wowiekazowie scale. We all know without argument that this movie in itself was a winner right out of the chute. George C. Scott totally nailed it. Karl Malden as well...Amazon needs to separate the reviews for this version of Patton away from those reviews that were written before Blu Ray was released. This version is without question a standalone..
