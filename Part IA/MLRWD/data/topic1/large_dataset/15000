Not very deep - but visuals and soundtrack work beautifully to create a mood of foreboding and set a colorful stage for a fairy tale like saga of the ultimate battle between good and evil.  A historical link to the society of ancient Egypt and an early 20th century archeology team bring an air of mystery.  Bruce Willis is in his element playing himself as a cabbie ex-army guy who must save the world (alla Die-Hard).  Gary Olsen does a fantastic job as the quirky villan allied with the Evil One.  Although targeting an American audience this is clearly a French movie...tenuous plot with eye-popping imagery, cool costumes, glorious sets, and wild characters, woven into a 90 minute tapestry of sight and sound by the minimalist, bordering on subsonic, soundtrack.  You'll either love it for what it is or hate it as shallow eurotrash Pop.  The DVD image in this version is of superior quality and images are well rendered, crisp, with rich and vivid color with no obvious artifacts.  The surround sound is stupendous and the use of low frequencies for some scenes sends shivers down your spine.  In terms of acting every one did a good job.  As far as casting goes, the character of the President was not the right guy - someone a bit older a bit more serious would have been better.  Also I could have done without the taxi/police chase scene but otherwise a great movie.  If you love French movies like (Big Blue, Professional, Messenger, etc.) or are die-hard Willis or Scifi-action fans, you'll be glad you own it and will definitely use your "Moolti Pahss" and watch it multiple times.
