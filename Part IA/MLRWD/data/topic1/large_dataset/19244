Those giving the movie low ratings because it is graphic are right - it is hard to watch. However I can't imagine how hard it must be for those animals to live through those experiences. And if more people watch and really absorb this film then maybe fewer animals will have to go through it which really is an amazing thing.

We have laws to protect our companion animals - however I find that most of the population 'doesn't want to hear' where their meat comes from. One of the highlights of this film for me was the investigation into small farms and organic farming which as a near vegan for many years had been something I used to justify my consumption.

I have been a fan of Dr Joel Fuhrman for year and I loved that she took the three participants to him to make a very important point - veganism is only HEALTHY if you replace meat with plant based protein sources and don't just lean on processed food.

Kudos for the film maker for making veganism so accessible to 'beginners' on the topic. I have read many books and watched many movies after giving up meat at 25 following a slaughter house clip that landed in my inbox. However this is certainly one of the best and even the already converted will enjoy it and learn new things.

As for me I am definitely planning on going from almost vegan to all vegan!
