This movie is that rare Hollywood production, a fine work of art.  Ostensibly an ordinary comedy with a fantastical angle, the film is actually a felicitous combination of morality play and comedy.  And it accomplishes that delicate balancing act between humor and pathos.  It's laugh-out-loud funny.  Besides, the technical mastery of continuity and timing that keeps the viewer interested through the obligatory repetition required for the theme of a man caught in a time loop, the story examines the ways and means we can play out our lives.  Given enough time and trouble, we can choose one or a succession of methods with which to deal with such a predicament: disbelief, panic, realization, despair, opportunism, futility, self-awareness, and growth.  The hero passes through all of these.  The movie is a profound lesson on life without a sermon, with wit and humor, with only glimpses of melodrama, and most of all with the gift of hope.  Despite the misery of this world, with a constant and continual effort to improve we can find the secret of existence, meaningful love, and the truth about ourselves.  Unappreciated after its release, later seen as a sleeper, this minor masterpiece will in time become more widely appreciated and eventually an esteemed treasure.
