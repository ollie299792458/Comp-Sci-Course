Ok, so lets take this into account before I evaluate the value of "Davie & Golimyr": I am a twenty-two year old male, and this movie was not made with me in mind.  For goodness sakes, this is a stop-motion retelling of the Biblical tale of David and Goliath that has gone straight to video.  The biggest star in it is John Schneider of "Dukes of Hazard" fame (and for younger fans, of "Smallville" fame).  The movie comes in a single disk, cardboard sleeved DVD that includes a set of free stickers from a Nick Jr. show called "Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!"  I am not the person who is meant to watch this movie.  Chances are if can read this, then you are not the target audience either.  No, this movie is squarely aimed at the toddler crowd.

The little tots are not going to make note of many of the things I did.  They are not going to muse over the fact that this re-telling of the famous Bible story is so close to the original, that the makers might as well have just made another David and Goliath.  They aren't going to note that this kind of stop-motion comes off as fairly unsophisticated compared to recent releases of "Corpse Bride" and "Wallice and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit."  Chances are, they won't even pay attention to any of that.  Trying to bring my own childhood back into play, I believe that kids will enjoy this because the colors are bright, the characters cute, and the story still speaks to the underestimated personality in most young tots.

Young ones who are already familiar with the story may get excited that, unlike Goliath, it takes two stones before the mighty Golimyr is taken down.  Otherwise though, they won't care about the production values at all.  This is not the best adaption of the story I've seen.  For me, the "Superbook" episode did the story more justice...ah, but I'm nitpicking now.  The movie is clean, colorful, and it will keep your kids busy for forty-five minutes.  So really, what's not to recommend?
