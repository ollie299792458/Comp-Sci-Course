Village of the Damned is simply superb in it's presentation of fear of the unknown. Not relying on special effects, which by today's standard were non-existent at the time, it uses atmosphere and acting to deliver a first rate scare. George Sanders is excellent as the teacher of the alien children forced upon the women of Midwich. The tension of what the children are and might do is tight and builds to a crashing crescendo in the final scene of the film. Based on John Wyndham's novel, The Midwich Cuckoos (an appropriate name if one knows how cuckoos leave their eggs in other birds' nests) it is a fine interpretation of the book. I highly recommend this movie to any fans of science fiction/horror who can appreciate the finer nuances of films from bygone days.

Children of the Damned does not, in my opinion, live up to its promise. Like many sequels it attempts to cash in on the impact of the first film but falls well short. As I do not have this films in my collection I am going to buy them
