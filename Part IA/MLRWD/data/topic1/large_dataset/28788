I picked up Emerald Knights and All-Star Superman for an extremely cheap price during Black Friday weekend and after being somewhat disappointed by the indifferent effort on All-Star Superman I was stunned by the high quality of Emerald Knights. One of the elements I enjoy about the Geoff Johns era of Green Lantern comics is the distinction that's made as to how each Green Lantern wields the power ring. Emerald Knights digs a little deeper and showcases the differences between the various Green Lanterns themselves. Like the artistic renditions, the stories of how Green Lanterns find their own path to greatness are unique and well executed. In all, there are five tales recounted to a rookie member of the Green Lantern Corps as war stories while the collective group prepares to face their greatest challenge; the transition from the current story to the flashback tales can come off as a little forced, but the content is of high enough quality that you will forgive the obvious method of delivery. The only other real shortcomings are that, like the live action Green Lantern movie, the big bad isn't fleshed out a lot and the lack of white incorporated into the costumes can make the Corps look a little homogenous. Overall, though, check this movie out if you want to see a Green Lantern film the way it's supposed to be.
