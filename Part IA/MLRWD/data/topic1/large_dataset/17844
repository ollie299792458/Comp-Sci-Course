Oh man, my mom hates this movie. That means it's great!! This movie follows the sick, depraved doings of a well dressed, educated, poetic, sadistic serial killer, who gets his kicks from shooting, strangling, beating innocent people. From an old lady, to the mailman, even a five year old kid, nobody's saved from this Edgar Allan Poe-reciting madman. All while a film crew documents his crimes (sort of like the Blair Witch-style documentary). The documentary-style of this film is really great. You can hear the sound go off when the soundman gets killed, then come back when the other crew members picks up the microphone. Plus, it's filmed in black and white, for a rawer, documentary feel. This movie is in French dialogue, but with English subtitles, so all of you who flunked French in High School can understand what's going on. Great movie, definitely worth getting if you're a fan of Natural Born Killers, Resevoir Dogs, or even the Blair Witch. Oh, for all you Punks out there, the box cover art of this movie is used on Rancid's first album cover- Demos from the Pit. Punk Rock!
