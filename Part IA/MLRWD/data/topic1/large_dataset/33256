The Secret Garden is my all time favorite film of its genre. It's a family film, but it is not just for kids.  The story is simple enough for children to understand, yet complex enough to keep adults interested. 
One of the aspects of the film I like best is the cinematography.  It is visually striking, and the direction was excellent.  I can't say enough about the emotions evoked by the visual excellence of this film.
The acting was superior, especially Kate Maberly's portrayal of Mary Lennox.  But all the actors did a superb job.  They were very believable. 
The sound track is also superior. The haunting melody of "Winter Light" graced many of the outdoor scenes. Sung by Linda Ronstadt as the closing theme, it remains one of my favorite musical compositions.  The interplay of the background music with the film's stunning visual beauty makes this movie a true work of art.
When the movie first came out in theaters, I took my 8-year-old daughter to see it.  She liked it fine, but I fell in love with it and have been in love with the film ever since.  I'm a man in my late 40s and I'm not ashamed in the least to admit that I simply adore this enchanting family film.  From its intriguing beginning to its highly emotional end, the film is perfect.  Enough said.
