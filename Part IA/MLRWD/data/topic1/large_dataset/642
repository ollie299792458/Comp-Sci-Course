I just watched this, on friday, and have re-watched 3 times since! This was awesome, but be prepared, because it is a slow at parts. The ambassador of UK and his wife are expecting a child. However, when the child "dies" a new baby is secretly adopted by the father, to keep his wife from being depressed. 5 years later, a series of events begin that make everyone doubt that this child is human. And as we all know, he isnt! Hes the son of the devil! This movie was amazing, better than the remake. From the satanic nanny, to the evil dog, this is truly an original! It does get a little boring at parts, but then something happens before or after, and the boring part is just explaining it. Also, this does have some blood (SPOILER!!)like when the one guy gets decapitated, and the dad at one point is jumping a fence, and his arm is disgustingly impaled on the sharp spikes! I loved this because it was sophisticated, not a campy slasher with lots of gore, sex, and annoying teens( dont get me wrong, I love those too)plus the characters are somewhat likeable. Id recommend this to anyone who loves those wonderful, amazing, 70s-80s horror films!
