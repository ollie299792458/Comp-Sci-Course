This production of Twelfth Night is the most substantial one I have seen, with a profound understanding of the characters and their relationships.  Ben Kingsley's Feste is a wise man with a powerful intellect and acts as the presiding consciousness of Illyria.  Olivia, Viola and Sebastion are all excellent. Sir Andrew emerges as a rather sad but very real personality.  Antonio's obsessive love for Sebastian arouses compassion.  As a result the comedy is less rousingly slapstick than one sometimes finds, but this makes it possibly for the more subtle comedy of language to come through.
  Its setting in Victorian times is completely convincing and provides many comedic details.  Sir Andrew with his neck caught under a croquet hoop is a very telling and hilarious example.  My only reservation is about Orsino, whose initial  appearance  with a lip-curling eye-tooth flashing sneer is difficult to forgive or forget - but he improves quite soon.
  For use in the literature classroom, this is an excellent choice.  It favors substance over surface flash and allows the fundamental themes and relationships to emerge clearly.
