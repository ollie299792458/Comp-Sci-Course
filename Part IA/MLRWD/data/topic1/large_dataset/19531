Hunter S. Thompson's seminal Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was a twisted, paranoid composite of two trips he and his attorney made to Vegas in the early seventies while Thompson was working for Rolling Stone. His vain attempt to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race and a District Attorney's conference on drugs tailspins into a mescaline, speed, and alcohol fueled vision quest in search of the American Dream. The movie glosses over most of the deeper parts of the story, but the first half of the movie creates a good illusion of fidelity to the first half of the book. Unfortunately, the second half glosses over more than just the deeper parts of the book and the viewer gets the impression that Gilliam was just trying to get the movie in the can and be done with it. The second half of Fear and Loathing eerily reminds me of the second half of David Lynch's adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic novel, Dune. 
Both Depp (Hollywood's most underappreciated actor) and Del Toro (who was all but unrecognizable due to the weight difference) did a superb job with the material they were given. If any filmaker ever has the guts to portray Hunter Thompson again, (e.g. a film version of his semi-fictional "The Rum Diary") Depp is the man for the job. Its good to see Del Toro out of his stereotyped criminal role; he is a very versatile actor.
The final score: If you are already an HST freak AND a Monty Python freak, this movie is worth the viewing, just don't expect anything more than a visually lush journey into drug induced decadence. If you've never read the book, I would advise reading it before watching the movie. Having a familiarity with the novel will clear up some confusion in the movie.
