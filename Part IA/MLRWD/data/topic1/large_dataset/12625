B-movie gem, topped by two noir icons: sultry Marie Windsor in a photo spread worthy of Victoria's Secret and tough guy Charles McGraw in a role worthy of his jut-jawed best, with enough twists and turns to delight the most jaded late night fans. The cleverly crafted one-liners between these two circling sharks fairly drips with shredded flesh. Not noir in classic sense of "Detour", it's still an unstable world with few certainties and a cynical subtext where cops can be bribed in a manner that debunks law and order 1950's. Sharp, imaginative direction: fat guy Paul Maxie clogs passageways like a heaving dump truck; wash-day clotheslines pop-up like a nightmare gauntlet; then too, great close-in camera work that creates subtle sense of no escape. Two diverse points: watch for errant palm tree in high-prairie town of La Junta, Colorado, and miscasting of a Beaver Cleaver  mom (Jaqueline White) in pivotal role that left me unconvinced. Still, this modest little black-and-white manages to lift its pot-boiler origins to near perfection, showing once again what was lost in the mindless stampede to technicolor extravagance.
