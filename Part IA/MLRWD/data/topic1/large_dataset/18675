This movie was really really FUNNY.  It seems like many of the other reviews are showing the movie as serious, so i was expecting another Requium for a dream.  But the only real similarity was the vision of drugs and how they send a life on a downward course.  SPUN is just an engaging film with lots of humor, likeable characters, and some really messed up *@@! happening to them all.
To truly apreciate the actors you must also see- RUSHMORE and ALMOST FAMOUS. Jason Schwartsman is a totaly different nerd in Rushmore, and Patrick Fuquit was the likeable star in Almost Famous.  Both of these guys play extremely different but likable parts in this movie.  I was pleasantly surprised and am now big fans of both of these actors.
BILLY CORGAN does the music, and its great.  I just need the soundtrack-which doesnt exist.  Corgan also has a small appearance in the movie.  Hes wearing a big yellow wig.
Get the unrated version- it has lots of nudity of one especially hot blond.  Britney Murphy was really hot in this movie too, even though she is supposedly a junkie.  she has a dance scene at a strip club, but no nudity of course.
Anyway- Get this movie as fast as you can.  It will spin you.
