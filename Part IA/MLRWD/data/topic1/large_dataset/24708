- Chuck Season 5 Content: 5+++ stars - Great extras & very rewarding heart-2-hearts with the actors for those of us who have fought for & supported Chuck. That said, an alternate ending giving the fans the "Charah happily ever after" ending they wanted would have been even sweeter! :)

- Amazon: 5 stars - great price & quick delivery!

- Blu-ray Quality: 1-2 stars

Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Chuck fan. That is why I purchased this Blu-ray and my love for this show is the only reason I'm not returning it. My Season 1 & 2 regular DVD's actually look better in my Blu-ray player than this Season 5 Blu-ray version. That said, my Season 4 DVD looks terrible in comparison to the first 2 season sets as well so I'm guessing something happened there! I noticed that for Season 1, they used 4 dvds to give us 13 episodes. For Season 2, 6 dvds for 22 episodes. Season 4, 5 dvds for 24 episodes. Perhaps that could have something to do with it...maybe they compressed the content too much? I can't comment on the quality of Season 3 given that I have resisted buying it, refusing to support that Shaw fiasco the writers put us through! I may however give in at some point, just to show my overall support for Chuck...we'll see:)

For now, I'm not sure who's responsible for the quality of the Blu-rays/DVDs but I'm guessing that corners were cut and most likely to save a few bucks but that really sucks for us Chuck fans / customers given we spent quite a bit more than just a few bucks purchasing them & more than that, given that Chuck is no longer on the air, the only concrete stuff we have left to remember this great show by are these VERY mediocre Blu-rays & DVDs to watch! That Season 4 Set was definitely not cheap and as for my getting the Season 5 Blu-ray version at a special price of $26.99, well, that was nice and all but I would have been quite willing to pay a little more for it anyhow and could have given Chuck the 5 stars it deserves had corners not been cut!

So, buy the DVD or Blu-Ray b/c Chuck is a fantastic show and you'll fall in love with the characters & get hours of pleasure and clean LOL moments which are not easy to come by in shows these days. Manage your expectations regarding the Blu-ray quality though and Warner Bros. or whoever is responsible for releasing this type of quality, is there anything you can do to fix this? Please?!
