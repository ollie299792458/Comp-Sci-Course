Not only is this story well written, but because it takes place on Gallifrey, it adds to the background and lore of the Time Lords.

It is now a fairly common theme in Sci-Fi, where a charactor enters a computer Matrix, but in 1976 this was a newer concept. The best scene of the episode is the one in which the Doctor fights an opponent in the Neural net. The neural net is explained as a network of all the knowledge made up from the minds of Timelords. It is not living but the Doctor's mind is, and if he loses the battle while in the network it would kill him.

The show is really not dated even today, because there are not a lot of tech effects in it. They relied on good studio sets, costumes and a very strong supporting cast.

This show had the controversial freeze frame cliff hanger that showed the Doctor's head being submerged under water.

The acting was superb and the story grips all the way to the end. There is a real sense that the Doctor has perhaps met his match in this one.
