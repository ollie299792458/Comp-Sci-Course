I had high expectations when I rented this movie from my local Blockbuster. Probably because it had Guillermo del Toro's name all over it. But, alas, it is only PRESENTED by Guillermo del Toro and directed by a newbie. In this respect, I felt that the advertising for the film was a bit misleading.

But hey, it's a creepy ghost story set in a spooky orphanage done in an allegedly Guillermo del Toro-esque style. So I gave it a shot.

Sadly, I found this movie to be derivative of countless other horror movies and chock full of hackneyed cliches. The scene that stood out as the primary offender was when the medium and her gaggle of paranormal detectives came over the house with their ghost-finding, ectoplasm-sensing computer equipment. This scene was lifted nearly frame for frame from Poltergeist. It was pathetic to watch.

The movie also borrows heavily from the plethora of Japanese horror movies involving the ghosts of kids. As you watch the movie, the names of other movies that have already done the scene you are watching stream through your head.

And when the movie ended I thought "that's it?" The ending was cheesily sentimental and just didn't carry enough emotional weight to make me care.

I think I'll stick with Guillermo del Toro and not his imitators.
