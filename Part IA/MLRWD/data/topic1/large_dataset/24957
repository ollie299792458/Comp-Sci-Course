IF someone told me I would enjoy a movie in which the main character (Tom Hanks)spends better than 90% of the time alone - I would've laughed and thought it a ridiculous premise for a movie. But I would've been mistaken...Castaway is a good, family movie, that demonstrates Tom Hanks abilities and leaves no room for doubt as to why he is one of a select group of headliners.

The sole survivor of a plane crash, Fed Ex engineer Chuck Noland finds himself stranded on an uninhabited island, living on coconuts and fish. As days turn to weeks, his well groomed and close cropped hair begins to resemble the straggley, sun bleached tresses of a caveman. His appearance seems to be the physical manifestation of the emotional trauma with which he is struggling...  He opens one of the FedEx packages and finds a volleyball, naming it "Wilson," this ball became his best friend, confidant and source of strength. His conversations with Wilson run the gamut, from heartwarming to laugh-out-loud silly.

 A good movie !!
