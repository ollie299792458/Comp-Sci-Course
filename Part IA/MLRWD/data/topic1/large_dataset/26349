I will not get into the technical aspects of the making of this movie other than to say it is stunning to watch.  This is what movies should be about... entertainment, fun, action, and a pleasure to watch.  When it was first released it was a stunning visual spectacular with all of the special effects of the time that audiences had not really experienced before.  The only complaint I have about the movie is how far it strayed from the book in some instances.  The switching of the 2 children's personalities (in the book the boy was the computer geek and the girl was the follower of dinosaur history) was minor in the scheme of things, but still bothered me somewhat the first time I saw the movie.  They left out the pteradactyl's in this film even though that was a big part of the book.  I am sure there were other things, also, that I cannot recall at this time, but still overall it was a fantastic movie.  I have not seen the DVD as of yet, but I have owned the VHS for a number of years and still enjoy watching it.  I really enjoy movies where I don't have to look for a hidden meaning and just enjoy the show.
