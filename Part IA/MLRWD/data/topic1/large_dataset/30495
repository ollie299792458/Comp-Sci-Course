I don't know if this is the greatest haunted house movie ever made.  It certainly ranks up at the top of the list, as do "The Shining" and "Alien" (yes, Alien).  "The Haunting" is my  favorite though.  It's so wonderfully ambiguous.  What does it take for a  house to be "haunted" anyway?  Much is made in the reviews on  this list that you never really see any ghosts.  Well?  Were there any?  Although the House certainly has a morbid history, it's not as though  everyone who lived in the house has died under suspicious circumstances, or  has been driven mad.  Some, like Crain's daughter, lived to a ripe old age.  And after all, Eleanor has a history of psychokinetic experiences.  That's  one reason she's there to begin with (that, and her desperate need to have  some sort of life).  It's every bit as likely that she's the source of the  disturbances as the House is.  Perhaps the unexplained (supernatural?)  happenings are the result of the psychosexual tension between Eleanor and  Theo.  Or perhaps they're akin to a bizarre courtship between Eleanor and  the House, and everyone else is swept along for the ride.  Regardless, it's  worth going along on the ride with them.
