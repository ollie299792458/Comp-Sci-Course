01/09/05  Although the movie, which near the end "showed a human side of the "Nun In Charge" prior to showing a couple of scenes from the Bing Crosby, Ingrid Berman movie which was about "Nuns In America" entitled "The Belles of Saint Mary",where she mentions she'd made up her mind to be either a nun or a cowboy like those in the "Westens" she liked so much as a child; the scenes stuck to the plot of "harsh life within the "convent walls" for these lay persons, who entered as young persons due to some unfortunate circumstance which made their families feel the "Magdalene Asylum" was the answer to their families problems as to what do you do with a teenage girl  whom the family no longer feels pride in.The Magdalen Order of Nuns had one mandate to keep these girls until some adult came to release them and the movie did have one case of a brother who did come 4 (four) years later ..and was asked by his sister what took him so long, to which the  18 year old told his sister, I was busy "growing up"  ...The convent appeared to be run like  what the public is led to believe is the atmosphere of "maximum security" prisons which hold "only dangerous inmates" vs an asylumn(haven) for "wayward girls".. The only sensibility to the movie is remembering 1. that theatre and movie scripts embelish and exaggerate on reality  2. that nothing wrong that did happen to the girls can be considered justifiable  3. that these situations happened in a time when people knew no better, and considered "corporal punishment & brute force" as the only way to have order with those they had labeled disorderly
