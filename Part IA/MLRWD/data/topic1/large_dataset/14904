As with most of my fellow amazonians I cannot figure out why this movie was knocked so bad.  It is a remarkable story of how one man gave people hope, freedom, and the chance for a better life in what was a very dismill and nearly decimated country.  The only reason I give this movie 4 instead of 5 stars is that the movie fails to deliver on one very important matter and that is in the movie it fails to explain exactly what happened to the U.S. and the rest of the world for that matter to put it in the state that it is and also fails to give a proper backround about the holnist clan.  come on kevin you should know better than that.  Its basic movie 101 never forget to explain the history.  I was suprised to see one particualr scene cut short which is at the end when the leader of the holnist clan is defeated only his second in command lays down his gun where the vhs version shows everyone doing it.  DVD's typically have more content,  but they cut that one scene which doesn't make any sense.  But all in all I would have to say the message makes the movie and that is HOPE!  "Hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies" (Tim Robbins, Shawshank Redemption)
