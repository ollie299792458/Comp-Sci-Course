I have heard all sorts of bad reports from various sources and I have to say that in my opinion they are grocely out of context and unforgivably biassed. What are these reviewers thinking ??
I have seen 'The Postman' a number of times both at the cinema, on video and more lately on DVD and I have to say that without a doubt, I believe it is one of the finest films ever produced.
The moment I watched the opening sequence to this film, I knew immediately that it was the closest approximation a 'post-apocalyptic' movie could possibly come to a real-life scenario.
The acting, without exception is superb in every aspect, the scenery and backdrops are profoundly moving and the musical score is brilliantly appropriate.
I would love to write more about this amazing film, however, I believe that unless one truly experiences this fantastic epic in all it's glory then justice simply won't be done.
Watch it and keep an open mind, you may find, just as I did, that some of the subtle undertones are more profoundly meaningfull than you could ever have thought conceivable.
