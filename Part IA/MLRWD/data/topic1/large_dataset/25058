I don't know that much about Chris, but I will comment on this issue. First of all, anyone who suggests that the War for Independence violates Romans 13 is both a shallow theologian and historian. They obviously are not familiar with the traditions of Christian polity that are outlined The Vindicae Contratyrannos or in Lex Rex, which layed out the biblical case for overthrowing a monarch who violates his authority under God.

Secondly, Article 11 in The Treaty of Tripoli is hardly a substantial proof of the true nature of America's traditions. It was a treaty with a Muslim nation, and a treaty by nature contains diplomatic language. What do we then say about the language used in the Treaty of Paris ending the Revolution "In the name of the Holy and undivided Trinity?"

David Barton, like any historian, slants history to some degree, but Barton never claims Paine, Franklin ot Jefferson were ever Christians. Other Founders like Adams and Madison, appeared more orthoxdox during their years of publc service, but moved away from that stance as they grew older. It is dishonest scholarship to take things said in, say, 1820 and apply it as though these were the views held in 1776 or when the Constitution was being framed and ratified. When one claims that certain men were "the least religious of the founders," he cannot avoid making a comparative statement about the commitment of the others.

I conclude with a statement from atheist historian Perry Miller

" Actually, European Deism was an exotic plant in America, which never struck roots in the soil. Rationalism was never so widespread as liberal historians, or those fascinated by Jefferson, have imagined."
