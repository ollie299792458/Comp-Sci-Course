As much as I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters, I was even more excited when it was finally getting the proper treatment that it deserved on DVD and Blu-Ray.  However, even with all the great special features and commentary and sound, there is no trace anywhere of English subtitles nor closed-captioning.  Being one who is hard of hearing, and not able to pick up all of the dialogue (especially when it's quiet and the characters are whispering), I've got a better chance of figuring out the lyrics on a Cannibal Corpse CD than the dialogue in the movie.  Yeah, this is not exactly Shakespeare being recited, but I like being able to get all of the details throughout the movie in case I miss an important plot point or something.  Basically all I'm saying is...shame on the studio and the distributor for not including at least closed-captioning, though subtitles would have been preferred so the whole screen isn't getting boxed out by the text from closed caption.  I definitely would have given this movie a 5-star rating if either one had been included.  Oh well....
