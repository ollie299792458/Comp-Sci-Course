Not too long ago one of my friends asked me "Why Donald?" He was referring to a period in the studio's history (never more prevalant than in the wartime films, available on another DVD) when Donald Duck was the big star. Why, asked my friend, was Donald Duck so wildly popular. More to the point, why did they decide that he would be the ideal star of morale-boosting, patriotism-inspiring war films? The answer is simple: Mickey Mouse is an idealist. He's how people SHOULD be. If the world were more like Mickey, it'd be a happier place. But, despite their overall "When You Wish Upon a Star" attitude (which seems to have died with Walt. Boo, Eisner!) the animators knew that things were not perfect and that the majority of Americans were like Donald Duck. You make fun of his temper-tantrums, but how many times in your life have you blown a fuse over something seemingly unimportant? We are all of us a little bit of Donald Duck...after all, who hasn't felt, at least once in their life, that no one understands us?
That's kind of a nice thought, isn't it?
