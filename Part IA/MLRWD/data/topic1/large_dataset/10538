Check it out yourself.  Much better than some of the reviews

indicate.  At least I thought it was a better movie than others rated it.  Compare it to junk like "Taking Lives".  At almost every moment you're still guessing.  Who's the killer?  How will this play out?  (In Taking Lives you've got a predictable plot and ending, horrid acting, a stupid story...)  Why couldn't I guess where this was going, but I could figure out every other movie I've ever seen in the first five minutes?  I don't know.  Perhaps this one is too off the wall, or perhaps because it's actually very predictable... but in too many ways simultaneously.  Perhaps it has TOO MANY cliches, too many possible obvious developments, too many paths... so many that you aren't sure which path the writers will take... and then that path appears to have several possible branches, etc.  It really kept me guessing the whole way through.  Perhaps you'd rather just passively watch a movie... or perhaps like me you're tempted to figure it out early.  But every time you think you've guessed it, you think again and come up with another guess, and then another.  I think it's pretty good.  Not just a one guess movie.
