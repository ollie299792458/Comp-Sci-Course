Another reviewer has said it all perfectly, and I couldn't agree with you more Mark Novell. Those who think this is a 'black comedy' or a 'camp horror flick' don't know how to look into a film too far and wouldn't know talent if it came up and hit them!
The talent is obvious in the writers and whoever dreamed up this story. Robert Aldrich did brilliant direction (as he did on Hush...Hush... Sweet Charlotte also showcasing Davis losing her mind). And speaking of Bette Davis, in those days there weren't too many actresses willing to look frumpy and ugly. She relished it until she saw herself on screen for the first time when she ran out crying.
It was criminal that the Queen of Hollywood didn't get the Academy Award for her performance. Joan Crawford was a bit restricted in her role simply because of the character she played. Victor Buono, in his first feature role I think, was nominated for an Oscar and you'll see why. He was talented enough to show so many emotions and be comedic at the right times without overdoing it.
Get this DVD and be marvelled at the talent.
Good viewing!
