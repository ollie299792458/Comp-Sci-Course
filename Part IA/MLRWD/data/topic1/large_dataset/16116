fright night is a classic vampire movie made in the 1980s.  william ragsdale, one of the main characters in the movie, is a teenager who discovers his next door neighbor, the very sexy Chris Sarandon, is a  vampire.  by attempting to reveal to the community Chris's identity, he  enlists the help of an aging film star (roddy mcdowell).  when ragsdale  reallizes that the vampire is after his girlfriend (amanda bearse), he will  stop at nothing to save her, even if that means losing his life.  i  love this movie! i forst watched it when i was 11 and have rented it almost  every weekend after that.  i am now almost 17.  this movie is classic.  chris sarandon is the most gorgeous guy in the world.  he is  so seductive!  the chemistry between him and bearse is amazing.  ragsdale holds his own  and accurately depicts the typical dramas of teenager's lives, reacting to  most situations the same.  stephen geofferys is also an excellent edition  to the movie.  evil is a classic outcast who relies on the vamp to relieve  his pain.  AWESOME MOVIE!
