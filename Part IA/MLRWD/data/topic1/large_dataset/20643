I am a huge horror fan. I think the original Hills Have Eyes is a classic. So I was sad when I found the new one is an empty headed waste. Remakes are best when they find a new angle on a story, or have something to add to what the first film did. Great remakes such as The Thing or The Fly work because the filmmakers created movies that use the original as a starting point and then go off in their own direction - much like the remake of Dawn of the Dead.

Hills have eyes is almost a shot for shot redo in the vein of Psycho at times. It misses the entire point of the original film - that we are only as civilized as our world allows. None of the interesting parallel between the two families remains (one from the 'burbs the other a clan of cannibal mutants). Instead we just get loads and loads of gore without any impact whatsoever.

I like gory movies as much as the next person. I love Blood Feast, Romero's zombie films, Re-animator, the movies of Lucio Fulci, etc. But those films had something more then just gore. They were creative, inventive, some were fun, some were scary. This lame rehash of Hills is none of those things. I can't stress what a waste of time this so called picture is. It only attempts to revolt the viewer and fails at even that since you are so uninvolved in the films events. I couldn't have cared less about what was happening on screen. It left me feeling nothing at all. Not fear, joy, pain, relief, empathy, disgust - nothing. The filmmakers failed. And you would do well to stick with the brilliant original Wes Craven film.  This was a lame excuse for a horror movie.
