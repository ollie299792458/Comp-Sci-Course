The nWo was by far the most influential angle and faction to ever hit the pro wrestling scene.  It forever changed the way wrestling was booked and promoted.
This is a great DVD for those fans who witnessed the birth of the nWo in WCW.  WWE has done a masterful job of giving us the history of the nWo and the reasons why Hall, Nash, and Hogan left WWF in the first place.  There are some fanstastic clips of Hall and Nash's early WWF career and even a fuzzy (assumed) home video clip of "The Cliq" breaking kayfabe at Madison Square Garden before Hall and Nash left for WCW.
We're treated to the rise of the nWo and the part that Hulk Hogan played in getting it off the ground.  Many great moments are chronicled like Eric Bischoff getting powerbombed off the stage, The Outsiders "invading" WCW Nitro, the nWo taking over a Nitro broadcast, and the revelation that it was Eric Bischoff who was pulling the nWo's strings.  Let's not forget the timeless clip of Nash launching Rey Mysterio Jr. like a lawn dart into the tv production's truck trailer.  Great stuff!
Unfortanetly there are some key moments in nWo history that are not mentioned.  The battles with Sting, the split into the Woflpac and Hollywood factions, the battles with Goldberg, and the reunification of nWo Wolfpac and nWo Hollywood.  Those were key moments in nWo history and it's too bad that WWE did not feel obliged to give that back to the fans.  It just seems that WWE was more interested in jumping to their version of the nWo, that's not good.
The extras are good.  The War Games with the nWo vs. WCW is a classic and was great to see again.  The inclusion of the "night after" WM X-8 is a good touch as well as the nWo vs. Austin and Rock tag match.
If you are a fan of the nWo, then jump in, you won't be dissapointed.  
Peace.
