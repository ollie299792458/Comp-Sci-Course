The Tudors is an excellent period-drama loosely based around the reign of Henry VIII. It's got a terrific cast of actors and colorful production design that really draws you into this time of history. You can tell from the very first episode how hard the production crew worked to get every costume and every set piece down and it gives the show an air of authenticity lacking in most historical-dramas (when I say authentic I don't mean 'historically-accurate' as this show takes many liberties with history).

The plots of each episode usually play off the previous episode before it with each season focusing on a particular set of events in Henry VIII's rule. We get a very linear view of events through different character's eyes including the clergy as well as the monarchy. While none of the characters are particularly likeable, least of all King Henry himself the actor's playing them are very watchable and charismatic. The political/sexual intrigue and how Henry's decisions effect everyone around him is what makes the show addictive and will have you gunning through this series.

This boxed set comes in a book-format  with the discs tucked away in sleeves on each page. Usually I don't like sleeved sets like this but the cardboard is glossed over making pulling of the discs out easier and you won't get fibers covering and scratching the discs. Again I would have preferred jewel cases but with the amount of extras included on the final disc (that are actual EXTRAS not free TV episodes) I can still recommend this set.

I obviously love this show and found amazon's $80 a steal for handsome sets, excellent costumes, terrific writing and attractive actors(though still no subtitles...but allows closed-captioning). Until the planned 'The Borgias' series airs The Tudor's is Showtime's best airing and a must-see historical epic!
