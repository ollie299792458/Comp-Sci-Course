This movie was sad at best.  What made it really bad was the waste of a good story.  Greek mythology is teaming with epic movies and this story is one just not this movie.  From my knowledge Hyperion was a Titans, so I guess this guy took the name as a metaphor between the battle in heaven where the Titans (Original God) fell to the new gods, Zeus and his boys.  I'm not sure but that's what I got out of it.

The movie was slow and the story was confusing and non linear.  You just wait for the good to happen and it never does.  The Brazen Bull is a good touch.

The Props were bad they used rebar for everything.  I didn't realize rebar had been around for so long and was capable of holding gods, in all of Hollywood they couldn't find something better than rebar. The Bow was purchased from the nearest sports store and had some crap glued to the handle and painted black.  I didn't realize the gods were into carbon fiber limbs and sight mounts, just sad.  Then the armor.  It was metal of some kind but when Theseus takes it off in the Titan cave in crumples like it fabric of some kind.  Those type of errors are just awful in big budget movies today.

This is nothing like 300, a great movie.  It's a sad example of a studio trying to cash in.
