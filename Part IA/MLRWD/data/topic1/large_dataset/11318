Euripides and Michael Cacoyannis (director of Zorba the Greek) combine creatively in this powerful anti-war film.

Essentially, this  stunninglyly acted  film dramatises, poignantly and  shockingly, the repercussions on the innocent of the union of egomania, the ambition for power and warmongering.

The juxtaposition of  and  intense tension between the male and female worlds, ie the violent vs the lifegivers, the state  vs the family, is tightly contained within prisons within prisons.

Just as the sacred deer is trapped and  slaughtered by soldiers, so too the beautiful Iphigenia is trapped  and slaughtered by the corruption of power and the lust for war. Agamennon is trapped by his ambition, pride and the military,  consequently Clytemenestra is trapped by Agamemnon's decision to sacrifice their daughter.

It is only the innocent Iphigenia who emerges with phenomenal human dignity thereby intensifying the personal and universal tragedy caused by war and egomanic power.

Iphigenia, is both ancient and.... present in the  slaughtered children in Iraq.
