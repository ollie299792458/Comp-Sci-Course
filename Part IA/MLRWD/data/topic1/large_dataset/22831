This is a must have for any Doctor fan.......ANY Doctor fan......the chemistry that Zoe, Jamie and the Troughton Doctor had was amazing........I'd have to say that while i have my personal favorites as to who is the best Doctor (Tom Baker), that this era has to be the single best chemistry between companions........during the last season, the writers wanted to kill off Jamie, but he refused to be written off when he found out that Troughton was in his last season.......and Troughton fought for him to stay and Frazier (Jamie) was there until season's end.....that's chemistry and loyalty
OK, enuff behind the scenes......here's the story.........the TARDIS  has a "Panic Button" that is activated when it is threatened with being overrun with a flow of lava........Troughton warns that there is no telling where they will end up........well, it is outside  time and space, outside of known reality.......they materialize in a plane of exsistance where a single being shapes all reality........they face common (and not so common) mythical beings such as a Minotaur, Unicorn, Guliver and Repunzel (and others from Zoe's world unknown to us Humans).......they get hunted by Toy Soldiers (who have an unnerving methodical rhythmic march that gives them an inhuman quality, similar to Cybermen but without that personality) and strange "White Robots" all after they wander out of the TARDIS and no longer know for sure that their TARDIS is the real one or a fictional one created by that (inapropriately named adversary) "The Master"...........well, Troughton and the Master (which i re-iterate is not THE "Master") have to face off with a "battle of the wits", with each of them writing reality with their own words........oh, i can't go on (and i wouldn't want to spoil that battle, which is great)........but as far as another review naming this a cross of Dr Who, Twilight Zone and Outer Limits....I'd say that is right on........weirdness and an epic era for Who, thus my ascertion as a must have.....Nuff Said
