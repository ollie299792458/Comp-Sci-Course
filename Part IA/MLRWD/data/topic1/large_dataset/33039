I consider _Year of the Dog_ to be one of the year's best films, but not, perhaps, for everybody.  Only those who have lived closely to animals or those who are capable of unselfish sympathy will be able to recognize and appreciate the subtleties of this film.  Yet, for those who can appreciate it, it is very worthwhile, and for those who cannot, perhaps they will learn something valuable.

Molly Shannon plays an introverted single woman who lives alone with her dog, whom she loves dearly.  One day, the dog gets dies unexpectedly, which, of course, has an immense impact on the woman.  This is not, however, a movie about one woman's loss, but about the implications of having a truly caring soul.  Shannon's character becomes an exploration of the many paths down which such a love can lead us.

Those who care about animals will find this movie to be a sensitive, uncomfortably realistic echo of their own thoughts and experiences.  (Finally, a movie portrays animal rights activists as real people with legitimate goals.)  Funny at times, heart-rending at others, at other times both, this is a film not only about animals, but the impact they have on those who care for them.  It is a film that could change your life.
