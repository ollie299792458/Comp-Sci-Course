I enjoyed Babylon A.D. and purchased the Blu-ray from Amazon. Vin Diesel is not the bigger than life character seen in most of his other movies. He is tough but begins to show more human elements like caring and self-sacrifice. These are traits some don't expect in a Vin Diesel movie. The girl he is transporting from China to the U.S. is charismatic. She is hauntingly beautiful and appears to be a savior. She is fragile like in the Fifth Element, but turns out to be something completely different like Blade Runner.

The action scenes are great and kept the movie exciting. Some scenes of the movie reminded me of Mad Max and Doomsday.
Strong performances from great actresses like Charlotte Rampling and Michele Yeoh also added positively to the movie.

The ending was a disappointment as others mentioned. The movie is good but not great. It could have been better if it were made longer to develop story sub-plots.

The Blu-ray is sharp and delivers powerful DTS Master Audio effects.
I liked the movie and will be watching it more than once.
