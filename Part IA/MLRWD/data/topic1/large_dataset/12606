This is a natively widescreen and Hi-Def anime, so the quality of this Blu-ray is among the best transfers out there for animated features.

The story is incomplete in this series: There are at least two movies that extend the plot beyond this series.  I wish I had known that prior to this purchase, as now I've signed up for at least two additional purchases.

The English dub is a quality one, and the main characters are thoroughly likable.  The story starts with our hero, awakening from a trance-like state naked in front of The White House with a cell phone and a gun.  From there, we follow him as he tries to piece together his lost memories and make sense of the bizarre circumstance in which he finds himself.

I was amused by the early use of familiar western pop culture references.  There is just enough violence and intrigue to keep you coming back after each episode.  Where other anime series often have throw-away episodes, this series stays on point.  There was only one uniquely Japanese reference that didn't make initial sense to me: NEET.  This is apparently the equivalent of a hermit or socially inept shut-in.  Would have been nice to know that from the beginning.  Aside from that, the series strikes me as culturally relevant for the times we live in, and it will be interesting to see how long we must wait for this show to seem dated.
