I'v been waiting for this fine film to come out on DVD for sa long time.  The dancing, acting, writing of this film are wonderful.  The Take of with Us dance, the Katie and Michelle dance, and the Bye Bye Love dance are just dazzling.  Roy Scheider brings this character to life and the surreal sequences are excellent.  Ann Reinking's (spelling?) legs are phenominal!  I really enjoy the "Take Off with Us" sequence where the director takes a terrible song, works out a creative and solid dance routine which is well received, then takes it to a further level of brilliance which no one , except his ex-wife, can appreciate (even though she curses him due to the fact that it was the emptinesss of his infidelity to her that fueled the artistic creation).  As far as the DVD picture and sound quality,  YUCK!  The film is actually splicey in places, colors wash out, and the sound is mediocre at best.  It's as if they transferred the vhs onto a disc using their laptop.  Now, the price is quite cheap, but I'll pay more for a cleaned up transfer.  This film is really an interesting creative journey, and I think people will pay for a collector's edition with enhanced sound and CLEAN UP the film.  A shouldn't see splotches on every other scene.
