This show holds a special place in my heart.  I was 10 when it premiered, and it's what got me into a life of comic-book collecting.

The one thing that gets me the most about this show is the nostalgic factor.  While I watched every single episode when it first aired, this show was never available in syndication after its initial run and it's left me nothing but memories - until now.

Yes, the acting is pretty bad.  In many of the scenes the actors will fumble on their lines.  Yes, the special effects were terrible, and even I could see that at age 10.  And yes, the stories are pretty pedestrian.

But as I started watching the DVD's, I realized I couldn't stop.  Something about this series was magical.  Maybe it was it's innocence, maybe it was the fact that it felt like it was trying really, really hard.  And maybe its because we'll never get a series like this again.

I have to wonder if there's a camp factor to this first season that people watching the original "Batman" series 20 years ago would have felt.  I can't say for sure, all I can say is that I've had a pretty good time watching this set.

Let's hope this one does well so that we'll get to see seasons 2, 3, and 4.  That's when the show started to get really good.
