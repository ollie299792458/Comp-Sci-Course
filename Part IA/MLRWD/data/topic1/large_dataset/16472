Okay, so I've read the books and played the games, and without a doubt love the franchise. For those of you who relate to that, I don't need to tell you how pissed I was after seeing the first live action movie. "What the hell is an Alice?!" I said to my mother. Each subsequent film has only served to stir up a combination of deep resentment and confusion. What did I do to deserve this, Screengems?

All that said, I happened to stop at my local Redbox just to see what was new, when I saw RE: Damnation. I thought, "S**t! That better be Alice-less!"; It was! It has all of the elements that you'd expect from the game; that does include many of the cliches associated with the genre. The graphics were beautiful (with the exception of a perspective issue on one of the characters, but that's neither here nor there). Leonissuperfoxy, ehem. It felt like more than just video game cinemas edited together, unlike some others that I've seen. It is my hope... No, my greatest hope that the current live action franchise spontaneously combusts, and the team responsible for this animated movie swoops in like Batman with a bad ass android film crew, and does their own live action film. I would also settle for Joss Whedon or Chris Nolan, in addition to those involved with RE:Damnation. Too late to make a long story short, so the primary message here is: Watch it!

That is all.
