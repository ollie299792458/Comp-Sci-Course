This fast paced classic was the vehicle for Hackmans prodigious talent and a lot more besides.It tells the story of two Detectives who pick up the scent of a major drug bust. loosely based on an actual case the script traces the unrelenting efforts of these Detectives played by Hackman (Popeye Doyle)and scheider (Cloudy Russo)to identify the main players behind one of the biggest drug importations up to that time.This movie unlike the later sequel was reasonably true to the general facts of the actual case although it chooses to ignore the fact that the drugs were in fact stolen after they had been seized, which was most probably an inside job as they were stolen from the custody of the Police. It is a mystery why this aspect did not form the storyline of the sequel when in fact the script writers chose a completely fictional theme for the sequel, but then I guess what really went down did not lend itself to an exciting storyline especially when the case was never completely solved.The movie itself is carried by the stellar performances of Hackman and Sheider and is further enhanced by a great location and a better than average supporting cast. The part of Alain Charnier or Frog One was perfectly cast with the very fine actor Fernando Rey producing a stand out performance in both movies. It would not do the movie justice if it were merely remembered for the brilliant car chase although car chase buffs would no doubt disagree. That the movie won as many oscars that year is testimony to its greatness. Hackman showed in spades in this landmark performance that he was Hollywood top shelf and went on to excell in many more although none better than this in my opinion. This was Hackmans defining role as was Patton with respect to George C Scott. A very watchable film somewhat drawn out in parts but never boring. A true classic in many ways.
