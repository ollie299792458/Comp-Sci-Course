Well !!  what can i say about this absolutly fantastic film, Rene Zellweger performed brilliantly, the accent was great I couldnt have done a better job myself and yes I am English. The performances which Hugh Grant and Colin Firth portrayed was just as brilliant, but sorry boys Rene tops you both.
I dont think I have laughed so much for a long long time, well not as much as the belly laughs I had when watching the film. I was fixed to the screen the whole time which i would say , on my head be it, so would everbody else's who see's it. 
There is not a lot I could say without going through the whole film talking about every little bit which was thoroughly enjoyed, oh yes every little bit,.  My congratulations goes out to all the actors , directors and producers, and all other persons involved in the making of this outstanding film you deserve the Oscar and I do not mean just ONE of those gold little men, I am talking multiple here.
But ending here WELL !! what can I say but absolutely ... FANTASTIC A must see and a  definately MUST have film. Enjoy and laugh.
