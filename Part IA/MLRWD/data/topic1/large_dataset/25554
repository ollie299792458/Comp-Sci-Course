This is one of the movies that if I come across it when I'm channel surfing, no matter where it is during the film, I always watch it to the end.  Every time.  The cast defines the sentence "There are no small parts, only small actors."  There isn't a small actor in the bunch.  The ensemble has a chemistry that only comes from a true appreciation for each other's work.  Anne DeSalvo, Bill Macy, Lanie Kazan, etc. all make the most of their screen time without crowding anyone else out.  Selma Diamond sparkles roughly with every appearance.  It's set during the romantic 50's when television was just beginning.  Peter O'Toole is a fading movie star who is doing a guest appearance on a sketch comedy show.  His alcohol fueled escapades require the studo to enlist Mark Linn-Baker as a chaperone until the show is broadcast.  The film doesn't beat you over the head with messages or morals, I just felt satisfyingly entertained.  It's nice to see a movie that you're comfortable watching with your parents or grandparents.  My DVD collection is getting a little bloated, however, this is one I was willing to add.
