Although this is a fairly well-done movie, it is obvious that many of the actors are 'acting' - that is, they have not done enough acting to forget that they are acting instead of 'being the character.' It also raises some important spiritual issues, especially for families of faith.  To understand this movie, one must believe in what most people call the spirit 'world.'  [In this movie, they sort of likened it so some kind of Cosmic Internet.]  It is also important to understand that in that realm there are both good and evil spirits.  [We could not know what good spirits are if there were no evil spirits.]  In Judeo-Christian culture, God is the leader of the good spirits; Satan or the devil is the leader of the evil spirits.

While I commend the movie makers for addressing such an issue, I think they should have made clear that there is both a good and dark side of human interaction with such spiritual forces.  I also think it should have been shown through some kind of established religious institution; it is through the experience and spiritual wisdom of one's spiritual body that one learns to recognize the good from evil spiritual forces.  The absence of such a foundation may leave one exposed to forces of evil they may not recognize if they try to 'play' with these spiritual forces.

Within that context, it is a pretty good story.  It probably would have been better if the plot had been simplified and focused more on how little Grace was able to tap into the spirit world and even why she was able to do it.  Still, this movie should provide lots of discussion for traditional values families, especially families of spiritual faith.  There should be lots to talk about for families that don't believe in such spiritual forces, as well.
