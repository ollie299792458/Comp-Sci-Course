There is no ability present to offer a sunflower seed to be the equal to a human being.It is further suggested that though some out of space meteor shower of a sort might provide just such a condition that that condition is so far fetched as not to be serious.There does not, simply put, exist proof of any kind whereby a human being could be so suckered as to be a walking talking sunflower seed.This most certainly is not a funny film and it certainly is not a friendly film.If what the film appears to suggest in that this particular kind of personality is as a result of some meteor shower then liberties are stretched to a point whereby the suggestion is not provable.The offense to this nonsense rests on the suggestive hysteria that indeed what is not provable has in fact been proven.How in the world would such an event occur whereby what is not possible has occurred? The supposition further is as illiterate as it is in fact not true.The stretch here is in fact that though there are no sunflower seeds walking around there is in fact a world whereby we know not of what is this world we live in.The fear that is running amok has nothing to suggest that there is in fact any basis for such conduct be it provable or not.The complication is that this nonsense is made neither intelligent nor is conduct truly unseemly.It is a curious problem that though conduct is not out of sorts there appears to be a look-a like resting or perhaps evolving inside of a sea pod.I really in fact did not see this as an interesting discovery.It was equally difficult to place the fear that this motion picture seems to have established in its claim to fame.Outside of the apparent suggestion there is mostly a unprovable supposition that has no value ouside of the hysteria it engenders.That is interesting and does mean something other than merely a unprovable suppostion.The film only has that as having any interest that there seems to be some fella running around telling all that will listen that the skies are falling,the skies are falling.I do not know of how to look further other than that the wanton hysteria is all I really recalled as it was the only element that was worth a listen.The film though is useful as in reality there would not be any assistance whereby there is assistance in this Motion Picture.It is more to the point a very mis-leading telling of a story that has no basis in reality.Iam really not of the opinion that this film is just so, however a different day may need to be to place properly how out of sorts such a claim to fame really is.This film may very well be generated by the very leanest of considerations whereby it most certainly is that.It is not an attractive film it is not even an interesting film however when greater political theatre is looked at this is closer to being dangerous and even unhealthy than merely paranoic.
