You will find humor, sadness, love and even some of your own family in this movie. If your looking for some humor, and the bonds of friendship from child to seniors this is it. A humorous touch on family, friends, and the bond they hold. The bond of friendship & love for each other and those who protect each others secrets.

Four young girls who are friends and remain friends into adult and senior years create a club as young teens. The Ya- Ya Sisters, they keep each others secrets, & have each others backs through laughs, sorrows, and a small case of mental illness (in those times it was not discussed). They grow up in Lousiana during WWII as young adults. They are wild and in one case in love. Then that love is shattered and the two most affected are the sister of the young man who is killed, and the friend who was in love with him and never really forgets or looses that love.

Then come marriages for all four and children all who grow up together. As the children become adults the trouble begins with one mother and daughter. Who although can not see the similarities of each other. The humor and laughs through out the movie start to become even more evident. Then there is the kidnaping of the daugther by the Ya-Ya's. You'll have to see the movie for the rest.
