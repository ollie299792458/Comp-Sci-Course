I saw more in this movie than a story about the CIA.  I saw an exaggerated tale of what many men close to power, whether in the business or political worlds, go through to achieve their business ends.  Yes, family and a semblance of humanity are not always sacrificed, but there are those -- call them workaholics, drudges, whatever -- to whom work and order are more important than family and friends.  These men enter a cerebral world where they have to live by something not taught at Yale -- their wits -- to survive.

These men (and some women) are all around us.  There are decisions made thousands of times a day to put business or political objectives before family and friends, though not always with the dramatic alienation that this movie depicts.  But every such decision, compounds over time to produce alienation from loved ones.  This movie offers a tale of how a bright and apparently sensitive young man can be molded into a husk of himself by devotion to "pleasing his superiors" and success at all costs, rooted in a 'love of country'.

Matt Damon gives a particularly fine performance.

On a lesser scale of importance, the movie provides a much-needed public airing of the connections between the Bonesmen and the CIA.
