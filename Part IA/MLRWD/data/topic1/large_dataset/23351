Although this movie may not be favoured upon by your top-notch reviewers such as Leonard Maltin, Gone in 60 Seconds is a riveting tale of action-packed drama and excitement, made by first-time director H.B. Halicki, who also wrote, produced, and starred in the movie as Maindrian Pace, a professional car-thief whose front is insurance investigation, and his job is stealing cars. In order to complete a new contract, Pace and his gang have to steal and switch over 40 cars in a week. All of them are easy, that is, except for the last: Eleanor - a '73 Ford Mustang that takes you on the most fantastic car chase ever! After his boss double-crosses Pace, a 40-minute demoltion derby evolves with 93 cars being destroyed and Pace using the most hair-raising tactics to outrun the endless number of police. The chase ends in a spectacular 128-foot jump through the air as Pace escapes the overwhelming number of police pursuing him. This movie is what started the car-chase epic and features some of the most exotic and luxurious cars ever made. If you want action, then you want Gone in 60 Seconds. It's a smash!
