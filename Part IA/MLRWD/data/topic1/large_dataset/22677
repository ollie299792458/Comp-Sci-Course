This isn't a serious or "meaningful" film.  It is pure entertainment, beautifully photographed on location in Egypt.  The stars, Robert Taylor and Eleanor Parker, had great chemistry both off-screen and on.  Taylor manages to be glamorous even when trapped in a sandstorm.  The plot is relatively thin with Parker seeking to validate part of the Old Testament by finding the tomb of the Pharaoh who reigned in the time of the Biblical Joseph. She bats her eyelashes at Taylor who comes along happily. Then she introduces her husband, Carlos Thompson.  There are horse and carriage chases, murders, the aforementioned sandstorm, a spectacular fight at Abu Simbel, a scorpion attack--all in ninety minutes.  Given the slower pace of movies in the 1950s, there is also time for Taylor and Parker to discover each other more thoroughly (over some fermented goat).  Egyptian belly dancer Samia Gamal shakes her stuff at the demure Parker.  The film isn't currently available on DVD but the WB Archive is releasing lots of new titles each month so they may get to this gem.
