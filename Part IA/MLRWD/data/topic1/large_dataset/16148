This is the first half of the Clannad story.  'After Story' covers the other half.

Like AirTV and Kanon this show has a lot of the same themes and ideas, but this series takes a much less fantastical approach to the story telling.  It still has moments of fantasy, but it is more of a 'faith' based inexplicable force through the series that holds the background together rather than being the main event.

This first half is much less dramatic than Air or Kanon (don't worry, the 2nd half more than makes up for it), following the carefree and directionless days of Senior highschoolers whose 'plan A' did not work out, and they are desperately searching for some form of validation or direction to move in to gain some meaning to their lives.  Specifically it focuses on Tomoyo whose dreams of being a sports prodigy failed, and he finds some meaning in life in helping Nagisa fulfill her passion of resurrecting the school's drama club.  The first half of the series meanders about following different plot archs that do not really relate to eachother, but tie the lives of these characters together to collectively achieve Nagisa's dream.

Good story telling, fun characters, high drama, reminded me a lot of my life and friends from high school, addictive sound track, and solid voice acting... even the English version is good.  Definitely one to watch with your significant other.  There are some aspects of the fantasy and art style that I like better about Kanon, but in many ways I love this better due to it's relate-ability.
