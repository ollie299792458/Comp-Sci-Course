This film is a great late 70's classic, despite (or is it because?) of its paper-thin plot and low-budget production.  The Tall Man is a relentless foe who pursues overly-curious 13-year-old Michael Pearson. Mike discovers the towering undertaker is no ordinary funeral director.  The Tall Man's real job is to process corpses into 3-foot dwarves that he ships to another planet to perform slave duties.  Mike's crusade is joined by his brother Jody, who cool guy image is not enhanced by the scenes of him wearing a ridiculous looking pith helmet while strumming the guitar, and pal Reggie, who wears a huge bow tie and peddles ice cream.  Along the way there are car chases, gun battles and hand to hand combat with evil little dwarves that bleed yellow oily stuff.  The ending is a tad predictable, but provides a good lead in to the second film, which was mediocre.  The 3rd and 4th ones were progressively bad.  The original Phantasm, however, remains a decent flick for afficianados of horror and cult films.
