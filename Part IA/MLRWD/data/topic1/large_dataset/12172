This movie was my first lesson in how low-budget, B-horror movies don't all have to be cheesy and awful.

I caught the tail end (is that a pun? ;) of this movie several times on the Sci Fi (back then, that's how it was spelled ;) channel, but never was able to catch the beginning. I thought it was really good, but didn't realize how good until I got the DVD as a gift one year and could finally watch the whole thing.

Suspenseful with a good backstory and likable characters that you just can't help but root for, this movie is really well done, especially since you don't even SEE what's scary until more than halfway through. I feel that the werewolves in this movie are the scariest werewolves I've ever seen--gangly, impossibly tall and intimidating humanoids with snarling wolf heads atop them.

I docked a star because I didn't like the end--or, rather, I am still confused about what really happened and why! I don't understand Megan's role in the whole thing. How did she become a werewolf? Is she actually part of the family or was she just visiting while researching? Why did she betray the men and all of a sudden decide to help the wolves instead, letting them into the house? If she's a werewolf, why didn't she change into one earlier in the evening when the others did? Etc.

Oh, and Spoon's death scene (and one-liner accompanying it) is the best death scene in any horror movie ever. Period. You go, Spoonie. I nearly added the fifth star back on, just for that.
