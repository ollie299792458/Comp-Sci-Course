Rita Hayworth went down in Hollywood history as the Love Goddess.  Her title role in *Gilda* (Columbia Pictures, 1946) leaves no doubt why.  Yet here she is much more than a sex symbol. For one thing, Rita was a seriously talented actress.  For another, she was one of the best dancers in films.  To this day her performance in *Gilda* remains unrivaled as a combo of talent, sensuality, sensitivity, and sheer drop-dead pulchritude.  Columbia's catchy ad-phrase for the film was, "There never was a woman like Gilda."  You'd better believe it. Glenn Ford perfectly fills out the character of Johnny Farrel, the young gambler who hates to love femme fatale Gilda.  In return, Gilda loves to hate Johnny.  George MacReady offers an outstanding performance as murderous Ballin Mundson, the man Gilda fears.
If you like movies that challenge the viewer to figure out hidden meanings, then *Gilda* is for you.  "Maybe that stands for something," Rita-as-Gilda says near the beginning; "Maybe that means something," she says near the end.  Halfway through she says, "Any psychiatrist would say that means something." The question of interpretation hangs over the entire film, loaded as it is with symbolism and double-entendres.  
On the other hand, you can ignore the subtext and enjoy *Gilda* as a noirish romantic mystery-thriller.  It's a beautiful flick to look at in black and white, and it's never boring, even all the decades since it was made.  Some reviewers say the plot is difficult to follow.  I don't agree; the story is both logical and economical.  But that may be because I understand *Gilda* to be a dramatized introduction to the psychological concepts of C.G. Jung.  Never mind.  If you like your movies to be just movies, *Gilda* tastefully blends ingredients from *Casablanca*, *The Maltese Falcon*, *Notorious* and *The Big Sleep*, then stirs in its own original sauce.  In my opinion, it's an improvement upon those classics, as fine as they are by themselves.  
I wouldn't call *Gilda* a true film noir, for the reason that at the end the male and female leads are triumphant instead of tormented.  Great films of the 1940s that had real "noir" (black) denouements are *Criss Cross*, *Detour*, *Double Indemnity*, *Scarlet Street*, *The Killers* and *The Postman Always Rings Twice*.  Still, on their way to a happy ending Johnny and Gilda pass through a landscape that is darker and more suggestive of spiritual abandonment than most '40s film noirs dared explore.  At the same time, because of the intense chemistry between the leads, *Gilda* sizzles hotter than any film of that period I can think of.  
Love the music too.  Five stars.  They just don't make 'em like this any more.
