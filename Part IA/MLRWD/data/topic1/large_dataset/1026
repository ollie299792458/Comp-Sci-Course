For me to give a 5-star rating to any Jim Carrey movie, before I saw this 1, I'd say you'd see the sun rise in the west first; or see Bush become a Christian!
Very very small-the ending, kind of leaves 1 hanging; especially with Natascha's character when she rejoices over Carrey's choice and throws on her coat and runs out the door, where's she going? To him?
But for what the movie is and attempts to accomplish, BRAVO x 1000. To qualify, for people who are not into a surreal brand of movie, without question, avoid this one!
Ed Harris' character Christof? Like Carrey's, bravo! A little malevolent, at the end when he tells Truman to choose to stay; is it love, or control? Masterfully played! And Laura Linney, always outstanding. Natascha McElhone? First roll I've seen her in but, as with Harris and Carrey, very poignantly played!

Some of the philosophical questions attacked, interestingly enough, are issues, and choices, America is contending with today.
What is it we're seeking? security, with the known and totally controlled, or the adventure of the unknown, freedom, and exploration?
How do we define sickness? completely controlling a human being's life for ratings, or the rest of the world itself gone completely mad with rising crime and a government we don't seem to be able to control any more, and an apathetic spirit which chooses to just disengage?
Is it sick/wrong for the network or corporation or whomever it is to claim ownership over Truman, in an obvious capacity, when in a more invidious one we delusionally call ourselves free today at the same time government has virtually reduced us to slaves?
What is it Goethe says, "None are more easily enslaved than those who call their slavery freedom"? Truman's mistake-discovering the game; when are we? If you like movies like "V For Vendetta" you'll like this 1 too.
