"Changing Lanes" is one of my most favorite drama movies. Its plot mainly focuses on the relationship of two normal guys, Doyle Gipson and Gavin Banek , who have totally different social backgrounds, and how they ended up to realize what is right and wrong.  Doy Gipson, played by Samuel L. Jackson, was a car insurrance salesman, and Gavin Banek,played by Ben Affleck, was a lawyer, who worked for his father-in-law, a dishonest man who tried to steal the one-million foundation from other members in the board for himself. The car accident caused by Gavin in one morning day had almost changed the two men's life forever. As a result,Gipson was late for the divorcise court to inform his wife and kids that he has just bought the new house, and to express his endless desireness to be a great husband and father. On the other hand, Gavin, who accidentally dropped the important document while writting a check to Gipson, couldn't win his case, and his life was threatened, which he had to find the document or he would be going to jail.  Frustration between two men grew intensely as they tried all attempts to revenge each others. Gavin cut off Gipson's credit lines and did some tricks that sunk Gipson deeply into family issues and financial troubles. While Gipson almost killed Gavin by taking apart Gavin car's wheel. However, at the end, they came to understand each others more, and their reconcillation helped them to realize that the hatred had drawn them into the world of sin, evilness and guilt of the modern society. This movie has acutally made me concentrate so hard and held my interest 'til the end.  The other reason I gave this movie 5 stars is the uniqueness of this movie. The movie goes beyond the "drama" means, it sent the good messages. It taught me a valuble and moral lessons that revenging doesnt' help solving or winning anything, and you can never get enough revenge without paying for it each time.
