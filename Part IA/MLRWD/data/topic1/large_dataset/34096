Take one unfaithful wife, a mentally unstable husband, and throw in a young couple on their honeymoon who get mixed up in a murder plot, and you've got Marilyn Monroe's best film, "Niagara"!!  My personal favorite Marilyn film used to be "The Seven Year Itch", until I saw this one.  Expertly directed by Henry Hathaway, "Niagara" will take your breath away with it's awesome views of Niagara falls and colorful scenery.  The plot, about a cheating wife (Monroe) who plots to kill her husband (Joseph Cotton) is of course nothing new in filmmaking, but here, it is done so well, and with such a great twist, that it pretty much outshines other films with a similar storyline.  The beautiful Jean Peters and her on-screen hubby, Casey Adams, make the perfect honeymoon couple who get involved in a real mess thanks to Marilyn and Joseph.  Also on hand is big Don Wilson who, with his on-screen wife, adds a wonderful touch of merriment to an otherwise tense story.  Actually, Don practically steals the show! His performance as the big lovable boss of Adams' character is one of the things that make "Niagara" so much fun to watch.  Definately worth 5 stars, "Niagara" is one great film with great actors, believable characters, a good script, and a big finish that will have you on the edge of your seat!!
