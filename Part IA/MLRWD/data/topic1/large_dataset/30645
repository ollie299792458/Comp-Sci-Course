This film seems to cover all of the bases-fast-paced action, peerless performances, and hysterical dialogue (but a warning, they are all saturated with the vernacular of stressed-out, potty-mouthed stock  brokers). Although some reviews have said the script is convoluted and  lacks direction, I entirely disagree. The script contains scenes that  reveal the many dilemmas that plague Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) - his struggle  to gain the approval of his inhibited father, a federal judge; his fight to  live with himself; and his need for redemption. It is obvious that it is  quite difficult to find films that are so tightly and expertly woven these  days, but overlooked films like `The Boiler Room' confirm that there are  still writers and directors out there who know how to do their job  competently.
Ben Affleck has a memorable cameo as the guy who motivates  the young brokers-to-be. Vin Diesel's role is small but he most definitely  makes the most of all of his scenes. Nia Long plays Abby, whose role (if I  must nitpick) I felt could have been developed a bit more and contained  more connecting scenes with  Seth. The kudos really goes to Giovanni  Ribisi, who is proving that he is fast becoming one of Hollywood's hottest  and most talented stars. Enigmatic in appearance and disquieting in  demeanor, he takes command of every scene and delivers his lines with  emotion and bite. I cannot think of another actor who could play the role  of Seth as well as he did. His performance in the role of a young man  struggling to come to terms with himself keeps you nailed to your seat for  the entire duration of the film.
The rap music and slightly annoying  cinematography chiefly in the beginning of the film can be easily forgotten  once all the primary elements are established. Don't miss this film!
