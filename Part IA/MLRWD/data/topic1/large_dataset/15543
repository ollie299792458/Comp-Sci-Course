While this is a beautiful film to watch, and the acting superb, it is, as they say, The Real McCoy.  Jordan's film adaptation of Greene's novel is more adaptation than anything else.  While the start of the film follows the novel closely enough, the end strays away from the text, and the story, rather abominably.  Films based on novels need not always follow the novel to the letter, sometimes it's impossible, but in this case, Jordan's changes make the film a weaker vehicle for the story that Greene wrote.  The clincher, the fact that Sarah gives up after making her promise to God, and not only goes to bed with Bendrix, but accompanies him to Brighton, makes us wonder whether Jordan thinks he is a better story-teller than Greene.  But alas he isn't.  The tremendous irony on which the novel is based, that God takes Sarah away from Bendrix without a word, and that she kept her promise all the while hating it, is lost, and the film begins to ooze Hollywood rather than Clapham Common in the blitz.
Still worth watching, and more than once might I add, the film does a good service to Greene by making more people read his novels, not only The End of the Affair.  Fans of Ralph Feinnes, especially, will enjoy the film, as he is again cast in the role of the melancholy English adulterer (cf The English Patient), and his intelligent interpretation of his character and of the text helps to save this film from being a total washout.
