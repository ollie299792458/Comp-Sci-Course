Tarantino found the perfect form for this film. Now that I've seen Vol. 2, I can say for sure that the split works perfectly well. And yes, sure, I would like to see it as a whole reunited film some day, but now I see that the 2 volumes strategy works in an entertaining and artistic way too.
I won't say much about plot. You can find that everywhere else. It's true that the first volume was all action, and this one is more of a complete films. It also makes the previous one even better, because now you see the substance behind all that virtuos action scene.
The final dialogue between The Bride and Bill is the great pay off. It puts the whole thing in a new perspective, and you'll find yourself liking that Bill a bit too. He is a tragic chraracter, as much as the Bride and the others. This is the great thing here, there is no good and bad side really. I mean, The Bride herself was one of them, and only motherhood made her change her ways. But think of O-Ren... She became what she was because of a tragic childhood, so she's a victim too. Everyone is a victim here, and everyone is a killer because of that... as a song I heard recently said "you become the monster / so the monster will not break you". Think of Vernita's daughter... she is a victim of The Bride too. She might want satisfaction some day, and if she killed Beatrix, no one could really object. Of couse, what maked Beatrix more human and closer to us is that she became a mother and that made her a real person, not only a roaring rampage killer. She trascended the killer she was, and almost pay with her life.
And Bill... when he explains the reasons behind his actions, you'll find it hard not to simpathize at least in some ways with him. 
All of this, plus the brilliant single-minded and virtuos directing (Tarantino has become a great director now; the great screenwriter is no surprise of course) make this one a milestone film.
