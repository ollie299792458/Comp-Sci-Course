Blue Collar is a not so sweet, good old fashioned, American tale of what happens when circumstances can push you into the shaded corners of the American utopia.

The acting is A-list through out this slice of Apple pie. Yaphet Kotto's portrayal as Smokey James is obviously the flaky crust of the film...arguably giving his best performance to date. Richard Pryor is at his most explosive and brilliant (the apples and filling of the trio) as auto-worker/family man Zeke Brown.  The multi-layered Jerry Bartowski played ever so solidly by Harvey Keitel holds his own among giants (of the time) and is obviously the sprinkle of cinammon and sugar needed to complete this cinematic masterpiece before being fired in the oven of hard times.

I recommend watching Paul Schrader's directorial debut after a long, hard days work to experience the full potency of the film; until then I'll leave you with a warm piece of Zeke's wisdom after telling off an I.R.S. agent in love with Uncle Sam:

"If I had the Navy and Marines behind me, I'd be a mutha***** too!" -Zeke (Blue Collar)
