The Girls Next Door Season 1 is a wonderful television show. I fully enjoyed watching it on tv but after I purchased it on DVD it is now a favorite part of my DVD collection. This is a great show, one that should not be judged on the cover. It shows that these girls are not superficial gold-diggers but that they are kind and caring young women. The Girls Next Door helps define a generation where people are more liberal and free to be who are they are. We are no longer a closed-eye society but one that likes and appreciates new ways of thinking, just like these girls. When else would it be acceptable for a man aged eighty-two to have three girlfriends, all under the age of 35? The answer is, only at the Playboy Mansion.
This DVD collection is one that is great, colorful, and entertaining. It is light and fun-loving and can bring a smile to a seemingly boring day. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a little escape from reality.Not only would I recommend Season 1, but look onward to the newest seasons, because they only get better.
Purchasing this series on DVD only makes it better because you can watch it over and over, whenever you like. The DVD also contains bonus information and things that you would not be able to see. The DVD episodes are also un-censored, unlike watching it on television. Therefore, I would not recommend to show the DVD version of this show to young children, but perhaps refer them to the television version instead.
