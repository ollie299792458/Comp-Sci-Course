This movie really accomplishes certain feats none of them good.  The violence and gore can be a little much, Uwe Bowl must have been proud.  The beginning of the film was slow and we have seen this story a thousand times. The middle was pretty much gory and pointless.  Until the end it got better but it came a little to late.  Lately I have seen my helpful vote count drop with vicious speed.  I am sorry but I am a reviewer and I will not dumb down my views on films.  I must speak my mind in these situations because lately films have hit rock bottom.  And I try to point out the good films from the bad and if I appear cruel or tough it's because I do this for all who read my reviews.  It means a lot to me that people take interest on my opinions in the realm of films.  I wanna thank  you all so much for taking the time to read and rate.  So, like I was saying the end of the film in which the heroes are being chased by nut jobs and they duke it out, I thought it was amazing.  It was funny and vicious, very cool.  If the movie could have sustained this formula that just works the film would have been at least decent.  So until the end of the film we feel justified for sitting through a tasteless movie that offered a stomach churning thrill ride that didn't deliver.  I must strongly recommend that anyone who isn't prone to watching gory movies STEER CLEAR OF THIS FLICK IT COULD MAKE YOU SICK.  Honestly this film pushed me to my limits.  So this movie wasn't original or thrilling (only
at the very end) but it redeemed it's self.  Please continue to rate me helpful.
