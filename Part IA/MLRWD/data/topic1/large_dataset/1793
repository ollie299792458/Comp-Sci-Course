All right, this video can never be mistaken for Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan, which was possibly the best Star Trek Movie ever, but this video does have it's charm.  Star Trek V takes allot of abuse since Shatner took his turn at the directors chair this time around and that was, well, maybe a mistake. Nonetheless, this is a valuable movie for it's classic Star Trek humor, as well as a setting for a new Enterprise adventure "to find God". In case you don't know, in Star Trek II Mr. Spock died. He was brought back to life in Star Trek III, and ah yes, in the process Enterprise 1701 was destroyed. You will find some jokes about Spock's "death" here, and  now you will get it when you hear them. In this Trek, a new ship, Enterprise 1701A is given to the crew, but it's hardly space worthy. This gives the miracle working ships engineer Mr. Scott lot's of things to fix. There is a shaky peace with the Klingon Empire, but we all know Kirk hates Klingons and they don't like him very much either. While as usual, Mr. Spock remains the voice of reason through out all, however, the video introduces Spock's brother yes, brother, played very well by Lawrence Luckenbill, as a Vulcan who embraces emotion. He hijacks the Enterprise, and takes it's crew on a quest to find God. On the way there, there's lot's of fun action. Do they find God? Well, when the find who they find things get serious as so they should. This is not the most effective outing for the Enterprise and it's crew, but it is a thought provoking video for a moment or two and at other times it's just good fun.
