E.T. - The Extra - Terrestrial (Widescreen Edition)

  I had a Big thought on the Type of Alien that E.T. represents in this Movie finally?  He's a Frog Alien!  There is a Connection in the Film to the Scene where Elliot is in Science Middle-school Class, and He is about to be asked to discect the Frog!
  The Classmates Administer the Sleeping Chemical to the Jar, and prepare!  And, Elliot draws the Connection, and Calls to his Classmates to free the Frogs back to Nature, and their Ecological Freedom!  Are Frog Aliens a California Alien Conspiracy in the 1980's?
  Really, it seems that the Alien is only interested in the Botanical Ecology of America, and Earth in the Movie!  So, I think the Filmmakers thought that this Idea for a Creature Space Alien would fit a Childhood Adventure!  That was back in 1983 when the Film was released, and captured the Hearts and Childhood Dreams of Filmgoers!
  A kinda Sci-fi Alien, for a Special Effect Children's Movie.  The Aliens Ship is so perfect for a Childhood Fanatsy on an Alien and Boy!  It's like a Christmas Tree Orniment!  Really, Frog Aliens might come from some kinda Water Planet mostly!
  So, watching the Movie on it's 2005 DVD release, is like a re-understanding with the Alien E.T. for Me!  That He is a Type of Frog Alien, that may be the only "Be Good" Alien of his Spiecies in the Film! But belongs to a Sci-fi Concept of Aliens that may reach out to even Alienography!  Even tough such Concepts might best be scene as Alien Life that has not reached Earth, but may be in Galaxy's Far, far away!
