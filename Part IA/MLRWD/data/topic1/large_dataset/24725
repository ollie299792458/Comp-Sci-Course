In this fictionalized memoir of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry, the pro-smoking ("pro-choice") promoters are bright, young, and hip; the anti-smoking ("anti-choice") crusade is fronted by dangerous fanatics and dim-bulbs who just don't get it. The script is filled with insider information, however, which delightfully skewers Big Tobacco. Our hero Nick Naylor has four tasks: (1) make sure the cigarette makers' announced fifty-million-dollar campaign to dissuade teenagers from smoking has the opposite effect; (2) negotiate product placement in glamorous Hollywood; (3) somehow regain the respect of his pre-teen son, who despises everything his father stands for; and (4) obstruct a Vermont senator's campaign to require a skull-and-crossbones on every pack. (It seems to me, of course, that the skull-and-crossbones would only enhance its appeal to teenagers.) If clever sophistry can persuade people whether or not to smoke (and market results seem to prove that it can), then this movie is devastating. Despite all its sex and profanity, the indelible message one comes away with is that smokers are losers. Visually, the film is colorful and imaginative; the soundtrack is lively and eclectic; a parade of gifted stars give unforgettable performances; but it is the script that makes this movie a classic. It is filled with lines you'll find yourself quoting again and again.
