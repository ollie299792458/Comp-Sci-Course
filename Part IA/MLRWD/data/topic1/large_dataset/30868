What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?

I wasn't particularly interested in "Office Space" when it first came out, and I assume that it was a sleeper hit upon theatrical release, but when I checked it out much later, I was on the floor laughing. Not only does "Office Space" stand out as a great comedy for those starved of great comedy, but manages to hit closer with those actually victimized by white-collar occupations. It's suprising how this evolved from a series of cheaply-made animated shorts, starring the squirrely stapler-obsessed Milton, and into an underestimated masterpiece.

Some would say that a comedy doesn't really require top-notch acting to get its hilarity across, but "Office Space" is a grand exception. Ron Livingston is perfect in the role of Peter, who learns that by doing nothing you can find the ultimate happiness and confidence you seek (thanks to unreversed hypnosis). Gary Cole's portrayal of the boring yet frightening Lumbergh should be added to the pantheon of best screen villains ever, and Stephen Root was simply born to play Milton.

Mike Judge obviously felt compelled to split open the unexplored injustice of white-collar slavery and definitely makes it work. This isn't a gross-out comedy full of outrageous behavior (I don't know if the bludgeoning of the copy machine counts), but if you want to unwind after a tough day of school or work and enjoy a downright funny-as-hell movie, you're making the right decision to owe this one a few bucks.
