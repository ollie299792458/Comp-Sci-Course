I've been trying to find this movie for 20 years.

I saw this movie when I was in Yugoslavia as a kid.  Its "Happy Ending" Theme, Cute Puppy Love, Great Songs, Slapstick Comedy Style with Blend of Modern Parodies with Old Pirate Setting, Guantanamo Human Rights, Pirate Honor etc. is overwhelming and very inspirational that one forgets and totally overlooks the TV-production-ish negatives.

I want Kids to see this movie because I feel that it subconsciously made me the way I am: good humored, solutions oriented, creative, and strive for the best in life, which boils down to simply, "Forget Your Worries, and Have A Happy Time!".

And that's what the movie is about, taking one through a Roller Coaster Ride in a fun park, Running you through cute Slapstichs, Romance & Love, abit of Sex Feel, Songs and Dance, and then going to the turning point of the movie where everything seems to go downright bad, a big crisis. Then suddenly our heroine realizes that, in that "Thin Red Line" between Success and Failure, there is one Freedom that Absolutely No One Can Take Away from her- and that is the Freedom to Choose a Happy Ending and Influence the Rest to do the same!

Thanks to the movie makers, Stars (Nichols, Mr. Freddy and the Pirate King), for shaping me the way I am.  I would definitely want to meet these people in the future (if possible) and will look to buy the blu-ray when it comes out!  In the mean time, lets do what this favorite movie of mine tell you not to forget: "Choose to have take the path that leads you to your Sustainable Good Times!"
