"FNL" - Season 2 built itself up on the show's very strong first season and pretty much never let its viewers get bore. There's pretty much no one-dimension character in Dillon, Texas - even the most unlikely people can turn out to be amazing unlikable one week (yeah, I'm looking at, Julie Taylor), yet can still manage to make you root for them. Truth be told, it's hard for me to think of a better ensemble cast on TV right now - "Desperable Housewives" and "Grey's Anatomy" get all the hype, but they wish they could be as genuine as Kyle Chandler and his group manage to be so easily. So a great cast and great scripts make up for a pretty solid show... 'til the football scenes show up.
Now, I know, I know, "Friday Night Lights" is more than a football show, but C-O-M-E O-N! How many episodes can you make with the Dillon team making a final comeback drive to win the game AND SEE THEM WIN IT AGAIN AND AGAIN?! This is crazy - we're talking about high school football, folks!
So yeah, the minutes "FNL" producers will decide to make the football scenes as realistic as the rest of the show, they'll be pretty much no reason for it to not win some Emmys.
