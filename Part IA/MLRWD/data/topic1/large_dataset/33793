Let me clear this up. I rarely write reviews for Amazon. In fact, check my stats, I only have a few. Only when I feel strongly enough about something. However, I always 100% of the time, read reviews before I purchase a product. The other reviewers are absolutely correct. This is not the original US released Blu Ray set. This in fact on the outside of the box when you receive it has UK ratings all over the cover and back. The discs are labeled with just pictures of Superman and you would have no idea which is which unless you read a tiny writing print on the edge. The rest is in Spanish all over the rest of the disc. However, this all being said, this plays perfectly, and is 100% the Blu Ray Warner Brothers releases and extended releases of each movie and the quality is exceptional. I see no difference in quality and in fact the Blu Ray is great. The title menus are not glamorous and I would be curious to see if the US version has the boring menus this version has. I played each movie quickly from start to finish and they play perfectly and are not in Spanish. Not sure if anyone cares if the disc labels are not titled, but I don't care and I have decided rather than return this, I am keeping it. Who cares if the box is in a UK rating and the labels are in Spanish?

The only thing I have to say is shame on Amazon for not noticing this and shipping a faulty product like this and listing this as US. Get the description straight and stop being deceitful about the content of your products.
