The film begins with the Crook campaign of 1883 in Mexico, when Geronimo promised to surrender in two months, but he finally surrendered about a year later to Britton Davis (1884).

1)Britton Davis was sent in Arizona in 1882, so he already knew Gatewood when Geronimo surrendered in 1884, after the Crook campaign of 1883. Davis was present in the 1884 surrender, but Gatewood was not, so he led Geronimo to San Carls, alone.

2)Geronimo left the reservation (1885) not because of some forbitten dances, but because the whites had spread rumours that he was to be arrested and hanged. The film does not mension at all the "lost telegram" sent by Davis to Crook.

3) In the next campaign, Davis was not with Gatewood, but with captain Crawford troops. Crawford (a most important figure in the Apache wars) is not mensioned at all.

4) Both Davis and Seiber left the Army in autumn 1885, but the film shows them as members of the group of the last Gatewood mission (1886). Even Chato (the other member of the group) was in a delegation to the north, by that time, so he could not be with Gatewood, and surely not at the prisorer train with Geronimo.

5) At the council of Los Embudos canyon (1886), the film does not mension Tribollet, the mercant who sold liquor to the Apaches and convinced Geronimo and Natchez to leave again.

6) Where is Natchez (a most important chief) ?

7) The real Geronimo campaign was led by a strike force of soldiers under captain Lawton and Leonard Wood, chasing them for four months in Mexico. Gatewwod should meet Lawton and Wood to try to negotiate with Geronimo. Where are Lawton and Wood ?

8)There is no mension of the "Tuscon Ring" which was the real responsible for the last Apache wars, having economical interests.

Despite all this, the film is great, well played by every actor, beautiful photography, serious, spectacular and I found it much-much better than Dances with wolves.
