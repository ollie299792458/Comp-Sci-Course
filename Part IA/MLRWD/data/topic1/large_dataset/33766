This is not a perfect movie, but neither is it a bad one.  At the time it was filmed, the producers didn't have the luxury of pacing it into a limited-run series on HBO/Cinemax/Showtime-------ie, a ten or twenty hour movie which could be spread out over several weekly episodes (much like Masterpiece Theatre did with so many other novels).  So what you've got is a very condensed and edited movie which begs to re-done on cable (the only reason that TWIN PEAKS ended so disasterously in the middle of the second season is that it probably should have been filmed as a year-long, "finite" series...but the nature of TV in 1990 was such that no series got produced without a five-year-run in mind).

I first saw this when I was nine or ten, on TV (1972?).  I didn't understand a word of it, but the images never left me.  Three years ago I googled "Michael Caine, Anthony Quinn", and finally got the title.  I enjoyed the movie, then ordered the book.  At first the book seemed overly verbose, so I tossed it in the "for free" box in the laundry room at my apartment complex.  Three days later I fished it right back out, and spent the next three weeks reading 25-50 pages per night.
