I adore Mae West. She was and still is an amazing role model. She broke boundaries and didn't care. While she was very vain and did outrageous things to her younger female cast she was still an amazing screen siren or the 30's. This box set is a little on the dull side, but it's the content that I really wanted. A few of her greats are on here, unless you're a fan like me in which case all of her movies are her "greats." The only movies missing are "Belle of the Nineties" "The Heat's On" "Everydays a Holiday" "Klondike Annie" and her own personal favorite "She Done Him Wrong." I don't know how, but I would love to see all of her movies in one tidy box set entitled, "The Fabulous Mae West" And now on with the review.

The videos are pretty mint and look like they've had the usual "Blu-ray" touch ups. The audio is pretty decent and the clarity is overall perfect. Granted my opinion is relatively biased due to my admiration for the woman on the screen. That being said the discs could have been a little more dressed up and not just double-sided. Why not add two more movies onto the other side of the disc with "My Little Chickadee" and "Go West Young Man"?

The trailers are nice, but they should have added a few more special features like deleted scenes that weren't destroyed or something to that effect. Granted some of what we want to see is under copyright and can't be touched. All in all this is a very good box set. Could it have used a little more presentation? Sure, but for the content on those discs...the presentation of the box set is made up for.

Pros:
5 Mae West movies
Excellent Sound
Good Video Quality
A few trailers that add to their designated movies

Cons:
Lack Luster Presentation
Missing the other 5 Mae West movies.
Double-sided discs (This one can go either way depending on the person.)

Overall:
Great Gift Idea
Terrific Collectors Memorabilia
You can never go wrong with a well placed double entendre.
