"Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is a classic movie about a popular troublemaker named Ferris (Matthew Broderick) and a day that he skipped high school. He gets his girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara), and one of his friends, Cameron (Alan Ruck), to spend the day with him. Ferris is taking the day off from high school because he wants to show Cameron what it's like to have some fun instead of being so uptight and worried about everything. Principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) is upset at Ferris and wants to catch him live in his act because this is the ninth school day that Ferris has missed this semester.
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is great because it has many classic parts such as when Ferris decides to take Cameron's father's car for a ride, Principal Rooney's expedition to Ferris's house, and all the pranks that Ferris pulls to keep from being caught such as the dummy that snores in the bed. Myself, I skipped a few days in high school just because I was sick of school and wanted to take a day off. If you ever made your parents think you were sick and then they went to work and you just did what you wanted to the rest of the day instead of going to school, you'll like this movie even better. 
I recommend anybody who likes comedy movies or anyone who ever played hookie before in high school to get "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." Trust me, you won't be disappointed
