This movie is the realized back story for the movie "Underworld".  There is nothing revelational about this movie to the storyline of the franchise except for Lucian being the source of the modern day Lycans (ability to transform back into human form).  This movie is basically about his development from childhood into the leader of the Lycans and also the love story between him and Sonia (Victor's daughter).  The tie-ins of this movie to the other two were very well written.  While viewing "Rise of the Lycans" is not necessary in order to make sense of the other two movies in the franchise, it definitely enriches them and basically adds more seasoning.

The action and battle sequences were exciting and very well done.  But, while I enjoyed the movie, it lacks the plot twists and suspense of the original "Underworld".  The acting is good, although I wish Victor would have had some better dialogue.  Rhona Mitra was SUPERB as Sonia.  Her resemblence to Kate Beckensale makes the viewer realize why Victor took Selene under his wing (instead of killing her along with her family).  Selene is absent from this movie except for the final clip which happens to be the opening scene to "Underworld" (a good transition). IMHO, this movie ranks 2nd in the franchise. While "Underworld Evolution" was enoyable in its own right, the creatures of this franchise look more comfortable (and believable) in midieval times than in the modern day.  If you own the other two movies on DVD/ Blu-ray, you'll definitely want to add this to your Underworld library.
