This was a brilliant social experiment that put such fine points on the realities of life during the Regency period.  Single 21st century men, women and their chaperones are thrown together for 6 weeks just as their counterparts would have been.  Quickly, it becomes apparent that the divide between the lives of men and the limits for women is especially challenging for 21st century people crammed into 19th century garments and social strictures. It's all one big party for the guys while it's a living hell for the girls--regardless of class.  Any reader of Jane Austen especially, will discover context that can profoundly change the way we understand the dilemmas of her characters and the social assumptions embedded in her stories.  Viewing this series should open the eyes of anyone who thinks this period was "romantic."

Most surprising and touching is the way that even though people are playing roles similar to the equivalent station they would have had in life 200 years ago, the feelings and relationships are so very real.  Fascinatingly, even in this Regency hothouse, love comes where and when you least expect it. I was able to find out from a Google search that at least one of the couples continued to see each other after filming ended. I would love to know how doing this show may have influenced the participants' choices when dating in the 21st century. Did the women come to expect chivalry? Did the men appreciate how capable and independent women are now in comparison to the long-ago past?  And what about the girls' chaperones? They were real "characters." I wonder what became of them most of all.  They added a shocking amount of drama to the couples' party.
