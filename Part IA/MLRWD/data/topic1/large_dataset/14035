It's official, Smallville butchered Superman.
The series stuck to its original goal of preventing Clark from becoming the Man of Steel for as long as possible. And when he finally does change, the scene are the worst Superman scenes to be filmed. There's only two maybe three shots of Tom Welling in the suit and the rest of the time Superman is shown in a far away shot done with incredibly poor computer animation.
The series decided to do its own version of Superman saving an airplane and its absolutely pathetic. The film Superman Returns has a far superior scene and it even won several awards for it. But that's because that film was actually done by Superman fans and by people who had actually read the comics. Smallville clearly isn't done by Superman fans and they maybe have read about ten issues, and obviously hated them. Hence the reason why Smallville stays away from Superman for so long and doesn't even give the characters their original names.
The Blur? Velocity? What stupid names to give Superman and The Flash.
Now what really is awful about the finale is how it ends. Lex is barely in it, and maybe the actor had two, three days of filming. (but more than likely just one.) And Clark doesn't even fight Lex or Darkside. I was at least expecting a fight scene between the those two once Clark became Superman, but no he just moves the fire ball away in the last ten minutes of an hour and half show. The whole episode is horrible and boring because most of it is Clark and Lois complaining about getting married and complaining about their futures. Boring!
Now if people really want to see a good version of Superman, check out the animated films from DC Animated Warner Studios. Those films are marvelous, stay true to the comics, get PG-13 ratings because of all the action, and they show why cartoons are the best way to deliver comic books as movies. Live action films are just horrid, cartoons, that's where it's at.
