I first saw parts of the show on youtube and fell in love with it because Ruthie Henshall was in it and she is really amazing!!! I had to buy the dvd just to see what the other songs were like. The show is unbelievably entertaining. I read reviews saying that there's no plot. Well if you watch the songs fit together perfectly. or example "Hello, Little Girl" "My Husband The Pig/Everyday a Little Death" & "Everybody Ought To Have a Maid" show that the older man wanted to get with the younger girl but the older woman saw it and is disgusted so she gets a maid to cheat with. I thought that was a clever, Considering they are only using Sondheim songs!!! The actors did a great job Bronson Pinchot was unbelievable especially on "Bang!" & "Buddy's Blues" John Barrowman has a beautiful voice as displayed in his duet with Ruthie "Unworthy Of Your Love" Ruthie Henshall did amazing i hate when people say  that she sings through her teeth, she only really does it in "Lovely" but she does have great teeth. Also her perormance of "More" really shows off her skills as a Dancer and shows that she's a Triple Threat!!! George Hearn does great as always! And Last But not least Carol Burnett!!! Carol really puts some humor in the show. She's amazing in "(Not) Getting Married Today" which is a very hard song. Overall a great musical review!!!
