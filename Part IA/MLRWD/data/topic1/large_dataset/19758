Okay, here goes with the minority opinion:

It's terrible because the script is amaturish, obvious, totally lacking in tension and surprises, and all the sets and palaces and pagentry cannot disguise a bad script.  I do not blame the actors, as they have almost nothing to work with.

  Incompetent writing has murdered this material.  I have watched the entire first season and I'm done with it.  I love period dramas, and could not imagine that I would be BORED TO TEARS with this one, but the writing is CBS mini-series level only.  Plotting is simplistic, obvious and unrealistic.  The viewers are never left to discover anything for themselves, as the Borgia's tedious plans and schemes are waved slowly before their eyes and carefully previewed in dialog 'info-dumps'.  The dialog is pitiful and there's a lot of it, but  scarcely a line of it sparkles, or leads to any character developement (which is non-existant) and much of the time it does not even advance the plot, only wastes time until the next scene comes along.

 I get the impression that the writers were bored with this project, in over their heads, and just throwing words on the page to draw a paycheck.  The script is not in the least bit clever; it fails to deliver any surprises, and there is absolutely no tension in a show that should literallly be dripping with it. The sex scenes are not erotic, and the gorey battle scenes lack any of the corresponding horror.

Great dramas begin with a brilliant script:  Sopranos, Mad Men, Breaking Bad.  Sure, these are a different genre, but I want this level of masterful plotting, pacing, character developement, in short storytelling, to illuminate fascinating tales such as The Borgias as well.
