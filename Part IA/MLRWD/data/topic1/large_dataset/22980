Halloween II picks up precisely where its predecesor left off. "The Shape" is still stalking the poor baby sitter Laurie Strode. Laurie is soon taken to the hospital while Michael Myers is believed to have burned to death in an auto accident. However, it was merely an innocent pedestrian in a costume and now the real Michael Myers has found out where his prey is. This movie goes along okay. There are various killings at the hospital until it seems like Laurie is the only one left. When all hope seems lost, Dr. Loomis comes to Laurie's aid and soon he and Michael are caught in an explosion in one of the hospital operating rooms. You also learn some interesting facts about the "Myers Family."
This movie was overall pretty good. I was very sorry to hear that John Carpenter didn't direct the movie but was glad that he was involved with it. One thing I didn't like about the movie was the actor playing Michael Myers. He looked much more different than Nick Castle in the original. I don't recommend that you see this movie without seeing the first.
