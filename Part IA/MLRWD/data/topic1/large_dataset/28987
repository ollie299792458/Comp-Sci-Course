An odd combo: cult director Don Siegel, who forever changed the "Lone Cop" genre with "Dirty Harry", and provided Duke Wayne with his final film "The Shootist"; mixed with Oscar-winning comedian Matthau, who personified Oscar Madison in "The Odd Couple" and the Sleazy Brother-In-Law/Lawyer in "The Fortune Cookie". But it works. Don Siegel brings his trademark hard-edge and mean-sprited characters, while Matthau borders on deadpan thru the whole thing as a bank robber who unwittingly knocks over a Mob-controlled bank in the middle of rural New Mexico. There's also a lean, mean hitman on his trail played by Joe Don Baker, and one of the 60's and 70's best sleazeball white collar villians: John Vernon. Add in the beautiful Felicia Farr (Jack Lemmon's wife), the "Blow-torch and Pliers" line that Quentin Tarantino "borrowed" for "Pulp Fiction", and a great denoument, and you have a cracker-jack action-drama, with a hint of comedy-similar in tone to Matthau's "Taking Of Pelham 1,2 &amp;3", which came out a year or so after this. In short, a quintissential 70's cult movie: memorable, tough, and near-great.
