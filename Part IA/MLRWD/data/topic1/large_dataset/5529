I really want to give this 2 stars, but because the acting and cinematography is superb, I'm giving it 3.

The big problem with this movie is that there is absolutley no character development whatsoever. The viewer is denied any chance to understand any of the characters. It is as if the writers have completely dehumanized the cast of characters and are portraying them more as animals. Man is not an animal. Man has feelings, thoughts, emotions, memories, a conscience. To portray a person as an animal is down right insulting. By the end of the movie, I was led to believe that the Jake LaMotta character was mentally insane which is not an accurate depiction by any means.  The writers should have stuck with Jake LaMotta's story. It was his story, afer all, even if they didn't seem to like it. Maybe it's a good thing the actors and Scorsese didn't stick completely to the script.

An alright movie with lots of boxing shots (too gruesome for me , however) and local color, that will however not allow you to connect with the characters.
