Update Oct 4 2012:  I stand by my review below but I have a major complaint in that I've already bought 2 of this DVD cause the first one started skipping and now within 6 weeks my new one is skipping so I'll have to replace it cause it is so vital to my back health.  Sure wish they didn't make these on such low quality CD's.  Now I will have bought 3 of these.  If my next one starts to skip too I'm gonna have to freak out.  Have a good day!

I saw all the great reviews here on Amazon about this videos and got excited.  I had 2 fusion surgeries on my neck in '09-'10 and since then have had chronic pain in my upper back, neck, and shoulders specifically.  I was amazed to find a yoga video prescribed exactly for my worst areas of pain (I have hip pain too and their other video for hips/low back/sacrum is great also).  I worry sometimes about the reviews where so many people back up the product with raving reviews.  In the back of my mind I'm always thinking about some corporation having its employees write reviews so a product will sound amazing.  I'm convinced it does happen on a small scale but I feel sure it hasn't happened here or if it did they were right anyway!

It's been the most unique yoga routine that I've seen.  It's not your standard down-dog/sun-series routine.  I feel so good after (and during) the videos as they stretch and release just the right muscles.  If I can make one complaint it's just that between this video and the low-back one there are quite a few of the same poses.  I can see how they work both areas but I like to do both videos back-to-back and it's just a little disappointing when the same poses are coming up.  I'd say maybe only 1/3 are the same at most and it's not enough to change my 5 star rating.  Gary Kraftsow is a living god!
