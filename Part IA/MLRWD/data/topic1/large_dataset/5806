Make no mistake: there are some profoundly goofy moments in this film.  Will Patton, as the evil General Bethlehem, declaims lines with an apparent conviction that the audience is deaf.  And Costner grunts through the scene where he discovers the Postal Carrier's gear: he repeats "Uhh-uhhh-ahh-aaah-unhhh-unhh-unhhh" for about three minutes.  And the less I say about the two actors throwing Shakespeare at each other -- one after a lithium dose, the other after a three-day coke binge -- the better.
It's also clear Costner still hasn't solved the pacing problem that's dogged him since 'Dances with Wolves': the early scenes go on way too long and individual pieces cry out for editing.  But if you can accept the pace, this is a decent film with a very interesting concept of postal carriers uniting a group of mutually suspicious post-apocalyptic survivalist communities.  Yeah, when I first saw the trailer for this movie in 1997, I laughed, and the critical reaction to the film was partially justified.  But the action scenes are done very well, and the actors make it hold together (particularly Larenz Tate as Costner's second-in-command).  And despite its sillier moments, the script never ventures completely into the unbelievable.
You could do worse: Costner's movies, at least, attempt to create a mythology for their heroes to inhabit, and he has a knack for transporting the viewer into a convincing version of another time.  It's not John Ford, but it's not bad.
