My lovely bride came through for me in a big way by giving me this DVD set for Xmas, and I had set my expectations relatively high, given the snippets I had seen of this concert on July 2nd looked great.  I decided to take a quick look at this my gift the day after Xmas, and spent the ENTIRE DAY mesmerized! The live concert video footage was tremendous, and the sound was simply astounding in Dolby Digital 5.1.

The best part for me was Disk 3: The Pink Floyd reunion after 20+ years since Roger Waters had left Pink Floyd.  According to a Billboard, the currently configured Pink Floyd had not performed live with Roger Waters since 1981, and had not performed live as currently configured since the release of their album "The Division Bell" in 1994.

David Gilmour and Roger Waters came together on the London stage as if they had never been apart, and their song set was clearly the highlight for me.  The set was performed at night, and the clarity and detail of the video was outstanding.  On Disk 4 is an extra of the reunited Pink Floyd rehearsing for Live8, where Roger Waters is interviewed and explains how they pulled off this one-time (as of now) reunion.

There were a few negatives, one being the camera shots when panning the audience on numerous occasions seemed blurred.  The other had to do with re-setting the audio to Dolby Digital 5.1 for each DVD before I listened to it.  The default was Dolby Stereo, which was still very good but not the same as 5.1.

Overall, this is an outstanding collection of musical talent delivered in high quality sound and video.  Your biggest issue will be explaining to your "significant other" the amount of time you'll need to go through this remarkable collection!
