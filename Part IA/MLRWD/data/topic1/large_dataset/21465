I will be perfectly honest ... with myself.
I am a huge fan of Robin Williams' work, and I found him sympathetic enough that I found a kind of chemistry between the characters of Christy and Annie that was deeper than on-screen sexual destiny.  I completely bought into the more mature and engaging chemistry of two people who have shared some of the most important, most wonderful, and most painful experiences life can offer.  Add to this that the actors who play the children are gifted in bringing us around to liking them and being concerned over what bothers them.  There are only two role left, well, one actually...but I don't want to ruin that little tweak.  Suffice it to say that I am ever impressed by Cuba Gooding, Jr's emotional range and depth and his remarkable ability to share his outstanding interpretation of his character with us, and as for Max Von Sydow?  Who else can be so charming, strong, fatherly, and somehow frightening all at once?  For many of us, he will ever be the iconic "old priest" -- Father Merin from a little movie that never quite gives up its hold on #1 on the list of scariest movies ever made.

So that's the technical stuff.  Now for the honesty.

It is possible that this film is emotionally manipulative, and I know some critics that denounce such exhibits of film making prowess as "cheesy," "predictable," and "pushy."  Twenty years ago, Robin starred in another emo machine called Dead Poets Society.  Again, critics who have not the talent to elicit more than cynicism panned the film because it succeeded in creating an emotional response.  Tell me Romeo & Juliet is anything but a calculated tear-jerker.  Shall we give Shakespeare one star?  So what's it all add up to?  Simply this honest statement:  I've not cried at a film like this since Dead Poets.  That film I cried at as a child beginning his first year of teaching.  This one I cried with as an adult who better  understands something of loss, regret, and never giving up.
