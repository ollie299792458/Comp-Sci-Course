I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I would consider this my all time favorite movie.It is very funny and very real to me. I am a male and product of a Catholic education during the 1960's.I learned under the tutelage of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. My great aunt was a nun for 75 years when she finally died. Haley Mills and Rosalind Russell did an outstanding job of acting in this classic film. The moments of joy, sadness and sterness were acted out with such realism. Mother Superior was strict as well as witty. She was well respected. That is how she won the heart of Mary Clancy. If you are Catholic you will love  this nostalgic film and learn to appreciate what the good sisters sacrificed for us.It was by their good example that many followed in their footsteps. The gothic sets which represent the interior of the convent and chapel are beautifully decorated. The exterior of this medieval convent was also very ornate. The convent grounds were also nicely landscaped. The Convent itself is located somewhere in Pennsylvania. I would love to go there and see if the old convent is still standing. You can view more of the school grounds in the sequel. The sequel is good but the original film is better. Watch this film once and you will want to watch it again. It is a classic!
