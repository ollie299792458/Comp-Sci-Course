I'm a little ol' fashioned when it comes to comedy.  I don't appreciate toilet humor or say the dance scene from "Superbad" with what happens to his pants.  Those jokes make me want to turn off the tv or stop watching the movie.  That said, I read reviews when this movie came out.  They said it can be a little trashy, but a great overall movie.  So, I gave this a rental.  Not only was it a great theme (even if it is trite and over-used at this point in time), but it was hilarious.  It has been a while since my wife and I laughed that much at a movie.  In fact, I loved it so much I bought it.  Paul Rudd plays his typical character (see "I love you, Man") and Sean William Scott plays a sex obsessed man.  The two kids are really great and the relationship that builds is great.  It is one of those you know how it is going to end about 20 minutes in as it takes the same plot line the other 10 million comedies before it does.  However, it is funny, really funny.  We both really loved this movie.  The crudeness is not horrible and it has really great moments.
