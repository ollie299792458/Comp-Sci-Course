In my opinion, Philadelphia will live throughout film history as a movie more honored for its intentions than its artistic merit. Stellar performances by Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington stand along side a rather inept script penned by Ron Nyswaner.

The central conflict of the story pivots around an utterly transparent act of sabotage. The filmmakers have attempted to make a tense courtroom drama, yet the defense doesn't really have a leg to stand on. Also, Washington's homophobic/AIDSphobic lawyer has a complete change of heart concerning taking the case but the turnaround is devoid of believable motivation.

Still, it was major step forward for mainstream gay films and the consistently fine acting by the leads and the supporting cast, (Jason Robards is riveting,) makes this film well worth seeing.

ABOUT THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY DVD: Justice has finally been served --- sort of. Demme originally shot a scene in which Banderas and Hanks were seen talking in bed. The scene was cut for fear of "alienating the audience" but the decision sparked controversy. The 10th Anniversary DVD edition includes this scene in its extras section. Although the scene should have remained in the theatrical version, at least DVD viewers can now see the longtime "married" couple actually acting like a longtime married couple.
