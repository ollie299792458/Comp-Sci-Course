I was prompted to watch High Noon by Dennis Prager's Nationally syndicated radio program, The Dennis Prager Show.  I must admit, I missed most of his conversation about the film, but I figured if the intelligent Dennis Prager  spent a weekend watching an old western instead of devouring some lofty  tome, there must be something to it.
Indeed there was, and is.  High Noon  is a classic western, with a clear demarcation between good and evil.  What  I found interesting however, was how relevant the issues within this  sampling of the old-fashioned western genre are today.  Quite simply, the  story is about the dilemma societies face when confronted with truly evil  people intent on doing harm to others.  Based on the shootout in the end  (traditional western stuff here) one might think the answers are simple.  But the well-crafted script leads the viewer through the myriad of  perspectives on issues such as capital punishment, duty, courage and honor,  societal apathy and the agonizing personal decision to stand up for what  one thinks is right.  A truly well-done cinematic dissertation on the  issues that spark public debate today.
I recommend the movie not just for  those reasons stated above, but also because its just a plain-old well-done  movie and story.  It defies its age.  A classic for all time.
