Vampire Hunter D is one of the first anime movies I ever saw along with Robot Carnival, and it is still my favorite.  I can watch it again and again.
Originally released in 1985, and re-released in 2000.
In the  year 12,090 AD, the Earth has fallen into the clutches of ruthless vampires  and humans are enslaved by a corrupted feudal system, prey to a mockery of  freedom and justice. Only one being has dared to challenge the cruel  authority of these vicious, arrogant immortals - the mysterious vampire  hunter called "D".
A beautiful young villager, Doris, has been  targeted by Count Magnus Lee and his clan for the harsh doom of belonging  to the Count. In desperation, Doris promises herself to the enigmatic  hunter in exchange for the extermination of these tyrannical monsters.  Before "D" can execute his plans, the Count abducts Doris,  forcing "D" to forge through hordes of demons and unholy fiends  to rescue Doris from the bloody reign of the House of Lee.
Cult classic  by any standard. Sophisticated blend of horror and futuristic science  fiction. The bizarre imagery and exotic characters help to fully realize  the tone of the film, confirming its status as an exceptional work of  animation.
This movie is a must see.
