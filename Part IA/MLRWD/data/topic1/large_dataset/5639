This is one of my favorite films. Rocky is a great story about a Philadelphia club fighter who gets the chance of a lifetime. Rocky Balboa is this character, played by Sylvester Stallone. His apartment is a wreck, he does not have much of a social life, and his no. 1 job is as a muscle man for a loan shark. But, when heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed has his opponent for "The Bicentennial Fight" injured in training, he decides to give an unknown fighter a chance. Rocky's nickname,"The Italian Stallion" catches Creed's eye. From here on in, the film is fantastic. The acting is outstanding, especially by Brgess Meredith, who plays Mickey, Rocky's trainer. A fantastic story, great music, good romance between Rocky and Adrian(Talia Shire), great antics from Paulie(Burt Young),Adrian's brother, and, of course, the great training montage highlight the movie. The fight scenes are also amazing. Rocky is simply and plainly a great movie. Th sequels are ok, but nothng beats the original.If you have'nt seen it, SEE IT.
