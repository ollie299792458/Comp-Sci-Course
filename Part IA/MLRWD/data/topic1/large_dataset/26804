The Pyramids of mars was one of the first episodes that i ever watched.It has a stunning concept and plot.There was action,but not to much so that they over-did it.Pyramids of mars was exceptional from its predecesers.It was a very good example of what you can achieve with good actors,on-location filming and good props and costumes.It was a very controlled episode.It was a good idea using the concept that the whole of what we know as egyptoligy was actually based on an alien race.Pyramids of mars also differd from its others because of the badee.Usually the enermys that the doctor confronts are very mortal and have the flesh and blood concept about them.This was very different in pyramids of mars.Instead the enermy was a mighty god called SUTEK the destroyer.He was unstopable.It was mear luck that the doctor managed to trap him in the time vortex.But wherever there is a bad guy there is allways a good one.HORUS god of light fought sutek and managed to imprison him in an eternity of agonizing pain.Of course he escaped and that was that.This is one enermy that if the doctor slipped up on he would not of been able to stop.I pesonally adore this episode and it will allways remain one of the all time Doctor Who classics.
