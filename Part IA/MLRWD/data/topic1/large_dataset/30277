It's very good, divided into 22 chapters or lessons. She gives a clear explanation of each move, she takes enough time to repeat the move so you understand it. I would say it is for basic but quick learners who do not need to be explained in tiny detail about the right basic position from the very start. I must say I have taken already half dozen classes before I bought this dvd so I knew already the theory of the basic position.

Her tone of voice, music and lights are just fine. The camera is also ok. There are no close-ups in excess, nor useless takes to her face. The environment is pretty as well and you follow her mirror-like. I am not native american speaking and her explanations are still clear and easy to follow to me. DVD is all regions (it plays in Mexico just fine). There is a starting menu and after each lesson it takes you back to the menu, so you can choose exactly what lesson you want to take and how much time to devote to it. In the end she dances three different choreographies in full custom while she tells you what's she's doing exactly, useful to put your steps together, but also to give you some idea about the differences between the music. She also indicates which lessons you must be fluid on for that choreography in specific. I think it is really cheap considering hte amount of information and the quality, compared to other recommended DVD's. I personally don't think it would be a challenge for intermediate or advance dancers, because I am a beginner and for me it is just fine. But then again I have danced ballet and jazz before and it is not like I have difficulty having two left legs.

From the 22 lessons, 21 are about hips, there is only one ondulation, the basic one. It is hips in mild combination with arms. No veil, no zills, not much of torso either. If your interest includes also these subjects, look for another DVD to complement. But even alone, I think it is worth and I definitively recommend it.
