As a former engineer on CSX now injured,  I remember our famous runaway in Ohio that this was loosely based on. I also remember since I was involved in the chase the runaway train CSX had in Rochester NY. I and my conductor at the time were asked to leave Lyons NY and try to chase it down. So I can tell you from experience this is an intense situation and Denzel and Chris did a great job letting you feel how intense a situation it is. I have a few issues with technical errors involving the use of the automatic air brake in place of the independent. For those unaware the brake handle that Chris Pine uses on the curve when Denzel tells him to use the independent brake is actually the automatic. For those unaware the automatic brake is basically the train brake which requires the air hoses to be connected to be of any significant use; otherwise, in many instances you would have less braking force than if the independent/engine brake was used. Another technical error relates to the alertor or "deadmans" feature, not only does it apply the brakes when it goes off it also kills the throttle (unless the feature is totally cut-out). I could give more technical issues that bothered me; however I really had fun watching this movie and am able to look past this. I recommend people give it a chance. The railroad talk was not bad and actually resembled some conversations I can remember having myself with conductors. If you want more railroad related questions answered email me at bob_flammia@yahoo.com, have fun and enjoy this really fun movie!
