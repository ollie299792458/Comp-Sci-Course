I've recently started to go through my video tapes and picking my favorites to get on DVD.  Fairy Tale - A true story is one of only a handful that I've decided to repurchase.  It is such a wonderful tale of innocence and wonder and hope.  I never get tired of watching it.  Even though the main story is about the events of the Cottingley Fairies and the two young girls who capture faeries in photographs, most of the drama is occurring in the adults surrounding this event. This movie is such a wonderful balance of the perspective of the girls and the hope and joy these photographs brought to the adults in the movie.  On the surface it looks like a kids movie, and even though many kids do love it, it is much more than that. It's as much a faerie tale as it is about how we all grow up and stop believing in those things we cannot see and touch.  But when we are little we have imaginary friends, and tea parties with dolls, and play with faeries in the back garden.  This tale is about the deep hope many of us have that maybe those childhood fancies, that seemed so real when we 'didn't know better' may have actually been a lot more than we can rationally accept as adults.  That is why this tale is so amazing.  It isn't about little children believing in faeries, its about Sir Arther Conan Doyle, and publishers, and Kodak, and the world faced with the possibility that faeries might actually be real.
