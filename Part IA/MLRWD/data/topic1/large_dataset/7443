Unfortunately, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials never gained the
fame and mass following of JKR's Harry Potter.  But his series was one
of my favorites as a child, and now this first movie is a visual treat,
and welcome reminder of how wonderful the books were.

Unfortunately, we marketed the movie all wrong in the US, and labeling
the series as the "anti-Narnia chronicles" did not help boost its
popularity among the audience here, which reveres CS Lewis's creation.
 Please understand, there is nothing about His Dark Materials that
detracts from the wonder and Christian themes found in Narnia.  If
anything, having read the two series side by side as a kid, I was able
to appreciate the parallels between stories, as well as the different
worldviews of each author.

I think children and adults alike will enjoy this movie tremendously,
regardless of religion or worldview, regardless of whether or not they
have read the books.  My boyfriend was not familiar with the series,
but enjoyed it as much as I did.  In fact, he was the one who informed
me that the next 2 movies are not currently in production, as it
failed to crack $70 million in the domestic box office despite huge
success overseas.  In fact, it is the first film to ever crack $300
million internationally without reaching $100 million domestic.  An
astonishing disconnect, really.

The producer has vowed to make the 2nd and 3rd movies, and I'm
crossing my fingers they do a better job marketing the movie (and that
critics aren't so quick to trash it!)  This series has real potential.
