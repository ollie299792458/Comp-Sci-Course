I saw this film during it's theatrical run and didn't think much of it.  I saw it again recently on the Sci-Fi Channel and thought it was even worse.  I don't like films that keep reminding us in very obvious ways that we should be frightened.  
Let's start with the Event Horizon's engines.  What better way to summon the demons of hell than by using a creepy looking device with evil spiky things coming out of it. You know why the movie "Alien" was scary?  Among other things, the alien itself was scary, not the ship and technology used by the crew.
Now how about the message picked up by the crew of the Louis & Clark.  Originally it says, "Save me."  OK, a voice from beyond the grave in another dimension.  That's pretty scary.  Then they realize it says, "Save yourself."  OK, still pretty scary.  An ominous warning from outside our reality.  Oh wait, there's more.  "Save yourself from hell" is the full message.  I see, it's 'from hell' is it?  Well then, I guess I really should be scared.  
Oh well, it could have been worse.  It could have been "Deep Rising."
