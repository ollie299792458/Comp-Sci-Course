When I got this movie, I was really looking for MAN OF FIRE, but made a mistake with a very happy ending, which is that I got to see TWO excellent movies, rather than just one.

I absolutely LOVED this film in which there was plenty of thrilling action accompanying fine acting and a good story.

More than most contemporary works, this movie IS what it claims to be, and MORE.  An aptly told story with shooting and stuff blowing up, all for some very good reasons.  I was glad to see Denzel Washington doing something so far removed from his many other roles.

Keeping in mind all DW's previous roles, which are all very highb row, this film and "MOF" make the very well-timed transitional roles between everything else and TRAINING DAY, which was just totally over the top, in a good way!  Perhaps no other actor's catalogue shows such a logical and visible depth and growth and direction.

You MUST SEE this movie.  Remember, the later film, Man On Fire, is also extremely good.
