As an experience, two of the three films rate a 5, and true fans of the films know which films we have REALLY wanted all this time.  Rating the DVDs based on their features and value, I have to rate the boxed set a 3.
While the boxed set doesn't contain the words, "Collector's Edition" or "Director's Cut Special Edition," I was surprised at the lack of features on the much-hyped "Bonus Material" DVD.  No story boarding section, no deleted scenes, no director's or actors' commentary...you get the idea.  What is on the Bonus DVD isn't much more than a few cursory featurettes and 1-hour teasers of each film.  Even worse, one of the major features, "Exclusive Access to the Indiana Jones DVD Website" only runs on computers with Microsoft Windows.  Forget it Mac users--once again, as with other LucasArts products, they are only Windows friendly.
This DVD set could have been so much more.  I kept trying to remind myself that these films were made between 15-22 years ago, and it may be that getting the now high-priced actors and even higher-priced director and producer to do a full length film commentary on something that old might be difficult.  But, on the flip side, I kept thinking they made all that money for the films and now the DVD set, and THIS is all they give the fans?
What viewers of the DVDs are stuck with (I'll bet there will be a "Special Director's Cut Edition" just before Indiana Jones 4) are a bunch of snipettes of interviews, on-location photography, short diatribes on the filmmaking process and the standard "this is how we rig a car to explode and make the stunt man go into the air" segments--the same thing every other action/adventure DVD has.
What is missing from the DVD set experience is exactly what made fans love the character and the stories: the sense that the family of characters had souls and filmmaking was elevated to more than just a 1980s re-do of old classic b/w serials.
