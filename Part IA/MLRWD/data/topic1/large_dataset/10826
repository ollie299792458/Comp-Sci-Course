As far as sequels go Jaws 2 isn't bad, but it could have been better.  It's nice to see a good chunk of the cast from the original, but the story overall just plays out as a rehash of the original with a few twists and turns.  What works in the movie is Roy Scheider's performance as a shell-shocked survivor of the first film who suspects that his town is about to suffer another shark problem when several people begin to disappear again off Amity's waters.  His fears are confirmed when he discovers both of his sons are in peril at the mercy of a shark during a sailing excursion with other teenagers.

This movie is watchable and enjoyable, but it's not the shocker the original "Jaws" was.  The body count is higher in this movie, but the shark attacks are bloodless for the most part and don't pack the punch they did in the first film.  The shark doesn't look as realistic this time around either and they show way too much of it.  Jaws 2 plays out as more of a drive-in B monster movie and less of a shockfest like the first film.  I give this movie three stars for the performances and some of the action sequences.  Skip the rest of the Jaws sequels because it only gets worse from here.
