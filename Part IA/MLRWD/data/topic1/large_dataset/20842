I just concluded her 3 mile weight loss walk dvd, and I tell you I'm so excited. I love the fact that she has "regular" people with her and not the normal size 1 that you see on regular dvds. I was also encouraged by the weight loss count of some of the members of the group that were highlighted during the workout.

She is truly a GOD sent, in the midst of the workout I called my last sister who weighs approx 300 lbs and was enocuraging her to get into it, there is no strain to the body and I just love leslie's spirit.

There were a couple reviews that she talks to much and what not and the music is this and that, to those people I say if you were such great experts why not make your own dvds and leave your negative comments for somebody who really cares geez, cause this woman knows what she's doing and she encourages you to have fun while losing weight.

I actually found myself laughing and being interactive in the workout, I've never had that level of fun or enjoyment before while exercising.

I ENCOURAGE ALL WHO ARE LOOKING FOR AN ENJOYABLE AND EFFECTIVE WORKOUT, PURCHASE LESLIE SANSONE DVDS and forget the party poopers who really can't do any better themselves.
