I think that most accounts of real stories (including this one) are meant firstly, to be informative; secondly, to be artistic.  Indeed, everyone should learn about the hatred and violence that is directed at people with  alternative sexualities.  People who are inclined to hold such views could  certainly benefit from viewing such a film.  After seeing this movie,  anyone with blood in their veins should be able to find simpathy for people  like the main character, Teena Brandon: a lesbian who takes on a  traditional male gender. However, one must be somewhat familiar with a  story before choosing to view it in the form of a two hour film.  Furthermore, a potential viewer must also have some previous interest in  the subject matter.  It seems to me that anyone who would watch this movie  would already be understanding of the various sexualities which are  practiced today.  They are aware of, and disgusted with, crimes committed  against their participants.  I calculate that these are exactly the people  who do not need to see such a gruesome movie to understand the message it  conveys.  I found this movie extremely disturbing and certainly, the most  sad movie I have ever seen.  Without the slightest bit of ignorance, I can  say, "I did *not* need to see that!"
