I will start off by affirming what others have said: Darker Than Black is AMAZING, with wonderful music, top-notch animation, one of the coolest main characters EVER, and an involved plot.  Darker Than Black: Gemini of the Meteor (or Darker Than Black Season 2) is a very, VERY weak follow up.  Gone is just about everything that I loved about the first series and hardly any questions posed by the end of the first DtB were answered at all.  I could describe this whole 12 episode season as being just another small 2 episode-long story in the first season.  Nothing happens!  It's slow and boring and the main (completely wonderful) protagonist has sunk to such a miserable low.  And don't get too attached to any character.  It's just not safe.

To the question of whether or not someone should buy this season, I answer maybe.  For one thing, purchasing this might encourage Funimation to release the first season on Blu-Ray or even encourage Studio BONES to continue the story with actual plot.  Possibly, anyway...  I can hope!  And another reason is just for the OVA included.  This OVA fills in some of the missing time between seasons and further explores many of the characters.  This is very helpful and, I think, absolutely worth watching, even if to alleviate some confusion.

(As a side note, more connecting information is revealed through the excellent manga entitled "Darker than Black: Shikkoku no Hana".)

Now, on to the product itself.  I have not put the discs into my player to watch yet so I can't account for the quality of the picture, but I can talk about this particular item and how it differs from the "Normal Edition".  As far as I can tell, the only difference is the sturdy box it came with that can house both Gemini of the Meteor (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DEUEOU">Darker Than Black: Season 2 with OVA's (Blu-ray/DVD Combo</a>) and the first season's complete collection (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DC883I">Darker Than Black: Complete First Season</a>).  This is pretty useless to me as I already own the individual dvds (having purchased them as they were released) in their artbox (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F2U72S">Darker Than Black: Starter Set</a>).

And that's another reason I'm hoping for DtB (the first season) to be released on Blu-Ray!  To fit in the empty space that the complete first season left behind!

To sum up, if you were in love with the first season and hate to see a poor successor to it, you probably can get away with not buying this.  If you're like me (a completionist, a Studio BONES animation fan, a lover of Blu-Ray, and a hopeful nerd), go ahead and buy this.  I certainly don't regret it.

Maybe if there's ever a Darker Than Black Season 3, the compounded questions will be finally be answered!  *hopeful nerd*
