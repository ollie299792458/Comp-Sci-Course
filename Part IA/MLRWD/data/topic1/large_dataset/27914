Flow yoga is a bit different from the style I usally practice (Bikram), but I found it enjoyable and challenging.

Shiva Rea is a good instructor and it was very enjoyable to watch her fit physique perform these yoga flows in the lush Hawaiian scenery accompanied by pleasant if a bit repetititve music.  Actually performing the flows  myself was a bit more difficult.  I would label this DVD as intermediate rather than beginner.  Poses are not explained and things move along at a decent clip.  If you don't know the poses by name already, then you will be a bit lost, at least until the 4th or 5th viewing.  Also, some of the moves require poses that take your eyes off the screen and it is easy to fall behind at these times.  I would have liked the DVD to close with a more relaxing flow, but that is a minor quibble as you can watch it in a different order if you wish.

After going through the routines, I was left sweating and a little tired, but feeling warm, relaxed and fully stretched. Very nice. Some of the poses are not that easy for the inflexible, but you get better as time goes on and just do what you can.

Not a bad yoga DVD, but perhaps not by first choice. If I had to suggest yoga DVDs for beginners, in order they would be: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RE94LU">Essential Yoga For Inflexible People</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RCNF">Yoga For Every Body (With Over 35 Routines)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUX2P0">AM/PM Yoga For Beginners (with The Dalai Lama & 10 Routines)</a> (I like the different routines for morning and evening).
