This is basically a bunch of kids having a costume party on a train.  Lucky thing about the costumes, as this allows the killer to walk around unnoticed.  As someone else said, the movie consists of a bunch of scenes of kids talking, then the conductor talking to the train crew, then the kids watching a magic show, more kids talking, more magic, then a lot of scenes with the train conductor talking to the kids.  Somewhere sandwiched in between all that is the ocassional kill.  I couldn't believe the amount of David Copperfield scenes in this thing.  It's more than obvious that the film makers were banking on him being a huge draw for the audience.  Now it just makes the movie seem incredibly dated.

There aren't any real scares, and the revenge motive of the killer is quite silly.  A prank is pulled on him, and to everyone's surprise, he decides to start doing a bunch of pirouettes while standing under some loose draperies, thereby nearly hanging himself.  Nobody to blame but his own laughable stupidity.  Jamie Lee Curtis' character motivation seems very odd as well - she holds a grudge against the head fraternity guy for years just because he was responsible for the prank which really shouldn't have hurt anybody, but the guy started spinning under the drapes.  I mean, who would anticipate that some guy would start spinning around when he got surprised?

The only good part of the movie is the atmoshpere on the train.  It could have been a good movie, but the focus on the train conductor character seemed very odd and none of the characters were sympathetic, not that we even got to know them at all.
