I have used Pilates for Weight Loss in the past and enjoyed it very much, but the copy I was using didn't belong to me.  When I decided to purchase my own DVDs for working out, I immediately looked for Suzanne Deason's DVDs.  I love the way she has several levels of modifications on her "for Weight Loss" DVDs and I love that they are created with round bodies in mind.  Yoga for Weight Loss is no exception.  My goal in using these DVDs isn't to lose weight, but rather to find something that works for my shape while still increasing my strength and flexibility and helping me to live with less pain in my muscles and joints.  After reviewing this DVD and doing the fully modified version, I am very happy to say that Deason continues taking round bodies and different levels of fitness into her instruction.  Instruction is clear enough for beginners and the poses flow in a way that is familiar to me, having been a practitioner of Iyengar Yoga some 15 years ago.  If you have a round body (male or female isn't really important) and you are looking for a Yoga DVD that takes that into consideration, this is definitely the DVD for you.  Pay no attention to the "for Weight Loss" moniker - while it may or may not be true, what it really means is that it's for people who have a non-standard body shape.
