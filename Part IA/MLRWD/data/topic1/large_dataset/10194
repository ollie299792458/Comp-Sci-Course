I watched a rental of this movie last night. Saved me from having to buy it, thank goodness. I see some people seem to love this movie and brand anyone "haters" who disagree. Let me say something about my experience. First, if you liked the first one you can save your time and money. This is in no way the same movie or character. The only similarity is the flaming skull which does look pretty good. Everything else is a complete make-over. They changed his costume to a Batman-ish shiny suit( you know how they like to "improve" on the original, maybe supposed to resemble charcoal?),dumped the cool Hawg (precious little saddle time here)and have him more like a Ghost Walker cause he spends more time riding shotgun than anything else. Here, anything he rides is a ball of flame but he's only on them for seconds at a time. He's more powerful than the Devil???? Yeah right.The story is very confusing and what's with the strange convulsing and rocking from foot to foot? I can't blame Nicholas Cage but the director. Agree or not, this Ghost Rider is anything but fun.
