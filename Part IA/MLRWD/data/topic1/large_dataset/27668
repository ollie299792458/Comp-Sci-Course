I think this guy is the best guitarist in this world. The sound of his guitars is incredible. It's a real pleasure : acoustic and electric , the work is perfect.
If you need action and power PULSE is the best concert of all time, but if you prefer feeling and blues , this live is for you.
David if you read this review, you must know that you gave pleasure to millions people around the world since your fisrt album with PINK FLOYD, thank you very much.
Your modesty must be an exemple for all the artists ( and for Roger Waters for sure).
I am a french man and I cried when I listened to your song of Bizet :YOU ARE THE BEST !!!
The sound and video quality of this dvd is EXELLENT. 
My personal preference is your extra with Mica Paris : for all the professionals of electric blues , I really think that are better than all the other guitarists. I love Clapton, BB King , SRV ... but I have never heard a sound so clean and beautiful...
Thanks a lot, David . I hope that you will do ohter concert like this and other dvds.
