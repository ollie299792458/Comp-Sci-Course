I have to say that I really enjoyed "Mamma Mia." I don't like to watch movies much these days because I am really hard of hearing. My youngest son bought me earphones to use to watch and listen to the news and my favorite programs. So when he brought home "Mamma Mia," he insisted I could watch the movie with the family. He even played the words to the song at the bottom of the screen. What fun we had!

After he played the movie one time, all the great-grandkids (we are a multi-generational family in this house) clamored for him to play it again. So he did. I think we had more fun the second time watching the movie and singing along. I never watch a movie a second time, so this was probably a first for me but I did it because we were having such a great time. Can you imagine one movie bringing such joy?

My great-grand-daughter is an American Idol fan and plans to sing on the show one day. She showed me how she will perform with the song "Mamma Mia." She might win.

Anyway, the story. I didn't like that the children had to hear about how Meryl Streep slept with three men in one summer and didn't know the father of her child. The rest of the story was entertaining in showing us how the daughter "found" her father. After the movie, we all talked about our favorite song. Mine was the women throwing down their laundry and other work and joining the women's right-to-have-fun song (that's what it looked like to me). It was fun watching them all dance the same movements. I loved it!

We all loved the singing and dancing. It was a really happy movie. I'm glad my son made me watch it!
