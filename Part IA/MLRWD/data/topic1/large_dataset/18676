Season four of The X-Files is the starting point for the best seasons of the show. Like season three, season four carries on the mythology with new, fresh ideas and classic story arcs. Plot points from previous seasons are finally dealt with here, the impact of the incidents shining through. This is the season where it all starts to change. Scully gets terminal cancer, and Mulder is now caught dead-center in the conspiracy he's been so avidly investigating. With drama soaring to new heights and humor still raising the bar, the season boasts some impressive episodes. Besides serving as a vehicle for the conspiracy, the stand-alone episodes this season are great, too. There's all sorts of bad elements this time around like the chupacabra, cancer-devouring madmen, golems, invisible men, and spirits. This season finds the characters really coming through in situations that they can't do anything about. Mulder and Scully begin to see their place in a growing cover-up to conceal the government's darkest secrets and they rely on each other to make it through and find the truth. With terrific story arcs like Scully's cancer, the identity of CSM, Mulder and Scully's part in the cover-up, and the whereabouts of Mulder's sister, this season marks the beginning of the best for this show. Highlights include "Tunguska", "Terma", "Paper Hearts", "Memento Mori", "Tempus Fugit", "Small Potatoes", and "Gethsemane." Another great season.
