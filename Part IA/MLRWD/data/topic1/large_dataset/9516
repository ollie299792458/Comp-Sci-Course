I wasn't even born when A Clockwork Orange was released. My mother was just entering adulthood when she saw it and somewhat told me about it many years later, but she did omit the more "fleshy" scenes... lol

I first saw this in High School, I thought it was a very interesting film, but as shocking and controversial as it might've been back in the day, I think there's way more shocking material nowadays and it certainly won't impress any teenagers or young adults anymore. However, it's a perfectly done film with excellent acting and many memorable scenes that are now part of popular culture.

About the Blu-ray disc. The packaging is the standard BD blue case. The movie is very sharp and looks really nice in Full HD, however, I do agree that the quality is much higher in "2001: A Space Odyssey", but that's not really a big deal, it still looks great.

Special features are very good too, it even includes a rather lengthy but very interesting insight into Malcolm McDowell's (the actor who plays Alex, the main character) career and life.
