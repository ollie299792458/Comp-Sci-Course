Batman:MOTP is hands down the best comic-book/superhero adaptation ever; live-action or animated. It is better than Tim Burton's classic 1989 feature and any other comic based adventure to grace the small and big screen.
The irony in this is that this series, if you want to admit it or not, was an animated spin-off of the then successful live-action movie series. This movie became a spin-off of the hit Fox series and now it is probably the best interpretation of the character to date.
In the movie, a mysterious killer is knocking off gangsters and Batman is taking the blame. Meanwhile a former love interest of Bruce Wayne returns after suddenly skiping town several years later leaving then husband-to-be Bruce heartbroken. And to make matters more interesting, the Joker devilishly starts to cause trouble. Above all these fun and games is the love story which drives the story. It's an exploration of the loneliness in the life of the main character. 
Mask of the Phantasm to me is what Tim Burton's first feature could have been. Beware that the origin of the Joker in this movie also assumes the Jack Napier/organised crime beginning.  The animation, though not Disney quality, works well with a terrific screenplay. What I liked about the movie was the role fate or destiny plays in the life of Bruce Wayne. Fans of Frank Miller's Batman:Year One should be pleasantly suprised by an action sequence involving the caped crusader against a swat team.
A fantastic movie with a brilliant score by Shirley Walker. A must see movie for any Batman fan.
