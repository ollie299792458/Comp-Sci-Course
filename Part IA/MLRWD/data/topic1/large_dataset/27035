Health from a different level - I always did some kind of sport to balance my life. Yet, sometimes I felt less energy after going for a jogg or doing a gymnastic work out. 3 months ago I started doing these yoga exercises with Ravi & Ana and it is remarkable: 1. I recognised (after "fat free" DVD) that I had no food cravings for chocolate or bread anymore, I had not to hold myself back from "unhealthy food". Somehow this "craving", which I had fought for years, left me after the first time doing their exercise DVD. This was an extraordinary experience.
These exercises bring you in touch with your natural flow. Since then I recognised that especially the chakra exercises which seem to be simple are extremely effective.
With regards to the AM & PM I highly recommend it. Yet, I would have definitely underestimated it without doing their other more engaging workouts (e.g. Fat Free new & Warrior Workout). The AM training is short & very powerful. Sometimes I just do the chakra meditation & that alone has an energising & harmonious effect I have not felt with any other exercise.
