OK, maybe I read too much. But a story of a little baby who floats downriver and is adopted, and later leads his people through the desert to freedom (and water) just sounds a little derivative.
That said, though, I did like this a lot, for a number of reasons:
a) My 2 year old loves it. 'Nuff said.
b) The graphics are amazing. This one is worth watching, it's truely impressive.
c) The dinosaurs look pretty authentic, and I used to read _way_ too much about them. No brontosaurus in the swamp here! Dinos are fast, smart, and move in a way that makes sense to the eye.
d) The meteor that wipes out the Dinosaurs is an AMAZING, absolutely riviting. Perhaps a bit _too_ apocalyptic, but my son seems not bothered, but entranced, by it.
e) The movie is not annoying, even the 150th time your kids watch it. You know this is _really_ important.
f) My 2 year old loves it.
If anything, I'd compare this visually to Final Fantasy, not Land Before Time. It's really worth watching.
