This was a major return for veteran Director John Carpenter, whose work in the past decade or so has left many fans disappointed and confused. After the much deserved success of "The Thing", Carpenter seemed to have lost his feel about how special effects would transfer to film. In The Ward, Carpenter relied more on story and suspense than going all for broke with special effects, and the result is a classic movie that continues to build in suspense and has a ending that comes as a complete, and welcome shocking surprise. The film is atmosperic and well told by this Master of the Macbre, and the special effects flow seemlessly into the developing story. While not as graphic or horrifying as The Thing he definately rediscovered his ability to tell a story that catches the viewers imagination and leads one down paths that in the end, left me feeling completely taken in until the near end of the film .One of the best Carpenter films I have seen in years, and will no doubt hold it's on as time goes by.
