...is how I would describe this movie, if I had to in one word.
I happened to enjoy "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and this film is a bad attempt to replicate that film.

My wife and I sat down to watch this hoping it would be as good as the reviews on the cover. Not even close! I watched about 40 minutes of it and gave up. So to be fair, I did not watch the entire movie. I simply couldn't stomach it. My wife did and reported to me that it never really improved any.

The editing and overall pace was clumsy and awkward. The story seemed forced and absurd. The acting was at times good, but the dialogue was so bad the actors looked silly. When the film attempted to be funny, I actually was embarrassed for the filmmakers because it was NEVER funny. The characters were also unlikeable. The lady that was dying seemed nice enough, but they jump into her ordeal so early in the story that it was hard to feel any serious sympathy because we don't know the character well enough. The woman's husband acts like a jerk and I guess it was supposed to be endearing, but it wasn't. It was irritating. The main character violates the wishes of this dying woman by blabbing about her problem to everyone and then gets mad when they do the same. He also, for some reason, gets a little nuts when he sees people eating cheap food. And then the whole premise of pretending to love and marry someone as one last lie to a dying woman was kind of disturbing. And on and on...

Sorry, but this film left a sickening and awkward feeling during and after viewing it. The only thing my wife and I got out of it was we talked for about an hour later that night about how bad this movie was.
