Despite the fact that this movie is roundly referred to (perhaps inaccurately) as a "coming-of-age" movie, it is also very much a movie for its time...by the time the 1980's were in full swing, materialism and the drive for success had already taken ahold of a surprisingly large number of teenagers who weren't merely interested in sex, drugs, and rock & roll (at least, not until they got their off-campus housing straightened out in time for the first semester of their Freshman year)...no, it was imperative that the important thing was to obtain a degree in Business Administration and to live happily ever after as a character in a Bret Easton Ellis novel.

As such we have Joel Goodson (Tom Cruise) and his pals, a group of red-blooded American youths who stress over the usual teen angst but with a distinctly '80's flair...how can the future be so bright when you do NOT get to the (Ivy League) school of your choice?  Whatever will become of your life if, God forbid, you actually have to enter a publicly funded university?

Everything else seems mildly incidental...there is a hint of "Ferriss Beuller" in that you just KNOW the main character will find a way out of all the bizarre situations that come his way, and like most of John Hughes movies from the same time period, the lifestyle portrayed onscreen may be lost to those of us of middle (or lower middle) class backgrounds, but the slick production, moody photography and fantastic soundtrack make it easy to appreciate regardless...in many ways this is like an extended "Miami Vice" episode...but without the gunplay.
