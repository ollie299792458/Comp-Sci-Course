When compiling lists of the 10 greatest films ever made Carol Reed's THE THIRD MAN is often overlooked, maybe because when we think of great directors, Reed's name doesn't spring to mind. He is certainly not an auteur, let alone in the same class as Orson Welles who has a key supporting role in this film. Nevertheless, THE THIRD MAN is a masterpiece and certainly one of the best movies of all time. I would say it's just about a perfect film.

Pulp fiction writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) comes to post war Vienna at the behest of his childhood friend Harry Lime (Welles) only to discover that Harry has been run over by a truck, and is dead. Or is he? What follows is a tangled mystery that Martins tries to unravel, with or without the help of the authorities, Harry's friends and cohorts, and Harry's lover (Alida Valli) whom he falls in love with.

The plot construction is bold and ingenious, and the dialogue memorable thanks in large part to Grahame Greene's exquisite screenplay. I just loved the way the 2 cemetery scenes with Valli framed the action. There is also the fantastic b&w cinematography with it's expressionistic and surrealistic touches, great acting by everyone, especially Cotton (his best role), Valli, Welles, and Trevor Howard, great editing which includes documentary footage in the narrated opening sequences, and a unique score in which the orchestra is replaced by a single instrument, the zither, expertly played by Anton Karas. All the diverse elements are incorporated in a perfect blend of action, suspense, mystery, romance, and humor.
