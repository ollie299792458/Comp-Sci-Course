There are many important principles about excellence in teaching that are demonstrated by this film.  For example, that "EXPECTATIONS is all"  (to bend a phrase from Hamlet). An excellent teacher has an abiding faith that high expectations, properly managed across individual students, are inspiring and motivating to children. Excellent teaching is a very specialized skill and requires much hard work (and should be justly compensated as such... but that is another issue).
HOWEVER, it is misleading to call these kids "inner city" kids.  These are the first generation children of new immigrants to this country who are highly motivated to have their children succeed.  These are not kids from families that have grown up in 'the projects' for generations - who have little hope and no role models, etc.  Having said that, I do think the basic principles may still apply - it will just take a whole lot more faith in the inner strength and resilience of the children that show up in your classroom.
It was sad to hear how other teachers in the schhol really did not appreciate Rafe very much.  I can understand it though.  Rafe probably has 35 kids or so in his class?  In a 2,300 student elementary, there must be more than one 5th grade class. How do student's get assigned to Rafe's class?  Do the other 5th grade classrooms benefit at all from Rafe's 501c3 corporation and the significant donations he gets to enable his 35 students to go on 2 major field trips each year?  Seems like the first order of business for Rafe should be trying to scale his methods across his own school or at least across all the 5th grades.  Has he tried?
