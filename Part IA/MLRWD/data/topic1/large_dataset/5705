Okay - So I first saw this movie in high school. I've loved it ever since. I actually wanted to emulate Johnny Lee Millers style in this movie there for a while actually. Hmmm. Anyway - not knowing much about computer hacking, this movie is very entertaining. I'm pretty positive though that they glamorized it quite a bit. If you were to actually hack into someones computer - I doubt seriously that you'd see neat little code flying around the screen, or that you can creat a virus that looks like a demonic little pac man actually eating lines of code. Nonetheless - I still love it and it remains one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm not sure what anyone else might say - but I feel the soundtrack is one of the best to date! You have Underworld, Leftfield, Prodigy, Orbital and more offering up some of their best tracks to the film. The soundtrack is actually second best to the soundtrack for the video game WipeOut XL, but that's a whole other story all its own. Okay - I've said enough. Buy it - Rent it - Enjoy.
