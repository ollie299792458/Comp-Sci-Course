After recently renting Red Planet on dollar day I thought I should watch the other Mars dud of the last year or so. ... Anyway, after a bit of a slow start, the movie hints that it may have potential when the first Mars mission runs into an unsavory situation on the Martian surface.  I was left wanting to know more, but in order for this to happen I had to suffer through the rather unsavory middle portion of the movie.  This is where the movie really falls off.  It continues to hammer into the viewers brain the fact that Sinise's character is still grief stricken over his wife's death.  I thought the movie accomplished this at the cookout, but I guess DePalma had little other material to work with.  The action aboard the space craft in transit to Mars is also lacking.  And I don't really mean in a kinetic sort of way, but more in an intellectual sense.  The movie stimulates the mind like an episode of Momma's Family, but without all the witty banter.  And when things do start to pick up, they really just slow down.  There's really no better way to put it.  I will give Tim Robbins credit for excising himself from this sinking ship when he did.  And while I realize the ending of a story usually isn't as interesting as the setup, the ending of this movie is rather lame.  The way the movie contrives to get to the endpoint that it does is really rather weak and amateurish.  If the rating scale provided, I would probably give this movie 1.5 or 1.75 stars, as it is by no means the worst movie I have ever seen.  I would still try to avoid it though, as the movie provides an uncomfortable viewing experience.
