I'm sick and tired of misleading "documentaries." Larry Elder is a hack. He clearly has an agenda, just like Moore, to spew his loaded opinions to the masses. If you really want to know the facts about the second amendment, gun control, and the American media start reading. I'm not talking about Elder or Moore's books either. I'm talking about hard research. Study the constitution, our founding fathers, the history of our media, the history of gun laws, and our judicial system in general. Don't get your history from no-talent hacks.

Also, if you really think the media is liberal, then I would suggest studying the media and taking journalism classes. There is no such thing as "The Liberal Media" just like there is no such thing as "The Conservative Media." If we truly had a liberal media, then every news station and newspaper would be like "The Nation" or "Mother Jones Diary." Same goes for a conservative medai. Then everything would be like "The Weekly Standard" or "American Spectator." What we have is a corporate media. A media that only cares about ratings and telling us B.S. that we don't need to know. They also neglect to tell us a lot about certain issues and stories. I'd rather have a biased media then the one we have now. Conservative and Liberal medai outlets are always more accurate than the mainstream media. They're not run by some corporation that's just lookin' for a buck. They're real journalists that actually care about reporting and giving you the facts. The only thing Brit Hume, Wolf Blitzer, or any other moron on the cable news cares about is their pocket book.
