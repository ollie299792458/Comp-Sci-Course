Every time October rolls around, I have to watch THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. Halloween is my favorite holiday, and yet, since I'm an adult, I can't trick-or-treat anymore, but I *can* watch THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. 
This is a movie unlike anything you have ever seen before: it is a stop-action, musical comedy about the leader of "Halloweentown" - Jack Skellington - growing tired of his job and deciding he might give Christmas a try. But the plot, in my opinion, is really secondary to the off-beat, even bizarre and yet endearing, songs that are sung by this original cast of characters. These characters are so original and so interesting that you feel as though you have always known them. And the surprise to the film is that, in many ways, it is actually a love story between Jack and his admirer, Sally. "But will we ever / end up together?" sings Sally. 
I think that people of all ages would enjoy this movie, except that some of it may be too scary for the very young child (four and under). For me, however, it wouldn't be Halloween without THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS!
