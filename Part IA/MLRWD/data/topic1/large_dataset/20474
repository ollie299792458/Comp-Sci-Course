"Holes" is one of those rare films that is faithful to the original book. Of course it helps that Newbery Award winning author, Louis Sachar, also wrote the screenplay.
I'm a former elementary school librarian who really enjoyed the book when it came out. I saw the film with my son, who has read the book several times, and my wife (a teacher) who had never read this book. My son and I went on an on about how Camp Greenlake is just like we pictured it in our heads, and my wife kept asking us if this or that was in the book, and we just kept saying, "Yes!"
Actually, I think the film made me appreciate the subtle complexity of the book even more. We're talking about a book that deals with such sophisticated themes as fate, justice, compassion, racial tolerance, love, education, family identity, keeping promises, and friendship, to name a few.
Don't let the PG rating fool you. This is not just a kid's movie. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't take younger children to see it, simply because they wouldn't get it.
Who would've thought that a film (and a book) about a bunch of kids digging holes could be so interesting! Highly recommended. I'm sure we'll see it again.
