With a bad attitude I was corralled into watching this movie. In fact, my attitude was so bad it should have landed me in the dog house for a week. In good faith I have attempted to watch many well liked musicals, such as West Side Story, The Hills are Alive with the Sound of Music, Mama Mia and Moulin Rouge, to name a few, and I experienced profound misery to the extent that I was not able to watch any of them in their entirety.  Musicals are just not my forte. Therefore, I was especially resistant to a musical tampering with the Beatles...However, from the very beginning I was surprisingly captivated. What caught my attention and held it is how the movie looked visually. It is an absolutely wonderful treat for the eyes. Choreographed well (the businessmen in New York on their way to work), outstanding cinematography (with attention to little details like juxtaposing the pattern of the sidewalks with the structure of the cathedral ceiling), enjoyable use of animation and special effects (Come Together, the Egg Man and Mr. Kite are enormously fun), cast perfectly with each actor delivering outstanding performances (every frame of the movie provides an example of this) - are reasons this movie is incredible. Moreover, the story is believable and is relevant to the times and to the music. Tampering with the Beatles music is what impressed me the most, for it is the kind of tampering that not only rekindled my interest, but offered new interpretations that are as good as the originals.

Bravo!
