Based on glowing recommendations I read here, I purchased Robin Hood. What a sorry disappointment! I had to force myself to finish watching the first episode. Eager to give this series a chance, I managed to make it through five episodes. I could not continue watching. Advertised as action-packed and cleverly written, the show is neither. The sword fights resemble an elementary school production of Macbeth and the plots are as mundane as reruns of Matlock. Characters are one dimensional and sets resemble a Medieval Times restaurant or a bankrupt historical restoration park. Costumes are atrociously bad: a major character Gisborne looks like a pleather Matrix reject and chain mail is substituted with silver lame. (I swear I even saw a striped polo shirt in a crowd scene.) If those involved with the series could poke fun at themselves, this abysmal show would be side-splittingly hilarious. But, I'm told it's a drama . . . as dramatic and as earnest as any after-school special. If I could rate this series lower than one star, I would. I strongly urge you to bypass Nottingham in favor of truly exceptional historical drama like Rome.
