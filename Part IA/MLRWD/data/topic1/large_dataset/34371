Luca Ronconi's production of "Ernani" opened the 1982-83 season at the Teatro alla Scala amid great controversy.  Riccardo Muti conducted Placido Domingo, Mirella Freni, Renato Bruson, and the late Nicolai Ghiaurov.

Muti's conducting is simply magnificent, being both disciplined and exciting.  This period may be remembered as the greatest in Domingo's fabled career, if one takes into account this performance along with the "Don Carlos" (1983) and "Francesca da Rimini" (1984) from the Metropolitan.  He is the ideal bandit, and sings with great commitment.

Freni's voice was beautiful and she was always musical and sympathetic on stage.  The burning passion one associates with certain of her rivals in Verdi's scores is the sole missing element.  Bruson must be regarded as one of the greatest baritones of his time, giving a magnetic portrayal as the King of Spain with exquisite legato and control.  Ghiaurov's once-great instrument was past its best by 1982, and he was a wooden actor, going in and out of his characterisation.  He never learned, as is said in monastic life, "custody of the eyes."  The very final shot of the production, with the bass supposedly displaying a kind of ferocious vindication, is risible:  Ghiaurov looks confused, not knowing quite what he is supposed to register; a completely superficial actor.

Ronconi is the greatest Italian director since Luchino Visconti, and this production is his masterpiece.  The sets (by Ezio Frigerio) and costumes (by Franca Squarciapino) are overwhelming, and Ronconi alternates between a beautiful stillness and movement that stirs both mind and soul.
