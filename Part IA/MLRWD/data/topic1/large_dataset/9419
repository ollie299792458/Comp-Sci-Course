At last, at last! This is the Steve Vai DVD I have been waiting for. A FULL performance...and a GREAT performance...documented with clean production and just the right amount of video spice.

Steve Vai edited this video himself, and it's clear that he learned from his missteps on the "Live at the London Astoria" video. THIS time, the camera angles show the action with energy but without undue frenetics. The cuts are well paced. The special effects are slipped in tastefully and in a ways that add to the experience and the fun.

Best of all, the performance is nothing short of AWESOME - everything you'd expect and more. The new band format is fresh and dynamic. Alex DePue and Ann Marie Calhoun bring solid rock and delicate classical sensibilities to their violin parts...and Ann Marie practically steals the show with her first statement of the melody in "For The Love Of God." Beautiful.

It's always great fun to see Steve's unique musical and theatrical vision come to life. This DVD finally gives that vision the entertaining, challenging and exciting showcase it deserves. Well done!
