I'm not going to review &#34;Ikiru&#34; per se, but discuss the &#34;import&#34; DVD version (vs. the Criterion version).

The &#34;import&#34; DVD version of &#34;Ikiru&#34; is an official DVD release of the film by the Hong Kong company Mei Ah. It is not a bootleg (though bootleg versions may also exist).

THE SUBTITLES ON THE MEI AH VERSION ARE SO BAD THAT THE MOVIE IS NEARLY UNWATCHABLE. The English subtitles are a translation of the Chinese subtitles/translation of the original Japanese dialogue. This is evident because the Japanese characters bizarrely have Chinese names. As a result, the English grammar is atrociously poor even by typical Hong Kong standards (and this is coming from someone who watches a LOT of subtitled Hong Kong movies). Think about that for a second:

Japanese ---&#62; Chinese ---&#62; Garbled English ---&#62; scratching your head trying to figure out what characters are talking about

Plus, the Mei Ah DVD is a &#34;flipper&#34;, i.e. a double-sided disc that you need to turn over in the middle of the movie.

So my recommendation is to stick with the Criterion version. It is worth the price. If you think you can save money by buying the import version, do this instead:

1) with a magic marker write &#34;IKIRU&#34; on the front of a ten dollar bill

2) burn it

That will cost the same as the import DVD and will be a much more satisfying viewing experience.
