I'm not a die-hard Bee Gees fan, but this is one great concert. The video and audio quality are absolutely flawless. The audio mix is good, too. The drummer is isolated to ensure a good mix.

 I've read many of the customer reviews, and I don't think anyone has mentioned the bonus features. My DVD could possibly be a deluxe edition. The front cover has a sticker attached that lists the extras. The boys sing a few songs from their appearance on "An Audience With The Bee Gees," and an interview is also included.

 But the MGM concert is the selling point. The renditions are studio-quality. The highlights for me are "How Can You Mend A Broken Heart," and "I Started A Joke."

 Olivia Newton-John is in the front row. Barry introduces her from the stage and when "Grease" is performed, she gets a lot of camera time as she listens and watches the clips from the film.

 This show is especially poignant due to the recent passing of Robin. Barry has outlived all three of his younger brothers.

  If you don't have this one, grab it. You won't be disappointed.
