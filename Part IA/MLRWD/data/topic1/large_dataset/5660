Try to remember your 1st, 2nd, or other crushes/loves while you were still innocent, which by the way is always a part of you no matter how much you want to deny it now that you're all grown up, then this movie will probably appeal to you.

It has heart, brains, and a funny bone, and if you're highly imaginative, creative, enjoy lots of humor, are romantic, idealistic, and/or any combination of these, then you'll put yourself in the main character's (Kyle's) place, see it through his eyes, feel a ping or two pulling at your heart strings, and remember what it might have been like for some during those times, and really have fun, laugh a lot, and feel silly.

I'm not going to tell you a lot about the movie's plot and other details, since the other positive reviewers did a great job of that. I'm just going to tell you that every friend that I've watched this with so far, and they are all very different personality types, has enjoyed this movie and laughed out loud quite a bit, throughout. Leather Jacket Love Story is touching, funny, light, campy, hopeful, and sexy. Enjoy!
