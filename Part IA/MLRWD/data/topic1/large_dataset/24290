Luther Heggs, played by Don Knotts, dreams of being a newspaper reporter. To get his big chance he spends the night in the haunted Simmons mansion on the eve of the 20 year anniversary of the murder-suicide of Old man Simmons and his wife.  After reporting on his terrifying night in the mansion, Heggs is sued for libel by Nick Simmons, the Simmons heir.  Being known for his "wild flights of imagination" Heggs must prove that he didn't make the whole story up and in the process reveals the true murderer.

The Ghost and Mr. Chicken also features Dick Sargent as the newspaper editor, and Joan Staley as Heggs' love interest.  Released in 1966 by Universal Pictures, in Technicolor, with a running time of 90 min., this movie was set in the 1950's in small-town Rachel, Kansas.  Alan Rafkin directed.

I give The Ghost and Mr. Chicken five stars.  This movie has everything, comedy, romance, and ghosts; and is classic "Don Knotts".  It has all the spooky clich&eacute;s, black cats, secret passageways, and creepy organ music, just to name a few.  This would be a great Halloween movie for the family.
