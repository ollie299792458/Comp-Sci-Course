Three Kings is the best buddy anti-war movie I have seen in years. Picture Gunga Din with Irish soldiers instead of British,if you will. The plot is deceptively simple: steal the gold that Sadam Hussein stole from Kuwait during the invasion of that country. The trhee soldiers in the title{well,4 actually,Spike Jonez does not get full king billing, I guess,though he almost steals the movie}The scenes of the americans hiding in a humvee to steal the gold and being met with starving woman and children,then gunned down by iraqi soldiers is powerful as is the comment from the soldiers:Bush told them to rise up against Saddam and we'd support the,they did,we didn't." Interestingly for a main stream Hollywood movie, that war and Bush are bashed mercilessly for their betrayal of the Iraqi's and Kurds who risked their lives, then were left to be slaughtered by Husseins troops. The 4 leads are uniformly excellent. Clooney is wonderful as Archie Gates,the Special forces major,Ice Cube is excellent as the chief{also he portrays a pacticing muslim in the movie,and it is done respectfully, another rarity for Hollywood}, Mark Wahlebrg is barlow,almost the conscience of the group and Jonze is conrad, the redneck{well, it is Hollywood after all} Searing in its indictment of the failure of American policy yet still funny enough to keep you watching, this is a very,very good movie. Sort of a thinking persons action movie, if you will.The best american movie of the year. The DVD come loaded with those features which appeal to afficioandos.behind the scenes,timelines  deleted scenes,etc. The transfer is excellent, as is the sound. Very,very well done!
