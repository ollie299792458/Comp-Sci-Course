Hilarious movie, perfectly cast about a guy that had an embarrassing moment at a high school graduation party. Not being able to get the girl of his dreams(his best friend) because he is overweight, he leaves his home town forever going on to L.A. to work as an agent for the music industry. He becomes super successful and good looking with a great life. While chaperoning a difficult singer to Paris,(Anna Faris in a role she was born to play) their plane makes an emergency landing outside of his old hometown. This being the first time back in ten years, since his embarrassing send off, he has to deal with all the drama he left behind and reconcile with old friends, including the love of his life, his best friend. He soon realizes although he has changed so much, the old feelings for this girl and his own insecurities from high school come roaring back in a big way. Great cast of characters and lots of laughs. One great role is that of his mother, played by Julie Hagerty, from Airplane fame. Hilarious ( Joyce, Joyce?) everyone is terrific and really puts their own mark on the movie. Good storytelling and memorable scenes. A must see!!!
