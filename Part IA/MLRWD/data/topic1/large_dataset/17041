I got the VHS version years ago. Played it till there were so many drop-outs that I got another one. Think I went thru maybe 5 copies of the VHS. Then the DVD version came out. The sound on it seemed to me not as exciting as the VHS version. Then the Blu-ray version came out. My expectations were sky-hi, but alas, the sound mix was even worse than the dvd!

Granted, the VHS picture-quality sucks. And the Blu-ray picture is superb...but who cares! I didn't buy this for the picture.

My solution was to buy a new VHS version and copied it to dvd so I could play it forever (since i dumped the VHS player long long ago).

When I play it for peole that come over...everybody is rocking out! Not just toe-tapping, but air-guitars and air-drums and all sorts of moving and shaking...Party is ON!

I've played the dvd version for folks...reaction is usually a polite "Oh, that's nice." Reaction to the Blu-ray...yawns and early departure.

For me, it's the SOUND of the performers and the excitement of their interaction that is important. Sadly, the Blu-ray doesn't have any of that. Kinda seems like only Roy is featured...everyone else has their sound feed muted. Maybe whoever mixed it wanted a tribute to Roy only. Sad. Don't think Roy wanted it that way.
