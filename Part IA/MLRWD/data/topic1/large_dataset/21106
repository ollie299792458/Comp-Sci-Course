I was a bit let down by this one, but should I really have expected a lot to begin with?  I didn't go in knowing much, other than being quite impressed by the lead actor in SPL.  For the record, I rented this one and didn't see any of the extras.  Just the film.

Emotionally and thematically this movie was all over the place.  Taken as a whole, it was a mess.  There were a lot of individual scenes and some characters that worked really well, but it's like someone was trying to make 4 movies at once.  I really liked the three leads for the first 90 minutes.  They became good friends and had some very funny scenes, especially the big training scene.  The action as well was all excellent.  But the last 15 minutes or so were terrible.  And what about that lead, Jacky Wu?  He was great, but his character had no reason to do all that fighting.  Ok, he technically did it for the money, but on a whim.  He wasn't greedy.  He was poor before but had no trouble getting by.  He didn't even want to fight at first because it was illegal and he was an all-around nice guy.  Just didn't make sense.  Oh and this is not a tournament movie.  Wu's character just gets used by two rich guys who keep gambling with each other over their own fighters.
