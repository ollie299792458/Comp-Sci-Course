The first time I ever saw this film was about 3 or 4 years ago.  I had heard many numerous references to this film, but never really got around to watching this film.  One day, in the BX, I saw this and decided to pick it up.  The movie itself is pretty good.  It has a decent storyline and some pretty good cameo's to make it a notch above the current dime a dozen mainstream movie out there.  (Meet the Spartans, The Comebacks, etc) My main gripe about this movie is it seemed too short and it went into the storyline rather quickly.  If it were any other way though, it probably wouldn't be the movie it is now, and it would run the risk of being drawn out and over done.  The storyline, as we all know, is about 4 people who live together, one works at a music store, one is a custodian, or a janitor... one works at a fast food joint, and one is a kindergarten teacher, which scares me because he's a weedhead and all, but he was doing the best out of all of them, AND the guy on the couch until he went to grab munchies, fed a horse, and not just ANY horse- he was an officer of the law!  And ended up in prison.  They raise money to bail Kenny out of jail, where Thurgood meets Mary Jane on one of their visits.  Ultimately,  They fall in love and he kicks the habit.  Half Baked in a nutshell.  This movie is memorable, and the characters and the lines from the movie are good, but not great.  If you can remember the scenes and the lines and laugh along with the movie, cool.  This movie is a little nostalgic for me and always brings me a laugh when I need it.  So, when I need to get lifted, I look no further.  Hope this review helps you.
