Those reviewers who describe Susan Hayward's magnificent performance in this movie as "overacting" remind me of something that happened to me several years ago at my job.  I'd made friends with a new co-worker who was a generation younger than me (he was in his early twenties).  When he mentioned that he loved movies, I asked him if he'd ever seen one of my all-time favorites, "I Want to Live!"  He said he hadn't, so I lent him my copy.

A few days later, when he returned it, I asked what he thought.  He rolled his eyes.  "Talk about fifties overacting!"

I said, "Guess what?  She was going to the gas chamber.  What was she supposed to do?  Mutter, 'Bummer?'"

And so I say to similar reviewers, you don't have to like Hayward's performance or even the movie.  But I can assure you, Hayward was spot-on in showing what it would have felt like to go through what Graham did.

Gloria Swanson's silent-film star character in "Sunset Boulevard" says at one point about the era in which her movies were made, "We had faces then."  I can say about the era in which "I Want to Live!" was made--"We had feelings then--and we weren't too 'cool' to SHOW them."
