Based on the reviews, many of them, my wife and I thought this would be a clever, funny piece with some good writing behind it. We are pretty normal people, not easily offended and enjoy just your regular types of movies-- star trek, you've got mail, transformers, the various kid movies that come out....

This movie just went on and on. The funniest parts are in the previews. The movie gets about halfway through and then just doesn't go anywhere.... plot gets really predictable and just repeats and nothing new happens. They do push the homosexual relationships farther than what would probably stay in the theaters for any length of time, and for normal folks like me it was like, well, I was hoping for more plot.

Carey does not play his normal stupid-humor roles and this is certainly a different piece for him. McGregor is just a supporting actor and really doesn't have an opportunity to offer his true talent. He's just playing a roll in a film.

Had I known, I'd have rather spent the time watching AFV.
