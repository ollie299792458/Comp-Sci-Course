You would have to be a big Pacino fan to like this movie since everything about it is unoriginal. It's one of those films that you have to figure out who the killer is and it can be anybody. Along the way the focus shifts to "possible" suspects trying to make you think that they are the one, only to time and time again disprove it by having them get offed. Eventually it turns out to be the person you least expected it. No way, really?

Al Pacino plays a forensic psychologist who testified against a leading suspect in a murder case. Although there wasn't really any clear cut evidence, the jury convicted the guy largely based on Pacino's testimony. The guy is sentenced to death, before his execution Pacino receives death threats that he has 88 minutes to live, and people start dropping like flies around him.

I keep calling him "Pacino" because you will honestly not remember his character's name. This is Al F'n Pacino playing himself. The whole movie centers around him flirting with his young students like a dirty old man while yelling at everyone and no one in particular. Pacino yelling on screen into a cell phone, let's give this guy an Oscar. By all purposes this would cause a scene, but it seems that everyone in the city is used to Pacino yelling in public places.

"Did I blow up my car?!? Did I shoot bull-ets at myself?!?"

Calm the hell down. It's actually pretty hilarious, it's almost as if everyone around him is consciously trying to make a mediocre movie but he cannot be contained. He's bursting through the screen with an incredible performance!
