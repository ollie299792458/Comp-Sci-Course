this is the most complete realization of the "america's favorite child molesting burn victim" vaudville act. freddy debutes his wiseass routine, but it works. all of the nightmare scenes are memoriable, especially the one where he cuts the guys wrists open and manipulates him like a marioneet. the best in the series. if you get any of them, get this one.

  A review of the other ones:

part 1-the freddy phenomenon begins. some good scenes, but I think this is actually one of the WEAKER films in the series. Overrated, as is Wes Craven altogether.

part 2-the most UNDERRATED. the only one in the series that has a male lead. has tons of subtlety and freddy is scary and intense. a homosexual theme lingers all throughout this movie. Ironically, the opening has THE BEST nightmare sequences of all.

part 4-the most gimmicky in the series. freddy is now a comedian. most of the nightmare sequences are pretty lame, and one is repetitive and annoying. slick but at the same time boring. the most memoriable scenes shows Linnea Quigleys breasts in a FX sequence. skip it.

part 5-weird "Euro" Freddy feel. this movie is really cold and doesn't go well with any of the others. packed with tons of effects, many of which are on the gross side. the actor who plays a comic book artist in this film later stars as a teenage freddy in Freddy's Dead.

Freds Dead-totally lame sequel with a visual style thats actually alot like part 3. The nightmares suck. most notable for having a ton of celebrity cameos.

New Nightmare-Craven uses a life imitating art gimmick, but its really just another unexceptional installment.

Freddy vs. Jason-hated it. they shouldn't take these two out of the eighties. they should of made this film right after say, part 4. the use of CGI is totally heartbreaking. freddy and jason are the epitome of eighties horror franchises and traditional special effects and I think that a lot of people will agree that this fact alone ruins the movie.
