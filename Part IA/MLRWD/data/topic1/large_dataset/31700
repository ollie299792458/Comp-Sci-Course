Jamie Kennedy's character, B-Rad G, is a wanna-be "gangsta rapper" from "The `Bu" who laments that his life is hard. After all, he has to contend with things like traffic and having too much money. His father is running for governor of California and B-Rad's behavior is "embarrassing" and costing him votes. Tom Gibbons is one of two black staff members and is also B-Rad's father's campaign manager. He and his staff devise a plan to kidnap B-Rad and have the "black scared out of him." 
Enter Sean and P.J., a pair of feminine, black, classically trained actors, who are as unfamiliar with "the hood" as B-Rad is. They have to study a hip-hop dictionary to learn the correct phraseology to use on the streets and will be paid $30,000 to carry out the scheme. P.J.'s cousin, Shondra, who actually lives in the hood, enters into the scheme so she can make a quick buck and open a chain of beauty salons. Do the writers really think the only way black people can get ahead in life is by ill-gotten gains and duplicitous methods? 
Being a black woman from Los Angeles I struggled with whether or not to see this movie. Since the basic premise of the movie deals with hip-hop, I thought it would glorify the elements of the genre we are bombarded with on BET and MTV such as the "video girls," the bling-bling, etc...
