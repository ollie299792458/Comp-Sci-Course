How would you like to live the same day over and over?  Well, for some of us, it feels that way occasionally.  But in this fantasy, our hero does just that.  He keeps living the same day over again, trying different things each time, learning from his mistakes, and getting more and more talented.  It's a great concept for a movie, and it is a great comedy.

One minor change I would have made in the movie is this: I would have had some indicator so the audience would know just how many times our hero had gone through the day.  Early in the movie, that number might read 1, then 2, then 3.  But later, it might be a hilariously large number.

Now, is there a profound concept behind all this?  Um, I don't think so.  If I had to live through thousands of similar days, would I try to get better at music or art?  Maybe!  And sooner or later, I might start phoning up all sorts of scientists, find out what theoretical problems they were working on, and, eventually, solve them.  After that, I'd be phoning those scientists to tell them the answers to their problems, on the spot.  I'd also be finding a way to do all sorts of computer searches each day, systematically looking for needle-in-haystack kinds of solutions to problems.  Eventually, I'd find some interesting stuff.  And it would be easy to prepare an absolutely unbelievable chess opening book (although one would have to memorize it).  Oh, there is plenty even one person could accomplish, given enough time.  If you watch this movie, you'll find that you'll wonder about what you might do with so many chances to live a day over and over.
