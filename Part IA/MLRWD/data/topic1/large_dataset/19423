The voices to go with Yogi and Boo Boo were way off.  Ackroyd's sounded too "smart" and uppity for a bear, and Boo Boo's sounded forced and not juvenile enuf for such a cute bear.(boo Justin Timberlake  The bears were TOO human.

The animation and live footage did not mix well together, the scenes with both humans and animated bears were obviously fake.  Would have been better as a completely animated/human-less film.  Since its one of the first live action/computer animation mixed film that I remember seeing, I suppose it was a noble attempt that will surely improve with time.

Loved the animation, hated the voices, didn't enjoy the live action(which most of the movie was).  Might be ok for kids.

Movies are supposed to be entertaining, with ups and downs, not boring.  I enjoyed two  scenes--the waterskiing one, jand the flying/turtle scenes, which didn't last nearly long enuf and actually included some excitement.  If the rest  of the movie had been more like the whitewater scenes, it would a been a good movie.

I hardly watched the cartoon as a kid so I'm not biased in that way, but I have to believe it did the original an injustice.  It got good for the last 10 minutes, too little too late.
