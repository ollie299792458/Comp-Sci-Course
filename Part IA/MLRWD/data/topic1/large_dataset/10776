The Gummi Bears modeled after the Gummi candy we all love takes place during a medieval style era when kings, knights, and noble men existed. The ancient Gummi Bears had fled the land when humans threatened their way of life. A small group of Gummis' were left behind to tend the Gummi home in hopes that the ancient gummi's could return. The tales take you through various adventures the bears face, some are against a tyrant that threatens the glen, while others dive into magical possibilities. Accidental spells, unusual creatures, nifty gadgets of all sorts, and monsters of plenty show up in the day to day lives of these bears making for a great series.

This has been one of my all time favorite animated series when I was growing up. The stories, action, and adventures throughout inspire young adults to become honest and caring individuals. I am delighted that Disney has produced the series in DVD format. If they make the remaining episodes available I will be first in line to purchase them. I hope to see some of the Care Bears, Ducktales,  and My Little Pony series sold on DVD to complete the wonderful 80's style of animation. This is a must buy for all ages. You wont be disappointed.
