I went into this film with apprehension.  I'm not a fan of MMA or Ultimate Fighting.  I can't stand it.  I've always been a Boxing fan, and will always be a boxing fan.  So I heard this was an "MMA Movie" and I wasn't sure whether or not I would like it or not, but I like David Mamet's films, and there were several actors that I'm a fan of including Children of Men's Chiwetel Eijefor.

I have to say I was blown away by this.  This is NOT an MMA movie.  This is an intelligent film that happens to involve MMA.  If you're looking for a dumbed down movie that treats the audience like an idiot, and has a fight every five minutes or so, go rent Never Back Down.  That's probably more to your liking.

This is a Grown Folks movie involving MMA.  Chiwetel Eijefor plays a man who trains cops to survive.  he doesn't train them to compete in tournaments, or to be the toughest guy in the world.  He trains them to come home alive, if they happen to run into trouble on the streets while doing their job.  And the film is about what happens when this man of honor is put in a situation where he is being asked to forsake his honor and his code that he lives by.

It also stars Max Martini (CBS' The Unit) in a pivotal role in the film.

I'm not going to give anything away, but I would advise you to skip the movie trailer because it gives away just about EVERY big thing in the movie including part of the climax.

Don't watch this if you're expecting a whole bunch of fighting.  This isn't about the fight.  This is a very special movie that I've already watched about five times since buying the Blu Ray.

There's some very good extras on there as well, including a director's commentary by David Mamet, and a featurette that showcases the Asian Magician in the movie, who is a real life magician.

The picture quality and audio quality on this Bluray is fantastic!  Buying this film is a no-brainer.  You have to do it.  You won't be sorry.

I can't recommend this any more highly than I am.
