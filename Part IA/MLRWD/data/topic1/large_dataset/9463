*Might have some spoilers. I was very interested in seeing this movie after seeing who was in the cast. I was familiar with Charlyne Yi from her role in Knocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition). I was also aware of Michael Cera from one of my favorite movies of all time, Superbad (Rated). And last, Seth Rogen who is in both movies mentioned above. He plays a friend of Charlyne's character and has a very small part but nice to see him.

"Do you believe in love?" That is what Charlyne Yi who is from California is asking. She has a production crew she takes across the country asking her friends, children, strangers, middle aged, and also elderly people if they believe in love. Charlyne, aka `Chuck', does not believe in love and wants to know what others think of love. During the filming she meets Michael who is a boy from Toronto. During the movie she is interviewing people about love. She goes all over the country and the couples she meets and even single people share their stories and as they tell them they are reenacted for us. I thought this was a really cute idea!

Throughout the movie Chuck is getting to know Michael on a personal level. Oddly enough I would not have seen these two actors as a couple but they were able to convince me that there was chemistry between them. I would not say she is guarded but she has no filter when she speaks of her feelings of love or lack of it. While spending time with Michael I think he slowly starts to break her out of the `I don't believe in love" shell. He falls for her but she cannot say she is in love with him. At that point they are asked to go to Paris to `end' the movie. Michael gets sick of the cameras and not feeling his love reciprocated, declines to go. Chuck goes on her own but is not having a good time. Production tries to get her to say on camera she is not happy in Paris because she is sad over Mike. She states she is sad because she could not tell Mike she loved him. She then says she wants to leave.

She goes to Brampton (near Toronto where Mike is from) to find him. She then tells the production crew to stop taping. At that point they did not have an ending: Chuck submitted her own. At the end Mike and Chuck's story turns into a reenactment that was played throughout the movie of the people that were `in love'. The reenactment is left for you to make your own interpretation of their story.

I highly enjoyed the movie and was laughing a lot! I think this movie is either going to be loved or hated by people. I cannot say I loved it but I really liked it! I am glad I saw it and was highly entertained!  I would recommend this movie, it was refreshing and something new.
