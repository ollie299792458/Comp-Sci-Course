First off, Sahara is not a Comedy, but an Adventure with Humor. Secondly, its obvious Gentleman Caller 83 has never heard of Clive Cussler, or read any of his books - considering if he had, he would have understood the first fact. The Dirk Pitt series has been on the National Best Seller lists for about 2 decades now.

"Cussler's books have been published in more than 40 languages in more than 100 countries and have a readership of more than 90 million avid fans. His past international bestsellers include PACIFIC VORTEX, MEDITERRANEAN CAPER, ICEBERG, RAISE THE TITANIC, VIXEN 03, NIGHT PROBE, DEEP SIX, CYCLOPS, TREASURE, DRAGON, SAHARA, INCA GOLD, SHOCK WAVE, THE SEA HUNTERS (non-fiction), FLOOD TIDE, and CLIVE CUSSLER DIRK PITTÂ® REVEALED" (excerpt from bookreporter.com article).

If the Direction is at least competent, the acting decent, and the special effects fun and dazzling, this movie has the potential to become a blockbuster with the ability to continue on in the likes of James Bond and Indiana Jones.
