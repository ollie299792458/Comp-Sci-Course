I've waited literally years for this one. By the time I bought a DVD player the original edition was out-of-print. So, finally, the moment we've all waited for...well, it's alright. First of all I WILL say that the new transfer is first rate, although I was a little disapointed that the picture isn't clearer; I guess I just didn't realize the limitations of the original negative. Sela vis. And the new 5.1 sound mix? Fantastic! I love the inclusion of the THX Optimizer for those of us who can really use one to calibrate our televisions to the proper settings. Now for the unpleasant part. The new interviews with Stuart Gordon and Brian Uzna are good but really don't offer much insight and get a little monotonous. And all the "extended scenes?" I'd hate to ruin it for you all but they were ALL included on the original, R-rated VHS release (though not on the unrated one). I still consider this a must-have but as for hardcore fans looking for the Holy Grail, this one just missed it by an inch or so.
