Reviews here did not make this film sound interesting, but I never argue with 4.5 stars and, so, gave it a try. Simple descriptions of what this movie is about simply do not do it justice. I was blown away by this incredibly intimate and emotionally-driven story.

Iguchi is a widowed man who loves his two young daughters (both incredibly adorable) and his ailing mother (who rarely remembers who he is). He is stretched to the bone trying to support them all on the most meager of wages. He risks his well-being and his honor to provide for them. He is a disgraced member of society, but he doesn't care. He doesn't seek recognition or increased social status; all he cares about is his daughters.

Yoji Yamada's screenplay is a beautiful one which explains itself slowly, instead of the Hollywood mode of hitting you over the head so that you can't possibly miss the point being made. For example, early in the film, we see Iguchi working in the garden after coming home from work. We assume that's what he likes doing, like many of us do, but we find out later in the film that he must grow and sell his crops to supplement his wages and stay afloat. There are dozens more examples like this that you need to discover for yourself. Watching this film a second time would yield whole new meaning for dozens of scenes.

I am just shocked at how good this film is, especially since I had zero expectations. This is now my favorite samurai film after Seven Samurai. It is a slow piece, very unlike typical Samurai films, but a real treat if you have the patience for it. It is, without a doubt, a very special movie. If you're a fan of Japanese cinema (new or old) or just great filmmaking in general, I highly recommend giving this terrific film a viewing.

One quick comment about the DVD: English subtitles are burned into the picture, meaning that they can't be turned off or changed. Perhaps another publisher like Criterion will eventually give this great film the treatment that it deserves.
