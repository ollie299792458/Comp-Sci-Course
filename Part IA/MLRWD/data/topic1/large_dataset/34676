This is a great movie that brings you mixed feelings. It gives you anger, sorrow, strength, compassion, love and hope! This movie is based on the true life story of Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, played by Denzel  Washington. He's chased by a racial driven detective since the age of 11.  Being dealt the wrong hand in life, he spends half of his life (wrongfully  accused) in jail. I didn't like the directing in the first half of the  movie. The director, Norman Jewison, kept jumping from one time frame to  another, sometimes without you knowing. During the second half of the  movie, it started settling down. It focused more on Hurricane and his  relationship with Lesra and his 3 Canadian tutors. Lesra was inspired by  Hurricane's publicized book. Hurricane befriends Lesra and his 3 tutors. In  fact, they devote their entire lives in trying to prove Hurricane's  innocence. Something that activists, famous actors and musicians failed to  do before them. This wasn't your typical jail-type of movie. It didn't have  any rape, drugs or violence. I look forward to reading the out-of-print  hard copy of Hurricane's book, "The 16th Round...".
