Anyone who grew up in the 60's, 70's or 80's remembers watching this on television.  I remember my family watching this every day on the CBN.  This is just a wholesome show with no cussing or sex and plenty of mischif!  While Bud, the younger of the two Ricks children gets him and Flipper into all kinds of trouble; the older brother, Sandy usually finds himself right in the middle of it as well due to Bud's pleadings.  Many times, Porter Ricks is right there with them - but since he's the dad, he usually does the punishing.

What ever happened to the days when an entertaining dolphin, two mischevious boys who practically live with the fish, and an old-fashioned widowed father who still believes spanking his kids can get a point across will fill our entertainment needs?

Though season two is available, it is a lot more expensive then the first season.  Season three isn't available at all.  Every few months I check back to see if we'll be in luck to get these last to seasons at a reasonable price, but so far no go...

Though this show is based on the movie with Chuck Connors, there are a lot of differences.  Porter Ricks lives in a different house and closer to the ocean.  Though the bird and Flipper are still in existence, the mother is not.  Sandy now has a brother.  Even Porter Ricks has undergone a personality change.  The father is more loving.  Though he may be as stern, he seems to be stern in a different type of way.

Until I'm able to get the last two seasons, I'll continue enjoying the one season I have!
