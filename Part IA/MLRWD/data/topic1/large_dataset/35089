Rapturous is the one word I can think which may sum up the entire experience that is "The English Patient."  The rapture can be felt at every level of its production; the acting, the editing, the cinematogrophy, the screenplay, the music, the story itself.  The experience is so visceral that at times it seems to transcend the medium of the film and spread itself like an inkstain across the mind.

This is a complex, multilayered, intensely character driven epic; it is a love story, and a tragedy, one whose ramifications spread through the lives of the characters involved like ripples on a pond.  Against a WWII backdrop, Fiennes plays "the english patient," a man dying of burn wounds, whose slowly returning memories occur in a series of flashbacks that reiterate his doomed love affair with a married englishwoman (Scott Thomas), which interweaves in various ways with the stories of his eclectic companions, all of whom are emotionally and/or physically scarred in their own ways.

The directing, acting and visualization are utterly hypnotic, helping this film to reach dizzying heights of emotional intimacy.  The only thing which might have been improved was further development of the supporting cast, most especially the character of Hana, beautifully played (and suitably rewarded with a Best Supporting Actress Oscar) by the luminous Juliette Binoche.

Suffice it to say, this film is a masterpiece and was recognized as such by every major film critic out there.  The more I watch it, the more rich and seamless it becomes; instead of being able to pick up on errors, I only pick up more ways to fall into the story.
