A quickie warning about the Blu-ray version:

I just bought this elsewhere online to pick up at their retail store (hint: it was the *Best* price) and when I got it, I saw that there is no digital copy, EVEN THOUGH THE UPC NUMBER IS IDENTICAL. The original cover art had a sleeve (I think) with "Digital Copy (Blu-ray Disc symbol) Special Edition" at the top, with Jim Carrey bungee-jumping off a bridge. The newer version that I received is Jim Carrey walking through a field with his arms outstretched.

After about an hour of research and wondering if I should return it and start trying again to get it cheap on eBay while avoiding used copies (seller having used the digital copy) or just to keep the darn thing, if you look at Amazon's image of the back cover here and zoom in, it says, "(Digital copy) Offer expires April 6, 2010".

So, kudos to Amazon for having readable back cover art, and BOO! to the studios for limiting digital copy availability and not changing the UPC code. Bad studio, bad!
