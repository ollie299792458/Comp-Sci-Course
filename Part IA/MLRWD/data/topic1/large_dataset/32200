The visual imaages are remarkable.  In fact, they are what is good about the movie.  If viewed for that, it is worth seeing.

The story was a major disapointment.  Depite good acting, it was impossible to care about the charaters.  I think this was because the story line drags too much and just seems to be a compendium of  too movie references: for example, the robots were transmogrifications of Gort, Robbie and the Iron Giant but with a bad attitude.  Running around inside the mountain with the rocketship was reminicent of Indiana Jones and James Bond; the splash down sequence was pure Bond. A good idea got out of control. There is actualy a decided absence of new ideas and creativity in this regard. That's understandable for first time directors but the producers have been around long enough to know better and should have exercise more control.

The DVD includes the 6 minute short that was the basis of the project.It is actually much better than the film itself.  Had they continued with that and been held to 90 minutes the results could have been impressive.  Also in the special fetures section someone says they were trying for a "noire" look -- and in that may lie another big problems.  It had that look, alright, but there was nothing "noire" about the characters or the story line.  No moral ambiguity about motivations, no sense of emptiness at the end.

I hope they get to try again but next time with the help of simeone who can spin a good tight tale and who understands that the visual style must be linked to the stopry and characters.
