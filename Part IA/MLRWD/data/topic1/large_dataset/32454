I think the premise of this film was good and, were I a creative person, I would be tempted use the premise and some of the plot points to write what could probably be a wonderful book. There were even some lines in the movie that were fantastic, when I could figure them out because of the poor production quality. Had this group never heard of looping and ADR? As other reviews have pointed out, the sound was so bad as to render some lines impossible to decipher, regardless of how loud you turn the television or how many times you back up the DVD.

The editing was also terrible ... abrupt jump cuts and many transitions through tedious seconds of completely black screen. During some passages it was impossible to figure out how much time was passing ... were we still at the same party are had we jumped ahead in time to another party days (weeks?) later? There were even places where there seemed to be flashbacks, but if that was intended it wasn't clear and did not particularly make sense. And what as with the bizarre fortune teller sequence?

There seemed to be way too little backstory conveyed for the main characters. The opening few minutes were so awful, I almost didn't continue watching. When a movie that has been marketed as a "gay interest movie" opens with unexpected violence and heterosexual sex, why should anyone continue watching long enough to figure out which characters, if any, are gay and what possible relevant message can be gleaned from the story.

This is one of those, fortunately few, movies that I don't want to keep but feel I should just throw in the trash rather than give away or sell it, thereby exposing another unsuspecting viewer to the train wreck. One star is way too much for this stinker!
