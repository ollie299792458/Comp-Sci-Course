This 2001 award-winning documentary by Jacques Perrin certainly is unique.  It's a full 99 minutes of exquisite cinematography of migrating birds, some species flying as far as 12,500 miles each year.  There are a few captions, which tell the name of the bird and the amount of mileage they fly in order to migrate.  There's also some light background music as well as natural sounds, and a few sentences, spoken by the director.  Other than that, it's only the birds, whose migratory patterns were followed for three years.
At the beginning of the film there's a disclaimer informing the audience that there were no special effects were used. And so I sat there in wonder of how they were able to achieve all their shots.  There's the beauty of birds flying in formation, close up shots of them feeding their young, competing with each other, stopping to rest.  And there's one magnificent shot of fleeing an avalanche. 
There are different species filmed in different areas of the world.  We see the Artic Circle, the American Southwest, the industrial areas of Eastern Europe, the vast oceans, the skyline of cities and even a shot as they fly past the World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty. We also see hunters whose gunfire brings sudden death as well as a bird with a broken wing who is attacked and devoured by crabs.
Here is nature, in all its power and glory.  I sat there wide-eyed, taking it all in.  And somehow, the petty concerns of my daily life seemed to fall into perspective. 
Some people might find this film boring and I doubt if it will get wide distribution in theaters.  It's only playing in one theater in New York and, even in this densely populated city, there was a very sparse audience.  I'm glad I was one of the people in that audience though because I loved every moment of the film would definitely see it again on DVD, especially if it had special features to describe how the cinematography was done.
Highly recommended.
