SPOILERS.

This movie sucked. I'm sorry to say so, because I'm a big fan of Rachel McAdams - "The Notebook" was amazing, and I hoped that this one would prove equally heart-warming.

The first problem is the premise. Henry is a time-traveler; it's a compulsion he has no control over. He pops in and out, always naked, always in search of clothes - for no real reason. Regardless, McAdams' character falls in love with him (after first meeting him as a child) and marries him.

When things get tough, Henry buys a lotto ticket and wins millions. They buy a new house, with a studio so his wife can work on her art. She miscarries several times, evidently because the babies are travelers, too. Henry gets a vasectomy, but it doesn't matter because his YOUNGER time-traveling self sleeps with his wife and she becomes pregnant.

They end up having a daughter, who's also a traveler (of course). I would try to explain further, but I just can't get excited about writing this review. This movie was a disappointment. I recommend renting instead of buying, if you still want to see it. Don't waste your money.
