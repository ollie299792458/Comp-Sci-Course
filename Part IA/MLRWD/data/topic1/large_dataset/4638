A fabulous, frenetic, off the hook performance by some so-called "dinosaurs" of rock, Summer 1978, just when punk and disco were waging a war to the death.  Rising above it all are the original punks, the anti-Beatles, presaging and outdistancing the more monochromatic Who by a year or so.  The Stones get away with every trick, from disco-Miss You to twangy Girl with Faraway Eyes to Chuck Berry Sweet Little 16 and everything in between.  It's like a history lesson in American music traditions, pumped through several dozen monsterous Ampeg rigs turned to 11 or 12, lovingly restored by audio guru Bob Clearmountain.  The soundtrack sync is perfect, no slapdash edits that don't match what is actually being played. It's a joy to listen to through headphones. Ronnie Woods' playing is from the heart, Keith as intense as Johnny Ramone ever was, Charlie Watts provides a drum clinic in keeping the groove, Mick showing, like a crazed marionette, why there is only one Mick Jagger. This is one of those dvd concerts everyone from 8 to 80 should have so that their collection of cultural artifacts of the mid-to-late 20th century is complete. A must-have for fans of Rock and Roll.
