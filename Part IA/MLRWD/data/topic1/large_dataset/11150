This movie came highly recommended to me and I must say that I was not disappointed in it. I recommend this movie for a number of reasons. First the story is very intriguing. The presentation Jewish life in Warsaw was quite heart wrenching, this was quite a good angle for featuring a story, very unique. I thoroughly enjoyed the realistic aspect of this movie (beyond that it was based on a true story) that was incorporated by the director, Roman Polanski's, personal experience in WWII.  Secondly, the scenery and cinematography is well done and makes up for the relatively slow pace of this narrative.
On one hand I must agree with the other nay-sayer reviews in saying that this movie lacked so much in character development and dialogue. This movie left too much hanging for my liking. Things such as: what happened to his family, friends etc. I'm sure that given the high death toll these things were meant to be obvious, but the main character gives no indication as to his emotions or feelings on the matter. But on the other hand, given the circumstances of life at this time the story could not have been told any other way. 
The DVD comes with a number of features, such as a documentary, that are also worth watching, I found that listening to Roman Polanski's personal experience in the Ghetto was fascinating. It amazed me the amount of work and detail that went into this film.
This movie is well worth a watch for those who are interested in the human cost of war or those who enjoy epics of this time period.
