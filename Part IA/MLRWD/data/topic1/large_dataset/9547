I'm a 3D enthusiast and purchase most anything released in 3D. This is the earlier "Clash of the Titans" which worked well for this viewer and 4 stars for this one. Forget great acting, and purchase this for an engaging story, great costumes, spectacular sets and special effects. The cover shows the scorpion attack that appears in the middle of the film and really holds the entire story together. The spectacular special effects ending with the attack of the monstrous Kraken is not a let down at all either! I imagine many viewers oaf the original film from a decade or so back will be a bit let down that the owl is not brought into the fracas. They do pay homage to it at the owl appears briefly and is dismissed as being unimportant. This was a box office hit and did about 30% better than the current Wrath of the Titans which was more or less about the same without an engaging story. If you were to choose this one or the other, this is the better choice. See my review of the Wrath of the Titans to understand the differences. FOUR STARS
