I RECIEVED MY OZZIE AND HARRIET COLLECTION TODAY, AND WATCHED COUPLE OF EPISODES. NOW MY EXPECTIONS HAVE FALLEN SHORT, MAINLY, BECAUSE I EXPECTED THE QUALITY OF THESE DVDS TO BE EXTREMLY GOOD. BUT INSTEAD I FIND THE PICTURE QUALITY ON DISCS IS VERY POOR. ITS WONDERFUL THAT SO MANY EPISODES WERE PUT IN ONE COLLECTION,THE PICTURE IS VERY DISAPPOINTING.. AUDIO HOWEVER IS VERY GOOD, BUT I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS COLLECTION IS NOT UP TO THE STANDARD OF DVDS LIKE HAZEL, SEASON ONE AND ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS SEASON ONE.BOTH THESE DVDS ARE ALSO IN BLACK AND WHITE, BUT THEIR PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT. THOUGH IT STATES ON THE BOX THESE ARE DIGITALLY RE-MASTERED( THEIR NOT) BUT THE PICTURE QUALITY WOULD BETTER. THIS GOT 4 STAR RATING DUE TO THE NUMBER OF EPISODES IN COLLECTION, OTHERWISE  IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING .THE EPISODES ARE FUN TO WATCH AND VERY FUNNY, THE NELSONS ARE REALLY GOOD REPRESTATIONS OF THE APPLE PIE FAMILY. MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT HAVE SHORT CHANGED THIS FAMILY. PICTURE QUALITY " YUK" NELSON FAMILY GREAT".
