If it was not enough to see The Rock in Hannah Montana wearing makeup and blonde wig with curlers, you get a treat in Tooth Fairy seeing him donning a pink classical ballerina dress complete with pink tights and slippers. Dude rocks! He can pull off pink as well!

I would say this movie is 4.5 because it did tick me off at one point, but in the end, I enjoyed it, how the end made up for this one lousy part.

There was some funny parts, especially when he asked if the dress made his bumper look fat. I saw this a few nights ago, rented. Rented this and saw Mall Cop as well! I leaned a little more towards Mall Cop as far as enjoyment goes, but I enjoy this as well! I'm ready to buy both movies despite not really being a tv or movie person.

You guys should go on youtube, and see the clip of The Rock on Hannah Montana. I'm not a wrestler fan, but he's the man!

This is a very enjoyable movie, and when he is challenged to embrace being a tooth fairy in a real sense, and not in his term of Tooth Fairy, his hockey nickname, I say it is a lesson of learning sometimes it pays to embrace something instead of resisting it, to get to the better side.
