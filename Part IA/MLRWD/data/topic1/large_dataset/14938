After their first year of college, four friends (Jason Biggs as Jim, Chris Klein as Oz, Thomas Ian Nicholas as Kevin, and Eddie Kaye Thomas as the amazing Paul Finch) get together and have an awesome summer.  They rent a cottage and have party after party.  Jim needs sex tips from his former band geek Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) to get ready for his big day with Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth).  Oz's girlfriend Heather (Mena Suvari) is off to college, and Oz is anxiously awaiting her arrival back.  Kevin is still adjusting to the fact that him and Vicky (Tara Reid) are just friends now.  And last but definitely not least, Paul Finch is still obsessed with Steve Stifler's (Seann William Scott) mom (Jennifer Coolidge).  This summer (this movie) is packed with sex jokes, hilarious one-liners, and so much more.

My favourite scene is with the `lesbians'.  Stifler sees the girls holding hands and automatically thinks they're gay.  So him, Jim and Finch sneak into their house, only to get caught by the girls.  Stifler tells them he wanted to prove they were lesbians.  The girls decide to mess with them and have a little fun of their own.  They'd kiss, then they'd ask the guys to kiss.  Oh man, the expressions on their faces, LOL!
