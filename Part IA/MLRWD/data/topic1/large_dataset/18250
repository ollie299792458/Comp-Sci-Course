They took me kicking and screaming.I was board ,no plot .That was my first impression of this film.I CANT LIVE WITHOUT IT NOW.Bruno Ganz that face,you could write a map on it.Who is Homer? The library scene.NICK CAVE AND THE BAD SEEDS WOW!!!! COLUMBO. PETER FALK.This film is in my opinion a combination of EXPRESSIONISM and IMPRESSIONISM, The German and the French.The contrast of black and white/color,expresses it visually.The dialogue expresses it verbally, slow and methodicaly like an opera.I can go on and on about this film but time is short ,buy it ,because its like a book you will find something new each time you view it .It takes place in Berlin before the Eastern European revolultions of the early 90's.Berlin beautiful but dark a divided city,Solveig Dommartin is always veiwed in color,french expressionism.This film views our complex lifes in our world ,the modern world .It trys to view our lifes through these angels,sometimes answers are given sometimes just posed.Feel it ,Visualise it.
