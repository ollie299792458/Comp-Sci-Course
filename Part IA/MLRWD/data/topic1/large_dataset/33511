First off let me say the first time I saw this movie I was around 5 or 6 & it scared the living daylights out of me. I am now a 22 year old woman & the gremlins series are two of my favorite "scary movies" I watch them every time I see they are on, laugh the entire time I watch them, & will be buying this movie. For all the people complaining about how bad the acting is & blah blah blah guys this movie was made in 1984 not 2004 & is supposed to be a raunchy,comedic, semi-horror movie. Is it scary? Heck yes it's scary, the first time you watch it. If you show it to your kids they're probably gonna have some problems sleeping for a few nights, but guess what my parents told me when I got like that when I was younger? "It's just a movie, go to sleep. *turns lights out*" Guess what? I learned to tell myself it's just a movie (even if I had to say it to myself 2000 times til I passed out)& go to sleep, the next morning I would wake up smiling because nothing happened to me & realized that scary movies are just that, movies. They're not real. & I'm fine now, no therapy, no irrational fears of the dark, no dreaming about Gremlins coming to get me. If anything this movie's a lesson in following instructions, Peter was clearly told not to get it wet or feed it after midnight & he did anyways soooo it's kinda his fault things went sour. The 80s and 90s were full of movies & shows that didn't have cheery songs & happy go lucky characters in them that although frightening we still appreciate now. I watched Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Child's Play, Are You Afraid of the Dark, Candyman and Pumpkinhead & I screamed  and hid under the covers every time but I loved every second of it just as much as I loved Disney movies. Stop babying your kids, being afraid isn't going to kill them.
