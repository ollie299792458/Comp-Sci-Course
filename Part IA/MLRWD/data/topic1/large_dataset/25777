I have never seen alot of this footage in others series.  That is why it gets even 1 star.  It is good footage.

The narration is so biased I have to mute it while watching the series.  The propaganda is so thick it makes my stomach churn.

When I watch a documentary I want an unbiased, truthful narration.  This series portrays this war like our revolutionary war and comes off portraying Stalin like George Washington.  But what do you expect from a series produced with the blessing and full cooperation of the Communist Soviet government.

The narration even ruins the descriptions of the battles.  It makes the Russians look like some sort of Spartans of Bravehearts.

This documentary did not come even close to describing the Eastern front accurately as the war between the 2 most evil regimes in the history of mankind.  The Soviets murdered over 30 million of there own people outside of WW2 (not including the millions of other peoples).  By the time it is said and done they make the Nazis look like amateurs.  There was no good and bad side.  There was only VERY BAD and ULTRA BAD.
