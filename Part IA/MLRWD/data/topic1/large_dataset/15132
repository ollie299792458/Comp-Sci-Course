I'm not really a fan of people who use cliched terms like "This was an hour and a half of my life that I wasted watching this film that I'll never get back again."  But after watching this film, I truly understand why people would utter this sentiment.  This film is beyond terrible beyond unwatchable.  To be honest, I'm not a fan of the avant-garde "what does life really mean" type of movies - i.e. "Elephant," "Donnie Darko," "Mulholland Drive"-that are like watching a Robert Cormier novel come to life.  I had to watch Van Sant's blatant Columbine exploitation "Elephant" for a class once, so I should've known what I was getting into with this one.  However, the above movies are still made watchable by decent actors.

I'm sure Gussy Boy wants to get actors whom no one has ever heard of nor will ever hear of again to make the movie seem "real."  Problem is, they can't act.  I'm going to guess that's the point - let's have D-list actors have "real" dialogue with each other so that it seems "real."  However, it just gets annoying.  Van Sant spends so much time with the camera focusing on one character at a time that I began to wonder if a bout of narcolepsy had overtake him while at the helm.

Maybe I'm not hip enough to understand the idea this movie was trying to present.  Maybe I'm too old (at the ripe age of 26) to understand the artistry and commentary on the life of a 17-year old skater, but man...really, this was painful to watch.  And I've sat through Gone Fishin'.
