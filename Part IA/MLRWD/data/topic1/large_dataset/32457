Unlike the BBC series "Planet Earth", which is a stunning series in itself, "Earth, the Biography" shys away from lifeforms on the planet and looks at the Earth herself; in all its glory and complexity.

While I strongly disagree with one reviewer claiming this is proof we are ALONE in the Universe (C'mon, we can barely see into our own galaxy, let alone the billions of other massive galaxies in the Universe!), there is no doubt that our planet is rare amoung celestial bodies. Requiring all the right components to support complex life; like human beings. To believe the Earth was created by some super being is naive at best. This series proves we weren't here before, and we won't be again some day in the future...but Earth will still go on. Ian says, "forget save the Earth, she will survive, how about save the human race!"

Beautiful to watch, deeply interesting and thought provoking, and slightly frightening with it's dire warnings of global warming, I highly recommend this series to all who love our planet.
