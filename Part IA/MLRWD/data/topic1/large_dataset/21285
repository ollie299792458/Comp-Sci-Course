This is a case where the trailer didn't do the movie justice. I went to the theater expecting a real downer of a romance/violent road movie. What I ended up seeing was a very funny, very entertaining romance/violent road moveie. Brad Pitt is delightful as the bumbling, reluctant hero who just wnats to make his girlfriend happy. Julia Roberts, said girlfriend, leaves him after he goes of on a search for a valuable gun the mexican. What follows is separate road trips that eventually bring them together. Roberts is quite charming and vaguely annoying. Classic Julia, in her type of role. However, the real star here is James Gandolfini ("The Sopranos") as the sensitive hitman with a secet who kidnaps and then befriends Roberts. He's charming and adds a lot the the movie's humor. Overall, it's very violent and filled with bad language, and it deserves its R rating, but you'll laugh more than you'll cry. Some very nice plot twists give Pitt (who's lookin'good, by the way) a chance to show his comedic skills as a actor. A few slight flaws, but I'd still reccomend it.
