I was hesitant about watching this movie because of the bad reviews. I am so glad I watched this movie anyway. What a touching funny movie. I adore "Momma Mia."
Meryl Streep was a goddess. All the actors and actresses were right on. My aunt and I are still singing some of the songs from the movie. You have to watch this movie at least 3 times to get the full affect. The scenery was to die for.
Pierce Brosnan was gorgeous. Some of my favorite parts were when when Donna was painting her daughter's toes before the wedding.Plus, the song "When all is said and Done" was purely for the teary eyed person to relish.This was a funny, sweet, tear jerker movie.
 A must see for anyone loving movies with heart.
I know I will be watching it again and again.
Now, if I could sing these songs without breaking the windows....
 we would really be talking!!
Plus, the ending where they wore those gaudy costumes ,was hysterical!
It looked like everyone in the movie was enjoying themselves. They looked so happy and carefree. That's a good kind of movie to be in. A movie where everyone looked so happy just to be there. It showed in their faces and their performances.
