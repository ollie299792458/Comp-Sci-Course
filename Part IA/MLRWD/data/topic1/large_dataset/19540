David Schwimmer (yes, "Ross" from friends") makes his directorial debut with this film and doesn't do a bad job (note to Mr. Schwimmer - stay on that side of the camera). Simple story : Boy leaves pregnant girlfriend at the altar. Several years later, boy realizes what he was missing, but girlfriend has new boyfriend who is about to run a marathon. Boy decides the only way to get her back is to run against the new boyfriend...etc etc.

It's more detailed than that, but you get the gist. Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) plays the deadbeat Dennis Doyle to perfection. He's just go that "every man" look about him which suits the part. Hank Azaria (Godzilla, Mystery Men) plays his nemesis very well too.

For someone who has not been back to London in many years, this film felt a little like a trip down memory lane. The films is set all over the city and is diverse in locations and cast members. Doyle is a loser. He's a security guard in a women's underwear store who can't even catch a shoplifter. His decision to run in a Nike challenge (product placement galore) is motivated purely by a desire to get his girlfriend back from her all-American stud boyfriend. The Anglo-American rivalry is set, though it's not transparently obvious in the conflict (ie no one resorts to calling anyone "brit" or "yank"), but it's a clash of lifestyle, culture and egos. The film pokes gentle fun at everyone, from the stereotypical characters to the over-the-top media coverage of the marathon's dramatic climax.

The ending is perfect, and I was surprised that the tension towards the end really worked well. I think Schwimmer has a promising directorial career ahead. The film doesn't have the "silly" humor or the laugh-upon-laugh of "Shaun of the Dead". It's a little more subtle, but just as, if not more satisfying.

Well worth watching.
