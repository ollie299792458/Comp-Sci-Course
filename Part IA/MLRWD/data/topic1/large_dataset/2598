(Note to those who complain about Amazon's price: YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT. Go elsewhere, then.)

This is one of those rare movies I could watch over and over again, and/or rewind a scene to watch it a couple of times more. That especially applies to the montage of frenzied traders, where Stone makes a brief cameo. There are many visual subtleties, from camera perspectives to item inclusion, that a less talented filmmaker would happen on only by luck. It's a shame the theatrical version cut out the extras on the 20th anniversary DVD; not a frame was wasted. Well, I take that back: the obligatory bed scene with Bud and Darien. I don't say that because I'm a prude, but because it didn't add anything to the story.

It's nothing new to say that Michael Douglas gave the performance of a lifetime -- perhaps anyone's lifetime. Martin and Charlie Sheen, the latter noticeably less muscled than later years, also gave strong performances that were Oscar-worthy. Also of note is Hal Holbrook, who I wish had more lines. However, it fits with the story: if his character had had more time with Bud before the latter got in too deep, Bud wouldn't have needed the shocks of the liquidation meeting and his father's heart attack.

Simply a masterpiece of a movie.
