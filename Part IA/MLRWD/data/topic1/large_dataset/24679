BODY DOUBLE really is a brilliant thriller.  Sure, it does have the same concept as REAR WINDOW, but it has a completely different and ingenious plot that relies on a few lapses in logic to keep rolling along, but stays enthralling throughout.  Melanie Griffith as a porno actress(she seemed to be either a porno star, a prostitute or stripper in all of her early roles) is excellent and adds a lot of humour.  What violence there is(and there isn't much) isn't too graphic, although the weapon used for the killing may not be to everyones taste.  I can understand why people don't like this movie as there certainly are some moments of stupidity, two incidents with a dog, and a scene where Wasson sees the killer attacking a women in a van, tries to alert a policeman to the situation and gets one of the most ridiculous responses you'll ever see(I must admit that this part is very poor), plus the ending is a bit stock standard compared to rest of the film, but then again how many movies do have truly great endings?, not many.  Anyway, make sure you see it, don't over analyse it too much and just soak up the atmosphere.
The start is almost exactly the same as BLOW OUT although I think it is done better in BLOW OUT.
