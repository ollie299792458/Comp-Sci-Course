I am an overweight 21 year old female who has been a bit bigger all my life. I have tried numerous and I mean numerous things to get the weight off. My husband and I did the Richard Simmons Blast and Tone set and all I wanted to do after was cry. I was seeing no results and was feeling worse about myself than ever. I reached my all time high weight and finally I decided to do something about it again. I found Walk Away the Pounds with Leslie Sansone and thought to myself, " Well, it can't be any worse than the others." I saw all the smaller people on the video and figured.. " It's exactly like the others!" But I gave it a shot anyway!

Let me tell you, I am absolutely amazed! I enjoy working out and I even feel like doing it over and over again! I have started doing the tape 2 times a day. I am not yet to the 2 mile walk, but I know with time and lots of fun I will get there. I can't wait to make my additional purchase of her three mile walk. I am finally glad to see a video that not only " Smaller" people can participate in!
