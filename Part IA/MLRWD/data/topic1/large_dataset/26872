This is an amazing first season. The action is on the perfect level, the suspense is just right, and the whole season will have you begging for season two! Alias is about a spy who tells her fiance, Danny, about what she really does. Danny is murdered by SD-6, the branch of the CIA Sydney Bristow works for. She soon discovers that SD-6 is not apart of the CIA. She teams up with the real CIA to destroy SD-6 from the inside, as Syd is now a double agent. Soon, Arvin Sloane, the head of SD-6 discovers secrets about Milo Rambaldi, an ancient prophet. Rambaldi has many artifacts of great power. Sloane becomes obsessed with Rambaldi and his secret works. Rambaldi is surrounded in mystery. Sydney and Dixon go on many missions to discover more about Rambaldi. But, Rambaldi is not the only thing in this season. SD-6 sells weapons to terroist groups. So, the main theme of Alias is to hand the weapons to the CIA instead of the villians. But, the Rambaldi storyline is always in the background of the series. Alias is filled with double crosses, cliffhangers, outrageous outfits and exotic locales. Alias is the perfect blend of mystery, action, adventure, and sci-fi all rolled into one incredible series!
