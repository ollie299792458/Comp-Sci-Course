A good movie.  Not perfect but nothing is.  The shots at the end that explain how the cousin died should have been left out.  I think what happened to the cousin was obvious as soon as he was introduced without this intrusion.  Maybe they were left in to show the character fully acknowledging everything that happened to herself; she was moving on?  The large painting could serve a similar purpose, if that's the case, in addition to it's more obvious interpretation - Jiney's discovery of beauty in life.

  There are a few off moments I won't bother pointing out so four, instead of five, stars.  (I've never given anything 5.)

  In my opinion - I didn't write the story, so I won't put my view forth as the absolute truth - the main character is not a lesbian.  She simply understands her gay friend's interest - been there - and promises not to see anyone else out of respect for her friend's feelings - haven't gone that far -; she doesn't want to hurt her friend.  She says she won't see anyone else; she does not say she returns her friend's romantic love.
  The scene that suggest the two main characters spent the night in the same bed looks innocent.  It looks like a sleep over.  Mutual comfort after a traumatic day.  There's nothing that suggest the two characters just made love.  The conversation that follows the scene is about the events of the previous day.  If something happened during the night, wouldn't it be mentioned?  Anyway, the lesbian aspects of the story are just a support to the film's themes.  It's lovely, the ideas surrounding it and added to by it.  That's all I'll bother to say about it in an Amazon review.
  Finally, to those who complain that there are no lesbian love scenes in the film, grow up and read the credits.  The two actresses are blood relatives; Race WONG and Rosanne WONG.  Did you think they were going to make out?  Seriously?
