It is hard to find DVDs treated with such reverence by their makers.
The quality of the transfer, color saturation, and the extras are all some of the best seen in release. 
Add to that, one of the better bits of story-telling in many years. 
Hard to believe this was only the Coen Brother's second outing in film, just after the auspicious debut, "Blood Simple".
For those who didn't pick up on their work until the success of "Raising Arizona", it is very much worth going back & picking up this DVD. It's recreation of the 1920s, and the dissection of gangland rivalries, is exceptional.
Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, John Tuturro, Marcia Gay Harden are all exceptional. But there are many more actors in smaller but pivital rolls who will also catch your eye. 
And in the annals of cinema, the sequence where Albert Finney's character has a shoot-out with opposing gang hit-men, will be studied for years. Terrific storytelling, with nary a word spoken. It ranks up there with the opening scene of "Touch of Evil".
For those of you who love great moviemaking, this is for you.
