Providers seem to be getting the hint from the high sales of the Eva and Gasarki boxsets, so they've finally released the complete series of Nadesico. The plot we won't repeat, we're sure any fan site or other review will tell you more than you want to know - our advice is to buy without reading up on it.
The case itself is a bit of an enigma. Not just a box containing all of the dvds, this case composed of 3 double & 2 single cases moulded together. This makes a positive difference in terms of weight, space-saving and removes the worry that they'll fall out, but you do lose all that nice case art from the seperate dvds.
Without a doubt though, this is great deal taking the price into account. The quality is crisp and infinitely superior to vhs in terms of sound and picture. The one thing that we got annoyed over was Ruri's comment at the end of episode 26 "some of those questions will be answered in the inevitable sequel." But there is no sequel - just the Movie 'Prince of Darkness', which like most anime movies, only provides further questions.
