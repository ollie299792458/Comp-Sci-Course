I saw this series once, when it ran on Masterpiece Theatre in the late 1980s.  I've never forgotten it.  That's how good it is.
The PBS station in the Washington, D.C. area is, happily, re-running the series right now (WETA, Sunday evenings at 8).  Watch it if you can.  If not, you know where you can buy it.
This is a study of a group of young men -- well, okay, most of the actors aren't as young as they should be for historical accuracy -- and how they respond to risk, and loss, and each others' personalities.  The pace is stately.  Though the aerial combat scenes are genuinely thrilling, there are long, long stretches with no action at all.  The series is all about dialogue and expressions.
Two performances stand out for me.  Boyd Gaines is sensational as the American pilot in this very British squadron.  He comes across as both dashing and touching, a man carrying on despite terrible stress.  Neil Dudgeon also excels at the tougher assignment of playing "Moggy" Cattermole, the squadron jerk...mostly.  (That's one of the pleasures of this series.  No one is entirely sympathetic or entirely unsympathetic.)
