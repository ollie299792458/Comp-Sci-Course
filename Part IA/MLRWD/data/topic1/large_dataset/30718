This midnight movie staple is a great example of (dirty) skit comedy.  Another in the great line of quotable movies, there are some skits that are extraoridinarily funny.  The "Fist Full of Yen" is so good you  will find that you will want to build a Martial Arts Army of Extra-Ordinary  Magnitude.  
Some of the humor is not for everybody, as it is very  sexually explicit.  There is a great deal of nudity, so it is definitely  not appropriate for the kiddies.  But if you find early Saturday Night Live  or Monty Python funny, you will definitely get a kick out of this picture.  You will certainly never see the Evening News the same again.  There are  parts of this movie that do not hold up to time and some of the humor falls  flat, but most of the skits are timeless and the slow parts are few and far  between.  Plus, the 70's wardrobe and music are funny, in and of itself.  
People from Big Jim Slade the former tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs  to all the Catholic High School Girls in Trouble recommend this movie, and  so do I.  It is very funny.
