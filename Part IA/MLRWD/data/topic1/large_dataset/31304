Many people will see call "The Postman" the worst movie in some time, but lets be fair.  The movie is ill-conceived, pretentious as hell, and makes me feel less inspired than when I saw Navy SEALs. Costner's directorial effort shows promise in a certain  perspective but wriths in a contrived and artificial characters with dialogue inspiried by a Middle School play. Costner plays the unamed protaganist as a aimless wanderer who survives by performing shakesperian workd for townsfolk too damn ignorant to figure how badly recited it all is.  Will Patton plays a fascist demgogue bent on controlling what little is left of the modern USA. 
Through details to mindless to uninspired to tell costner ends up as the Postman, a symbol of freedom and stability long lost since the advent of apathy and superstition. Some praise must be said to visual look of the film, the sweeping foregrounds and diverse landscapes keep us somewhat interested, and at clocking just over 3 hours does manage to convey an epic feel.  See this if you like flops and disasters, next time you see your postman you will likely hold him as a saviour figure if this movie interseted you.
