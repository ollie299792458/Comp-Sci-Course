Sorry, this came on satellite one night and my girlfriend said she had wanted to see it. She knew that I don't like Reese Witherspoon in general, but I was intertested in the story. Well the problem was that Reese Witherspoon was just not believable, and every time she appeared on the screen it was tough not to change the program. To the film's credit it is beautifully filmed but there is just nothing to grab a hold of. The only merits I gave it were the sub-plot involving Amelia and her apparently rotten husband. Whenever those actors took over the story it was actually engaging. Merit goes to the scene when the father breaks down in anguish over the grave of his rotten son, whom he had disowned, who has fallen in battle. But then it's back to the Reese Witherspoon show and tedium with her poor attempt at a British accent and very narrow acting range. After a while the performance seems hung on her sideways mischevious smile, though nothing she does or says backs it up. Nice try. The storytelling is also not good, and sections jump from premise to conclusion without so much as one pause for pathos. With some plot developments, if you blink, you miss it. Way too long at 140 minutes, but such a story needs a long telling...perhaps a series on BBC could do it justice...The end result of this film treatment is a mindless story with the parts clunked together.
