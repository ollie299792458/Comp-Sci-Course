Even with all those books, websites and television series about Henry VIII, it is still hard to gauge his true character and his motives. Historians differ...Even the British, I understand.  About twenty years ago there was an Anna Bolena performance in la Monnaie, Brussels.  The performance was sponsored by a large international organization, and its chairman praised it during supper afterwards.  This chairman, being British, said he enjoyed the opera, but then he hesitated, realizing all this had happened in his "beloved" country...
I have seen the television series, I have read some books.  I guess that this magnificent video expresses everything that can be expressed about the history of Anna Bolena.
All characters are very meticulously casted.  They perfectly fit the images I made based on books, historical articles and television.  I do recognize the main characters, Anna, Jane, the King, Percy...  They are what I imagined they should be.  With all their emotions, with all their motives, with all their personality.  This is not only magnificent belcanto, but also magnificent drama and tragedy.
The music is outstanding, all performers sing outstandingly, the choir and orchestra are outstanding, the production is outstanding.  And it all fits together.  Go and buy this dvd!
