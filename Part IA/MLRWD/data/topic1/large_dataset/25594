I finally got to watch 'Marebito'.  It's definitely shot on low budget video format; but, that format adds to the creepiness / the uneasy gut feeling of everything that the filmmaker /

  director caught on film

  - It seems real in it's grittiness -

 I really want to believe that there is an underworld in Tokeyo

  Germany / New York City

  - Beneath civilization -

that's mind separated from the normal that everyone lives in

  -I found myself very creeped out by this film-

  I couldn't go to sleep

without looking under the bed / locking the door seven times

  - still couldn't sleep -

  wondering if the devros had found it's ways

  through windows / broken doors

  what would I do to know fear

  be devoured

  by

  end of life love

  Takashi Shimizu's 'Marebito'

  is

  a horrifying glimpse into that Seanced Reality
