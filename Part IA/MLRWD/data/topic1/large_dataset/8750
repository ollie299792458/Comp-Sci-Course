This is a film about the struggles that African Americans faced to get their musical voices heard. It takes music back to where it all began. The origin of R&B and Rock and Roll. But like the historical music and triumph it also portrays the dark side of the industry in it's early stages. The stand out actor in the film, in my opinion, would be Columbus Short playing Little Walter. He owned his part and made you feel all of his emotion. But the one thing the film lacks is a long enough history line of the dark lives of the charatcers that were portrayed. The dialog quickly skimmed through the lives of these characters. Actors like Mos Def (who played Chuck Berry) did not have much of an appearance and they're is so much more of Miss Etta James' life (beautifully played by Beyonce) that was not shown. The movie had five stories in one and not enough time to tell them all. The actors and actresses did great performances. And a big kudos to Miss Knowles (Mrs. Carter) for her improved acting skills. But sadly she sang more then she acted. If the movie lacks at all it would definitely be due to the lack of script, not in performance.The film had more "f" words in it then storyline.  All in all it's a good movie. But sad and depressing.
