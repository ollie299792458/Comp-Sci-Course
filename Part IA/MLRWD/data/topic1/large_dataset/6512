Ok, so most people are comparing this movie to the Hangover. It's not anywhere close to the Hangover. Sure, I can see the comparison (Happens before a wedding, they go to Los Vegas, ect.) But this movie is so much more than the Hangover I and II. There's emotion, comedy, laugh-out-loud throw up scenes, and most of all it's so realistic! Like they don't pick someone like Megan Fox or Eva Mendes. They pick people who A.) Are up and coming stars and B.) People can actually relate to!
My Mom and I saw this together and the first 5-10 minutes was so awkward! But, rest assured , after those first 3 or 4 scenes, the movie starts to lighten up on the sexuality and actually cracks jokes that are hilarious without relying on sex!
Kristen Wiig has to be one of the funniest women on the planet! Closely followed by Melissa McCarthy! But, this movie is so greatly casted, so greatly acted, and so Laugh-out-loud hilarious! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to cry from laughing so hard! Or someone who is looking for a movie that will put the Hangover to shame!
