I love this show.  I really, really do.  I've seen every episode countless times and I like my Monday nights uninterrupted so that I don't miss a moment.  But this season set is kinda crummy.  Sure, it has a lot of commentary, but things are missing here.

First of all, full screen instead of wide screen?  Major flaw.  I saw the episodes in widescreen format originally, so I'm not used to this full screen presentation.  There's no reason I can see why this set is not in widescreen.

Secondly, and I'm sure it has to do with money and copyrights, but a TON of music in the season is changed.  Nada Surf's "Inside of Love" from "The Slutty Pumpkin"?  Yeah, gone.  And that song fit the ending for the episode so perfectly.  The song in its place doesn't do the moment justice.  Additionally, Chumbawamba's "Tubthumper" is eliminated from the scene where the group eats in Lily's apartment/Chinese restaurant.  Sure, the Belle and Sebastian song and others that were written into the script are there, but it seems like everything else is changed.  CBS: If you're going to put a song in an episode for when it airs and don't plan on getting the rights to it for the DVD, don't put it in at all!  I still have a couple of episodes left to watch from the set, and I sure hope that the song at the end of the finale isn't gone...
