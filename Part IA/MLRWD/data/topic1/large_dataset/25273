Man! What an important film this is. Many movies attempt to capture, distill, un-distill, then saut&eacute; one's emotions, but fail. Now let me tell you, Predator 2 is one movie where they aren't afraid to poor on the drama, and they do it with five-gallon pitchers. The "Predator" long misunderstood as a frightening, evil, and bloodthirsty ... um ... um ... predator, is in fact shown in this film to really be a poor mixed up kid in the hell bound world of 1997 LA. Many will say that the Predator's tendency to kill, skin, and hang from scaffolds innocent people is extreme and sinister. I'm sure that we've all engaged in a little tom-foolery ourselves from time to time, and if he were on his planet following his own ancient and beautiful customs, that's all anyone there would make of it, tom-foolery. Furthermore, detractors might say that the Predator's cloaking ability is both unfair and dastardly, but it is in fact representative how frightened he is of life in general and his unwillingness to confront his problems, like puberty, head on. All in all, the Predator is just like you and me. God I love oysters.
