I met some of the cast while on a retreat with my fiance at the Udaya retreat center in Malibu, CA in June of 2011. While there they mentioned the 108 days and The Ultimate Yogi program they were working on. December my fiance found they were releasing the DVD series so we had to get it. I am so grateful for having the oportunity to try this series. So much thought went into making this set and for someone who infrequently did yoga but was introduced to it due to my fiance being an instructor, this set has definitely made yoga a greater part of my life. While on the program I not only got stronger and increased flexibility, but I also lost 36 pounds, feel 100 times better, and look great. I love the Yin, Hardcore, and Cross Train discs the most, however they are all great. The most difficult for me was the Balance series, but you get better as you progress. All in all, I highly recommend this set to anyone wanting to get fit and in tune within themselves. If you are not familiar with yoga it may be quite a challenge.
