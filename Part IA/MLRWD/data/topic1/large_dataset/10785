When I first saw the previews, I didn't expect much out of this movie.  It seemed too much like a comedy than a intriguing mystery from Sherlock Holmes, but contrary to my preceptions, this movie was surprisingly good!

Downey Jr. does an excellent job at playing Holmes- a rugged intelligence, witty comments, and good acting make for a good character.  I think the character development is one of the best parts in the movie.  Watson (Jude Law) also does a good job at being the reluctant sidekick who tries to be the voice of reason before engaging in investigations.

The story is good and makes you replay the events in the movie (and does a good job of allowing you to attempt to put the pieces together and figure out the mystery).  The movie flows pretty quickly which can be annoying for some and then the film will cut back to reveal how an event took place from a different prespective, but makes for solid explanations.

Recommended for anyone and at the price Amazon sells it for, its even better!
