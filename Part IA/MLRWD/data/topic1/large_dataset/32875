This movie, an all-time classic film noir effort by Billy Wilder, is now available on DVD after such a long wait, and it was worth it.

The special features are just terrific.  Wilder fans get to see an extended interview with him, excerpts from his AFI meetings, and more.  Kirk Douglas fans get to see an interview with him where he discloses the care for his craft and his commitment to honest portrayal, regardless of the degree of sympathy his characters (as written) might stir up.

This 1951 movie failed in the United States because postwar America was not ready for the unsparing, unsympathetic view Wilder and Douglas take to the story.  It's almost too honest to bear.  But if you accept that premise, you are treated to exceptional acting and directing in a beautifully restored film with great historical significance.

Wilder saw the future and put it on the screen for us.  We're now living in the media world he knew, fifty years ago, was materializing for us.

And we created and continue to nurture it.
