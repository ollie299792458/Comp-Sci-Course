The story itself is absolutely brilliant. This movie is definitely not the first to ponder the idea of "a real life in an fake world", but "The Truman Show" somehow seems refreshingly different from other films using variations this theme. 
I'm not sure what makes "The Truman Show" so unique. Perhaps its the fact that the "Big Brother" of the film is an ordinary flesh-and-blood TV director rather then some powerful futuristic technology (as in "Matrix") or some mysterious supernatural force (as in the "Twilight Zone"). Whether for this reason or another, the story clicks in as a masterpiece.
Based on the storyline alone, this could have been the movie of the year, or even the movie of the decade. Unfortunately, nearly all other aspects of the film are nowhere that good. 
Starting with the script. The details of the script of the movie sometimes spoil good points in the story. A good example of this is the very end of the film. The idea for the story's end is excellent, but it looks rather disappointing on film. 
As for the acting, it isn't that bad. But it isn't that good either. The guy playing the TV Director Christof is excellent and Jim Carrey is pretty good as Truman, but overall the acting simply isn't that impressive.
Other tidbits prove that the producers didn't think too much about making the film consistent. For example, it says that Truman is "10913 days on the air, and he was born in front of a live audience" when it supposed to be near his 30th birthday. This is more than a month off. Just how hard is it to multiply 30 by 365 (or 365 1/4 if you are really picky) and get the right number? It may be unimportant to the plot, but such errors point to the lack of seriousness on the producer's part.
To sum things up:
I give the film 6 stars (that's no typo) for the storyline, and 2 stars for the preformence. Overall, a 4-star movie.
