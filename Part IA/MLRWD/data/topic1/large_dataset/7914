Don't make the sam mistake I did by purchasing this edition, you'll be get ripped off.

It says that it is a "widescreen edition" and the original ratio of the film is actually 1.85, so until here it looks great. Before I had the 4/3 edition (1.33) wich sucks, so I was very happy to buy this "widescreen" edition... until I actually got it and sarted to watch it:

They just cropped off a 16/9 image from the 4/3 edition wich was already cropped off from the original 1.85!!!!!

I've never seen anything like that!!! So all the framings are weird and you're better off with the full screen edition wich you can transform in the widescreen edition the way thay did it anytime you want by putting the "letterbox" mode on your remote control. (I finally stopped the film and finished it with my old edition).

It's such a great movie, I can't beleive they were just too lazy to take the original frame to make the widescreen edition; They just thought people would be too stupid to realise they're missing more than half the image!!!
