Barbie movies are a great alternative to Disney movies.  The Disney movies have way too much drama and are scary.  But, the Barbie movies are very well crafted and only have mild bad guys that aren't scary - they are needed to tell the story of right and wrong.

The songs are well done.  The graphics are great and colorful.  Quality is excellent.  There isn't the depth of a complex cartoon like Star Wars or Pocahontis but the audience is 2-8 year olds and we don't need box office numbers or drama for success.  They are perfect the way they are.

My daughter's favorite movies of the series include the Mariposa one and a couple others.  And, for my 6 and 8 year old nieces, I sent this one as their first introduction to the Barbie movies.  They LOVE it.  I will send Mermaidia as second.  There's only one of the Barbie movies - Pegasus - that I don't love because of one repeatable line the girl says and I don't want her to repeat it later "you ruined my life!" The whole movie is great except that one line and I haven't seen that kind of writing in the other movies.  It was unnecessary.  Anyway...

It has been watched 100x by my kids.  She plus her two 6 year old brothers always watch it without complaints.  Great for us on our iTouch for the airplane; on tiny and large tvs at home; in the car.  I'm a fan.
