If you love movies, you will love "Midnight in Paris."  The script is intelligent, wise, and, of course, very witty.  Owen Wilson is perfect; funny and likeable.  The cinematography is Oscar worthy.  Mr. Allen is in love with Paris, just as he is love with New York, and "Midnight in Paris" is as beautiful as it is wise and funny.  The central theme of the movie is the human nostalgia for a Golden Age.  Even though this longing is doomed because no Golden Age exists, the ideal elevates the longing for a Golden Age beyond mere nostalgia into a dream that makes everyday reality more beautiful and meaningful.  For me, the romantic longing to live in the same Paris with Hemingway and Fitzgerald, two tragic and brilliant figures, permits me to understand, as most viewers will understand, the powerful desire to visit this Golden Age of creativity and beauty.  Like his other poem of love, "Manhattan," Mr. Allen's "Midnight in Paris" perfectly captures the beauty and romance of a magical city that is more than a city:  it is the realization of our longing for perfection, which, sadly, we will never achieve.  But the striving for the ideal, while doomed to fail, is beautiful and inspiring.  "Midnight in Paris" is a movie for lovers and especially for those who love movies and the dreams they inspire.
