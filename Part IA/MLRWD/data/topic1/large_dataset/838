Despite the unevenness due to truncated editing, this is one of the best historical epics on the era of the Crusades that I have seen, including even the Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven that cost three times the $$$.

Most recent historical epics put a modern anti-religious spin on the Middle Ages, but anyone who has actually studied the period knows that religion permeated European culture. This is the first film of the period I have seen that depicts children being placed in monasteries to be raised by monks, women being placed in convents as penance for sins or because of family poverty, and in this case, a son sent to join the Knights Templar in the Holy Land to alleviate a potential clan conflict.

These were common historical realities of life in the Middle Ages that I have read about in the history books, but rarely seen depicted in film accounts of the period. In this film, religious devotion is assumed and shown rather then discussed in the dialogue. There are numerous scenes of Arn praying while clutching the ivory cross his beloved gave him, or praying while staring at the cross on his sword pommel. The Templars all kneel together in prayer before an important battle.

The film has a lot of small historical touches, such as the sophisticated medical care Arn receives from his Muslim captors who carefully stitch a huge gash on his face after the battle of Hattin. This is Muslim return hospitality for Arn having saved the life of Saladin earlier in the movie. These touches add to the historical realism of the film.
