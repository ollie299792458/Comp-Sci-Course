I saw this movie for the first time this Christmas season.  We rented it from Blockbuster, and I watched it a few times already.  I am thinking I will have to buy it.  I won't give you a summary since others already have, but here are my thoughts on the movie:

Bing Crosby's voice alone is enough to make me watch this movie.  In the beginning of the film, he sings White Christmas in front of all the men in the army.  When he sings many of the men look down and get tears in their eyes.  Although it was probably done as an effect for the movie, his performance is moving enough to make you get teary-eyed without having to act.  All four of the main characters' voices blend together really well, especially in "Snow."

This is one musical where you actually love the musical interludes - because that means dancing! Vera-Ellen has to be the most physically fit person that has ever existed.  I couldn't imagine doing the dancing that she does for 2 solid minutes without falling over!  All the dancing is fun to watch and covers a wide spectrum of styles.  You get soft-shoe, tap, ballroom, show, and even modern!

I love all the fun characters that pull the movie along in their mischievousness - the guilt-tripping friend, the plotting sister, the snoopy housekeeper.  And of course the actors and actresses themselves are what drive the movie.  Bing Crosby is feeling and charming, Danny Kaye is dramatic and fun, Rosemary Clooney is serious yet passionate, and Vera-Ellen is light-hearted and oh so talented!  On top of the incredible casting, it's amazing that a movie with that much wonderful singing and dancing could also have a heart-warming and fun plot.  The movie is a bit on the cheesy side, but that only makes it more fun.  You often find yourself saying, "Oh bother!  Here we go again!"  Besides, what's a Christmas movie without a bit of cheese?

I highly recommend this movie and hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
