Look I know this doesn't compare to Lion King in the very least with as much drama, and as many Lions. However this film is meant to just be laugh out loud funny, and that it was. I literally find myself ROLLING whenever I watch it. So, it's set around the same time as the beginning of Lion King, but you are following Timon and Pumbaa's story instead. It's just ridiculous. Timon you realize is just a man looking for something more in his life. And he meets his Warthog compadre and they go through so much together. There's a lot of gags in this that explain more of what happened in the first movie. Little subtle things you would have never known had happened. Like... did you know Timon and Pumbaa actually tripped Simba and Nala down the hill during their love scene? But they did! Along the way the two are in the background like they are watching a home movie, and even pause it at one point which is another gag that cracks me up to no end. Really, I don't see why anyone hated this one. So fun, energetic and just zany.
