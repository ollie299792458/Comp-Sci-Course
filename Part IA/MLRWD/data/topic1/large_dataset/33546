As a highly acclaimed bathroom mirror dancer myself, I bought this movie for the great dance sequences.  The plot, acting, script is a  waste of time,except for comedic value.  I would have preferred to see 90 minutes of straight dance competitions, its too bad they think they have to wrap it in a pitiful script with ridiculous characters and truly embarrassingly bad dialogue.  I mean they killed a nice little kid off just to get the friends to make up!

 but... if you love watching good dancing, it is very worth it to FF to the big dance scenes.  Those are something you will watch over and over especially if your trying to pick up some moves.

Best line goes to granny....

Grandma: "Are you having sex?"

Grandson: "Aww Granny..."

Grandma: "I diapered it so I can ask about it!"

and lots more like that...

 PS the dancing in this movie is 1000000 times better than anything in that movie "honey" with jessica alba which I went to for the same purpose and was very disappointed.  At least this movie knew which side its bread was buttered on and gave lots of the good stuff.
