I have been a Shogun Assassin fan since 1980 when the film came out, and a fan of the "Baby Cart Series" when the film was playing in independent movie houses in Boston-Cambridge. So I will start of by saying that I have only good things to say about the Lone Wolf and Cub Series.

However, the blu-ray 5-film Collector's Set falls short. It falls short when comparing it to the six-disk DVD version, which in my view is one of the best transfers to DVD I have seen.

The problem with the 5-film set is that it is dubbed. You MUST listen to it in English. The 1980 Shogun Assassin did a great job of translating the film into English, but the problem with this series is the other films are done in the painful English translation parodied in the deleted scenes from Kill Bill.

I bought the 5-film series thinking I'd get something like the six-film series in DVD, plus the 1980 Shogun Assassin, the latter which I already have on blu-ray as a single. I open the set, so I am not going to return it. It's done. The other dubbed films, which I could not bring myself to finish watch, are contained on one disk.

If the Baby Cart series was available in blu-ray with the option to have Japanese with subtitles, or a dubbed version to choose from the menu, it would have been fine.

For now, if you are one of those purists who like the Japanese versions with English subtitles to help, I would steer you to the DVD version. If that is not important and a dubbed English version is what you want, the films stand up well enough in the transfer.
