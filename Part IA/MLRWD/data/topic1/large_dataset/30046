I saw this movie, "National Lampoon's Van Wilder" the Spring semester of my Senior year in college.  I can't think of a more perfect, funny movie to celebrate my graduation with.  The movie was absolutely hilarious, it had original jokes, great talent and beautiful women (I LOVE YOU TARA REID!!)  The guy who played Van, Ryan Reynolds, has great comic timing and was extremely funny playing the lead role.  I also thought his assistant Taj, stole the show on numerous occasions.  My favorite scene is the one where Taj interviews for the job as Van's assistant.  The supporting cast in this movie was genious also (the principal from breakfast club, the guy who played Booger on Revenge of the Nerds, the guy who played the Sherminator in the American Pie movies).  There was many original jokes in the movie also (ie. Van throws a party in the Hillel :-)
The unrated edition should be absolutely nuts and this is the number one DVD i want to own.  Any fan of comedy and/or college comedies in particular should buy this DVD as soon as it comes out.  You won't be sorry.
