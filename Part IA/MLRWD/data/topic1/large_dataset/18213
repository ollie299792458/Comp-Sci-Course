Sophie Traub is always worth watching, but this movie is almost an exception to that rule. If you want a movie which makes sense, this is not the one for you. Basically, Eric is a serial killer who is let out of prison (WHAT?) and is then harassed by a cop halfheartedly played by an obviously jaded Russell Crowe. A pretty girl stows away in his car (???) even though she knows he is a killer (!) and they sort of meander around together. Crowe's character stalks them but can do nothing, despite the fact the girl is underaged (WHAT?) We expect Eric to kill her, but she kills herself instead (WHAT?) and Eric, who turns out to be a serial killer with a heart of gold (!) tries to save her. He is all torn up over her death, and somehow (we do not see how) ends up in jail for being associated with her demise. Crowe's character knows Eric is innocent (???) but uses this as an excuse to put him back in the can anyway. The movie finally ends without much of anything having happened and you wonder why you watched it.

No, I did not give it away. To do that there would have to be a story. If you like this movie, check out Ed Wood's Plan Nine From Outer Space. It is not any worse IMO.
