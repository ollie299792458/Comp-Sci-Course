First off, let me make it clear this movie may not appeal to everyone.
It's the cinematic equivalent of Frank Miller's recent comic work: incredible visuals with ridiculous, over-the-top dialogue.
Likewise, if you try to take this film seriously then you may not gain much gratification.
However if you view The Spirit with an open mind as you would while watching the Adam West Batman show or reading Frank Miller and Jim Lee's All-Star Batman and Robin, then you're sure to have a much more enjoyable time with this irreverent pop culture parody.
At several points in this film you just have to laugh out loud at the absurdity.
Just don't go in expecting Sin City or The Dark Knight.
The Spirit is on the other end of the artistic spectrum, demented post-modern camp/kitsch exploitation.

Even though Miller updated The Spirit with his own visual trademarks and sense of humor, in many ways it's very faithful to Will Eisner's comic.
I must emphasize the term "comic" since that is exactly what Will Eisner's creation was, a comic book with a humorous, comedic core.
In any sense of the word, The Spirit is a "comic" film through and through.
You get the feeling as if Frank Miller wrote/illustrated a modern Spirit graphic novel and then adapted his work to film panel by panel.
Comic fans will also appreciate many of the subtle (and not so subtle) nods to comic book culture such as "the Elektra complex", which of course references Miller's own legendary run on Daredevil. (which was inspired by Will Eisner's original Sand Saref storyline from The Spirit)

In conclusion, The Spirit is a fun comic book film ideal for Frank Miller fans and comic book fans in general with an offbeat sense of humor.
