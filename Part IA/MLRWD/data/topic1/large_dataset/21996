Even at four years old, I knew this movie would be my favourite for years to come.

A film about a Colonel (Kurt Russell), hardened by the accidental suicide of his son, who accepts an apparently suicidal mission to another planet by use of a 'Doorway to Heaven'. The mission appears simple on paper.

Enter an academically unpopular Egyptologist (James Spader), who translates the coverstone of the gateway, which other scientists had mistranslated. 'Doorway to Heaven' becomes 'Stargate'.

The two, accompanied by a military team, travel through the Stargate to the planet Abydos, and meet the primitive natives (primitive because an evil alien who had taken the persona of Ra had supressed the Abydonian's academic evolution).

An hour and a half, a couple of deaths-then-revivals, a blossoming relationship and a turn-back from suicide later, the foe is defeated and everyone lives happily ever after.

Personally, this movie is well worth the price of purchasing the special edition. Though the DVDs don't have much extras, the small booklet which comes with the set is full of information about the production and history of the Dean Devlin/Roland Emmerich partnership.

This movie rocks!
