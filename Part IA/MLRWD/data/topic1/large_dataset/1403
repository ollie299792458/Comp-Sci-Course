I caught this on British television about 5 years ago, it also incuded a documentary on German director Werner Hertzog, and this being one of his creations, played Fitzcarraldo after the programme.
To be quite honest,  having seen how he directs, he would even make James Cameron wince at the  demands he makes of his cast and crew. Poor Klaus Kinski nearly lost it  during production, and watching the film it's not difficult to see why. The  concept, pulling a boat up a hillside and taking it to a river on the other  side is frankly bizarre. Bear in mind we're not dealing with a canoe or  inflatable boat here either, noooooo that would be TOO easy, try thinking  more along the lines of a mississippi style paddle steamer.
The actual  film is staggering in it's power to make you ask 'what the hell is going  on!' but for some reason is strangely compelling. 
Let's face it we've  all seen the film about the boat hitting the iceberg (hint..Titanic) but  pulling one over a mountaintop (no models or cg helping out here effects  fans) is frankly a bit disturbing.
So, is it worth it? well I guess it's  definitely maked under the category of 'different' but it shouldn't be  classed really...it sort of defies classification! give it a try...you'll  probably be just as exhausted after watching it as the 100 odd natives were  when they lugged the boat to the top of that hill.
