"Sleepless in Seattle" is one of the most heartwarming, inspiring, and romantic movies that I've ever seen.

The movie is about Annie (Meg Ryan), a journalist for the Baltimore Sun, who is engaged to someone whom she's not 100% sure is the one for her. One night, while tuning into a late night radio show, she listens as a young boy confides in the radio show host his father's hurt after losing his wife. Right then and there, she falls in love with "Sleepless in Seattle," and writes him a letter.

Meanwhile, the young boy in Seattle, Jonah, is very sad because his dad, Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) is dating a woman he does not approve of. After the radio show, tons of letters come piling in, and while Sam does not read them, Jonah does. Soon, he finds Annie's letter, and thinks she's perfect. Sam, however, will not give in to Jonah's plea to go to New York and meet Annie on top of the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day-a suggestion Annie put in her letter under the guidance of a friend (played by Rose O'Donnell), inspired by the movie "An Affair to Remember."

My favorite part is when Sam tells the radio station how he is coping with the loss of his wife-"Well, I'm gonna get out of bed every morning, breath in and out all day long. Then, after a while I won't have to remind myself to get out of bed every morning and breath in and out. And, then, after a while, I won't have to think about how I had it great and perfect for a while."

If that doesn't go straight to the heart, I don't know what will. I can definitely see why Annie fell for "Sleepless in Seattle"-it's what every woman wants (even the ones over 40 ;-D).
