There are some DVDs that you are proud to own, and will display proudly in the window. Then, there are the discs that you shove in your sock drawer, to keep from scaring the visitors away. This is one such DVD.
 The  musical itself? Good and funny! While not a cinematic masterpiece, there's  a good deal of fun  in this movie about the misadventures of a group of  guys going to Colorado territory. The songs are strangely addictive, the  scenery is beautiful, and it's just plain fun. The gore is 100% cheesy, and  the picture quality isn't the greatest, but where else will you find a  tribe of Japanese Indians?
 The extras? Even better! The commentary  manages to be both funny and informative, with the various commentators  getting more and more drunk as the movie progresses. The PSA was.. Silly,  to say the least. Seeing the original trailer was interesting (Especially  since the cast shown is not the same as the people in the movie), and the  clips of a school's production of C!TM finishes things off nicely. While  not a techinical masterpiece, this DVD has pleanty of enjoyable extras.
  Okay, so it's not the next Oklahoma. It's just a good way to spend a Sunday  evening.
