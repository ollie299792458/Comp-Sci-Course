Just watched Creepshow on DVD the other night.  This is one of my favorite horror movies.  The stories are great...both funny and scary, with a wonderful cast of familiar faces who all seem to be having a good time with the material.
Although this is one of the DVD's you can pick up very cheap, the picture quality is terrible.  I found the first story to be crystal clear, then suddenly the rest of the movie looked like a VHS quality print.  Blurry and dark overall.  It's a shame really, because this is an awesome horror movie.  Creepshow definitely deserves a remastered print at the very least.  Deleted scenes and some commentary by Romero and/or King would be nice too (Come on, what else is George working on at the moment and Steve is technically retired!).  Bottom line is, who knows when or if we may ever see a SE edition of this great film.  Until then, for the price, it's worth it to have in your collection, but be warned: it's overall quality pales compared to a lot of other DVD's out there.
