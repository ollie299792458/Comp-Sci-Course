I've read some of the negative reviews for this movie, and I will say that if you are sensitive to fairly graphic violence or what ends up being extermely intense and some would say horrific subject matter then this movie may not be your "cup of tea"

However it is mine and this movie is outstanding.  I'm going to try to do this without spoilers.  If I notice any I'll put some warnings in there.  The story is about a man who is kidnapped on his daughter's 3rd birthday and is held captive for 15 years in what appears to be a small studio apartment.  He is never permitted to leave this one room and his only connection with the outside world is a small telivision set.  He is fed the same meal 3 times a day every day.  One day he is drugged and unconscious and wakes up on the roof of a building.  This is where he sets off to find out what happened to him and why.

It all builds and builds and builds to an intense confrontation at the end that has the most shocking, jaw dropping, can't believe what I was seeing/hearing twist endings I have ever seen.  I literally gasped for breath covered my mouth and had to remind myself to both breath and blink again.

Yes throughout the plot there are some pretty silly scenarios like the main character surviving several injuries that in the real world would kill a person without prompt medical attention, or him beating back a whole hoard of armed gangsters with nothing more than a hammer (AWESOME SCENE THOUGH).  The good far outweighs the slight missteps.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodgiguez or any other violent revenge films.  If you don't think you can stomach the violence or subject matter then by all means skip it.  You're missing out though.
