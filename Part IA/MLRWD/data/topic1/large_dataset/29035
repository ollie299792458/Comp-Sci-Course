What if your home were about to be torn down and turned into a golf course?  You are worried that you will never see your friends again.  Wouldn't it be cool if you could find some way to stop it? You decide to look for a treasure.  You look with your friends so that you will all be able to find the gold and stay together.  This is the main plot of "The Goonies"
 "The Goonies" was a great movie.  It had a simply great plot that will blow you away.  There were quite a few funny parts.  There were some amazing obstacles and you didn't know if the boys would get away past them.  The action was incredibly tense.  The climax was very exciting, and the denouement was a good relief.  The screenwriter did a terrific job with the screenplay.  The cast put a lot of effort into their performances.  Overall, we really enjoyed this movie.
 In spite of our enjoyment, there were some flaws with "The Goonies".  We noticed a few small plot holes, but they weren't that bad.  Also, there was inappropriate language, and it just wasn't necessary.  Some of the humor was a little inappropriate, too.  This movie is scary in a bad way because things suddenly jump out at the characters.  We think that children under the age of six should not see "The Goonies".
 We recommend "The Goonies" for kids and adults who like adventure movies. Even though it has flaws, we think it's a great movie.  We hope you enjoy this movie as much as we did.
