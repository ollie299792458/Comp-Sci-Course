In my opinion, I think this is one of the best films that came out related to this type of situation. I was blown away by this film... By the tight screenplay, the professional direction, and the phenomenal acting. It is not a film for children. It is not a film meant to portray ideal role models for children. It is a film meant to realistically depict the lives of people who live at the very bottom of America's socioeconomic ladder. If you find yourself unable to reserve judgment against people born into a life so vastly different than your own, you will probably not like this film. In order to appreciate it, you have to be able to see past the moral and ethical ambiguities of these characters.

So if anyone feels unsure whether they can handle the ugliness of this type of world, but still feels curious enough to see it, take a cue from the Anthropologists... When studying a culture vastly different than your own, make sure to leave the rights and wrongs of your society at home. Because once you impose the moral judgment and ethical standards of your world upon another's, you've sacrificed your objectivity. And by doing so, miss the very point of empathy.

By the way: As for the jerk below me , you obviously don't have a woman to tend to your needs because you surely have a lot off time in your hands to be saying racist remake on this website, you need to preoccupy your dumb A//  instead calling attention to yourself.
