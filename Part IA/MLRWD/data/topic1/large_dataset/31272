"The Paper Chase" is that movie that terrifies future law students with visions of cut-throat competition and horribly stressful conditions.  If you realize it's heavily fiction, you can take if for what it is: a unique movie about high stress and how people react to it.  John Houseman is unforgettable as the notorious Prof. Kingsfield.
On the subject of how this movie represents _actual_ law school:
I am currently a law student at a top-20 law school (2003), I have plenty of friends who attend the other top-20 schools in the nation (including Harvard, portrayed here).  Even when this film debuted in 1973 it was considered a high dramatization to strike fear in the non-law student.  If you're considering law school, watch it realizing that.  The Paper Chase shows the darkest view of law school as much as Legally Blonde makes it out to be silly and fun.  Law School is neither: it's that boring movie no one would ever pay to see.
With that side note, the movie is a fun diversion.  Definitely worth the time to see what all the fuss is about.
