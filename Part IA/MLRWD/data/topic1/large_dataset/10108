This movie is fantastic. 
Well polished storyline impresses us with pyramid of power and terror. Savage islanders (maybe politically incorrect but I never mind) fear him by heart. Mighty dinosaurs (surely scientifically wrong but I never mind) are easily slain by him. He is King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World! Though I don't have particular fondness for stop motion animation, I thought visual effects are great. Essences of VFX for gigantic materials are perspective, points of view and contrast with smaller / nearer objects, and this film is filled with very clever examples of them.
And this movie is cruel.
You see, that huge ape is not responsible for disaster in New York. Totally not. He might be horrible tyrant in Skull Island, but he never hoped to visit Big Apple. All of tragedies of later part were basically done by human arrogance, and nobody in film feels sorry for poor Kong. But this selfish cruelty effected as an unplanned pathos, invited unexpected sympathy of audience and made this movie a forever masterpiece. Never miss.
