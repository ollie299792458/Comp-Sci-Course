Chris Knight throws this question to Dr. Hathaway before getting expelled. For what? For flirting with the head of the CIA's daughter. The hypocrisy is that we later find her in bed with Hathaway ..hmm..
Everytime I watch this film I get distracted by the comedy of it all-like the lines "Compared to you most people have the IQ of a carrot. "We're different than most people, Mitch. Better." or "What do you want?!-(Chris:) World peace, but I don't think this is the time to discuss it."  ....under all that jazz comes a deep rivalry between Chris Knight and Jerry Hathaway. Hathaway resents the party animal Chris has become, because the audience gets the feeling he's never had that kind of fun in his life, and doesn't know how to.
This film is hilarious, smoothly edited/directed, and so  intelligent it's rediculous. Did I mention the soundtrack fits "Real Genius" like a glove?
Watch it and be inspired to appreciate life to its fullest-with humour and a little genius.
