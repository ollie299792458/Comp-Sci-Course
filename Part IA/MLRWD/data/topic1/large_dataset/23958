I am a (...), Mother of two that has been working out religiously for three years.  I go to the gym, lift weights, practice yoga and horseback ride.  I have gotten bored with my current routine and was looking to energize my workouts.  I saw these DVD's and thought I would give them a try.  I am very glad that I bought DVD#1 with DVD#2 as each of them is very different.  DVD#1 is the striptease instruction (with two routines) and DVD#2 is the workout to prepare your body for the routines.  Don't get #2 if you want to striptease because there isn't any in it. What is on the DVD is a great total body workout that is fun and challenging.  I haven't been this sore in my (...) and thighs since I started riding horses!  I haven't gotten the courage to try the routines in DVD#1 yet..but when I have some alone time without the kids I will since they look fun.  One other point, unlike other workout DVD's Carmen and her trainer are not only nice to look out, but limit the chit chat and are not annoyingly upbeat.  They are down to earth and don't waste our time trying to motivate the viewer.  It is definitely a good buy on Amazon and I would recommend getting both DVD's to start.
