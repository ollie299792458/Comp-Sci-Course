This is a BUYER BEWARE statement for the purchasers of the DVD format of ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THEIVES. In the great process of the new DVD format for enjoying films that not only appear clearer and give you extra features  on which to choose, I am puzzled over Warner Brothers choice of doing  something that they have apparently not done on any of their other film  releases on DVD.  In ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES, the film has been split  to be included on BOTH sides of the disc.  This makes absolutely no sense  since it has been clear from the beginning, since DVD was first released,  that you could easily contain over 2 1/2 hours of content on a single side  including the extra features. (This film only runs 144 minutes.) The film  is still enjoyable, but alass, you will be faced with the cumbersome task  of having to turn over your disk in the middle of the film unless you are  equipped with a player that will play both sides automatically. WARNER  BROTHERS should be ashamed of themselves, and replace these disc's with a  single sided format free of charge to everyone who has paid full price for  less quality!
