This is a wonderful adaptation of the Maurice Sendak book, which won the Caldecott medal in 1964.  Spike Jonze and his team have worked extraordinary magic in bringing Sendak's very spare story to the screen as a film running 104 minutes. The conceit is that of Alice in Wonderland and the trick is of course, that Max runs away from home and has all manner of adventures in the land of the Wild Things then sails back (for nearly a year and many weeks besides and a day too,) right back to his bedroom where his meal is waiting for him (and it's still warm!) So Spike Jonze and his cohorts had a huge job to create a full length film from a skeletal story book, but it's all good - the casting of Max Records, who was 11, I think, when the film was made, in the lead role, the creation of the monsters - and their voices,  and the introduction of many underlying philosophical leitmotifs.
Of course it's a movie for adults, and a movie for young children to watch with their parents.  And having watched the movie, adults might like to learn something more of Maurice Sendak the man.
