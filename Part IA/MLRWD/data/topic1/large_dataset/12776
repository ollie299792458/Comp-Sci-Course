The title of this film is "Dead Poets Society". This is story of prepaatory school in East Coast of the U.S.A. This school is very strict and there are 4 traditions. That is "Honour, Dedication, Discipline and Excellence". Main characters are an English teacher, Mr.Keating and the students in his class. All students have each personality and they found their own way through Mr.Keating's class. It is Neil that I was most interested in. Neil has a dream which he want to become an actor, but his father opposite his dream. Neil could not against his ather's opinion so in front of his father, he obeyed his father but he could not give up his dream at any cost. I think this is owe to Mr.Keating. Mr.Keating said "Carpe Diem", it means "Seize The Day" in English so I particulary liked Neil in point of he accomplish his dream. So I think Neil tried to go on playing. Perhaps this film showed us you should find your own way. Especially I like last scene. I was encouraged by this film so I recommend you this film. Please watch this film.
