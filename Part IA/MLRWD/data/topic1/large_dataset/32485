I was initially dragged to this movie by my husband, while actually, I go to his 'comic book flicks' and he goes with me to spy thrillers and dramas (we both like action).  I was very surprised that I liked this movie so much.  It is witty, action packed, with a touch of mystery and faith.

I was surprised to see, although not very in-depth, that faith and Christian symbols were so prevelant, yet the movie was never preachy - now I know nothing of the comic, but it appeared to me that at a face value, Hellboy, who carrys his mentors cross, wasa nice touch of tension taht was, given the world created in the film, completely realistic.

Next, the movie's special effects are fun, yet, not completely "out there" considering teh world in which the plot lays.  Ron Perlman from 'beauty and the beats' fame is just terric and this part fits him.  He delivers the lines with enough seriousness to treat his subject matter well, but enough tonge in cheek t remind us this is only a movie and a comic book one at that.

Personally, I would like to give this film 5 stars, but because its my guilty pleasure doesn't mean I should overrate it - it does get a little too much at the end and the plot is probably a little too simple.  It is however, a great popcorn movie.
