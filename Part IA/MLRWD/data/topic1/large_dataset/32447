This movie is the retarded child of "Groundhog Day" and "Final Destination".  It's thoroughly lame. This movie deserves 5 lame stars.

She does what Hollywood wants you to think about stay at home moms: Absolutely bore herself with "mom stuff". The climax is when she figures out that she jumps from day to day, like a mixed up version of Groundhog Day.  She draws up a weekly calender. As soon as she hides it under the table cloth the movie goes back to being lame again; until the end.
Somewhere in the middle she figures out, that her husband is planning to cheat on her.  So she plans a hot night with him.  That of course magically makes him change his mind.  (We are to understand that putting out more, naturally fixes marriages).  When the day of his death approaches she can't change it.  She manages to change her fate and not end up in the insane asylum.  He has left them a house, triple income, and her belly pregnant.  Who needs a husband or father now?  How can life be better?

The moral:  As long as you let everybody know that you love them, and leave them with stuff, it's alright to die.

Here is how I fix it for you:  Watch the movie "Frequency".  This is how "Premonition" should have turned out but didn't.  In Frequency the main character gets a second chance but does not blow it.
