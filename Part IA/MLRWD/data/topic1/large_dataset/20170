While I realize the issue with "double-dipping" has irked the previous reviewers, other studios have milked their products far worse than Universal has in this case (be thankful you're not a fan of Paramount's original Star Trek series).

As a lifelong fan of Abbott and Costello, I am quite thankful that the Boys are getting their due - finally!  Universal has produced an attractive package for the actors that kept their studio afloat for many years.  (I read where 1941's "Buck Privates" was Universal's highest grossing film until "Jaws" in 1976)  This set comes in a handsome, trunk-like case.  It includes a very nicely produced booklet - Abbott and Costello: The Universal Story.  They have added 5 new audio commentaries (on Buck Privates, Hold That Ghost, Who Done It?, The Time of Their Lives, and Abbott and Costello meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde).  AND we are finally getting "It Ain't Hay" after either many years of negotiations with the Damon Runyon estate or the discovery of a usable print, which ever rumor was true.

I will be happy to replace the "Franchise" volumes with this displayable collector's edition of the greatest comedy team of all time!
