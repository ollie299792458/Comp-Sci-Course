what really kills me is during the last credits the "big lie" is put out there once again.  it comes in many forms.  this time it's the so called 'gospel of thomas'. it is like MANY other 1st and 2nd century gnostic belief systems that were condemned by the early church fathers and correctly so.  it (the gospel of thomas) essentially promulgates and encourages the idea that an individual Christian 'leader' of a specific sect has the ability to gain insights or enlightments that can exceed or go beyond Christ's teachings.  so you have people walking around claiming they knew what Jesus REALLY meant, 'cause they saw it in a dream, etc.  like 'god was a simpleton and created the universe badly' kind of nursery material.  that's actually one of the beliefs that one such 'christian' group had.  and to imply the church, i.e. evil greedy individuals who have power over people and won't give it up (by belief in the 'sayings of jesus' per the 'gospel of thomas' or other apocryphal materials) is a BIG LIE.  the church has always (especially in the early days when the Apostles and disciple of Jesus were still living) ASK them if said information agreed with what Jesus told them or they heard him say, was how many things were decided.  Christ did not leave a book behind when he rose from the dead, but He DID leave an 'institution'(the horror!)of people consisting of his 12 Apostles and His following.  so smoke on that, producers of the 'stigmata'.  otherwise a 'just above' middle rated horror movie that can be entertaining.
