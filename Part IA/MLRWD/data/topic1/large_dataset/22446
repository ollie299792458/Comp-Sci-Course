What you get:

There are 4 discs.  Battle Royale Director's Cut Blu-ray, Battle Royal Theatrical Cut Blu-ray, Battle Royale II: Requiem Blu-ray, and Bonus Features DVD.

Personally I think that Battle Royale is much, much better than Battle Royale 2 - but as a completist, I am glad they included it here.  So, I will not talk about the short-comings of BR2 but instead focus on the packaging and layout of the set.  I believe the set design is one of the things that the item description does not explain.

The case is a digibook style of sorts - no blue cases.  There is a plastic sleeve over a book with discs cardboard sleeve openings on the page ends.  If you have seen the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQO3QA">Alien Anthology [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O724NG">Stanley Kubrick: Limited Edition Collection (Spartacus / Lolita / Dr. Strangelove / 2001: A Space Odyssey / A Clockwork Orange / Barry Lyndon / The Shining / Full Metal Jacket / Eyes Wide Shut) [Blu-ray</a>], or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZSJ212">Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray</a>], then you get a good general idea of the disc housing.  As for this style, I am not a big fan because the discs often have their surfaces touching the case and moving around - unlike the standard blu-ray keepcase which suspends the disc slightly over the case material, touching the hub.  But this only seems to affect DVDs in a catastrophic way, so here the chances of it damaging the discs are minimal due to the surface quality of the blu-ray format.  But beware, the 4th disc is a DVD - so that could be an issue, though it wasn't for me.

Once you open the book you are treated to some of the best case design I've seen a long time.  There are many black & white photos with blood splatter-esque color marks spread throughout.  The book seems like a highschool yearbook almost.  This interior art is amazing and could possibly be one of the biggest selling features of the set, just short of the special features.  As for those special features, they are impressive.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006L4MX0Y">Battle Royale [Blu-ray</a>] has practically zero special features, so this set is the only way to get these features.  And though in standard definition, there are a lot of them - over 2 hours worth.

As a whole, none of these negatives could keep this below 5 stars.  I just wanted note some of the points of interest that caught my attention.  I highly recommend this set if you are a fan of Battle Royale.
