How anyone can say the performance of the actors in this production is sub-par is something completely beyond my comprehension.

The actors chosen for this film were completely perfect for their roles: Nate's mood shifts are intense, teenage Shiloh was captured wonderfully, Rotti couldn't have been played by anyone else, and the accompanying music for the soundtrack is addictive! The only character that seemed to need a little dumbing-down for actor talent was Amber Sweet... but come on, we really can't expect THAT much from Paris, and besides, she was basically just acting as herself! :)

The plot is completely original, as are the characters, sounds and images from this film. It is very fun and comically gory with a few saddening twists thrown in the great social commentary. I could watch this again and again (and I have, as a matter of fact) and I purchased the soundtrack almost right after seeing it.

If you're the type of person to look at this movie and consider it, then you are probably the type of person that will love it as well!
