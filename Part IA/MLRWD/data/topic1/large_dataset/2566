This movie was made to appeal to a wide audience, not just to Catholics.  The fact that the movie's producer (Perlberg), author (Werfel), and composer/conductor (Newman) were Jewish helped to generate a movie about faith that is of general interest.  The story of how the movie was conceived, produced, cast, and created is as interesting as the actual movie, and certainly its creation is a part of the Golden Age tradition of Hollywood.  Many of these supplementary details are provided as extras on this DVD including a filmed biography of its star, Jennifer Jones, and voice-over commentary by three film experts.  The extra features alone are worth the price of admission.

Speaking of "extras," the cast other than Jennifer Jones, a rookie, is composed of veteran contract players who were often in starring roles in other pictures: Price, Bickford, Cobb, Cooper, Revere.  Their expert presence in supporting roles here helps make the production believable, and the excellent back-lot sets and costumes help make Hollywood look like southern-France in 1858.  The musical score by Alfred Newman is essential in creating the movie's profound spiritual almost heavenly atmosphere, and Newman considered this to be his greatest movie score (and that's saying a lot, as he was nominated 45 times by Oscar for his scores).

In summary, this is a movie for all viewers and for all ages.  Just watch it with an open heart and an open mind.
