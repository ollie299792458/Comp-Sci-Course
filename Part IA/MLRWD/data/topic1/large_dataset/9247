There have been quite a few great reviews of this excellent HBO series so I won't go into details about the plot, actors, etc.  Instead I would just like to add my voice to the comments that HBO comes up with some of the greatest shows that have ever graced the television screen; Sopranos, Oz, Deadwood, Carnivale, Rome (although Showtime has been giving them a run for their money lately with Brotherhood, Dexter and the Tudors).  Then they either take a really long time to air new seasons (as in The Sopranos) or cancel it after only 2 or 3 seasons when we are really hooked (as in they did with Carnivale, Deadwood and now Rome).  I always thought that the really great thing about premium cable channels was not the movies, but in their ability bring us daring shows that we would not have seen otherwise.  Here HBO sets the standard.  Lately though they seem to lose their nerve too quickly and cancel great programs way too early.

That being said, I bought both seasons of Rome and I will proudly put them on my shelf, right in between Carnivale and Deadwood.
