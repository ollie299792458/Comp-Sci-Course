I first heard about this film on the ...FOX special "Did We Really Go to the Moon?"  Interested, I went and bought it. I was not disappointed. It goes like this: NASA discovers that there's a problem with the Mars spacecraft's life support. NASA kidnaps the astronauts and fakes the mission so the government won't cut off their funding. A reporter (Elliot Gould) picks up on the story and tries to follow it up, only to see his informants mysteriously vanish. When the real spacecraft burns up, NASA attepts to kill the astronauts, who make a run for it.
This movie is deeply rooted in the various conspiracy theories. If you liked "JFK," "The X-Files," "The Philadelphia Experiment," or the Showtime movie "Roswell," you'll enjoy "Capricorn One." Even if you don't like conspiracy movies, you can enjoy "Capricorn One" for being a suspenseful thriller. The ending is amazing and it is reminiscent of a great scene from "You Only Live Twice." Telly Savalas has a memorable role as a foul-mouthed cropduster pilot.
Space buffs will either be drawn to this movie or disgusted by the film's blatant use of Apollo hardware for the Mars ship and lander. But this movie is just a fantasy and isn't meant to be realistic. It strives to create a paranoid fantasy where an oppressive and corrupt government tries to kill its honest citizens just to save face.
Give this forgotten flick a try. You won't be disappointed.
