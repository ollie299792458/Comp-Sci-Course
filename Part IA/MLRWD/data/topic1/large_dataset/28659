Elmore Leonard knows Hollywood, but his insider's view of the movie business is the least of the appeal of this movie. John Travolta is Chili Palmer, a loan shark who comes to LA to collect a debt. The large gag is that Chili's utterly amoral, but brilliantly crafted amorality is a perfect pre-adaption to life in movieland. He moves almost seamelessly from the world of small-time hoodlery to big-time movie producing.
The plot makes its way through this metaphor with lots of action, sly double-crossing and grotesque thugs to spare.
But the large gag is one that you enjoy on reflection, after the movie is over. The little gags revolve around Leonard's wit (imagine: a movie with witty dialog!)and some imaginative casting. Danny deVito as Tinseltown's most sought-after leading man, Rene Russo as the delicious B-movie actress, Gene Hackman as the nervous, marginal producer. Travolta seems born for the role, he is by turns, hot, bland and violent and holds us in suspense as we wait to see who Chili will be next.
