I'm a longtime fan of the transformers since the original show in 1984.  I have seen most of the diff shows since then like beast wars, beast machines, cybertron etc etc.  I had never seen this particular TF show prior to getting this dvd set but i heard alot of good things about it so i took the plunge and bought the 1st season.  I think it's just fantastic to hear Peter Cullen and Frank Welker reprise their roles from my childhood and they still sound great, as all the other VA's do a fine job as well, i just wish bumblebee talked, im not a fan of the mute movie version that hasbro seems to prefer these days.  I like most of the characters fine especially Megatron and soundwave in particular( a couple i wish had gotten more screen time but if i said more it might spoil things).  I'm not crazy about the designs on some of them as they come across as tinker toys in appearance.  I was particularly surprised by the 3 human kids in the show as i was expecting to hate them as most of the kids in prior tf cartoons are downright annoying and whiny.  I think these 3 kids are the best thing since spike and sparkplug(though miko gets on my nerves a bit at times)

I don't regret my purchase and think it's a fine series, it's addicting as one episode leads to another and has that you just can't watch one episode feel going for it.  I'm defintely looking forward to season 2's release. I still don't think it beats the 1980's series myself but that's personal preference.
