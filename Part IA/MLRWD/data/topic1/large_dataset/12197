Juliet Aubrey and Rufus Sewell are wonderful as the star-crossed lovers in this miniseries.  Juliet is Dorothea, an idealist who marries an old scholar, Mr. Casaubon, determined to make his life better and help him with  his work.  
He couldn't care less, of course, and their marriage is a  cold one, until she meets his cousin Will (Sewell) who is as instantly  smitten as she is.
When Casaubon dies, instead of being able to go to  Will, Dorothea is stunned to find out that the evil old goat put a codicil  in his will so that she will lose everything if she marries poor Will.
We  also have the social-climbing spoiled Rosamond, who has enticed and married  Tertius, the noble doctor who seems initially more suited for Dorothea, and  Rosamond's devil-may-care brother Fred, whose life seems to be going  nowhere.
I loved this miniseries, how Will pines for Dorothea and his  heartfelt declaration is just so tender.  Fred eventually becomes a man and  Rosamond ends up getting what she wants, with poor Tertius meeting a fate  he does not deserve.
Wonderful writing and wonderful acting make this  miniseries a must-see.
