"Interstella 5555" is a brilliant take on music videos, movie musicals, and anime.  "Interstella" is "Fantasia" for a new generation, but instead of orchestrated music, you have the sound of Daft Punk.
The film follows a rock band of four blue humanoid looking aliens.  During one of there concerts on there home planet, they are kidnapped by a evil record producer named Earl de Darkwood.  He takes them to Earth and forcefully transforms them into a band for humans.  There only hope is another alien space jockey named Shep, who is the only one who can save them.
The art in this movie is gorgeous.  Leiji Matsumoto's work in "Interstella" is a perfect example of why 2-D animation is not dead yet.  The character models are very nice looking and the backgrounds flourish with depth and color.
Daft Punk's music is a matter of taste.  You ether love the club/funk/rock genera, or you do not.  Because there is no dialog, the music not only must set the mood, but also tell the story and if you don't like the music, then you probably won't like the film.  All the music is taken form the album "Discovery" and fits very well with the themes of the movie, being space, love, mystery, and others.
My only complaint would be that the music does not fit totally sometimes with what is happening on screen.  When you have a song the is somber and slow, but you have the screen filled with action scenes, it doesn't fit as well.  I wish they could have fit everything together perfectly like in the "Fantasia" films, but the music is mostly beats.  It would just be too crazy to have so many jump cuts.
If you enjoy great dance music and anime, or just want to see something that is different from everything else coming out this year, check out this movie.
