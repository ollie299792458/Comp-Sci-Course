First time I saw this movie, I was a child and with my Mother at my local theater with a few friends.  My Mother loved Helen Hayes, Jim's mother and was a huge fan of the classic movies of Disney.  She introduced this passion to me and it has always stayed with me.  The interesting part is that years later as an adult, I met Jim MacArthur on a flight to Honolulu, HI May 18th 1985.  The reason I remember the date so well, is that it was my Fathers birthday and my first trip to the island.  I ended up sitting next to Jim and he invited me to a dinner.  Well, one thing led to another and I ended up staying at his condo on Kalakaua Ave for the rest of my vacation.  After which time, we parted and I thought I would never see him again.  I was mistaken...we met again and again and again..Jim was a gem to be around. Fun, generous and a happy-go-lucky personality who loved to travel and show me things.  Our time spent together has left an imprint on my heart forever.  He ended up marrying another woman, as I found out later he had a child with her.  We spoke a few times after that..When I heard that he had passed away about 1.5 years ago. I stopped on the way home from work and had a "gin and tonic" in his honor.  I know he would have liked that.  He will always be missed forever.  I truly loved that man, but it was just not meant to be.
