First, after reading some of the previous reviews, I have to comment that Ice Age is not a Pixar movie. Not that I care terribly but it seemed worth mentioning.

As to the movie itself, I have two small boys (4 and 6) who enjoy the movie thoroughly. The slapstick and silly humor are certainly not out of their reach. As with most of these type of films, there is an effort to make it entertaining for the parents and I think they succeeded here. I find myself chuckling during many parts of the story and am not dissapointed when the boys pick this as our "Family Movie Night" film choice.

On the topic of animation quality, while this clearly isn't up to the level of the Pixar movies, who cares? I have not yet had either of my sons make a comment on the "lack of realistic fur movement" on any of the animated, talking, extinct, fake animals. I wish Disney would look at this and their old animated movies and remember that it is the story, not the animation technique that makes a movie. Otherwise, nobody would watch the Simpsons!
