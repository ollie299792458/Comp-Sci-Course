The Stuff is quite possibly one of the greatest films ever made. Mo Rutherford and Chocolate Chip Charlie are two of cinema's greatest heroes. Although the effects are sometimes of a poor quality, the story, the characters and the acting are (in most cases) fantastic. I read another review that claimed "...no intelligent adult should watch this film". Whoever wrote this should be truely ashamed of this merciless attack on one of the most terrifying and hilarious films ever made. If Mo Rutherford actually existed I'd have him over to their house to sort them out.

My only complaint about the film is that Chocolate Chip Charlie doesn't feature enough. A man with such a cool name should definitely be given a greater role. His immortal line, "My hands are lethal weapons", is one of the greatest pieces of dialogue ever commited to film. Charlie's horrific death was a twist I never seen coming and to this day it haunts my dreams.

So, to summarise: The Stuff is one of the greatest purchases I have ever made. A truely fantastic film that both terrifies and delights in equal measures. Highly recommended.
