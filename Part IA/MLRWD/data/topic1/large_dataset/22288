Yes, this movie has gore..its quite sickening and grotesque.  But nowadays, that is what many people are into, as sad as it sounds.  BUT, it also shows how creative and how FAR modern technology can enhance the film productions.  Just keep in mind, ITS JUST A MOVIE.  Those people who give it 1 or 2 stars because the movie was "not PERFECTLY acted", it is too immoral, etc...well I gotta tell you, it is only a source of --&gt;entertainment&lt;--.  If you say its too sickening or immoral, then just turn on CNN or any ordinary action/fighting movie.
Though the movie is not perfect, I'm still glad to give 5 out of 5 stars.  The car accident scenes are just plainly awesome... Acting is not perfect, but good enough.  The death scenes are gruesome and lots of gore, but quite realistic and creative...though I am not a fan of death &amp; torture.  I felt sorry for some of the characters in the film, but afterall, ITS FABLE.
DVD has quite a few additional features as well...worth the buy!
