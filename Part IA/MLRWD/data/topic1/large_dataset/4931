Sometimes, movies are not meant to be thoughtful, deep, or insightful.  Sometimes, they're just made to entertain, and MASK OF ZORRO delivers that entertainment in spades!!!  Set in the days of Spanish California, this flick tells the tale of Don Diego Vega (Anthony Hopkins), who was the original Zorro.  In a plot very much like the classic "Count of Monte Cristo", Diego is suprised by his foe, Governor Montero.  He sees his wife killed, baby daughter kidnapped, and is doomed to spent life in prison.  20 years later, Diego escapes to wreak his revenge, but is halted when he learns that Montero has adopted his daughter (the beautiful and spirited Catherine Zeta-Jones).  Diego recruits another vengeful soul (Antonio Banderas), who has lost his brother to Montero's henchman, Capt. Love.  Diego's attempt to make his new protege the next Zorro is main focus of the plot. Told in a fast paced &amp; fun style, this film has everything for the action film fan: great sword fighting, passionate romance, and a health dose of wit &amp; warmth.  All 3 leads are splendid and this film is well worth your time.  Highly recommended.
