Okay, here's the deal:  I first saw "Magnolia" in the theater and hated it.  By the time I left the multiplex, my patience was gone (typical multiplex experience), my butt was numb (ditto), and my head hurt.  It is this last which made me buy the DVD on pure impulse when it first hit the shelves.  It has since become one of my favorite movies and is one which I definitely recommend one see at home as opposed to in the theater.  Why?  One word:  Intermission.  Paul Anderson probably would've won my immediate and undying respect had he given the audience a bit of a breather.  I mean, let's face it, nobody enjoys sitting in a multiplex seat for over three hours.  Older films such as "Dr. Zhivago" and "Once Upon a Time In America," to name just two, seemed to understand this.  At home you can (and should) take at least one fifteen minute break.  I recommend this not only for the opportunity it offers to get one's head together but because it will allow you to discuss the film with whoever you happen to be watching it with or at least give some thought to what is being said and what is being done if you happen to be on your own.  Trying to take in all of "Magnolia" in one uninterrupted sitting is like trying to take in a five course meal without a break.  Does it look good?  Absolutely!  Taste good?  Absolutely!  Leave you feeling so stuffed you feel like you're about to go into cardiac arrest?  Absolutely!  Hopefully Mr. Anderson will take a lesson next time and go ahead and tack on an extra ten or fifteen minutes to allow his audience a chance at some digestion.
