The idea of a horror movie being so dull that it put me to sleep, and a restful sleep at that, really surprised me, as I like a lot of different film genres including horror and the variety of horror styles. I will try not to repeat what others have said, but essentially I expected better. If you like The Ring you will love The Grudge? What a lie. I did like The Ring, but I don't care much at all for The Grudge. If I was to give The Ring 4 or 5 stars, I could honestly give The Grudge not much more than 1 star. 
A complete viewing of The Grudge later, did convey to me the basic concept and the essentials of the plot which were intriguing enough. I was left thinking what a great concept was in this movie, yet it was portrayed so lifelessly. The scares... Weren't. 
Gellar's acting has been better. Pullman's wasn't so bad, but seemed merely workman-like. I think it did so well in the first week or so of initial release to theatres simply because the commercials and trailers were better than the movie they promoted. I do believe that I would likely appreciate much better the original(s) that The Grudge was based on.
