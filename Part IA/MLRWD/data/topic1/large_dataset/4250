Second Doctor Who actor Patrick Troughton gives one of his best performances not "entirely" lost like most of the episodes from 1963-1970.  While some of those stories exist in thier entirety, most are incomplete. THE INVASION has 6 of the 8 episodes that remaim entirely.  The other two episodes (episodes 1 and 4) make this DVD truely UNINQUE.  While video footage of 1 and 4 has been lost the audio remained, and now replaced with animated reconstructions. What hurts this otherwise CLASIC STORY is the sheer lenghth, which can be blamed on the BBC after the original script called for a six part story.  These stories are a part of the extras which are a must for any fan of Doctor Who.  The real treasure of this story is three-fold #1 the introduction of Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and UNIT #2 the return of the Cybermen the sound of thier invasion itself is priceless #3 Kevin Stoney as the real villian of this story, Tobias Vaughn is worth purchase price alone. Truely one of Doctor Who's greatest Villians.
