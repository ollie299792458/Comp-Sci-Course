This inspirational sports movie is a little bit Hoosiers and a little bit Dangerous Minds.  It tells the true story of Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson), a former high school basketball star who returns to his alma mater, Richmond (CA) High School, to coach the struggling basketball team.  From the beginning, Coach Carter has high hopes for his team.  He makes players sign contracts, promising to be great students as well as great athletes-intending to help them break out of the school's high drop-out rates and low college acceptance rates.

On the court, the team excels beyond anyone's expectations, and the team wins game after game.  But then the academic reports come in-and Carter realizes that several of his students aren't keeping up the academic end of the deal.  In a move that's highly unpopular with students, parents, and even the school board, Carter forces his team to meet in the library instead of the gym.  He cancels practices and games until the whole team is back to the standards that he expects of his players-even though the board threatens to go over his head and cut the chains that keep the gym closed.

Coach Carter is a compelling film about a man who devoted himself to improving the future of his community-not just to winning the game.  Though it definitely isn't the kind of movie that I typically enjoy, I enjoyed it.  It's fast-paced and action-packed, but it's also moving at the same time.  Anyone who loves basketball won't want to miss the perfectly-choreographed game scenes-though they may seem a bit long for non-hoops-fans.  It's not just for sports fans, though-the story is a powerful one for anyone.  It's a great reminder that there still are a few good, caring people left in the world.
