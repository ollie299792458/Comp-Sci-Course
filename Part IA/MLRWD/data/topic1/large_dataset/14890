The genious of "12 Angry Men" can be ascribed to its director, stars and most importantly the simplicity of its staging.  Modern Hollywood would certainly fumble the passionate elegance of this picture.  It really *is* true: less is more.  In "12 Angry Men" we are not showed "flashbacks" of the trial, nor are we showed the witnesses or allowed to hear from them ourselves as the audience.  In short, we are not allowed to form our own opinions independently, and thus we are forced to see everything from the point of view of the jurors.  This is crucial since at the beginning of the film we are at a point of innocence and must, as the characters, reevaluate the nature and 'truth' of the facts as they become revealed.  There is much to admire in a movie that begs its audience to *think*.  Too often, we are simply baited by Hollywood to pay attention with rapid-fire editing, multi-million dollar special effects, or formulatic plots beating down the same-old tired cliches to placate the modern American attention span.  Yet, here is a movie consisting of 12 talented actors in a small room.  No car chases, no bloody body of the victim to shock us, no gee-whiz visuals.  Just an amazing cast, a wonderful script, and a young director completing his first motion picture.  It is compelling.  It is relevant.  It puts us in a potion to question our own judgements and prejudices, and asks us how we would behave if we were in that small, sweltering room, wondering if we had missed anything, trying to convice a brick wall that there is something on the other side of its stubborn facade, knowing the life and death of another man is at stake.
