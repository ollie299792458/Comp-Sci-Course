I was delightfully surprised to learn that TWILIGHT ZONE writer Richard Matheson wrote a novel in 1978 and 20 years later, was made into a movie. As a huge TZ fan, and a Richard Matheson fan (I just recently bought the novel, though I haven't read it yet), I was looking forward to a brand new journey into the Twilight Zone. I agree with one of the other reviewers. It could have been a fine TWILIGHT ZONE episode (maybe for the 1980s episodes), but stretching it out to feature length is like a pair of men's briefs whose elastic broke. So, therefore, I was a little disappointed. Very weak, very slow, and VERY VERY disorienting. But it is the message in the story that shines through in brilliant colors -- excuse the pun. I do agree that the visual special effects are astounding. Because the pace and visual experience is similar to 1979's STAR TREK -- THE MOTION PICTURE and Robin William's performance is why I give it 2 stars, but it's the message in the story is why I don't give it 1 star.
