Good Morning, Vietnam stars Robin Williams in the type of role he plays best, as the hilarious, irreverent, and nonconformist military disc jockey Adrian Cronauer. Based (extremely) loosely on a true story, the movie takes place in 1965, where Cronauer injects life and humor into the hellish existence of GIs fighting the Vietnam War. To the enjoyment of the troops and the fury of his superiors, he fills the airwaves with rapid-fire hilarity, mocks Nixon, plays rock music, and defies the overzealous military censors with "unofficial" news reports. Williams' performance is brilliant, and as he would later demonstrate again with films like Dead Poets Society and Patch Adams, the role suits him perfectly.

The movie is so effective because it combines humor with poignancy as Cronauer's spirited humanity clashes with the regimented military life, the horrors of war, and the dehumanizing effects of conflict. He forges relationships with the Vietnamese people he comes into contact with, but heartbreakingly comes up against the barriers of cultural differences and political divides.

In one of the most unforgettable scenes, he dedicates Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" to one of the young GIs headed off to the nightmare of battle. With painful irony, the song mingles with images of the brutal reality of the war. In a sense, the scene encapsulates the discord between Cronauer's insistence on maintaining his humanity and the inhuman world that surrounds him.
