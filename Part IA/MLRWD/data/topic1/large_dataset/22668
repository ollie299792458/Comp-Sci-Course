I enjoyed this documentary - and found David Carr's commentary to be the best part of the film.

The description of the program indicates that it covers a period of a year at the paper - which of course - will be a bit of a random walk - so not sure why another reviewer calls out the fact that it is "unfocused".

While living in Washington D.C. the Washington Post was a Sunday ritual - and to this day - I still consider it to have been the best newspaper I've ever read, hands-down.

While living in Los Angeles, the L.A. Times became part of my Sunday ritual - and holds the rank of the 2nd best newspaper to my mind.

In the 1999-2002 time frame, while living in Seattle, Washington - the Seattle Post Intelligencer was introduced into my Sunday ritual - and the writing of John Cook still stands out in my mind to this day - as some of the very reporting ever.

A free and robust press is essential to the survival of democracy.  Reporters, who are free to pursue stories, independent of other concerns required to earn a livelihood are essential - and are not so easily replaced by the likes of Facebook, Twitter, Gawker, or the like.

Steadfast reporting such as was produced by the likes of Cronkite, Murrow, Rather, Woodward & Berstein - must not perish - or else our democracy will fall to tyranny.
