****SCREAMINGLY FUNNY!!!!!!!!*****

Here's a movie for "kids" of all ages: the storyline and animation both are often very funny, yet sometimes profound, quite warm, and yet at some points scary and suspenseful -- but only in the Disneyesque sense.

The animation of Barnyard is quite remarkable. It's as fluid and free as the absolutely best traditionally animated movies.

The music is nothing short of phenomenal. -- And *don't* miss the terrific music found in DVD Extras. Moreover, don't miss the whimsical music for the end credits. (The final credits-roll song is truly laugh-out-loud funny and quite adorable.) Speaking of DVD Extras, that's where you'll find many unfinished or unpolished -- but nonetheless very funny -- additional scenes which were not felt good enough (or whatever) to make the final cut.

Barnyard is also worth buying because (1) it's simply LOTS of fun to watch; screen it with lots of friends. (2) You'll find yourself watching this a ZILLION times -- because its so very story and features-rich; has many great quote-worthy scenes in Extras.

Speaking of Extras, the voice-over commentary is the only thing of the whole package that's weak; it provides far less information than one would want on the movie production process. In addition, the movie extras' commentary is about as interesting as an endless Academy Award speech: it's DULL. Otherwise, Barnyard offers a pretty much a perfect DVD and is an excellent value.

I'm hoping there'll be a Barnyard movie sequel; I'm looking forward to seeing TV episodes of Barnyard on Nick.
