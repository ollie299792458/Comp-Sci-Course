I just finished watching "The Grey" on DVD.I must say that this is a pretty decent action flick.The scenery is stunningly beautiful and the CGI wolves,although larger than their real-life counterparts,look awesome.Everything was done very well with this pic.I've read some reviews that indicate that viewers are unhappy by what is apparently an ambigious ending,and judging by the final scene before the end credits roll, it does look that way.However,if you scroll through the ending credits you'll see a final very short scend of what appears to be the black alpha wolf laying on it's side,perhaps breathing its' last.The camera pans along the length of the still breathing body and stops on a shock of black hair raising up from the wolfs' body.If you look closely you can see that it appears to be attached to a human scalp as pink skin can be seen underneath the shock of hair.This final scene would seem to indicate that the battle is just ended and John Ottway and the wolf have killed each other.I may be wrong,but I think that this is a reasonable conclusion judging by that final short scene,which at least for me ,brings the movie to a final conclusion.I reccomend this movie to anyone with a taste for the outdoors and outdoor adventure.We need more movies like this!
