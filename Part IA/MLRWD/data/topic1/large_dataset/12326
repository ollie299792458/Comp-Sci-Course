This film is a dark, true life look into Special Ops, politics, government, and the men and women involved.

Val Kilmer plays a "black" operator sent to retrieve the daughter of

an un-named political figure (i.e. the President) by whatever means necessary. Kilmer plays "Scott" the "shooter" to perfection and is at times both paternal and then scary as all Hell. "Scott" is the bottom line of the "get the job done and ask no questions" operator who's mission it is to deal (i.e. kill) whatever problem is at hand. The spoken line "one riot, one Ranger" is stated by Scott and followed by another character telling of Spartan, King Leonidas' tactic to send aid in the form of one Spartan. Thus, we have our movie title.

Brief looks into spec ops "Selection", weapons, tactics, and mindset are well carried off. Note: author and former Delta Force operator Eric Haney served as the movies advisor.

Without giving away too much, this is an intelligent, well-made thriller

with very brief, ruthless, and brutally affected action scenes.

David Mamet is well known for his twisted, multi-layed stories and this is no exception. Stunning at times.

A must see.

Note: Mamet and Haney produce the CBS show "The Unit" about the lives of special operations in the field and at home.
