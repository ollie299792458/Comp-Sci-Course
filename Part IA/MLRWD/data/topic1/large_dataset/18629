Based on Whitley Strieber's book of the same name, this stylish movie by Tony Scott is a masterpiece and extremely original.  It's been "ripped off" in many venues including the haunting opera Lakme by Delibes which is now commonly used in car commercials and such but was first widely heard in the movie.  The soundtrack is next to none mixing punk (Bauhaus) with Bach  (Suite #1 for solo, cello in G-major) and Shubert (trio in E-flat, opus 100). 
The movie is about a vampire who has been around even longer than Christ.  In the movie, it's not too clear but in the book, Mirium (Catherine Deneuve) may have been an eye witness to the Crucifixtion of Christ.  She also lived amongst the ancient Egyptians, the Italians during the Renaissance and the Viennese during Mozart's times.  The movie tries to keep true to the book, but manages to transcend what is on black and white and really captured the majesty, the scale and angst of Mirium's life as Strieber created Mirium.  
Her whole life has been about searching for love and companionship as she is endless and can not die (well, just see the movie).  The kink is that none of her lovers stays alive for more than about 300 years.  Her life's mission has been to find the fountain of youth which will allow her lovers to stay with her as she loves each one and misses each as they perish.  
When David Bowie (her latest lover) dies by rapidly aging, she takes Susan Sarandon as her next conquest.  Mirium's companions are almost like human pets...Mirium always outlives them and is saddened each time they pass on.  
This movie is INTENSE, intriguing, stylish and creepy fun.  It's really some piece of work and I hugely recommend it.  Oh, watch out for really explicit scenes between Sarandon and Deneuve.
