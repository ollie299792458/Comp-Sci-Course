I remember falling in love with this movie back in the early 60's when it was re-released by Disney in movie theatres. My friend and I went to see this movie and another (can't even recall what the other movie was) but we ended up staying around to see 20,000 Leagues a second time, much to the consternation of our parents and causing us to pool our modest resources to keep ourselves from starving for another 2 hours.

But this was Jules Verne coming to life on the screen, with James Mason portraying this tortured sole of a genius who was using his gifts to strike back at a world that had done him wrong. The Nautilus itself was a perfect blend of 1800's industrialism/heavy metal and Victorian elegance - the island of Volcania (Peter Ellenshaw's fantastic matte production) looked like the perfect "Batcave" for the Nemo character. Even though I knew the outcome, I was crushed by the death of Nemo, hoping that perhaps he might escape to live to build and fight another day in more fantastic machines (no doubt George Lucas might have remembered this type of situation and made sure the Darth Vader character had a chance to return should his funny little Star Wars movie might actually make some money!)

What can you say about a DVD which just gives you more of a good thing, including comments by the director?

Now if only Disney could see fit to bring back the 20,000 Leagues submarine ride at WDW which they so mindlessly discarded due to cost-cutting in the Eisner era .......
