The film that not only resurrected an aging genre but also put John Travolta back on the map and formally established Samuel L. Jackson as a superstar (who prior to his partaking in the film, was chiefly just another extra), Pulp Fiction, like Quentin Tarantino's earlier hit, Reservoir Dogs, featured some absorbing dialogue by Quentin Tarantino himself and Roger Avary that's frequently off the wall but funny, and stupendous performances by an all-star cast in this memorable melodrama that weaves together three interrelated stories regarding small-time hoods, drug-attics, boxing champions on the verge of death's door, and hazardous criminals that are the last thing you'd ever want to have to deal with, as Tarantino clearly shows in one of his stories which feature Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames as the key characters. The mode of the film is to imply such characters in sticky circumstances, and then let them evade into even stickier ones, which is how Willis's and Rhames's character wind up together as the captives of strange leather freaks in the basement of a gun shop. Or how, in the opening sequence, Tim Roth's and Amanda Plummer's character, a couple of stick-up artists, get in way over their heads. Much of the action in the film comes under the heading of crisis control. 
If the circumstances are adept and original, then as is the dialogue. Nowadays, many films use flat, functional speech: The characters merely say enough to advance the story line. But the ones in Pulp Fiction are completely in love with words for their own sake.

With Tarantino's trademark profanity and casual violence, he shifts between humor and graphic violence that inspired a seemingly endless slew of imitators, none of which have, however, made a picture as powerful as this one, for it is bound to become a cult favorite!
