The Magic of DVD technology makes Oliver! an incredible new experience. I've seen Oliver! on TV and video more than a dozen times, but this re-mastered digital verson of a 1960s movie brings the movie back to the  way it must have been first seen in theaters--quite possibly even better!  The colors are rich, the clarity amazingly sharp, and the letterbox version  exposes so many things off to the far sides of the screen that have never  been seen since its theatrical premier. The dance numbers are particularly  great with the letterbox version, as the pan and scan version cuts off many  cast members during the bigger production numbers. This movie is a grand  entertainment that will be cherished forever by musical lovers and those  with a pashion for Dickens and for the human heart. And now that it is  available on DVD, it just got a whole lot better. Truly one of the best  experiences I've had at the movies, and with digital TV. It's a dramatic  music with tunes that you'll be humming for weeks and characters you'll  never forget. The songs complement and move the story forward in almost  every sequence; It's extremely well done.
