If you don't have blue ray and the coolest-of-the-cool LED 1080 TV to make it work right, this movie is STILL stunningly pretty. I saw it on an ANALOG TV set, definitely NOT the right format for blu-ray. I was STILL extremely impressed with how gorgeous this movie is. I LOVED this movie, I really did. The character is independent, not dependent on some non-existent prince to come and save her, which is beyond stupid, and next to never happens anyhow. She thinks for herself. she knows what she wants. This movie is SO pretty, if you don't have the LED 1080 type TV, I'd say this movie alone would make it worth it. A Samsung 5000 series is very nice, and doesn't really need an expensive sound bar for most applications or most people, with a 32 inch size, and right around 400.00 isn't at all "undoable." With my new TV, I have more than enough sound, decent sound quality, and a really impressive picture. I only wish I'd bought a 55 inch screen, but not really practical for a movies-while-cooking kitchen TV set. It's so pretty, I want to just crawl inside it like that old Twlight Zone episode, "the 16 millimeter shrine" first season, where she wants to crawl into her old movies. If it were that pretty in 1959 it wouldn't have taken her a whole episode to do it.

Only a few films are this nice. Cars. nemo. Toy Story. Oh, the Pixar shorts are also gorgeous. LED and the new Blu-ray stuff REALLY makes you want a GINORMOUS TV set and just marvel over great movies like this one. Big enough to need a crane. Bigger than a video screen for Journey in 1980. The HEMI of TV sets. Then sit four inches away and because we're grown, no one will tell us no.
