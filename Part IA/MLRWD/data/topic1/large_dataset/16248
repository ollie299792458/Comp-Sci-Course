This is one of the greatest films to come along in many years. Javier Bardem's performance will go down as one of the creepiest villains in cinema history. The story, directing, cinematography, and acting are superb. This is the Coen Brothers at their very best. I am amazed by the number of negative responses to this film. The one caveat that I would offer the first time viewer, is that this is not a typical Hollywood film with a stock, predictable ending. This is a film that actually requires you to think about the story and the dialogue. Which is not to infer that it's like some bizarre art film. It's actually a taught thriller/drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat. But, if you're looking for the obligatory Hollywood ending with unbelievable heroism, a shouting match, factory explosions, climactic fight scene, grandiose music, etc., you'll be disappointed. The point of the story is much bigger than that, and yet simpler at the same time. It has to do with life, death, and the persistence of evil. And man, that bad guy is brutal!
