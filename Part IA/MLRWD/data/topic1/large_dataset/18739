I have to wonder when I read reviews of this film stating with a straight face that it bears no resemblance to the book.  From its beginnings with the sea captain discovering Victor Frankenstein in the arctic--which was the original framing device for Mary Shelley's novel, just as it is in the film--to the climactic confrontation between Frankenstein and his creature in the same frigid North, this is the most faithful adaptation of Shelley's novel that has ever been made.  The only one that even comes close is TNT's adaptation starring Randy Quaid as the Creature, made the year before this one.  Kenneth Branagh as Victor Frankenstein. and Robert DeNiro as the Creature are the anchors of this film.  It's good to finally see a film adaptation that remembers that the creature had the power of speech in the book, and did not grunt in monosyllables the way Karloff's monster does in Bride of Frankenstein.  On the down side, Branagh does take his shirt off a bit too much in the film, and the reanimation of Elizabeth is pointless and gory.  But the central theme of Victor's egocentric quest to defy death is here, as well as the metaphor of the father-child relationship between the scientist and his creation.  People not familiar with the novel need to realize that part of the point of this story was that the Creature was not evil--he was made bitter and hateful by his rejection at the hands of his creator and most of the other humans he encountered.  Here, as in the Shelley novel, the Creature is actually far more noble at heart than most of the more ostensibly "human" characters.
As far as fidelity to the book--within the reasonable limitations of a bigbudget Hollywood film--this is practically the only Frankenstein film that exists for me.  
As far as fun and pathos, I do still highly recommend the Karloff films, particularly "Frankenstein" and "Bride of Frankenstein".
