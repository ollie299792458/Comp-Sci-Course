1.) The audio is pretty good (some of the music is so famous such that anyone born and raised in Texas in the
  past 50 years probably knows it without even realizing it) but the picture image quality has not fared so
  well. Another reviewer theorized that the DVD was made from a 3rd or 4th generation copy. About that I don't
  know but the result is that some of the imagery is not as good as it should be. (Example : In the opening
  shot a watering pond for cattle (in Texas it's known as a 'tank') is shown. The color is faded and not clear
  making one wonder how the opening scene looked to theater audiences 50 years ago.)

  2.) I think that some of the acting is overdone and the attempt to 'act like Texans' causes some of the scenes
  to be almost comical (you have to 'stand back' and think about how the scenes strike you). Now, having said
  that, I will also say that some of the scenes are so 'classic' that they make up for shortcomings of other
  scenes. (Example: When James Dean shows-up covered in oil after his first well comes in, it seems exactly
  what anyone would do when everyone else figured that he would 'lose-his-shirt'.)

The overall 'look-and-feel' of 'Giant' is so much larger-than-life that its strenghts overcome its shortcomings.
If heroic music gets you excited, and the thought of a horizon that stretches further than seems reasonable
makes you want to get in your car and 'head west', then you've got to see 'Giant'.
