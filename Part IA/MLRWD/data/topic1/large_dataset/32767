Stephen King writes and wait for it, actually directs this adaptation of his short story "TRUCKS" (not to be confused with the later made for Sci-fi remake which was just a plain no brainer). Packed with a heavy hitting soundtrack by the Australian thunder from down under AC/DC (ironic I know), Maximum Overdrive despite it's cheeseball story will delight gorehounds and headbangers a like.

Much like a mechanical version of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, machines big and small begin revolting violently against people. Loaded with more dead bodies than an action movie and seriously dark humerous moments, this is a perfect movie for those saturday nights when nothing is on and you're so bored staring into space hurts. Hands down my favorite scene is the incredibly well shot chase sequence, where a huge and seriously ticked off Mack truck chases down a newly married couple down a deserted highway. Awesome. Though I still love the scene with the lawnmower, classic.

More so, the quiet moments of the film are usually slow but well accented with AC/DC's earlier blue's style motiff filling in the despair and desparation. So if you're looking for ninety minutes of bad B-movie to help you escape the day, look no further than Maximum Overdrive and enjoy Stephen King's hilarious cameo.
