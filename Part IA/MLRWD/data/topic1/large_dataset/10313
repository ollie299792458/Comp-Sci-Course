Let me start by stating that dramas are not typically my cup of tea.  I enjoy who-done-its, thrillers, and action movies but periodically venture into other categories (and thankfully so).  This movie tells the story of a brilliant mathematician (Hopkins) who suffers from a mental disorder such as schizophrenia.  Catherine (Paltrow) is the mathemetician's daughter who drops out of college to care for him while Catherine's sister moves to New York.  After Catherine's father dies, a mathematical "proof" is discovered in the house by a former student of the father.  This proof is believed to have huge significance in the field of mathematics.  There are many facets to this movie but at the center is a mystery:  Who wrote the "proof"?  With flashbacks to the past, move forward to the present and back again, the mystery slowly unravels to a dramatic conclusion.  "Proof" is also about relationships between father and daughter, sisters, and the young student and Catherine.  Without giving away the story, let me say that this movie touch me in a very personal way.  My father was no genious but he seemed to have endless talents.  At the end of his life, my father (like Catherine's) needed care.  Although the situations were different, I really identified with the movie characters and the relationships that exist.  I highly recommend "Proof" because the characters are so real and the story is touching as well.  Finally, this was a "who-done-it" after all...
