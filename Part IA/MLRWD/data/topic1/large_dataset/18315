This movie is bloody!  I mean, really bloody.  It's also fun, and for the genre, fairly well written and acted.  Now, remember I said for the genre.  This ain't Oscar material, but for what it sets out to do, it does and does it with gusto.  Heads go flying, people are split in half... You get my drift.  Still, the victims are all fun to watch even when they aren't running around screaming, which is a plus since you spend a good chunk of time with them before the slashing starts.

Now, why am I not giving this five stars?  The overall tone of the film is fairly goofy and over the top, yet early on in the film we are presented with a very nasty, disturbing rape scene.  Yes, the scene does play into the story.  Yes, the result of it is important, but at the same time, the seriousness of that particular scene and the complete lack of seriousness in the rest of the film do not mesh, and end up leaving a very nasty taste in the audiences mouth.

That one scene aside, the film is a bloody mess of a good time.  Just be ready to be disturbed early on.
