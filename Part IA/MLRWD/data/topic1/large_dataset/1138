I just watched this film two days ago and have not been able to stop thinking or talking about it. I am in the process of establishing business in Brazil and having travelled there several times, I was truly captivated. On my first trip there, I was drawn to the favelas each time I passed on my way to one tourist site or another. After convincing my new friends to take me there, I was in awe and refreshed if you can understand. I saw the poverty and what some might think is hopelessness, but I very much saw the life! The real life of people choosing to live with hope. This movie seems so much about conditions and choices. Some which we make and others that might be thrust upon us. The special features section that showed you the real people behind the movie and the life that exist between the hoodlums, the police and the favela dwellers is something to behold. It addressed the gun makers in the U.S. and abroad and how we will intervene/interfere (depending on your point of view) in the world drug wars but we are supplying weapons that are so powerful but not being produced to fight wars, but are being produced just to be sent to Brazil and no where else. This movie speaks to life, family, crime, government and every bodies part that is played in keeping such things flowing. You typically only hear about the beautiful people and things in Brazil, but keeping the war in the favelas keeps the "dwellers" from flowing into the streets of Rio to affect the wealthy and the tourist. This movie should be seen by everyone! Powerful, Powerful, Powerful!!
