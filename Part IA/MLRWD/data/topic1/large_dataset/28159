Most of the serious criticism of this film has focused on its "massive deviation from fact", changing the facts "to suit the message" and so on. But everyone knows no dramatization can be perfectly accurate--no one would criticize "Julius Caesar" or "Richard III" on this account, or, to use more modern examples, "The Crucible" or "Judgment at Nuremberg". Nevertheless, films should be held accountable for severe falsification if they claim to be accurate, or could even be reasonably mistaken for reenactments. "Inherit the Wind" falls into this second category for reasons I'm not totally clear about--even though it's clearly a piece of advocacy and terribly partial to the defense.

But is it really so inaccurate? Have a look at the transcripts and you'll see that there's a great deal taken verbatim from them. The context of the trial, the carnival atmosphere, the (irrelevant) ulterior motives of certain participants, the partiality of judge and jury, were all attested to, and not contradicted in any important way by every source I looked at.

It was after reading H. L. Mencken's original dispatches from Dayton, Tennessee that I began to understand what the real problem was. It's quite simple really. Religion, alone of all powerful social institutions, claims to be immune from criticism. We are so used to tiptoeing around the subject that flat-out public criticism of religion has become unthinkable, and any sort of behavior in its defense, including violence, understandable if not actually justified.

"Inherit the Wind" doesn't go out of its way to find excuses for these people--ignorance, viciousness, prejudice and superstition are depicted in all their hideousness. What shocks me is that this picture, corny and dated as it is in places, should now be seen as so "out of line". You wouldn't think people who are comfortable with hell-fire and God's wrath, or with amputations and beheadings, would be so thin-skinned. But there you have it. And it's getting worse.
