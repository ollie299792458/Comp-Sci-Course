First of all, let me start by saying that I'm a foolish girl, and I had bought this movie previously.  So, kudos to Amazon for an effortless return process.  I had absolutely NO problems with the ordering or return of this item.
Now for the movie.  It's not for everyone.  It's very crude, with a lot of cussing and sex.  But that's the point.  It's not supposed to be a pretty, flowery story, it's about real life.  More to the point, it's about Bukowski's experience of real life, which is decidely different from most people's.  If you are a Charles Bukowski fan, I think you'll be very happy with this movie.  It's very true to his style.  I personally am not a huge fan of this style, but my ex-fiance, for whom I bought this movie (twice, hehe) is a big Bukowski fan, and was quite pleased with this screen adaptation.  He rates it five stars, and his is the opinion that matters in this situation.
And, of course, Amazon gets five stars for the fabulous return.  I was very stressed when I bought this movie last minute, then realized, the day before Christmas, that I had already purchased this same thing.  It was quite a weight off of my shoulders to simply take it down to the post office and attach a label I printed off of Amazon.  They took care of the rest.
