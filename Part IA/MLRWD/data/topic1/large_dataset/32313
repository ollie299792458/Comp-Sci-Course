Ah, good ol' Warner Bros. Home Video!  If she were a woman, I'd marry her!  First, the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, then the Film Noir Classics Collection, and now this!!!  I should have known that they would be the ones who would finally bring the often imitated but never duplicated "White Heat" to DVD.  Not only that, but we also get two, count 'em TWO of the infamous pre-Hayes Code gangster classics, the two films which singlehandedly founded the entire crime-drama genre, "The Public Enemy" and "Little Caesar"!

  "Angels With Dirty Faces" and "The Roaring Twenties" are also terrific films, and I'm really looking forward to seeing all of these cherished treasures of the American cinema rescued from neglect and digitalized for posterity!  From what I've heard, Warner has poured their sweat and blood into this set, with commentaries for each film, vintage poster-art keep-cases, and the deluxe treatment that such a fine pack of films deserves.  I think I speak for every classic film fan here when I say that January is going to be a darn good month to have a DVD player!
