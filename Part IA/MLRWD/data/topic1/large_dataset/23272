Shortly after Blanche Dubois (played by Vivien Leigh) moves in with her sister Stella for temporary shelter, Stella's husband (Stanley, played by Marlon Brando) begins to suspect that Blanche is a fallen woman who's on the run and masquerading as a respectable lady. Stanley then decides he'll stop at nothing to destroy Blanche's hopes for a normal life. What happens in this movie will have you glued to the screen from start to finish. ASND has realistic , powerful acting from Leigh, Brando, Malden and Hunter .......This film makes my Top 5 Movies of All Time. If you consider yourself a "tender" person (as opposed to wicked/ruthless) then do yourself a favor and watch ASND. It's a primal reminder that the Gentle/Tender should always be watchful of their archenemy, the Wicked! It's no wonder ASND won so many Oscars. Blanche is a highly demanding role for any actress and Vivien Leigh steps up to the plate and hits a grand slam with her perfect performance ...and yes, Leigh won the Oscar for Best Actress. Even more amazing is the fact that Leigh is from the U.K. and Blanche is pure Mississippi ex-plantation debutante
