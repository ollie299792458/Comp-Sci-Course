When I saw the Ice Harvest DVD, I was intrigued enough to read the book, since the book is almost always better than the movie, right?  In this case, however, its almost a toss up.  While the movie follows the book pretty closely, the screenplay includes some nice improvements.  Perhaps the best was the relationship between Pete and Charlie.  In the book, they are merely inlaws, but the fact that Pete married Charlie's ex-wife (who they both now despise) is a twist that really adds flavor to the story.  So does the crooked cop who, unwittingly, saves Charlie's bacon. In addition, the "As Witchita Falls, so Falls Witchita Falls" schtick enhances the existential aura of the movie (though it may only make sense if you watch the alternative ending). All in all, the movie has better dialog and sharper edges than the book.

That being said, the book STILL works better than the movie.  Its hard to pinpoint why, but I blame the dark mood of the story.  Dark plots are par-for-the-course in books, but tricky on the big screen (especially during the Holidays--which is probably why it bombed).  The Ice Harvest is no different in this respect.  The Hollywood ending cheers things up a bit, but seems forced and (without spoiling it) a little hard to believe.  The book ending is much more consistent with the rest of the story.  If you look at the alternative endings on DVD, you'll see that something close to the book ending was actually filmed.  No doubt it wasn't used because it would have made the movie more of a downer than it already was.
