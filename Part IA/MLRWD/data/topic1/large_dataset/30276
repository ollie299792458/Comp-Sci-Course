I know this movie is intended for children, but even with that in mind it's still godawful.  I like Julie Andrews, I like Cinderella stories, I like fairy tales and I like kids' movies, so before you leap onto your high horse and defend the movie by saying that I'm just too cynical to enjoy it, you're wrong.

Here's why I didn't enjoy it:

Most of the acting sucks.  With the exception of Andrews, Anne Hathaway and Heather Matarazzo, most of the performances are just plain lousy.  Hector Elizondo appears to be so bored playing one of director Garry Marshall's "nice guy" characters for the umpteenth time, it feels like they used a Hector Elizondo robot for his scenes.

But even the three lead actresses struggle hard to work with a screenplay that boasts some genuinely horrid dialog and a director who seems to think that bugging eyes, screaming and someone falling down every five minutes is the best way to entertain kids.

Garry Marshall has never been a really great director.  He's made some good movies along the way (NOTHING ON COMMON, FRANKIE & JOHNNY, even YOUNG DOCTORS IN LOVE), but most of his movies are uneven, sugary sweet and self-destructively audience pleasing (PRETTY WOMAN, THE OTHER SISTER, EXIT TO EDEN).  I haven't seen every one of his movies, but I can't imagine any are worse that THE PRINCESS DIARIES.  Even the editing is bad, giving the movie a constantly off kilter feel, and not in a good way.

Anne Hathaway has gone on to do some great work since she (wisely) abandoned her typecast-riddled career as a kids' movie actress.  But it pains me to see Julie Andrews reduced to this.  I don't mean starring in a kids' movie.  I mean starring in a terrible movie.
