I was expecting to see the full, unedited version.  Instead, I saw the edited CBS TV version, complete with crimetime after prime time logos, and cbs TV stereo emblems superimposed over the episode.  Dark Knight was heavily edited, I have a more complete version that I taped off of the Sci-Fi channel.  The scene where Nick arrives at the museum and walks up stairs with the cop, sees the suit of armor with the cross and knows Don is there is cut, Nick explaining to Nat about the jade cup in his apartment is gone, Nick with the curator talking about the suit of armor having the wrong bolt-can't relieve himself-cut, the curator leafing through the Alton Kanal book and photo copying Nicks photo is missing the part with Don and Nick in the hospital trying to see the records of blood donors and Nick returning to his Caddy gone, scene after scene is gone.  What a let down after wanting the series to be released for so long..and we have a shorter version that what the Sci-Fi channel aired.  This is like paying the pizza delivery guy, sitting down to eat your pizza, opening the box, and finding two slices missing.  Well I paid for the ENTIRE Forever Knight pie, and I want my missing slices.  This is a RIP-OFF!!!!!  No extras included, unless you count the three commercials for different vampire movies that they want to sell you on DVD as extras.  Are those movies edited versions also???????  THIS IS A RIP-OFF!!!!
