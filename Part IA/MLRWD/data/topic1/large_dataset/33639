This is the worst movie ever. It has been appalingly screen written everyone is totally miscasted. But yet IT IS THE GREATEST FILM!
I simply love this movie despite all it's faults! (but i'm destined to fall head over heals with anything Laurence Olivier has been in!)
Everything in this movie is wrong which is why it is so great, any Jane Austen (eg. myself) should take delight at screaming abuse at the screen as they notice whole scenes cut out and Greer Garson in her massive totally wrong god damn same costumes as Gone with the wind hideous dress saying all her lines unlizziesh (same sets as well from Gone with the wind)
Garson made a pigs dinner of Lizzy, when the part rightfully should of been Vivien Leigh.
I recommend all JA fans buy this and simply all LAURENCE OLIVIER fanatics Buy this, Trust me if you are a JA fan you'll enjoy hurtling abuse at it and if a Laurence Olivier fan dribbling (unless you are a guy in which case i can firmly tell you you are not headrosexual (which may be a good thing or a bad thing))
BUY IT!
