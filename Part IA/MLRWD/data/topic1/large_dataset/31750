I was apprehensive in purchasing this DVD due to some of the negative reviews. Let me tell you it is worth every penny. First lets talk about the DVD. The film transfer is excellent along with the Dolby 5.1 audio. The 16X9 Anamorphic transfer is crisp with no artifacting and true deep blacks.... The 5.1 audio is excellent and is as close to a DTS track as you can get. Now for the movie. It was fast paced, realistic, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Some have stated the plot is not realistic, they should view the supplemental material on the DVD. Most killers believe they can get off the hook with an insanity defense...There have even been cases where convicted criminals have made money off their crimes... This movie is a sad statement about our society today where folks love real life TV like Survivor and Temptation Island. This movie takes it to the next level basically stating that our society is ready to view a real murder regardless of the victim. It really makes one do some soul searching and reassess your values system. This movie is a must see for all!
