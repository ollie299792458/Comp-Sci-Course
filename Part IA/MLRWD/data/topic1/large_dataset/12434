The third season of "Friends" showed that the show had found a comfortable groove, but as the season wore on it seemed as if the writer's were starting to lose some of the spark that made the first two season such successes. Still, Season three gave us some of the most important hallmark epsiodes in the series-- "TOW No One's Ready," classic Friends and is the beginning of the "bottle" epsiode tradition on the show where all six characters were in one room together driving each other crazy; "TOW the Football," a classic Thanksgiving episode where the true dorkiness of the Gellar family is revealed and of course the episodes that marked the beginning of the end (or the beginning of the end of the beginning or something) of Ross and Rachel, "TOW Ross and Rachel Take a Break" and "TOW the Morning After" Schwimmer and Aniston are both so good and so real in these episodes and I remember mourning the loss of the relationship just as much as Ross and Rachel did. Other hysterical episodes from this season include "TOW the Flashback," "TOW Frank Jr.," "TOW the Race Car Bed," "TOW Monica and Richard are Just Friends," "TOW Phoebe's ex partner" and "The One Without the Ski Trip" As I said before the episodes that closed the season didn't seem to have the same punch to them that the earlier ones did and it seemed as if the show was becoming more routine and formulamatic (an impression that quickly dissappears with the next stellar season). The actors are also more comfortable in their roles and are beginning to explore different aspects to their characters. Courteney Cox does a commendable job as Monica tries to deal with her break up from Richard, and Matt LeBlanc gives audiences a preview of what's in store for Joey later in the series, as Joey for the first time actually feels a deep attatchment toward a woman (Kate Miller). Lisa Kudrow is still stellar here as Phoebe continues her struggle to find family (a struggle that ends in an unpredictable way in "TO at the Beach"). Matthew Perry, who I believe was struggling with his addiction at this time,  also shows a different side of Chandler as once committment weary Chandler begins to search for a meaningful relationship. And as mentioned before Schwimmer and Aniston are both so good and real in this season and steal the season with their performances in the episodes dealing with Ross and Rachel's breakup. While the last six episodes or so are not the best in the Friends collection, the season is still worth while and hit some really high points.
