Unbreakable is a superhero "origin" movie about a lone survivor of a train crash who was unscathed in the incident. He is practically unbreakable. He is stalked by a comic-book enthusiast with a condition that leaves his bones extremely fragile and prone to breaking. The comic-book enthusiast, Elijah (played by Samuel L. Jackson), insists that David (played by Bruce Willis) has superhuman powers that makes him unbreakable, and is susceptible to drowning. At first, David believes the man to be a sociopath, but as time passes on, everything Elijah said turned out to be true.

This movie is so much better than The Sixth Sense. Some criticize the movie as "too slow," but I don't find this movie slow at all. Every scene in the movie is essential for character development and to the storyline. Sure, some would say that there were unnecessary and pointless scenes that added little to the film like Bruce Willis going out on a date with his wife, but I disagree. I thought it was important to build on Bruce Willis' character with his wife, with his son, and with Elijah, so these scenes were pivotal to the story.

Nevertheless, the story here is top-notch and the film has amazing cinematography and music. It also has wonderful acting performances from Bruce Willis and, especially, from Samuel L. Jackson. Not to mention, this movie had a better twist ending than The Sixth Sense.

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys mystery thriller films.
