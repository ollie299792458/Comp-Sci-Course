There are two basic requirements to be a fan of this film:  You have to be a Bogart fan, and you have to love the the classic B&W films of the 40's and 50's.  Being a fan of Film Noir is good too, although this one just misses being in that category.  Many younger viewers may pass it up because it isn't color, and not full of CGI SFX, and they would be making a huge mistake!

Bogart (Harry) is at the top of his game in this suspense drama set in Vichy-controlled Martinique just after the fall of France in 1940. Vichy and Nazi agents are crawling all over the place looking for Resistance members and sympathizers.  He runs a worn-out fishing boat for charter, with his alcoholic pal Eddie (Walter Brennan in a superb performance).  When he is stiffed by a rich American client, he gets entangled with a femme fatale pickpocket (Lauren Bacall's first movie role!) who steals the guy's wallet.  Just as he is about to collect, the American is killed by a stray bullet, forcing Bogart to take on a dangerous mission for the local French Resistance.  Complications ensue...

This movie is famous for introducing Lauren Bacall to movie fans. Smart, sassy, statuesque, and beautiful, she turns in one of the best performances ever by a first timer.  The on-screen chemistry between her and Bogey is electric - the air is supercharged and sparks fly between them in every scene!

Walter Brennan, however, almost steals the show from Bogart and Bacall in his role as Eddie, the drunken first mate.  He asks nearly everybody "Have you ever been stung by a dead bee?"  Nobody has the answer except Bacall, and the rest is history.

Next to "Casablanca" and "The Maltese Falcon" this is my favorite Bogart movie.  I've watched it easily a couple dozen times over the years, and it is still as entertaining as the first time.  I highly recommend it as one to add to your personal collection.
