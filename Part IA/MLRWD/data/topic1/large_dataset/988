I am so glad this got a re-release on video!  I have been searching for this movie for years.  Okay, so this one is not the classic that Halloween was but look at the cast... Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, Adrianne  Barbeau, Hal Holbrook, and Nancy Loomis.  It's a mood piece (not too much  happens quickly)...pure and simply put it's just a creepy movie.  But the  scenes with Adrianne Barbeau as a deejay pleading for anybody who can hear  her to help her son "get out of the fog" are worth the price of  the video alone.  It's a wonderfully fun film that any John Carpenter fan  will enjoy!  The signature music is there, and the cinematography is great  too!  It's not your typical "slasher" movie.  THE FOG aspires to  be something more...or maybe something less depending on how you see it.  It opens with a man telling a ghost story around a campfire about a ship of  un-dead lepers exacting their revenge on the inhabitants of a small coastal  town.  Well, that's what this is!  It's a ghost story that you might hear  around a campfire.  Primal and scary, and not really all that gory or  violent.  It's a wise purchase for any horror fans out there!
