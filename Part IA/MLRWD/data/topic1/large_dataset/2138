*BUYER BEWARE!*

For those of you who enjoy or love this film and have been reading the glowing reviews look again, at the fine print. You have been deliberately misled by Amazon into thinking that this IMPORTED release is of the same quality and caliber as previous releases.  It is not the extended version as stated but the theatrical release and not letter-boxed as promoted.  If you want to read reviews for this INFERIOR RELEASE, you have to search through ALL the reviews to find them, well buried.  In effect, you have been deliberately duped, again by Amazon into buying this product based on the reviews of other, superior releases.  And this is not the first time that Amazon has shown its' true colors.

As a film lover and collector, I have seen many times the disreputable, misleading and outright dishonest business practices of this company, time and again.  If you want to buy from Amazon you cannot trust that they will do the right thing and operate in a straight up manner.  You are forced to be wary, carefully read the fine print, the reviews and be on the lookout for inferior offshore product being misrepresented so they can make even bigger profit.
