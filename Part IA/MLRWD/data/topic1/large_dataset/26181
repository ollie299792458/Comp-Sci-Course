"The spy who loved me" is the oddest of Ian Fleming's Bond novels. It is basically the slightly risqu&eacute; (for the time) story of the sexual awakening of a girl, Vivienne Michel (the story is told through her eyes and Fleming even credits her with co-authorship of the book). James Bond? He turns up about half-way through the book to rescue her from a couple of baddies at a motel in which she is working and share his, er, experience of life with her.

So, what has this to do with this film? They have in common the title and a character called James Bond; there all resemblance ends. In this regard, it's a bit like the Fleming Bond short story "Octopussy", which shares the same fate.

The film has thus to stand on its own merits, of which there are precisely none. This is the most appalling hokum, silly story, woodenly acted by Roger Moore (who did once have the honesty to say that his acting talents went all the way from A very nearly to B) and others. Now I know that the Bond films are not really meant to be nerve-tingling thrillers, because you know that our hero and his panoply of ever more absurd gadgets is indestructible and equal to anything, but are more droll comedies with miscellaneous stunts and explosions thrown in, but I didn't find this one funny at all. (Makes solemn resolution never again to watch any more Bonds in which Roger Moore appears).
