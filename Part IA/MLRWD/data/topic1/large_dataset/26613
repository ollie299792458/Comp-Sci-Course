Insanity, passion and sex are the themes for this beautiful but sombering French film.  Betty Blue won a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, but lost to The Assault, from the Netherlands.

This is a story of a handyman, Zorg, (Jean-Hugues Anglade  who is also a struggling writer, and he meets a young girl Betty Blue, played brilliantly by B&eacute;atrice Dalle,

These two lovers are so carefree and passionate, and frontal nudity situations that exclude sex, quite often.  I shouted to the screen.... "can you two put some clothes on once in a while?"  The film starts with their relationship filled with over zealous sex.  For it's time period, and of course being French, there are explicit sex scenes.  As many films do for instant attention, there is an overly lengthy sex scene that opens the movie.

Betty works alongside the handman, first painting houses.  Her fiery temper seems not to endanger anyone, until the story progresses and Betty is considered violent, and extremely dangerous to others and herself.  The mood easily shifts from zany and outrageous adventures to depressing chaotic endangerment.  It takes a while to see the character Betty slowly descend to madness.

The two are as they say... made for each other.  There is a deep bond that shows with the characters as Zorg is determined to stand by his woman.

I love the picturesque and quaint home scenes filled with color and character, plus the outdoors sweeping view.  This is my first movie with director Jean-Jacques Beineix.  There are at least two versions, one being over three hours.
