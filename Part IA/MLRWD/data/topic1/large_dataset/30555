No, this film won't be everyone's cup of tea -- but if you're sick and tired of all the sex, violence, and crude language in today's so-called "family" entertainment, this delightful movie is perfect for a rainy day or relaxed evening with the whole family -- Robert Preston is magnificent as "Professor" Harold Hill, the silver-tongued purveyor of non-existent musical instruments -- He's a flim-flam man whose reputation preceeds him.
 Shirley Jones as the lovely Marian, the rather virginal librarian, and the late Buddy Hackett as the loyal sidekick.
 The movie has something for everyone -- with a great part played by a very young Ron Howard (you might remember him as "OPIE" on the Mayberry,RFD series. This movie was made BEFORE the Mayberry series, so you see Ron Howard in his very first feature film, and the Technicolor shows off Ron's fiery-red hair -- eat your heart out, Justin Bieber !!
 Anyways, it's a great theatrical experience that you can enjoy right in your living room !!
 Don't forget the popcorn !!!
