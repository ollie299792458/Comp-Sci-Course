OK, people, take a breath.  "American Pie" is neither hysterically funny nor hideously raunchy.  It isn't as hilarious as "Porky's" or as disgusting as your average John Waters flick.  It  is instead a pretty run-of-the-mill look at the eternal quest of high  schoolers to get laid on prom night.  
Taken in this context, the movie  is a pretty solid effort.  Jason Biggs is decent as an indecently-stupid  senior doomed to get caught in the most embarassing situations known to  man, whether by his parents, friends, or the entire town via Internet.  Chris Klein is his sensitive dumb jock friend who needs to play down the  sensitivity a bit if he wants to appear less effeminate on celluloid (a  good thing for a heterosexual lead role, Kevin Spacey call your office).  Mena Suvari is the virginal object of his affection, while Allison Hannigan  is simply worthless as a repugnant band chick.  
There are a number of  funny situations along the way, but "American Pie" simply does  not sustain the laughter throughout the film and the climax (as could be  expected the first time) is a letdown.  The pie scene of the title isn't  any funnier nor more disturbing in the uncut version, which of course leads  you to wonder why the censors even bothered in the first place.  
An  inconsequential movie good for a few sophomoric laughs.  3 stars mainly for  the lovely Mena Suvari.
