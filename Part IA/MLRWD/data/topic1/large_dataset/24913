As my title states, I have been living in the New York City Area for all of my life. I have mainly been a resident of Queens until recently, I now live in Staten Island which also makes up one of the five Boroughs of New York City. In all of my years living in Queens, I never even Gave Manhattan a second thought, all I knew was that a lot of people worked there and that it was across the East River and I had to take a train to get there. That all changed on the Day of September 11,2001. It was than that I realized that I would never ever see the North  and South towers again, and it also made me open my eyes and realize that there was such a magnificent, historical and  breathtaking world across that river. I did a lot of research and purchased a lot of books , but NONE have even come close to telling me the history of Manhattan(New York), like these DVDs do. I originally purchased the book and than found out about the DVD box set, and I just had to buy it.I was just so amazed about all the facts that I have learned about New York , such as where all the Names of the Boroughs had come from , that Manhattan was not originally purchased for $24.00. and that the first settelers were from Huguenot, which the name is now of the town in Staten Island where I live.I do try to get to Manhattan as often as I can now,to make up for all the lost time. I can not say enough about this box set that has not already been said.I think the total running time is around 14 hours , and they are just filled with such interesting facts and people that are too many to mention in this small review. I will always treasure them , because they have allowed me to open up and explore a world that I never knew existed across the river. It makes me proud to say that I live in THE GREATEST city in the wrold !!!!! THANKS RIC BURNS
