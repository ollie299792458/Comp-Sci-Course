This was the very first John Woo movie I ever saw. After that, I never looked at movies in the same way. This film is jam-packed with so much energy and excitement, it promises an experience that most movies rarely ever deliver(especially in the action genre).  It's just that good.  I don't want to ruin the movie for you, so I won't go into the plot much, but I will go into why it is so great.  First off, it's directed by John Woo, who is the very best director to come out of Hong Kong.  To him, a gunfight is not merely people standing around, shooting at each other; instead, it's a graceful, almost beautiful dance of death. Woo knows that the key to great action sequences is objects in motion, and he packs true emotions into them(just as all the great directors have done).  Secondly, it has Chow Yun-Fat in the lead, as the tough super-cop, Tequila.  Chow is an outstanding actor, and delivers his usual tough-guy performance as the gunslinging antihero; toothpick in his mouth, twin 45's blazing.  But, like all of the great action stars, there's more to it than that, and Chow brings something to the role that few other actors could. And lastly, Chow's costar is Tony Leung, a cold hitman who is more than he seems.  It's hard to outshine somebody like Chow Yun-Fat, but Tony Leung almost does. His performance is beyond words, and it's where most of the movie's moral themes are derived from. In closing, Hard-Boiled is the best action movie ever.  It's story may not be as complex as some of Woo's other masterpieces, but it's still better than almost any other action film.  And the action set-pieces are the best ever committed to the silver-screen. So do yourself a favor and see this movie. Now.
