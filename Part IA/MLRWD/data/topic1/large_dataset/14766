This movie is Jet Li's first lead role in an english language film and hopefully many more will follow.  Romeo must die has an ok plot, good acting and great fight scenes.
Romeo must die is a martial arts version of, as if the title wasn't a dead give away, Romeo and Juliet.  In this movie, Han (Jet Li) escapes from prison in Hong Kong and comes to the US only to find his brother murdered.  While searching for his brothers murderer, he accidentally bumps into Trish (Aaliyah), who just happens to be the daughter of his father's primary rival.
Jet Li plays an excellent little tough guy.  He is neither as wooden as Chou Yun Fat or as goofy as Jackie Chan.  He is, however, an excellent martial artist and a pleasure to watch in action.  Beyond being a great entertainer, Aaliyah's acting is also credible and she is absolutely beautiful.  There is obvious on screen chemistry between the two, however, it is never developed in the film.
The supporting cast also make solid contributions to the movie.  In particular Anthony Anderson makes a great funny man as Maurice.  Russel Wong is an accomplished martial artist that helps Jet Li to showcase his talents.
The DVD is a good buy.  The film looks good, the sound is excellent (a little too much bass) and it has an excellent sound track.  There are lots of interesting extras on the DVD.  I don't particularly care for the "making of" documentaries that come with most DVDs because they are little more than extended commercials.  Fortunately on this DVD, the music videos are good and the special effects featurettes are interesting.
