One day I turned to Cartoon Network, and Toonami was showing (and The Big-O on it, of course), so I started watching it, and I liked it, though not enough to buy it, although, I really wasn't buying much of anything back then. But, anyway, it started appearing on Adult Swim quite the while back, and so a 1 year a half ago, maybe a spec less, I decided to buy it, since I saw it again, and fell in love with it. And though, it may seem like a kiddy show, it's FAR from it. It's EXTREMELY complex and also quite religious. I know, I know... It has the Batman: Animation Theme from it and everything, and I did, and still do love it, "The Big-O" is MANY, MANY times better than it. I really love the dark themes to both shows, especially in Big O; it's absolutely great. Actually... I'd say without it's such dark themes, it wouldn't be as good. Anyway... What you need to know is that this Anime is one of the best out there, and by far, and therefore, I say that you should at the very least, try it. Now, let's give it my age rating, and wrap up this little review; 15+ (Violence, Minor Profanity, Sexual Situations, and Adult Complex Themes). There ya go. I'll be writing more reviews... Hoped they can help you out.
