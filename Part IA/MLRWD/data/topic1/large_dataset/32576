Another reviewer did an awesome comparison to "Pretty in Pink" and they were right on the money.  A great side-by-side compare and contrast.  I had never thought of "Some Kind of Wonderful" this way.

When this movie came out, I think I saw it in the movie theater 3-4 times before I actually owned it on VHS and more recently DVD.  It is one of my favorite movies of all time because I always identified with Watts' character (and was told by friends in the 80's about the reminder).  If you are a lover of the 80's John Hughes genre of films you will love this one.  The characters are played out well and the storyline is very sweet.  You can really feel the teenage angst between Mary Stuart Masterson "Watts" and Eric Stolz "Keith" as a best-friendship works towards something more.  Many of the actors and actresses in "Some Kind of Wonderful" have gone on to bigger careers and also recur in other John Hughes films.

After 20+ years, this still remains one of my favorite movies.  A must for every John Hughes groupie.
