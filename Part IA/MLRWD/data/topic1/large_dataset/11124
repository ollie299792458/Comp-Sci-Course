There was alot of hype for this movie but it just didn't live up to expectations.  While it had a great plot and such an excellent cast, the potential was there but it just lacked something.  The ohio and mexican scenes were filmed with a hazy yellow or blue lighting (done for artistic merit or whatever) were annoying and every monologue spoken by the characters was really slow and dragged out, very little emotion was shown through the movie,  which I found especially odd considering the heavy subject matter.  It was also a bit unrealistic, for example the daughter goes from being an honour roll etc. student who does drugs recreationally to very suddenly running away from rehab to living on the streets and sleeping with her drug dealer for heroin.  And of course this missed what could have been a great part in the movie, by showing what its REALLY like for people to do heroin (as in the after effects, not just the getting high part).  
Alot of the movie relied on "shock value" by things that just weren't very shocking at all, like the upper class prep school kids doing drugs, the well respected business man being the drug lord and the mexican general who was trying to put an end to the drug smuggling really working for the rival cartel.  And none of these "revelations" were very suprising at all.  This movie was a typical drug war movie with no new material at all.
