I want to state that some people who are talking about the first part of the movie being boring....well, It is called THE FUNHOUSE, what do you expect? you expect them to start out in the house at the beginning of the film? This film was awesome. It covered about everything a carnival back in the 80s had. Freakshows, the classic carnival rides, and of course the nasty bathrooms you had to see everytime you go to a carnival LOL. I was just amazed how they jampacked a night at a carnival in about 30mins before the beginning of terror in the funhouse. Take final destination 3 for example. I was expecting A lot of carnival fun and not just jump right in to the roller coaster scene after 10mins. As a kid I loved the lights and rides at the carnival and Tobe Hooper put you right in to one which is rare that there has ever been a horror movie involving a REAL carnival except the movie "rollercoaster". If I am not mistaken, thats about it.

Maybe that is not of a crowds interest and people wants to jump to the killing part but this has a great story to it!
