Lindsay, where are you? The lead actress of this wretched excuse for entertainment lacked everything that made Lindsay Wagner a star in her day; charisma, presence, beauty that emanates not simply from her hairdo but from her very spirit, and an extraordinary sense of down-to-earth intelligence and charm. The only thing that I can applaud about this horrid reboot is the fact that they tried it at all; that studio execs realized the potential of the concept and tried to give it a chance as a modern dramatic series. Unfortunately, it fails. In my opinion, it fails primarily because the lead is not a strong enough actress, nor has the star power of a Lindsay Wagner. If, for some amazing reason, the woman who played this part ever reads this, I am sorry if what I am saying offends.... perhaps you just weren't suited for this role, and you are amazing in other things. Maybe it's unfair to compare you to Ms. Wagner. Maybe you were directed poorly. Regardless, this show does not work on multitudinous levels, and the performances are a big part of that.
