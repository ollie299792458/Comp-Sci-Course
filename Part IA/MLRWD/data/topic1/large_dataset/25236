Something has gone seriously wrong with the encoding of the film. The image suffers from some sort of interlacing effect. Whenever sharp, vertical edges move on screen, the edges fan out into horizontal lines that seem to pulsate. This effect renders the film unwatchable during virtually all tracking and panning shots. The special features disk seems to be unaffected by this problem. The "making of" featurette has scenes from the film that appear to be from the new transfer, and they do not suffer from this effect. For instance, the cut from the "every sperm is sacred" number when the men open the doors of the lavatories is crisp and clean at the beginning of the "making of" featurette. But in the film, the movement of the men suffers greatly from the interlacing effect. The net effect of this problem is a total disaster. Universal had better recall the first disk and issue replacement copies ASAP.
As for the special features, the "making of" featurette was good, containing a mix of archival and contemporary interviews from the Pythons. The gag features that litter the disk did not seem that funny to me, and I am a longtime MPFC fan. The deleted scenes are a nice addition to the dvd. I am glad to see them, though in the end, I think it best that they were deleted from the final cut of the film. Terry Jones talks over some of the dialogue in a commentary on the scenes that serves as the only audio option for these items. I'm glad to have the commentary, but I wish I could turn it off.
Given how nice of a job the Pythons did with the Holy Grail dvd, this one is a bit of a disappointment, featurewise, and a disaster given the encoding problems that render the film unwatchable. I sure hope that the encoding problems get fixed. I waited quite a while for this set to be released. I do not look forward to returning it and waiting for a replacement version.
