There are a couple reasons I took off one star here:

1.  It is yet again another condemnation of women who are not absolutely drop dead gorgeous.  It features plain, fat, average-looking guys ending up with absolutely gorgeous women.  The double standard here is hard to miss, and disappointing.  The only thing that makes it tolerable is that it is somewhat central to the storyline.

2.  Once we get past the rather clever Cyrano De Bergerac and Pygmalion references, it goes into the realm of Prometheus in its creation of romantic relationships.  One would think that up until that point, Hitch has never had a disappointed client, which implies that men will absolutely love their partner if they get the right coaching.  None of these relationships will fall prey to what ended up happening to Hitch.

That's it.  Those are the only things wrong with the movie.  It is a fun romantic comedy which starts off very cleverly, and then devolves into a standard formula driven romantic comedy.  I enjoyed it, but had problems with numbers 1 and 2 above.
