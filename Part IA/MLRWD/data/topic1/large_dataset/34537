Adapted from the Jim Thompson novel of the same name, "The Getaway" script was originally suggested to McQueen by his then wife, Neile as a strong action vehicle to please McQueen's fans looking for Steve to play another moody, rebellious anti-hero. 
And a good choice it was....controversial director Sam Peckinpah again produced his unique chemistry with this violent, fast moving film about Texas bank robber Carter "Doc" McCoy (McQueen) paroled from prison with the help of corrupt politician Jack Benyon (Ben Johnson). McCoy and his wife Carol (MacGraw) must then rob a bank for Benyon with the assistance of Rudy Butler &amp; Frank Jackson (Al Lettieri &amp; Bo Hopkins). However, an intended double cross is soon evident and Doc &amp; Carol McCoy are then running for their lives to Mexico with $750,000 in stolen money, with the injured Rudy Butler, and Jack Benyons vicious henchmen in hot pursuit.
And those on screen sparks between McQueen &amp; MacGraw are real, contributed to by their torrid off-screen romance that would eventually see them become husband and wife !
McQueen was at his on-screen toughest since his role in "Bullitt"(1968) and certain scenes (such as where McCoy shoots up a police car with a pump action shotgun in slow motion) were inserted at Steve's request, because he felt that's what his fans wanted to see !!
The quality of this DVD is very good, with only some minor dissapointments in the sound area. If you are a McQueen fan...then "The Getaway" DVD definitely belongs in your collection !
