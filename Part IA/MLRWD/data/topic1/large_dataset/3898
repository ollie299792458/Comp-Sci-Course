From stuffing chocolates in her mouth to tearfully telling Ricky they are expecting a baby, Lucy has kept me glued to the set.  She is truly the Queen of Comedy.  This DVD set is fully restored and plays beautifully.  The sound quality and the picture itself is superb! I own a couple of Lucy shows on VHS, but they don't hold a candle to this boxed set.

  One pro for me is that I have often wanted to see all the I Love Lucy shows. It frustrated me that they only came out with The Most Memorable, and Most Classic episodes. It was by chance that I stumbled upon this website and noticed the complete Season.  I was surprised that I had never found this before, but then again, I rarely shop on the internet. It was esciting that I had finally found wha I had been longing for.

  I never tire of watching Lucy's crazy antics. They are as new to me as they were when I first watched them. This edition is packeged in a smooth, efficient manner. If you truly love Lucy, then I would definantly reccomend this dvd set. Enjoy!
