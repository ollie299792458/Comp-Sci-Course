I'm still not quite sure why David Mamet used a pseudonym in the credits, but the movie absolutely drips with his rhythms of speech. It complements the action well, otherwise the movie would be a bore outside of the car chases. The unique element is the band of mercenaries who cannot trust each other long enough to complete their mission. The cast is great: De Niro and Jonathan Pryce are Mamet veterans. Jean Reno is quite at home playing the Jean Reno character. Natasha McElhone is painfully beautiful, and one of the most capable actresses working today. She more than holds her own with the boys. But the movie's greatest strength isn't the actors or Mamet's hypnotic chit-chat, but Frankenheimer's car chases, which are "au natural". Nobody working with digital effects has generated the same level of excitement and realism, no matter what genre. The European locations are great, the cars are great, and the characters are well-rounded. Oh, and we've got a suitcase filled with who-knows-what, a la "Pulp Fiction."
