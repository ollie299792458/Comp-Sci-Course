This quite dire entry of the friday the 13th film when it first arrived did seem dull and a slap to the faces of all friday fans, with the lack of Hockey-mask Jason Vorhee's and the extreme lack of gore the film seems quite forgotten. Years ago i got a copy off the unrated laserdisc, and i got to review it again after its initial let down. WHY THE HELL DID I HATE IT, it's slick, the beginning and ending with Jason also stunning, it's well directed and acted and aside potholes (with a story about an inner demon crawling beteen bodies is bound to have a few) the script is pretty good, but the extra gore... those teens shahgging in the tent, well she is split in half front on view and there is nasty haead crushings and arm splittings all over the top gore with top special effects. now if anyone cares go hunt down VERSUS by ryuhei Kitamura cause it is the best gorefest since The Convent (which wasn't all that gory but did kick ass)! get this dvd if you just wanted more gore for jason, wish "family" paramount would release the others uncut, oh and jason X is great on DVD looks so better thabn even at the cinema you can get it in spain if you are impatient.
