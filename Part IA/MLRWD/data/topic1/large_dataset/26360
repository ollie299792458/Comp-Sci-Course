All I can say is WOW! A low-budget film similar to Creature from the Black Lagoon but with its own special story. The creatures I thought looked amazing even though there were only 3 costumes made. These creatures particularly hunt women and not for feeding but for pleasure. The story is outrageous and so is the ending that is very similar to Alien. The acting was pretty good as well as the violence and gore. One of my favorite scenes involved a ventriloquist dummy and two teenagers on the beach. The two lovers are interrupted by a lone humanoid who immediately kills the boy but the woman escapes and runs across the beach fully nude only to run into another humanoid. Another scene includes the humanoids attacking at a carnival. Special features include a Making of... featurette, deleted scenes, and a booklet. It seems they forgot a commentary but that isn't much of a setback. The DVD comes with awesome reversible cover art including the international Monster art which I loved. 5 stars.
