I must say that part of my problem with this film was that it was so dark.  Not subject matter only, but the actual lighting of the film  Now I know that there was not electric light in mid-19th century French villages and not in Japan either.  But, I actually was peering at the screen trying to make some of it out.

I have not read the book and so am basing my remarks simply on the movie.  I do not understand the life-changing attraction between Herve and the concubine.  They hardly look at one another, do not share any words, know nothing about one another and yet yearn to be together.  Was it just the excitement of someone new, or the allure of someone exotic?  For an oriental woman who belongs to someone else to write "Come back or I shall die", there has to be some major reason.  Maybe we are to assume it was just love at first sight?

How did Helene know about the concubine?  In one scene, she and Herve are making love and she is crying.  Is it because she cannot conceive a child, or does she feel that something has changed with Herve?  I will say that the twist in the plot regarding the long letter was interesting and touching.
