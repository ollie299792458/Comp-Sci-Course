I'm sorry to be a little sexist in this review, but Repulsion is scarier to view when you're a woman. I just want to add a little something to these reviews that I think is lacking. Polanski loves to play with our minds, particularly within films such as The Tenant and Rosemary's Baby, but Repulsion, I believe, is/was aimed at scaring the pants off of (then) recently sexually liberated women. Catherine Deneuve was obviously chosen for her 60's modelesque charm, representing the ideal beautiful woman of the sixties. The scene involving the only real male she comes in contact with signals to us that this woman is not all there - but is she to blame? Or is she right in wanting to run from a sexually charged, awkward situation? These are the questions we keep asking as we are dragged into this psychological thriller. Yes, it's scary to think that any one of us could spiral out of control given a length of time within a dark desolate apartment. But to be a female who feels as though she is being physically tortured by dark masculine figures, that's a little jarring and a little more personal. For these reasons, Repulsion left me feeling scared because so many women might come in contact with these demons more than they lead on. Some might say that Polanski is misogynistic for creating such films, but misogynistic or not, he's a genius for being able to terrify by using the mind against itself.
