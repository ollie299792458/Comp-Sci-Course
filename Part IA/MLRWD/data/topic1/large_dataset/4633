I feel too small to do this but its by way of tribute. When Mr. Fellini made this film, Europe was still recovering from the war. But, most importantly, from the great challenge that Hitler and Facism had posed to human existance: that anyone who did not contribute something to society did not have a right to live. With this film Mr. Fellini masterfully answers this challenge, exposing it for the lie that it is. "Il Matto" put the answer into words when consoling the heart broken Gelsomina. She felt she was worthless but he explains that,of course she has worth because she is a creature of God and He has a purpose for her. What purpose? she asks the clown, to which he deftly answers that if he knew that he would be God. Yet Mr. Fellini dares to answer what the clown could not by making us love each of the characters, even the brutal Zampano. This is a victorious film. It declares in inarguable terms that our worth is not a result of wealth or what service we render to society but of the love of God. The fact that many, even "macho" types, are moved to tears, mourning over these loved ones, demonstrates the truth of what Mr. Fellini has conveyed in "La Strada".
