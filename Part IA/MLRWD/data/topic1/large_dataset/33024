Voyager remains the best series ever produeced as a star trek title. Perhaps it is a personal taste, but I can't help but be drawn the the tales of the lost crew. Each of the crew seem to possess a unique passion, and by god the passions are very noble ones. The captain's obsessiveness of the caring of her crew, chakotay's unwieldly humor, tom paris's passion for flight and science fiction, the dotor's fine appreciation for music. Many parts of the episodes seem to echo a similiar passion in my own heart, and I can't help but smile profounddly as I watch the series.

Season six, like five , have some of the best episodes, intertwined with some less interesting, but nevertheless worthwhile ones.  The doctor has a few debuts as an opera star in 2 episodes and you can listen to him sing like a pro, "the blink of an eye" tells of a planet where an entire civilization evovles from stone age to primitive space ships right in front of your eyes, (especially good if you're an Civilizations fan). Tom paris's "Alice" is a space ship that talks and falls in love with you, and you with her, it makes you want to grab hold of a joystick and play one of your favorite fight simulation games right after you've seen the sexy space shuttle.
