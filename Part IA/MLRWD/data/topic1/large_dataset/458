I'll be brief..

Like many of you, I expected the worst going into this film based on the ratings.  But hey, how many times do you see a great film that got bad reviews?..too many to count!

I also have been a huge fan of Vince and John since the beginning. And, I adore Jennifer. They all have wonderful comedic timing and the ability to cause you to care about their characters.  They are believable in this film!!  Supporting cast was wonderfully chosen( yes I realize they are all friends).  How did you all enjoy seeing the guy from "A Christmas Story?"

I thought this film was really brave.  And I think that people in today's society cannot handle the truth about themselves.  This movie probably made a number of people do some soul searching.  Those who really watched and understood this film probably saw a piece of their lives on the screen.  I know I did.  There are some important life lessons to be learned from the relationship between Brooke and Gary.  Unfortunately, the people who need to learn those lessons are too busy criticizing others and overrating their participation in society!

The ending was very bold move...how you left may say if you are a glass half full or half empty type.  I left very grateful that I married a real man!!
