Alice visits Wonderland as a child and grows up believing it as just a dream before it calls to her again, this time seeking a Champion to free Wonderland from the Tyranny of the Red Queen and regain the crown for the White Queen. While in the original story, the Jabberwoky was rather different, in some variations he is depicted as a dragon-like creature, so this is not new. The Red Queen has always been depicted as a tyrant,and it can be assumed that she might consider extending her reign during the time of Alice's absence from Wonderland. People tend to forget that Fairy Tales are not all sweetness and light, some can be extremely dark and this story focuses on this aspect as it mirrors Alice's dilemma in real life as a free spirit  who finds her life literally scoped out for her in a stiflingly arranged situation to a weak milquetoast nobleman. It is in Wonderland that she discovers her power as she reluctantly accepts the challenge of killing the Jabberwocky and takes over her own life once she reemerges from the rabbithole to reality and refuses to play the faceless wife while seeking a new destiny. This movie was beautiful without being "cutesy". It depicted Wonderland as more of a nightmare and the Hatter was a wild wonderful mad catalyst to spark Alice's discovery of self. It was dark, but there were still elements of fun and I found the movie enjoyable overall as different from other stories. I can accept this as Alice's last venture into Wonderland as a wild dark romp as Alice seeks to save the friends she made over the times she had visited before before leaving Wonderland forever to take up adventuring for real.
