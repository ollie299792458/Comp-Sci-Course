Hey "Who" Fans! I count myself as one of your brood, and I have to speak up about this DVD.

We all know that there are going to be 4 specials for this unofficial "Season 5" of Dr. Who (the last episode being a two-part show, shown around Christmas 2009 in the UK). So, we can only assume that at some point all 4 shows will be included in their own DVD set. Buying individual episodes sends the wrong message to the BBC. We DON'T want to shell out cash for one-offs -- give us some value for our money.

And if any BBC execs are reading this, how about throwing in the animated "Dreamland" to any upcoming 2009 Episodes DVD set? It would be a really nice include.

And to the fella' on this review list who thought that "The Next Doctor" was part of this series of specials, sorry -- if the BBC holds true to their prior DVD releases, then THAT episode will be included in the release of next season's box set. Just look at how they packaged seasons 2 through 4. The previous year's Christmas Special was always included in the following season's DVD box set.
