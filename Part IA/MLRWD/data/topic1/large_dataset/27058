I first saw Baraka because the DVD was included as a promotion with my parents' DVD player. I had never heard of the movie before that. The first time I watched it, I was transfixed. Now I watch the movie every couple months or so. It trully is an experience, and I find that the lack of narrative (and narration) actually adds to the movie's re-watchability, because you don't feel like you're treading over information or story that you're already so familiar with. I just received my copy of the special edition anamorphic version, and what I've seen of it on my high-def TV is just astounding.

It seems the most common complaint is that there is no context provided to the scenes. Initially I did try to think about where the various scenes were and what was going on. However, I've found that if you stop trying to think about the intellectual details of the scenes, only then do you begin to truly *experience* them.

Granted, this movie is not for everyone, but I suggest that everyone see it at least once.
