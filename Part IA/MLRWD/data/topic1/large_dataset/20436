This is a winner.

Charlie Brown gets roped into preparing a Thanksgiving dinner by a pushy Peppermint Patty who invites herself and a few friends over to "Chuck's" place for the holiday meal.  Time constraints restrict Chuck to a haphazard snack of pretzels and popcorn - great football food, but not for a festive holiday get-together.  Peppermint Patty, Marcie and Franklin all make their debuts into the Peanuts animations on this.

Linus explains the origin of Thanksgiving as a feast initiated by Pilgrims and Indians for the purpose of giving thanks - a fact reiterated by Marcie after Patty rebukes poor Chuck for the food preparations.  Great message.

An added bonus is the Mayflower in which the cartoon does not softsoap the hardships of the Pilgrims in their quest for a new opportunity for religious freedom in an unknown land that at times was quite unforgiving.  Also explains the role a few native Americans had in helping these people.  I certainly learned something new from this.

And, for the football fans, you can play this DVD for the kids during the NFL games' halftime stuff.
