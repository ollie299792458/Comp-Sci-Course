In the late 60's and early 70's. There was a constant flow of really great movies coming out of the "new hollywood". Directors were able to push the envelope and create works of realistic and character rich films with original themes. The movies weren't copycat.

This movie stands out because of the consistently excellent work from it's actors. Lee Marvin was at this point by all accounts a leading man and Ernest Borgnine was at the very top of his game. It had been almost 20 years since he had won his Oscar for "Marty" (1955). He had developed to become an incredibly nasty character actor that I really miss in todays market. In this movie his role is played with such conviction that when I saw this movie in the mid 70's in my small hometown theater. It haunted me for weeks and I never forgot it.

Today, I'm a musician and the musical backdrop for most of this film is horrible. It is peppy and anthemic when it should be like a slow moving frieight train that is filled with sadistic conductors and homeless, desperate men with nothing to lose.

Otherwise this story is terrific entertainment.
