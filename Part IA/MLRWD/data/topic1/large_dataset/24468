Under a careful and loving baton mastered by James Levine, Marilyn Horne excels in her portrayal of Isabella, main character in "L'Italiana in Algieri", this early comic masterpiece by Gioachino Rossini, not as brilliant as "Barbiere di Siviglia" which would come later, but nevertheless ingenious, funny, and a great vehicle for a star mezzo.
Horne's interpretations of "Cruda sorte" and "Pensa alla patria" are alone worth the price of the dvd. She also looks great which was not always true due to an occasional overweight. Her figure in this 1986 register was in great shape.
Paolo Montarsolo comes through with his Mustaf&aacute; even if his timbre is not very pleasant. Buffos Fernando Corena and Spiro Malas --who sings Haly in this performance-- were, I feel, more effective in the role.
The rest of the cast is only sufficient and perhaps one could say not up to the Met standards. We can only take a look at the 2004 Met's cast for "L'Italiana in Algieri" of Borodina, Fl&oacute;rez and Furlanetto to stress this point.
However, Marilyn Horne and Levine make this register a very enjoyable one.
