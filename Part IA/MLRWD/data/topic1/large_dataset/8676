I'm going to review this movie in two parts; because that's how it seemed to play. (The s&eacute;ance scene is where I separate the two.)
The first part is as frightening as anything I've seen since the Exorcist. It's that creepy. The second half turns, for some reason, into part "Suspiria", part Amusement Park spook ride. This abrupt change of direction doesn't kill the thrill or detract from of the overall pace of the film but, it does downgrade it from a "perfect 10" to solid 8. Maybe 9.

Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell, who collaborated on both Saw (2004) & Dead Silence (2007), struck horror gold on this one. It's the kind of horror film that's best viewed alone and at night with the lights out if you can brave it. (As most of the great ones are)

Not at all a blood bath and without the stereotypical scantily clad teens in distress, this PG13, 103 min creep-fest takes the viewer on a ride that will leave you turning your lights on to get safely to bed.

The first half is a totally original haunted house spine tingling journey in and of itself and than you are catapulted into a dream like state of horrific illusion and visual Menagerie.

Drawling from "Poltergeist", "The Sixth Sense" and "The Changeling", Insidious is destined to achieve it's deserved position in the top horror films of history.
