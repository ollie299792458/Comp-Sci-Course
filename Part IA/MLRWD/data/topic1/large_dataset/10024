Before ever viewing the outrageous comedy with a star studded line-up in "Old School," I went in with an open mind, not expecting to be blown away, but only expecting to simply "like" it.  I felt like any movie starring Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn is at least worth watching.  Within the first 5 minutes of the movie I had cracked my first laugh, a subtle laugh that seems to be ongoing through out the entire film.

The basic storyline of the movie is about one of three middle aged men who moves directly onto a college campus into a house that would soon become one of the biggest party houses the college had ever seen.  The house is later threatened to be rezoned by the university because it is not providing for the school in any way.  The three men then decide to form a fraternity, which leads to a series of outrageous and hilarious events that all the members of the fraternity experience.  The movie never loses interest; there is funny part after funny part, and even a couple of guest star appearances.

"Old School" is hands down one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen.  The star studded lineup adds a lot to this movie and makes it that much more entertaining for me personally because I recognize each of the characters from different movies or shows.  There are non-stop hilarious scenes from the movie, the laughs just never stop.  I would recommend this outrageous comedy above any other, I guarantee you wont find a dull moment.  It is a movie that can easily be seen more than once, and will leave you with more and more laughs each time you see it.
