If there were ever a time to love Harrison Ford, it is through his performance in this movie. He's the HARD BOILED EGG of an anchorman with a soft golden yolk heart that he has kept under wraps for years; and it takes the frisky energy and boundless belief of McAdams to finally crack his hard shell and set this Lovable Curmudgeon free. Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton are the reasons that I purchased this DVD. I could watch this movie once a week, and still laugh out loud at their pairing and their exchange of barbed insults. Yes, McAdams is puppy-dog cute & frisky, her love interest is hunky; but it's the repartee, those mild insults both on and off camera that Ford and Keaton sweetly hurl at each other ["It's hard to get between you and a sausage...], that spice up this script. Accolades,as well, to superb Jeff Goldblum as the Big Man Upstairs, who carries himself with aplomb; in fact accolades to the Casting Director for each and every character placed in his or her role. The cast is empathetic, believable and lovable. It's Ford and Keaton who make this script fly! Note Ford's catharsis at the end of the film; his sudden realization that, "Yes,"  he can be a hard-core Anchor Man AND an approachable human at the same time. A great story line; great performances by the entire cast!
