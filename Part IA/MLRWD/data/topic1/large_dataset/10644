I really loved this movie. It's pretty unlike how most movies are in that the characters seem to be real people. They look like regular people (meaning, don't have a ton of make-up on, don't wear unrealistically glamorous clothing,etc). It helped make the film seem genuine. Ryan Gosling barely even looks like himself.

The story itself is beautiful as well as uncomfortable. The fact that this guy walks around with a sex doll (which he never seems to use for what it was intended because she is religious and they can't sleep together, according to him), and seems to have a complete relationship with her definitely will make you uncomfortable...at least for him.

I had a friend say about this movie: "Amazing movie with second-hand embarassment all over the place". I think that pretty much sums it up. It's weird, it's different, but it's so touching how the community embraces this doll for the sake of Ryan Gosling's character and his mental health.

Just give the movie a chance!
