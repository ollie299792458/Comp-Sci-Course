The Usual Suspects is a real treat for movie lovers who enjoy film noir and caper movies. The Oscar-winning screenplay and the excellent cast makes every scene rich with texture. I put my DVD player on "shuffle play" and let the scenes come up in any order - you'll see what I mean. One of my main measures for buying a DVD is how often I watch it, and you have to watch this a number of times just to appreciate all that goes on. It also takes a few passes to figure out what the heck Benicio del Toro's character is even saying in the semi-intelligible voice he has chosen. It's throwaway humor, but you've go to dig to find it. I loved it.
It's an exciting thiller and it's so FUNNY without breaking the mood. Many of the jokes are only understood in retrospect, though, making repeat viewing mandatory. Kevin Spacey is always aces, but he earns his Oscar as he introduces us to the story of Keyser Soze - a new name that everyone will know. Second best movie of the 90's - right behind LA Confidential.
Okay - that was the old review - I've since bought the special edition, and I highly recommend it. Deleted scenes and the blooper reel are so-so, but the discussions with the actors are fascinating, as is the trip to the Cannes film festival. Best bits were the discussions of the infamous lineup and the other actors' comments about Benicio's intentionally unintelligible dialogue.
P.S. - I just recently caught the movie on network TV, where they overdubbed "Give me the keys, you fairy godmother." And some people will wonder what all the buzz was about.
