First off, if you're looking for a comedy with a thick and rich plot, you won't find it here.  However, if you just want to have a good time and "be goofy," then you'll love this movie.  This movie is chock full of parodies, spoofs, and hilarious characters that could easily compare with "Saturday Night Live" or the "Simpsons".  If you're a fan of Weird Al's music, you'll enjoy it even more.  You needn't listen to the comments of the critics who mostly attacked this movie back in the '80s.  They practically get payed to dislike movies, and in my experience, most comedies well received by critics are, overall, not nearly as funny as the really bizarre, satirical movies of this sort.  Anyways, UHF is a really good movie, and if you were planning on spending [alot of money] for a used tape of it, now you have a chance to get for a much more reasonable price. Plus, according to Weird Al's Website, it will be a Collector's Edition with lots of extras.  The DVD is DEFINITELY coming out this summer.  Enjoy!
