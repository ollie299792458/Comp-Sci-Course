you know, quite honestly, i didn't want to see this film at all when i first went to the theater, but it was my grandma's birthday, and she wanted to see it, so i went.  and i am also a huge film critic - i criticize everything that goes wrong in a film.

but honestly, i thought last holiday was an absolutely amazing film.  yes, there were small holes in it, a few problems, and a lot of things were done to the extreme, but it hink that's what makes it such a heartwarming film.  the message of the film is a huge one that i think many people, if they actually chose to follow, might find their life taking a turn for the fantasical.

you don't see as many movies out anymore that send out such a positive message to the individual, encouraging them to take on life and live wholeheartedly.  most movies concentrate on the smaller things in life, and i was very excited to see that this one gives you a much broader picture.

i was very impressed by queen latifah, considering the only other thing i'd seen her in was chicago.  i instantly liked her character, especially as the movie went on.  i think i spent the entire movie with a huge (i'm not kidding here) grin on my face.  it was so exciting to see a movie that, in spite of a few small cinematic problems, managed to pull off a beautiful, heartwarming film.

i think i'd have to say that this movie has wedged it's way into my heart as one of my all-time favorite films.  i know that when i comes out on dvd i will buy it to remind me when times are tough, just how precious life is and how good we can make it.  at the very least - it will put a huge grin on my face.
