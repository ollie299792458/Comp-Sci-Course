In 1989, this movie suffered from several problems that were unique to this particular film, but one thing is shared with later Trek films was a diminished budget. Paramount never really believed in Star Trek's staying power until the Next Generation was a hit. After that, Trek could do no wrong, and Paramount couldn't be swayed from supporting dismal outings like Voyager or Star Trek: Insurrection. Before they saw the light though, they kept cutting the budgets. Maybe they felt they better be careful just in case Trek really WAS a fad after over 20 years of fervent devotion by fans. Because of the budget's shrinkage, and the actors' fees swelling, there was less and less money that found its way onto the screen (The point of making a film)! To cut corners, they crossed off ILM from FX duties, and went to a smaller, cheaper vendor for this film. They did a good job, with the budget they had to work with. Truly. But after seeing some pretty wonderful stuff in the previous 4 pictures, I came away feeling a bit disappointed. The Final Frontier looked a little flat and phony. New FX wont fix all the flaws with this picture, but it would go a long way toward making this Trek one that could stand tall with the rest of the films. Be a good marketing move on Paramounts' part, too. How about it guys? How much could it cost? You let bunch of computer geeks fool with Star Trek I, and that picture didnt even NEED any help! ILM could probably bang out a whole batch of new FX in an afternoon, if they didnt stop for coffee breaks.
