What a great musical. It has everything as far as I am concerned. I watch it at least once a year. This particular verson is great. The acting is great. The singing is great. And, the story is a classic. Tevye the Dairyman is played brialliantly by Topal. You can't go wrong with this purchase.

Watching this film finally led me to wonder who had written such a great story and developed the character of Tevye. I wondered if it was the play producers and song writers or some writer. I had never heard of Sholom Aleichem. He is the creator of Tevye the Dairyman. I read the book. The character in the musical is an excellant portrayal of the character described in Sholom Aleichem's book. I am now reading another book by the same author "The Adventures of Mottel." Tevye is a writer's creation - and quite a creation this Tevye is. We can't forget the writers of all these great classics.

The songs written by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick are classics also. After watching it you will be humming "If I Were a Rich Man" for at least a week. This is a keeper. It can be watched and enjoyed over and over. It is worth every penny and I'm a penny watcher.

My wife and her sister watched it with me for their first time. Both of them were unfortunately unfamiliar with the history. It was interesting to field their questions as the play unfolded. So many of us know so little history. Once again this is a production that has everything: pathos, charm, great music, history, tragedy, philosophy, religion, hope, sadness, wit and humor. This is one that you can buy now and watch forever ... it will never get old.
