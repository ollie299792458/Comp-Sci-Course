If you've read the other reviews, you'll know that this film is supposed to be a 1957 sci-fi movie that was never released until it was uncovered in a vault or basement or someplace on a movie studio lot in 2008

I don't know if you can call what I'm writing here a review.  I could only make it through about 30 minutes of this movie.  I can't watch films that are untrue to the time of the setting. The TV show Madmen is fine.  The first two Godfather movies are fine.  "Casino" and Good Fellas are fine.  American Grafitti squeaks by in the authenticity aspect.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078322737X">American Graffiti</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671723227">Wiseguy</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RKW">GoodFellas (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>  There are others that are OK. This one is not OK.  It is so bogus, and such a poor effort as far as the haircuts, the settings, the language and most everything else. I guess it's supposed to be an homage to the 50's and 60's sci-fi movies, but in order to pay homage to something, I'd say you will have done your research about the subject, and perhaps understand the mind-set of the film makers and the audience.  It would probably be a good idea to watch a lot of the movies too.  The writers and the director for this movie didn't do any of that stuff.  Love wasn't their motive; money was the motive.

Alien Trespass is so superficial and so tongue-in-cheek, it's like Saturday Night Live for the past 20 years - smugly disrespectful to the audience and to the subject matter. Just like SNL, the actors don't appear to even be in character.  Barely professional.  If you can forget about it being a homage and watch it just as a movie, it's just a bad movie.

If you want to see a good homage to a film genre, buy Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, Death Proof or Planet Terror.  Too bad about this one.  I'm sure it sounded good on paper to a movie exec who is a sci-fi buff.  Realized on film, it's awful  unless it got real good after the 30 minutes of it that I could stomach.
