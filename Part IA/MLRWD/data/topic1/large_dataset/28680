Having read many of the prior reviews, I would refer viewers to Robert Penn Warren's novel.  I think it would be difficult to fully appreciate the Sean Penn movie without having read the novel.  And lack of exposure to the novel may account for a good deal of the reviewers' criticisms.

Given that most folks are not willing to delve into a 1940's very long book, I think that the more recent movie is much closer to Warrens story than the 1950's movie.  The themes of universal corruption, observing versus participating, class distinctions, political expediency, lust for power, and the attraction to power are all addressed in the movie, but without the nuance and development provided in the novel.  Obviously.  But the movie does attempt to cover almost all of the main plot points and themes of the book -- not always sucessfully, but close enough to be understandable.

Sean Penn, not my favorite actor, does an surprisingly good job as Willie Stark, although his southern accent can be so deep as to mush out dialog.  His energy and motivation carry the movie.  Jude Law's Jack Burden is quite well acted, except for a drifting accent.  His narrator role is quite well done.  The Stantons, Anne and Adam, played by Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo, are underdeveloped with motivations that are probably not comprehensible without first reading the book.  In fact, the major theme of Anne Stanton's attraction to Willie Stark is not really explained in the movie, but is a major revelation in the book.  And these two characters' accents are all over the place.  If you conclude that I believe a good dialog coach would have helped the movie, you are dead on.

All in all, without having read the book, I probably would have given the movie three stars.  Having read it, I give it a solid four.  With a little refinement and focus, it could have been a five.
