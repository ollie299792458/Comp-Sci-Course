This is one of those movies that I really didn't know if I would like it or not, based on critical reviews and those here on Amazon.

Now, I'm sorry that I waited 7 years before seeing it.  I loved it.

First, I remember original reviews that said that the movie was laughing at a woman with a mental breakdown.  TOTALLY WRONG!!!  One of the main reasons this movie works is that it does not laugh at its protagonist, but is very much WITH her.  You really care about her--and much of that is because of the great performance by Renee Zellweger.

This is not a movie to "classify"--and it is all the better for it.  If it had been played straight--as a drama or thriller, it wouldn't have worked.  The "comedy" approach was just right--although I wouldn't classify it simply as a comedy, even a "dark" one. It's too much multi-layered for that.  If anything, I was very moved by it.

For those looking for a nice, simple, easily classifiable flick, this won't be for you.  For those who are willing to check their expectations at the door and just go for a very satisfying ride, this is one's a winner.
