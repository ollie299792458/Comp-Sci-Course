Since the theatrical release of this movie, I have wanted to see it, but since I am only 16 I can not get into R rated movies to easily, unless I want my 40 year old parents there, so I decided to wait until it came out on video and just buy it.  
So, what did I do when it came out?  I bought it.  I watched it.  I had very high expectations because I love movies that have twists and turns and unexpected storylines involved.
So, here's the premise of the movie.  A brilliant philosophy professor, David Gale (Spacey), is accused of murdering a fellow death penalty abolishonist, Constance (Linney).  Gale grants a reporter, Bitsey Bloom (Winslet), 3 interviews, 2 hours a day, the three days before his execution is scheduled to take place.
Bitsey goes to the interview solidly believing he is guilty.  But as he tells his story, she starts wondering if he is actually guilty, and goes searching for clues, to prove or disprove his verdict.
That's really all I can say, I suppose, without giving out too much.  This movie is VERY good in some parts, but once one part of the plot is revealed, it was easy to guess the so-called "heart-pounding conclusion," or the quote that is on the DVD cover.  
The other reason this movie only got 3 stars, was that it was a play for morality, and basically just a message that the death penalty is wrong and the justice system is flawed.  I do not need a morality trip on a movie, I want entertainment, and it leaves you feeling downright stupid, to be blunt, especially if you are a Texan, if you support the death penalty.
