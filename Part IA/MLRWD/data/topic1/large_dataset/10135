I have a copy of this same cover, early VHS, version of Soldier Blue, which I bought 10 years ago in a video store after searching for it for years.  Price sticker on the box:  $59.95 (I talked them down to $25.)  It was banned in most U.S. theaters and never publicized that I can remember. The movie even protects Gen Chivington's identity by calling him "Iverson" --were the producers afraid of a lawsuit or what? There is even a town named after him: Chivington, Colorado.  Although it is a story done by Hollywood, the underlying sad truth is certainly told.  Every U.S. citizen needs to see this and know the price Native Americans paid for us to live here in this country.  Overall, it is a real downer.  Have a "double feature" night:  Watch Soldier Blue, cry your eyes out, and then watch "Last of the Dogmen" to give yourself some hope that just maybe some of these poor people survived.  Even if it isn't true, you can at least try to sleep that night.

P.S.  My Great Great-Grandmother was a young woman in Denver (coming there by ox-cart from Tennessee in 1860).
She saw Gen Chivington's "parade" of massacred Indian body parts that November day in 1864, and she never forgot it, re-telling the story to her decendants until her death in 1913.
