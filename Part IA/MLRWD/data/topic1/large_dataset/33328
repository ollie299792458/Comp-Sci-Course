Everything about This collection is great The weakest parts are  Satanis(lot of talking kind've boring ffw to the rituals a few rituals they're kind've nice but the naked women in them are ok looking their are hotter and alot of naked women in the trailers and  in the sinthia movie)  and enter the black house(boring also a few rituals again the women are ok here (two documentrieson on Anton Lavey) the best parts are The Altar section in the main dvd menu which  has great movie trailers some are really long but they has lot sex scenes demon possession orgies rituals alot of fun and the movie magazine covers are kind've nice but just pictures. The best part of the dvd  is the movie Sinthia the devil's doll(78minlong about a women who murders her parents and see's a psychiatrist because she's having bad dreams about her parents )the movie repeats her murdering her parents alot  it's really weird and surreal and confusioning in some parts  lots of nudity some lesbian scenes well worth the price I never knew the The burlesque scene could be so enjoyable!
