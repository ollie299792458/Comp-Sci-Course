This is a mind-expanding movie from the era in which mind-expansion was actually considered desirable. Many social issues are addressed in this movie, while it keeps the watcher amused with terrific comedy.

The story revolves around Harold, a rather lost youth on the verge of manhood, who has developed an obsession with death. He finds himself frequently at odds with the typical ideals of our society, as personified by his materialistic and rather aloof mother, a zealously patriotic uncle, and the girls his mother expects him to date. At a funeral, he meets Maude, an elderly woman who seems to share his interest in death, but who exhibits a surprisingly vigorous outlook on life. The director symbolically foreshadows this by showing Maude carrying a bright yellow umbrella like a flower amidst the field of black umbrellas at the funeral. Harold falls in love with the lively Maude, and I expect most viewers will, as well. The inimitable, unforgettable Maude is played wonderfully by Ruth Gordon, and Bud Cort also delivers an excellent performance as Harold. Much of the music in the film is that of Cat Stevens.

I give this movie my very highest recommendation. I found it both thought-provoking and hilarious when I first saw it in the early seventies, and it has remained one of my favorites for many years now. I promise you'll never view May-December romances quite the same after seeing this movie.
