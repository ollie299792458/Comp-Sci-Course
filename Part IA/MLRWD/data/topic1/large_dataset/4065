Of the five American films made in the 1980s I would save at all costs, three are by Alex Cox, which I like to think says more about his brilliance than it does about the wretchedness of that decade.  Cox is above all a political filmmaker, which is both why he can't get a film produced in this country, and also one of the reasons many people don't understand "Sid & Nancy."  The idea behind the film is that while you could do what you wanted in the anarchic late 1970s and it was all good, or at least not all bad, you really were a disposable piece of garbage in Reagan's America.  So while the historical action depicted takes place in the 1970s, the film itself is firmly set in 1986.  When Sid looks out the window of his room at the Chelsea, it's 23rd street in all its 1986 madness, the Iggy Pop character has New Wave hair, the cars are all mid-1980s and Gary Oldham is about the age Sid would have been had he not died in 1979.  At any rate, anyone who watches this film has to contend with Chloe Webb's performance as Nancy Spungen.  While Gary Oldham is good enough as Sid, this is Webb's film, which makes sense, as "Sid & Nancy" is less about the Sex Pistols than it is about being poor and marginalized in the US.  Webb is so good in the scenes with her dealer, here called "Bowery," that she never had to act again, which she more or less didn't.  I reckon no one noticed just what a knockout beauty she is, but you can, if you see the final scenes of the film.  Just be prepared to spend some time completely devastated afterward.
