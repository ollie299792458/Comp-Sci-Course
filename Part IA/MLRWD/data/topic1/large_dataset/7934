When I first saw this collection in the store, I just had to buy it!! Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is my all time favorite Christmas special!  The others in this collection are great also, especially Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town.
On a more troublesome note, I was reading some about the original production of Rudolph and found some interesting info.  First of all, nowhere on this package does it credit Rankin and Bass.  Also, there is a cover of Burl Ives' classic song by (of all people) Destiny's Child.  I'm not a fan of theirs anyways, but this is almost sacrilege!  I also found out that this version is different from the version that originally aired in 1964.  The next year (1965) some songs were changed and some scenes cut.  There were also deleted scenes that were never even included in the original airing that add to the continuity of the movie.  For instance, Yukon Cornelius always licked his pick.  Why does he lick his pick if he's looking for silver and gold?  Apparently because in the uncut version, he's looking for peppermint!![...].
