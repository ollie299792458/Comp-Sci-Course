Compared to movies like You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, Notting Hill, My Best Friend's Wedding, and As Good As It Gets, Don Juan DeMarco is the only one that explores the true meaning and great depth of both emotional and physical love.  For instance, in You've Got Mail and As Good As It Gets, the magic behind those films is how they make you feel excited about the chase of romance and how they make you feel heart swepted when the man finally wins over the woman with his dazzling and sometimes eccentric charm.  Needless to say, those two are great date movies.  But if you want a great romance movie, buy this dvd.  Because Don Juan Demarco appeals to the ideal of love and probes you for its true meaning.  In the movie, Don Juan tells Don Octavio De Flores the four questions of value in life:  What is sacred?  Of what is the spirit made?  What is worth living for and what is worth dying for?  The answer to each is the same.  Only great love.  With uplifting and transcending words like these and a great musical score that will make you want to ball room dance as you watch it, there is absolutely no doubt that this the best romance movie ever made.  Buy it.  I guarantee that you won't be disappointed.
