I don't actually own this movie; I came across it for the first time on TCM about six months ago, and watch it whenever it's on.  I've never been a big fan of older movies, but "Mildred Pierce" is one of those rare films that holds my attention from beginning to end.  Joan Crawford is at her movie-star best as the title character: an ambitious, hard-working woman willing to do ANYTHING to gain the love and respect of her self-centered daughter.  Ann Blyth is sinfully wonderful as uber-snob Veda Pierce, but Joan's Mildred is the one that steals the show.  You can't help but feel sorry for her as she conquers one next-to-impossible goal after the next, only to be cut down repeatedly by the impossibly ungrateful Veda.  The ending, where Veda gets what she richly deserves (and anyone with an ounce of compassion prays she'll get), is both the most heart-wrenching and satisfying moment of all.  "Mildred Pierce" has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time.  Say what you will about Joan Crawford's off-screen demeanor, but as an actress the woman was most definitely in a class all her own.
