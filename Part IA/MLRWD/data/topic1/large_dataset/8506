The idea, as I have always learned it was:

"freedom of religion."

not

"freedom from religion."

Many of the first colonists came here to get away from religious persecution. That George Washington didn't mention God or that Madison wanted separation of church and state does very little toward indicating that George Bush is radical in proudly worshipping however he likes.

In fact, it's a very American thing to do. The right to worship or to not worship, without fear that that will disqualify you from all rights of citizenship is one of the key rights the war of independence was fought for. If there is a large body of Christians to whom Bush appeals because of his religious faith, it is their legitimate right to vote for him. It's called Democracy. If someone wants to make a film about why his faith is important to them, they should have the right to do so. It's called Democracy.

I say, until atheism or non-christian (or more realistically christian) religions are being made illegal, stop whining.
