I remember seeing this film many many years ago and I remembered some of the most unforgettable scenes.

First off you get BOTH the 'R' rated theatrical version and the 'Unrated' version which is quite a bit more intense and sexual.

I'm not going to get into the story because there is enough info out there about this film.  So I'd rather share my experiences with the quality of the transfer.

I watched this blu-ray on an 80" LED LCD screen and the quality of the transfer is superb.  It has definitely been cleaned up prior to the transfer.  The images throughout are crystal clear sharp, the colors vibrant (but not overblown) and the blacks deep and rich.  The audio is Dolby Digital Stereo (if I can remember correctly) but it also is crystal clear and you can hear every word whether spoken very softly or loudly.

There are NO supplements, not even a trailer.  When you put the disc inside your player it goes right to the movie immediately after the Olive Films and Paramount Pictures logos.

The only nitpick I have is the slipcover.  Whether done on purpose or not, it looks like it was printed years ago as it appears slightly faded and a bit rough in texture.  But hey, maybe that is how it was intended to look and feel.

All in all, I rate this blu-ray 5 stars for both the transfer and the movie itself.  If you like intense thrillers with a sexual edge then this is a great example of very well-done film with absolutely brilliant performances by the entire cast especially the two leading ladies.  They truly make this film so believable and provide the sizzling sexuality that lies at the very core of the film.

A MUST HAVE ... BUY IT !
