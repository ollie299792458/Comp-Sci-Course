Not meaning very great offense to other reviewers, but those who give this film 1 and 2 stars and claim that there is little of Jane Austen in this film must be very ignorant. Amanda Root's performance is exactly what I would expect to see as Anne Elliot onscreen. People complain about her and Ciaran Hinds as being too old; I call BS. Wentworth in the novel is in his mid-thirties, I believe, when he and Anne are re-united; Anne is 27, which was considered old in that time period. The point is that the characters have matured, it's been almost 10 years since they fell in love, of course they're not young anymore. Persuasion is largely regarded as Austen's most mature novel (which is one reason it is my favorite Austen novel). If you want youthful fluff, there's Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, or Emma.

If you are a Jane Austen fan, and especially if you love Persuasion, you should definitely see this movie. I mean, for God's sake, I just watched it for the first time 3 hours ago and am now watching it again!
