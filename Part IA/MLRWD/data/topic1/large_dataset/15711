I'm so glad that Fox has re-released this great movie.  It is an all-time classic.  I am confining my review to the extras on this new release as most people have seen and know what this movie is about. Yes, the movie itself stands on it's on as deserving a dvd release BUT it is SOO wonderful that they have put out all these great extras on the new release!  It is wonderful to see Jane,Lily & Dolly interviewed about the making of this film, as well as all of the deleted scenes, the hysterical gag reel and of course the commentary.  I would recommend watching the movie with the commentary on as it is the best way to learn what the trio have to say about the movie, their costars and themselves and all of the behind-the-scenes "dish".  Although if you're looking for backstabbing divas you will be disappointed as they have nothing but fun, positive memories to share about making this film.  They do still talk about a sequel which is almost hard to believe that they could do because it would be hard to top this movie.  A nice piece that is included is about Colin Higgins, the writer/director of the film.  They obviously adored and had great respect for this man.  It was nice to see him get some recognition, even if he has passed.

By the way, from looking at the recent reunion pictures for this special release, don't they all 3 still look great?

Buy this movie for the laughs and the spectacular special features.
