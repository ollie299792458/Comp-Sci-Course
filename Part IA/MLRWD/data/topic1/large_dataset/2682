This is a superb film of resistance to the horrifying time of great human anguish, the time of the Shoah and the Nazi madness of the 1930s and 1940s. I found myself intensely drawn into the film because of the superb acting and the profound passion that is involved in her defiance of the regime, her courage under interrogation, her willingness to speak up before an irrational and thoroughly immoral trial, and a deeply moving execution. The acting and the cinematography are excellent. Every young person, especially those in the latter years of high school and college should see this. Every older person should see this so that we do not forget. Church groups should show this to their young people as a testimony of faith, albeit conveyed indirectly and by innuendo. This film, like others of this genre, helps modern day Americans to remember the greatest atrocity of the modern and postmodern world and the witness of martyrs. Do not miss this film -- its craftmanship and its narrative are riveting. It will sear your soul
