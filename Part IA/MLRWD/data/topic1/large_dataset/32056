This is an often overlooked rare gem, and unless I had attended film school, I doubt I would have ever heard of this amazing woman.  My advice... Snatch a copy, you won't be disappointed.
The very first, full-length animated film ever made... (and when you see it, you will not believe that it was made by artist Lotte Reiniger and her husband, Carl Koch - 2 people!).  Compare that with the animated films of today, and their army of assistants, one can only stare in awe at the magnitude and work involved with this early film.

The biography of Lotte is worth viewing as she was a pioneer, in a field dominated by males at the time, heck, still is.
You'll enjoy this film, and I believe that kids will also marvel at her beautiful silhouetted characters and lovely scenery, all painstakingly cut out from black paper, and even though it's not Disney, it's very entertaining and also, such an important education on the beginnings of film animation.

I cannot say enough about Lotte's work.  She has made several other films, some color, which are very rare and worth looking into as well.
She was an amazing artist and still is one of the greatest role models for young and old alike.
