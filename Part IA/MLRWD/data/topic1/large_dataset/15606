The A-Team
When I heard that they were going to shoot the movie I said: Oh my God I hope Hollywood does not spoil everything... and guess what? I was completely wrong!!!

A-Team it's definitely a great movie! I was a little skeptical about this movie because I thought it was very difficult to shoot a the A-Team film.

I thought it was very difficult to find the perfect actors for the film... but they did it... they found them. The whole group of actors is excellent!

The film is also a tribute to the original television series, is full of details that make a classic film but modern at the same time. For example: now we all know how they met, why B.A. is afraid to fly and uses that hairstyle and how the TV series begins.

I think they did an incredible job with the characters and perfectly adapted them to modern times.

If you liked the series I guarantee you will love this movie!
Great plot, great actors, great performances, great visuals, great action!! In other words, The A team is a film that you can not miss!!

A MUST SEEN MOVIE!!!!!!
