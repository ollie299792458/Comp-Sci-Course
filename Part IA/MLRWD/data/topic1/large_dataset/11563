This film is not entirely for elitist film enthusiasts, film students, or film geeks.

Just ask yourself:

1. Do you enjoy *good* use of black and white film?

2. Do you enjoy beautiful cinematography? (Just take a look at the DVD box cover... it's a gorgeous shot!)

3. Do you appreciate symbolism in film?

4. Are you not afraid to watch a movie with subtitles?

If you find yourself saying "Yes!" to one or more of the above, then I urge you to check this movie out.

Other points: It has one of the most brilliant dream sequences ever to be put to film. The women in "Wild Strawberries" are drop-dead beautiful; my old college roommate vowed to marry a blonde, Swedish girl after watching this movie. The dialogue, despite having to read the subtitles, is excellent, even funny at times.

Ingmar Bergman is considered one of the greatest filmmakers of of the 20th century. If you've never seen any of his work, then let this very accessible movie be your introduction. You don't have to be a snob to enjoy "Wild Strawberries", but you might turn into one after watching it!
