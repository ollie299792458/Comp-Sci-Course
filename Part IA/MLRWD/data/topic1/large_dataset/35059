Disney's Gnomeo and Juliet is a fun move with a unique spin on an old story, through the eyes of gnomes. Its a good movie that kids will enjoy, but won't go down in history as an all-time great. It's a strongly crafted and entertaining picture that will dazzle young audiences and even keep the parents tuned in.

Gnomeo features a dazzling 3D transfer, strong soundtracks, and a tiny assortment of 2D blu-ray extras which is its only weak spot. There are no 3D extra features on this disc. The soundtrack includes Elton John and Nelly Furtado to name a few. This disc is a full 1080p release and the natural depth, spacing, and size of the 3D effects are quite magnificent. General depth is very impressive, and the oddity of walking and talking gnomes appear far more realistic and convincing than their 2D counterparts. Even the blades of grass are impressive. Cross-talk is a non-factor. This is a top-notch transfer and details are positively striking in almost every frame. Visually this is one of the most impressive 3D releases so far. Highly Recommended!
