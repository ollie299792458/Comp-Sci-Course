I really liked this movie.  However, it had some flaws.  What I liked was the English culture, the manners, the style.  The whole gist of the movie seemed to be taking a weekend in time dealing with the interactions of the upstairs/downstairs characters.  My problem with the movie is that there was so much interaction occurring at the same time.  It was interwoven and hard to pay attention to everything at once.  Especially with the English & Scottish accents.  I had to take a star off the rating for this movie simply for the lack of English subtitles.  I cannot understand why they were not included with a movie this heavily accented.  (To my way of speaking.)  I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if I could have understood it as it went along.  The accents were very pretty but they left too much puzzlement in their wake.

To bottom-line it, I enjoyed the movie but couldn't understand a LOT of the speech.  I would have bought the Blue-Ray version if it had included subtitles.  However, I was fortunate to come across the Netflix version (instant watching) which does have subtitles which can be viewed on some devices, notably <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VBVQBU">Xbox 360 250GB Holiday Value Bundle</a> and I understand the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CLPP84">Roku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player</a>.
