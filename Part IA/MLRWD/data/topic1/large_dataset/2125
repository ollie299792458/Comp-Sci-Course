Fawlty Towers is, in my opinion, one of the greatest Britcoms of all time. It is one of my favorite shows, and if you choose to watch it, it might go near the top of your list too. John Cleese plays the role of Basil Fawlty to perfection, a rude, and very stressed hotel owner. I believe that no other person could ever have played Basil Fawlty nearly as well as John Cleese.
Basil Fawlty is supposed to be a horrible person, but I'd say when it comes to how he treats the people who stay at his hotel, some of them are worse than he is. The child from Gourmet Night, the man from Waldorf Salad, and many others further prove this thought.
Anyway, Basil Fawlty runs the hotel with his sensible yet talkative wife Sybil (Prunela Scales), and one questions their marriage. Working at Fawlty Towers is the smart, quick-witted, artist Polly (Connie Booth), who is often dragged in to Basil's scams and such. Also working there is the hard working, yet extremely bad at English, Manuel (Andrew Sachs), a worker hired from Barcelona, as well as the chef Terry (season 2).
My personal favorite episode of this show is the hilarious The Germans, one of John Cleese's best performances in my opinion ("Don't mention the war! I mentioned it once, but I think I got away with it"). So please, do yourself a favor and buy this 3-disc set containing all twelve episodes of Fawlty Towers, and you can own some of the greatest half hours in the history of television.
