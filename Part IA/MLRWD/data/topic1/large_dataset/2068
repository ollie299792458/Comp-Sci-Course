I'm not going to tell you not to see this movie. Because, being the horror buff that I am, I know such a statement will only intrigue fellow horror enthusiasts. But, let me tell you, this film has less to do with the usual churn-your-stomach, marvel at human atrocity horror vibe and more to do with a premise that falls flat on its big fat a**.

I didn't expect much going into the film, but I did expect a mild adrenaline rush and a few good gross-out scenes. I experienced neither. The first half of the film, otherwise known as the set-up, was so boring and drawn-out (to someone like me, who has already researched the basic concept behind the movie) that I found myself literally fast-forwarding through some horribly-acted chase and "terror" scenes. Once I finally arrived at the heart of the movie, which I considered to be the events taking place AFTER the human centipede was created, I was so disappointed by the results that I couldn't help but regret investing the time and energy in the movie in the first place.

I would honestly categorize this movie as more of an action film than anything. There's a lot of chasing, a lot of crying, but absolutely zero sense of tragedy or impending doom. With this movie, you get what you pay for, which is nothing more than the sum of its parts. I was honestly more interested in the trailer than I was the entire movie. It is so incredibly boring and underdone. And that's not to mention the ending, which left so many loose ends that I couldn't help but realize that I'd been duped; there had never been any sort of storyline or theme in the first place. The Human Centipede is simply mindless drivel lacking any psychological or "thrilling" components. Yawn! Onto the next.
