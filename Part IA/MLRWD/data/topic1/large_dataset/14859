Larry Flint was a victim of the Right ring, yes I said it the right wing, they do the same things as us left wingners only they petend to be so bloody wonderful.  Larry Flint is a idol for freedom of speech.  I saw this a few day ago on HBO.  I Didn't watch the start of it.  I love the good fight that Larry was trying to win and he will win at the end of the movie.  To some Larry was a sleze bag but aren't well all, only Larry was mostly a victim.  For once Courtney Love was in a good movie, I haven't seen much of them but will one day soon watch her stuff.
  This movie is a good movie I am good at writing reviews like some.  The acting was good the actors really go into the part of film.  It did make me feel sick when they were shooting up herion.  I don't like neddles.  I am going to tell people to watch this movie.  I want to watch more left wing films.
  My favoite part of this movie is when Larry is giving the SEX OR WAR speech. Its ok for volince to be on tv such as the those horrid Saw movies.  But people freak out about eroctia.
