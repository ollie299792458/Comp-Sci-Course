Been a huge fan of the Never ending story ever since I saw it for the first time to long ago, when I heard part 2 and 3 where available I tried to get my hands on them aswell but sadly never succeeded in that until recently I managed to get tNeS on dvd Finally, after many years somehow I recalled vaguely from my youth that I've seen Never Ending Story 2 long ago, but I suppose I was wrong, because nothing seemed to be familiar in the movie, nevertheless, after I watched it (seen it 3 times now since I ordered it on amazon) I really have to say I love it. The first part still is the best in the series, but Part 2, if you love part 1, all I can say is to get your hands on Part 2 aswell, it's almost as great as the first part. Taking a returning Visit to fantasia Different then the original in a way but still very amusing to bring you back to your youth.

A must have if you possess the first part, if you don't, then what are you waiting for, if you like fantasy movies, even thou it's aged nowadays, the Neverending Story and the Never Ending Story 2, are a must have for your collection of Fantasy movies.

Your Children will be gratefull for it if you have any.

~a Never Ending Story fan.
