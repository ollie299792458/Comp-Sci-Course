Simon Birch has become my favorite film of all time! If you will watch this film with your heart first, and your eyes second, your soul will find itself closer to God at its conclusion. Pay careful attention to the scenes of wind and water...they have a very important message. Wind is something that we can not physically see, much like God's presence in our life. Yet if we pay attention, just as we can see and feel the effects of the wind, but not the force behind it, we can see and feel the effects of His movement through our lives. The same is true of the currents that move through our lives, just like the flow of water that we see in this film. There is a Source that moves us and carries us if we will just surrender to its wisdom. God has a perfect plan for each of us...Simon Birch understood that so clearly. If you will trust in that, even when you can not see and understand what that plan may be, God will reveal it to you at the perfect time. I promise that you will never be the same again!
