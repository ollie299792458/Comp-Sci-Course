Despite my 5-star rating, there are some pretty big problems that need to be pointed out:
-it was too short
-some weak casting, especially for Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam
-considering the quality of the source material, John Harrison should be ashamed of much of the writing in especially the first episode
-the Fremen aren't portrayed correctly (clean, water-fat white people?  I don't think so)
The last point doesn't really bother me, considering the circumstances, but the other three would have wiped out any chance of a perfect score if not for three main points: 1) If it were not for these bad points it would, like the book and its sequels, stand high above all others as a pinnacle of excellence of Shakespearean proportions--instead, it is forced to contend with other 5-star movies, such as Pitch Black, The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings; 2) I believe that for all its shortfalls, it really captures the spirit and essence of the novel; and 3) this DVD set includes not only a good 5-hour movie, but also a nice load of excellent special features.
The movie follows a basic sequence of increasing quality from beginning to end.  In truth, if the whole thing were like the first episode, I wouldn't have such a high opinion of it.  The words in the book should have been taken much more seriously than they were.  But the beginning isn't all bad.  On the contrary, the scenes with the Baron Harkonnen are very high quality.  Ian McNeice and Matt Keeslar work perfectly together throughout the movie.
The second episode is better than the first.  At this point, many people are unhappy, because it looks like everything was shot on a sound stage, which it was.  Part of the problem is that the sand that was delivered to them was not the same color as what they had ordered.  Personally though, I thought it added an artistic touch, giving the movie an elevated quality, like a play about an epic Greek tragedy--a quality that often matches part of the mood of the book.  It is also in this episode that you are finally treated to the outstanding performance of Barbara Kodetov&aacute;, the best actress in the world.  Even if you don't like the rest of the movie, you're sure to enjoy watching her fantastic treatment of the Chani character.  Like the first episode, this one also races through the story much faster than it should.  This is unfortunate but not fatal.  By the end of this episode, you should be very excited to begin the next.
The final episode is the best of the three.  This is where director John Harrison and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro really earn their pay.  Even Zuzana Geislerov&aacute;'s terrible acting couldn't ruin this episode, although a better actress could still have improved it.  As it draws closer to the end, the spirit and feeling of the book are captured more closely than I would ever have thought possible.  My favorite scenes near the very end are the real reason that I couldn't bear to give it less than five stars.  If the whole thing were this good, it might give a partial idea of just how magnificent the book is.
It's also worth noting great performances by Laura Burton (Alia) and Julie Cox (Princess Irulan).  Have you ever seen a little girl acting circles around a room full of seasoned actors?  You'll have your chance in the scenes with Alia.  As for Julie Cox, she is the definitive Princess Irulan, plain and simple; although Purists might be unhappy about her expanded role.
If you don't have any experience with the books, you should be aware that The Master's writing can't be accurately adapted to the screen.  He uses techniques that are exclusive to the book format.  My point is that you should not think that watching any movie will give you much of an idea of what DUNE is all about.  But it's a great movie in its own right, and it's great to be able to see parts of the story play out in live action.
One more thing I'd like to add.  If it weren't for the book, there would be no question that this movie deserves five stars.  It's comparing the two that causes disappointment.  All of Frank Herbert's incredible dialogue is changed!  It's uncertain why such changes would be made, and they certainly don't help.  So when you watch this movie, you might try to pretend that there is no book.
