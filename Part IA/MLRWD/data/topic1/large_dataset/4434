I just watched Tora! Tora! Tora! for about the fourth time, after being away from it for about 10 years. This is done in documentary style, and according to the commentary basically all incidents are true.

I had a chance to see part of the filming in 1969, on North Cane Street in the town of Wahiawa. We watched with fascination as one scene was shot over and over again. This was a street allegedly in downtown Honolulu. The young man delivering the telegram to Fort Shafter is pulling out of the alley on his motorcycle. Then the camera catches the Japanese zeros flying overhead, signifying that it is too late for telegrams. The person who actually delivered the telegram in his youth was a Mr. Fujimoto, who was on the set as a consultant. Unfortunately, almost the entire sequence was left out of the final cut.

Despite this, both the film and the DVD extras get five stars. The short called "Day of Infamy" adds to the film and clarifies specific historical points. And the running directors commentary explains the obstacles that had to be overcome in this joint U.S.-Japanese effort, including the different cultural perspectives in how to put everything together. Plus that, it explains many technical details that went into making the film.A valuable resource for amateur and professional filmmakers alike.

The feature and the DVD extras can be enjoyed at different levels and be revisited over and over. I myself spent over 5 hours in one day going through the whole thing. The film is an excellent supplement to documentaries that use real footage. Definitely an educational experience.
