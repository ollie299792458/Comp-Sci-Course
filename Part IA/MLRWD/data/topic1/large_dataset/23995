**Update Feb 13 2012**

So I bought Drive to watch it again and felt that maybe I needed to add more to my review to make it helpful for those on the fence but I just now decided that Drive doesn't need anybody to defend it.  Either you're going to watch it or you're not.  Don't watch the trailer and don't listen to any of the reviews.  Just watch it, by yourself if you can, without distraction and don't try to analyze the movie as you watch it because you'll get lost.  Not because you're stupid or "don't get it" but because that's how it's supposed to be.  You are only a passenger on a journey with an unknown driver, so enjoy the ride for what it is.

**Old review**

I'd like to start by saying that I'm an avid movie goer and I enjoy all kinds of movies.  I usually check out the new releases the day of or the day after their release.  However, I overlooked Drive because I was under the impression it was like the Transporter.  That's right, the reason I initially passed on this movie is the same reason it has so many average or one star reviews.  Don't get me wrong the Transporter was a good movie but I wasn't interested in seeing another movie like the Transporter.  The one star reviewers had a false perception of what Drive was going to be like and once they noticed Drive ISN'T linear and one dimensional they decided to right it off as a bad movie.  I'm glad I gave Drive a chance and now it's one of my all time favorites.  If you have an open mind you'll probably enjoy this movie and if you don't enjoy this movie it's probably because you're scared of anything that's different.  Drive will be a cult classic. Oh, and the soundtrack is pretty good too.
