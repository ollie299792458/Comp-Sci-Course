I tend to like the Family Guy, but this episode is devoid of originality or humor, no matter what your opinion on the pricing is.

They had under an hour to satirize the bible of sci-fi mythology, and the best they could do was a Grey Pupon joke?  How about the fact about 15% of the running time is animated versions of the spaceship scenes in the film.  There are a few witty exceptions, but for the most part, it's like watching a cartoon version of Star Wars establishing shots.  It's the laziest writing I've ever seen on this show.  The special documentary makes it sound like such an event.  But when you literally spend an entire minute playing the muzak version of the Empire Theme in its entirety, you're not making it funny by making it longer, your beating a dead horse (and burning up time you weren't creative enough to work another joke in).  You can't tell me it would have been any LESS funny if we just heard the opening bars of the song.  That way there's time for another, better gag.  And can someone explain the Italian guys on Tatooine?  What a waste of time THAT pointless ethic stereotype gag was... That made eyes roll back in the 80s!!!

Save your money and rent it, or wait until it's released as part of the season... Or don't buy it at all.  This is 20th Century Fox enabling the crummiest franchise cross-pollination since the Alien-Predator disasters.
