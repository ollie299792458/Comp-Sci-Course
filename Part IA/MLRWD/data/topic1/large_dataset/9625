Nadesico continues to combine comedy with a deep plot and interesting characters in volume 5, where the story suddenly takes a back seat to slap-stick comedy reminiscent of Slayers while still being able to focus on the plot. As the crew of the Nadesico discovers the secret kept from them about the Jovian Lizards, that they're actually humans that were banished from earth hundreds of years ago, they have to cope with the fact that they're no longer just fighing against a faceless enemy, but killing others not much unlike themselves.
Munetake has his own problems with the military blaming him for the leak, even he was left in the dark like everyone else. With the threat of being demoted, Munetake is looking for something to secure his position, and a new weapon for the Nadesico would do fine... The enigmatic Ruri also has her own episode as the questions about her so far unknown past are answered, but the answers might not make for a happy ending. ...And what anime would be complete without an episode where the heroines dress up and sing in an idol contest?
The animation is as strong as ever, and the video quality looks much better than the previous volume as well, though I still think the video looks too grainy for DVD. But the artifacting is gone, so I'm happy.
I noticed no problems with the audio, and the dub continues to be quite pleasant to listen to. The dubbed script seems to be getting closer and closer to the original script, but Ruri doesn't seem to sound as good as she used to. She has many more serious and soft-spoken lines, much different than in the previous episodes, which her American counterpart doesn't seem to be able to do as well.
