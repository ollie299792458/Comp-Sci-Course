Much Like Peter Jackson's juggernaut The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Milius' epic takes itself very seriously.  This is a necessity with such high-concept fare, but it only works with serious, philosophically-conscious filmmakers like Milius and his co-writer Oliver Stone.  This is what hurts the Brendan Fraser Mummy films and the last two (first two?) Star Wars installments. It is grand, hard-nosed, and extravagant, but it is never campy, nor does it revel in its potential schlock value. 
The film starts with the famous quote from Nietzsche, which entails that whatever does not kill you, makes you stronger.  This movie is brutal; it is relentless.  You will feel stronger after watching it.  This can be a "movie for guys who like movies," but it is much more than that.  It is a super-macho treatise on the nature of strength and will - perhaps more accurate than those watered-down human interest stories we see on the news every night.  
Milius and Schwarzenegger never bat an eye, nor does the stellar supporting cast, making the transition to Conan's world even more convincing.  Like a great film should (all films, even if based on real events, are fantasy), Conan the Barbarian takes you to another world where you can smell the burning flesh, taste the blood, feel nature's callous hand, and "hear the lamentation of the women."
