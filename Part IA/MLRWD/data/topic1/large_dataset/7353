NEXT held my attention all the way through.  First the premise was original and different.  A writer asks us to suspend belief and accept a premise,
once you do that, enjoy the ride.

I was with a friend in LA watching the Godzilla movie.  As Godzilla attacked NY, he questioned whether the suspension bridge could actually hold Godzilla's weight computing with engineering algorithms that it couldn't happen.  I explained he just spent $9 to see movie geniuses engineer a film adventure asking us to accept the premise that a fictional gigantic lizard exists and has run amuck in NYC.  Have fun.

NEXT is a what-if:  a mind was so advanced it could foresee a future and multiple paths to avoid the outcome.  Fascinating premise.  My accolades to the writer.

Whatever it is that Cage eats for breakfast, I have no idea, but he has mesmerizing screen personae and I know he's going to save the day, but it's always done with fresh ideas and great action.  I liked Julianne Moore in a competent strong unemotional female,  butch, kickin' butt role.

Don't like the movie?  Ummm...maybe you didn't get it, and couldn't let go.  It's a roller coaster ride for your mind.  Enjoy!
