[Note:  Received the replacement disc today (October 14, 2010) with the Final Curtain Call.  Came by UPS, and took less than a week after I called to complain about the missing scene.  Who'd have thunk it, Fox did somethin' right.]  I can't really add to the accolades for the Mary Tyler Moore Show, I love the entire series.  The quality of the DVD is just unacceptable, and I've only given this set four stars because of this fact.  I will never buy another DVD set produced by Fox.  Besides, where is the rest of the Bob Newhart Show?  Anyway, Fox didn't even bother to provide an episode guide for MTM Season 7, the scoundrels.  Here it is:
