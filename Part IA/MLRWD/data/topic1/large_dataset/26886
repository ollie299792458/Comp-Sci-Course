People who are harping on the First-Person perspective should get over it and grow up, get some class and develop taste.

Dark Passage is one of the absolute best film noir has to offer. When I think of Hard Boiled noir classics, this is the perfect example (even though he is an escaped convict here, not a detective.)

I have to admit, Maltese Falcon was ok, but it was too Soap Opera, with everyone lying and stabbing each other in the back 50 times to Sunday all night long. It got old pretty fast.  The Big Sleep was a better version, with Bogart as a detective, but the storyline is very long and extremely complicated if you can figure it out that is!

Bogart is an escape convict with nothing to lose, so he finds Bacall after bashing some poor schmucks head in, and run off to change his life around! Unfortunately, there are a lot of roadblocks along the way!  Also:  The Cab Scene, is without a doubt, one of the best "dark, secluded, in the back allyway, with only shadows" theme of Noir I have ever seen. Again, it is a perfect expression of what many consider Film Noir to be!

Many have tried to duplicate Bogarts Hard-Boiled style whether as a detective or anything else (ie.. a Sargeant in the movie Sahara) and have failed miserably.  Let the pro's handle the Hard-Boiled persona that is legendary these days...
