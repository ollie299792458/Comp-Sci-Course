The animation, directing, and voice acting are above average, but the characters are flat the story is predictable.  No element is atrocious, and nothing falls flat, but nothing is original, surprising, or clever.  The show simply lacks inspiration.  I might have enjoyed it when I was 15 and hadn't seem the formula it follows so many times before, but now (at age 30) it simply has nothing new to offer.

The story is a pretty standard killer-machine-wants-to-be-human combined with a busty-but-angsty cat girl acting like an infant.  Except that it's not as clever I just made it sound.  The characters are flat and predictable, but tolerable.  The episodes are willing to cross some lines that most shows will not, but ultimately they are following a predictable story arc.  There is an ongoing plot, but not one with much real suspense.  The production quality is good, but not enough to carry the show.

Despite the front and back of the casing, the show is not at all pornographic.  There is nudity, but it is tasteful (if a bit gratuitous).  The gore is under control, but occurs just enough to keep you unsure of what will come next.  It's just too bad the directing and art weren't paired with with characters or a story that I cared about.

I don't regret watching the series although I wish I hadn't paid any money for it.  I have absolutely no desire to watch it a second time and I would not have regretted missing it entirely, but once I owned it did watch the whole thing.  I kept hoping it would get better, and in the end I mildly wish I hadn't bothered.  Overall, I can't recommend it, unless you want to see yet another excuse for a scantily clad (or unclad) cat-girl feeling angsty.
