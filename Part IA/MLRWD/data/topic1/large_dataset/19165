People keep asking me, is this movie worth the double dip?? My reply is YES!!!! I have been waiting for months to receive my copy of this rerelease Collectors Edition and it was worth the wait.

The story needs no recap, everyone in the world should know the story by now. However the special effects are awesome (that man/dog hybrid still works today and the space flowers at the beginning look very organic and real) and the acting is top notch. My favorite performance in the movie is Veronica Cartwright as Nancy. The movie also is still very scary and intense once the action gets going.

The picture on the DVD is a lot cleaner and sharper than the old disc. The widescreen framing appears to be correct, the old version seemed more zoomed in and the credits were slightly cropped off on the sides of the screen.

The sound also has more boom and clarity to it. Those pods hatching sound as creepy today as they did in the theater in 1978.

The extras while not excellent, are pretty good. Wish they would find more stuff for the Blu-Ray version, if they ever release one.

As for the Blu-Ray DVD, Yes I would definitely triple dip for that one if the picture is outstanding and true Hi-Def.
