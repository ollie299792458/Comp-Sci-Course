First off, I have read a fair bit of Will Eisner's "The Spirit" comics.  That said, this film was largely misunderstood when it was released.  When it came out, a lot of people were expecting Sin City part deux-- only to find an action comedy with a healthy helping of cheese and wild, dystopian out-of-body experiences.

The "cheesy quirks" of the individual characters (Octopus' hatred of all things eggs, Spirit talking to his cats, the constantly changing costumes in the "villian's lair") are actually an homage to the "untouchable" heroes and wild, untamed villians of the 40's.  In fact, the majority of the "cheese factor" was due to the director attempting to fuse a modern setting (hence, cell phones and hi-tech weaponry) with the feel of the 1940's comics and noire film.  In other words, this is a comic book movie that is simultaneously poking tongue-in-cheek fun at comics in general.  Because the film isn't taking itself seriously, the viewer shouldn't either.  If you are looking for an unashamedly fun movie, this is a great one to have.  Probably one of my favorites to this point... unpretentious fun.
