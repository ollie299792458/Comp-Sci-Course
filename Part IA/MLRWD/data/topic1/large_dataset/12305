Although I haven't read the book from which this movie is based on, I loved "Donnie Brasco." Also, this movie was a blind buy. I've heard good things about it, so I decided to buy it. I was sceptical as to what this movie would be like, because I always had this vision that Johnny Depp was a "pretty boy" romantic actor. However I did like him in "Secret Window," the only other movie I've ever seen him in. Neeless to say, I was impressed with his performance in this movie. I wasn't expecting him to come close to standing with my favorite actor, Pacino. In this movie, however, Depp showed that he can stand toe-to-toe with the best in the business. Of course, Pacino was excellent in this movie also. I also enjoyed Michael Madsen (better known for his role as Mr. Blonde in "Reservoir Dogs") although, the entire movie I wass waiting for something as memorable as the infamous "ear scene" from "Reservoir Dogs" from him. All in all, I have to say that "Donnie Brasco" is a great, underrated movie, and is now amongst my favorites.
