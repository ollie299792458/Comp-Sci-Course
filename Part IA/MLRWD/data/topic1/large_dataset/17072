This is a visually pretty movie, written to be poignant. People seem to forget this when they write reviews of it....
"The Legend of Bagger Vance" is a worthwhile view provided the viewer satisfies a number of conditions first. First, viewers who are looking for an artistic masterpiece will find is a sickeningly sweet picture without angst or pretense aside from that which Will Smith delivers his lines; these seem to come straight out of the self-help books written by people like Deepak Chopra. Matt Damon plays a World War I veteran smitten with enough angst to drink himself into a stupor yet not quite enough to seek the greater redemption through literary or means enough to help anyone other than himself. There is no angst or mental torpor; this isn't that kind of movie. 
So what is it? This is a feel-good movie-- not quite a golfer's 'Field of Dreams' but darned close. She builds a golf course, the all-time greats come, and in the end, the world is saved and we reach the truly great end-of-history (not Hegel's or Fukyama's)-- life happily ever after.
The music, clothes, and actors in this movie are what one would expect out of a work without hint of depravity or true tragedy. When the protagonist's father is out of work, it is not because he suffered but instead because he was good; even the 'bad' guys really come off good. It's as heartwarming as anything outside of Disney, and all over the world, golfers shall be drooling over the shots of the course....
