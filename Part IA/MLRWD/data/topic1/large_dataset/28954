To all of us whose names were never called when chosing sides for basketball we finally have a movie that beautifully illustrates our plight.  I cried as I saw May's "doomed to failure" attempts to connect with a world were only the false is exalted and any  one who is different and unique is thrown aside as dsyfunctional. It's painful to see yourself in such a wounded character but to succeed at fitting in is to deny the very thing that sets you apart and makes you special. The isolation that being different imposes on a soul makes for an intensity of experience that can transform one into a saint or a monster.  It is a very thin line. Unfortunately, for May, she only encounters the fake wannabe "outcasts" in her world and comes to believe through their deception of her and themselves that she has finally found kindred spirits. With this blush of acceptance she starts to show her true weirdness (uniqueness) and is quickly rejected by these pseudo-outcasts. This betrayal is the most painful "cut" of all and leads to her utter disconnect. Once you totally disconnect from societal pressures and modes of behavior you come in contact with your true personal power and it is awesome.  However, if pain is all there is when you encounter this power then you are transformed into a monster but if you have ever had a glimpse of love or truth then maybe the saint can emerge. Unfortunately for May she only encountered the false and no truth and thus her descent into hell. A truly wonderful and beautifully poignant film.
