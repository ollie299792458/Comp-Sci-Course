With such wonderful characters that the Pink Panther franchise offers, in the proper hands, this movie could have been at least good, if not great, notwithstanding the fact that Peter Sellers is no longer available.

I'll spare the details concerning the plot, because it's not interesting or important, and it is not the plot that ruins this movie.

What is noteworthy is the fact that Steve Martin is completely miscast, and more to the point, NOT FUNNY!  As Peter Sellers' Clouseau was routinely convincing and even indearing, Martin's is habitually uninspired and annoying.

Having recently seen Geoffrey Rush 'as' Peter Sellers, in the 'Life and Death of Peter Sellers'(2004), I think Mr. Rush could have slipped into the Clouseau role in a truly stunning, seamless, and perhaps even creepy way.  Martin is essentially trying to do the same thing, but it doesn't work.

Kevin Kline is also miscast, and only slightly better in the role of the perpetually frustrated Dreyfus.  Pop star Beyonce is pleasant eye candy and her formulaic musical contribution is only a minor distraction.  Secondary players Emily Mortimer and Jean Reno are best cast as Clouseau's assistant Nicole, and sidekick Ponton.

Henry Mancini's Panther theme music is still prominently featured, however some of the newer musical scoring is out of place.  Also out of place are the tasteless flatulence 'gags' which today's Hollywood is enamored with and finds endlessly amusing.

This movie is just over 90 minutes, but it felt like two painful hours had passed as the final credits rolled.

It's difficult to find anything nice to say about this movie, but there is a nice extra feature worth mentioning on the special edition dvd, about the creation of the new Pink Panther animated title sequence.

Perhaps the funniest, (and also the saddest) thing about this movie, is that the animated opening title sequence is actually the best part of this film and dvd.
