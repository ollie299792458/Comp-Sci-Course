This excellent little slasher film starring Eliza Dushku and Desmond Harrington harps back to such classics of the backwoods slasher genre as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes. The story is simple: Five friends are driving along a road when their jeep crashes into the car of another man. The group go to look for help and find an old building. However, things soon take a sinister turn and they realise that the car crash might have been the least of their worries after all.....

This film is particulary gory and for this reason, gorehounds will not be disappointed. The special prosthetic make-up effects were created by the Stan Winston Studio - the company that created the effects in all three Terminator films as well as in the Jurassic Park films - and are one of the most fascinating parts of the film. The production standards are very high in general as is the acting of the whole cast. Unlike in many other slasher films, the audience actually cares for the characters created here and root for them.

A must see for any horror fan and anyone who enjoys a well-made and atmospheric film.
