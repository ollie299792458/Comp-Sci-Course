How do you boast about your own (film) greatness without appearing obviously conceited?  If you're Michael Mann, you write and direct HEAT, one of the best films of 1995 and one of the last true cinematic crime epics.  HEAT brings Mann's TV classic CRIME STORY full circle (the film is actually based on Mann's made for TV flick, LA TAKEDOWN) but with an all star cast.  Pacino gets to rework the dialogue Dennis Farina made famous:  "You do not get to watch my television set!" and "When these guys come out the door of whatever score they take, they're in for the surprise of a lifetime."  Like Farina's Lt. Mike Torello, Pacino's Lt. Vincent Hanna, LAPD R/H MCU, is a great cop whose career brillance has been paid with fatal personal consequences:  3 failed marriages, no social life, an empty future.  This is all in a day's work for Pacino:  great performance, unforgettable character...rivaled by DeNiro's Neil McCauley, a career criminal with a single tier life, told bold faced with the film's most powerful lines: "Have no attachments, allow nothing to be in your life that you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds if you spot the heat around the corner."  There are few cop dramas as powerful as HEAT, largely credited to the Mann script and technical advice from Rey Verdugo (who appears as a Las Vegas detective in one of the more comical scenes) and long time friend Charles Adamson, who worked on CRIME STORY and THIEF.  Ashley Judd never looked more ravishing than she did here.
