Needless to say I am disappointed with this DVD. As much as I love the movie, I cannot say the same for the DVD. I own both the original DVD released a few years ago and the recent Collector's Edition. The original DVD lacked in the special features department, except for the theatrical trailer and the transer used for the DVD suffered from its share of grain and print damage. The Collector's Edition, while it had a separate disc just for the special features, it appears to have the same transfer from the original Predator DVD. The Collector's Edition suffers from print damage and grain. You'd think that by releasing this Collector's Edition that Fox would have taken the time to attempt to clean up the film, but they didn't. I guess they can justify having the fans double-dip for another DVD of Predator with the inclusion of a separate DVD of special features. But, to tell you the truth, if you already own the previous DVD of Predator and you're not into the whole special features thing, then save your money and don't purchase this Collector's Edition. However, if you don't already own Predator and/or you're a hardcore-fan salivating over the special features bonus DVD and you don't care about a below-average film transfer, then by all means purchase this DVD.
