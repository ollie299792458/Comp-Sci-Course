My daughter and I saw this movie together and when it was over we compared opinions.  She's thirty years younger than I am, has a terrific sense of humor, and we're both fans of a good sick joke.  We were really looking to be amused, and this was simply 100 minutes of wasted time.

Please don't see this utter crapbag of a movie.  It's slow, dumb, and an insult to the viewer's intelligence.  It throws together lame bits that loosely parallel the era's topical humor: Willie Wonka, Narnia, Harry Potter, X-Men, etc, etc... These are rich veins to mine, yet not when one digs with the kinds of shovels kids bring to the beach.

I wish I could  give it "minus" points, like the anti-humor it was.  In fact, it was so bad that afterward, during a post-movie meal at which the central line of conversation was how much this movie stunk, I realized I left my phone in the theater.  I almost considered leaving it until the night staff found it, rather than go back into another showing, however brief.

"Epic Movie" is only epic in this sense: we ALWAYS bring it up as the measuring stick of terrible.

"I'll never go to that restaurant again.  That was the 'Epic Movie' of  service."

"Boy, that food poisoning I just went through was the 'Epic Movie' of illnesses."

See this steaming pile if you don't believe me.  But don't blame me...I told you.
