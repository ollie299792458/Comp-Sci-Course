um.. i guess most people hate this one (and Batman & Robin too for that matter). but i personally enjoyed this one a lot. the characters seemed so cartoonish and over the top. it was strange realizing this after watching it for the first time since my childhood. honestly, all of the cheesy humor in this entertains me more than the recent Nolan films. Granted, Nolan's versions are well made but i think they're WAY too long and.. well, i think it's evident that Nolan's approach is more "real". if that makes sense.. trying to make it as real as possible. i mean.. could you imagine the penguin being in a Nolan version? even the Joker's face paint wasn't nearly as recognizable as Nicholson's. and he was portrayed as a more serious character. the atmosphere doesn't captivate me as much as the older ones such as Batman Forever. Batman Forever simply entertains me more and that's all a movie really needs to make me love it.

by the way, i thought i should mention that tommy lee jones looks absolutely ridiculous in this movie. haha. i prefer the hilarious makeup as opposed to the newer computerized version.

Val Kilmer i don't really care about honestly. he did a pretty good job but neither him or George Clooney really wow'd me as batman.
