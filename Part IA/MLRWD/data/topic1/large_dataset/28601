I was disappointed when I bought this version, when I recorded the Superman 2 version on ABC way back in the late 80's.  VHS tapes don't last, so I wanted the UNCUT version of Superman 2 on DVD.  I wasted my money.

Vital scenes are cut from the DVD:

1)  Superman saves the boy at Niagra Falls. He goes back to the hot dog stand and meet up with Lois, changes back to Clark Kent and walks away from the hot dog stand with a proud and humourous smile on his face (knowing that he saved the boy).

2)  Flying to Paris.....and it shows him passing the Concorde in the sky.

3)  A prison scene with Lex and Otis, about Otis going "pssh", which Otis mentions he had wished before they left the cell, even though it means something else.  Funny scene.

4)  Miss Teschmacher needed to go to the bathroom at the Fortress of Solitude, where she says she thinks she found it.  And Lex says, "she found it."

5)  And finally, the ending where Superman defeats the 3 supervillains, Lex shows more interest in befriending Superman (which he doesn't), the cops show up at the Fortress to arrest Lex, and Superman destroys the Fortress Of Solitude.

There's more from the ABC version, but too difficult to explain.

Just to say, the Lester cut wasn't worth the price!  I don't know about the Donner version, but the DVD creators destroyed this movie....and who knew a TV version would be so much better!
