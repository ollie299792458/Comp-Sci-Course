This is hands down one of the scariest films ever made. Horror is my favorite genre, and I was so tired of seeing these horrible, pointless remakes being pushed out one by one. But then this little unexpected gem came out, and it blew me away. It takes skill to truly terrify your audience, and Director Neil Marshall was more than capable. Its as if Marshall watched The Cave, and said to himself, "This could be made so much better."

Whoever dares to compare this to The Cave has obviously never watched these two films. Where The Cave was a piece of garbage, The Descent is a truly spectacular film that will make you nervous from beginning to end. The blood used in this film isn't there for the sake of being there, it is used intelligently, not moronically like the Saw or Hostel films. There are no stupid characters here, either. Almost all of these women are likable, and you are going to care about them once they descend into madness.

Video: This is one of the best transfers I have ever seen. Even in the darkest scenes, this film looks outstanding. Detail is very strong in all areas. What really caught my attention is that there was no grain in the dark scenes, which is very impressive. This is demo material all the way.

Audio: The PCM 6.1 Uncompressed soundtrack was upgraded on my PS3 to a PCM 7.1 Uncompressed soundtrack, and this is where the film truly shines. The surrounds are used very well, and the soundtrack was well balanced. This is demo material.

Extras: I haven't seen all of them, but there is a lot here.

If you have yet to see this film, what are you waiting for?

If you have seen this breath of fresh air, and loved it as much as I do, then what are you waiting for?
