One night last year I was flipping TV channels as usual, when I flipped to Lost. Little did I know that I was watching the premiere episode, and that it would forever change my life. I kept watching (which is rare for me) because it was that good. And the next week I tuned in, and the week after that, and so on. Lost will addict anyone who watches it, and everybody should give it a chance. But why?

Lost is an original piece of work. It combines very layered, and deep characters and a great storyline that is sure to give you jumps, chills, and "Whoas!" The characters are very human, and that gives this show an edge. It's, in fact, difficult to explain how it captivates you, because it just does. I've been watching it with my friends. Even they were skeptical at first, but they understand. Lost is unfortunately underated. Many think it is a reality show. But no, please give it a chance.

No wonder Lost Season 1 won Best Drama. This is TV's best drama; this is TV at its best. You couldn't ask for more. If you haven't seen it, watch at least the first 2 episodes (Part I and II). You will be stunned, like I was.
