In a marketing ploy to capitalize on the release of the new "Manchurian Candidate" directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep (in theaters July 30th), MGM homve video has released this "special edition" of the original 1962 film.
This new DVD contains exactly the same special features that appeared on the original issue (Frankenheimer commentary, interview with Sinatra, George Axelrod and Frankenheimer), but to jusitfy the re-release and the use of the term "special edition" MGM has added two new featurettes--an interview with Angela Lansbury (who has some revealing anecdotes--especially when it comes to the "incest" scene between her and Laurence Harvey) and an interview with Director Billy Friedkin who waxes rhapsodic about the film and Frankenheimer's work in general.
No need to re review the film--it's been widely hailed as a masterpiece of cold war paranoia, but had the bad fortune to hit theatres right at the height of the Cuban Missle crisis, which didn't exactly help first week box office....and it still has 1962 written all over it--even if every aspect of the fantastic plot were to come true someday, we'll probably never see anyone ever smoke in an elevator again.
