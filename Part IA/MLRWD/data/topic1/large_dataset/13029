I saw the movie in the theater, over and over on cable back in the 90s, and more recently, last week.  I remember when I saw it in the movies, I didn't know WHAT to think...I was a pretty mainstream person at the time, and this was a bit 'outside the box' for me.

BUT I LOVED IT...and still do.  Ya'll know the summary so I won't repeat it here, but Lori Petty is perfect as the fly the seat of her pants smart aleck who loses her family and falls in love at first sight with a tank,  (Reminds me of the first time I saw my first car.)  and goes on a rescue mission to get back her little girl, picking up numerous other oddballs along the way.  One of which, is none other than Ice-T..he is the mouthy pseudo boss of the Rippers, kangaroo mutants who join forces with Rebecca and Jet Girl...who, I didn't even realize was Naomi Watts (!!!) until reviewing the credits.

As a mom, I will encourage my daughter to watch this movie.  The heroes are women..and they are not only tough, but funny and real...or as real as you can get in a sci-fi B movie.  (Ya'll get my meaning.)

It's just brainless, hilarious, raucous fun..and if you squint, and listen really hard, you might just hear the warning that runs throughout the movie.
