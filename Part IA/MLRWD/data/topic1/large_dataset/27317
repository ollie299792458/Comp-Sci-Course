I am a big movie lover, especially weird unknown outside the box movies so this movies hits my genre perfectly. Before I start reviewing the movie I do wanna say that I typically do not rate comedies very high. I think most comedies these days just arnt funny, maybe I am just picky, who knows.

Here are a few things that stood out to me:

ACTING:
I have never watched a comedy where the main actor (Dale - Tyler Labine) is the only actor with any jokes and the rest are just supporting roles (I dont remember ever laughing at anyone else besides dale) and it not bust. It was like the whole movie they were trying so hard to over-do Dale but it never worked, you still laughed at every word that came out of his mouth.

I really hope to see Tyler Labine in more stuff, he was just incredible in this movie.

STORY LINE:
I loved everything about the story line of this movie. Tucker and Dale just bought a new vacation home in the boonies and they accidently run into some college kids who are creeped out by T&D. It gets much worse when one of the college kids gets knocked out and T&D try to help her but the other kids think they are kidnapping her. It has a lot of twists and turns after that and the ending is great.

SUMMARY:
The whole movie is just brilliantly refreshing and I recommend it to anyone!

Thats it for mow, ill finish the review in a few days.
