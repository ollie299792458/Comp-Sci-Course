I was fortunate enough to see this movie on the big screen in the short week it was available along with my sister (who is also a fan) and my father (who had no idea what it was about at all). When I first saw the other reviews I was a bit shocked at the negativity; while the art is a bit lack-luster (ok, I'll admit my sister and I laughed about how bad it was through most of the movie) and it doesn't really add anything or follow the original storyline consistently (quite a few inconsistencies actually) it was a brilliant movie. It wasn't really supposed to add anything to the original storyline anyway so that's not anything I was worried about. I was pleasantly surprised with how well I liked the new characters (I won't give anything away for those who haven't seen it) and the amount of blood was definitely much higher than normal (which my father wasn't too happy about ^^') but it was still wonderful. I definitely plan on buying this (I'm super-excited for the US cast commentaries!) and I would recommend it to any Fullmetal fan.
