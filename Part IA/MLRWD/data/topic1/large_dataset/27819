First of all to clear up some of the other misleading reviews on here, this movie is not based on Dagon at all, other than using the name "Dagon" It is clearly based on Shadow over Innsmouth.

With that out of the way I can say if you are Lovecraft fan, you will most likely enjoy this film. Although, I would also like to clear up the notion that this film in an accurate adaptation of HPL's Innsmouth. Certain elements are potrayed very well, like the escape from the hotel scene. It's not exactly right, but they tried, and its still quite effective. I think a more apropriate way to put it is it's Stewart Gordon's most acurate adaptation of an HPL story.

I really thought the creature effects were good. I know there was a mention of bad CGI in another review, but there is very little of that. All of the foam latex work is quite good. The location in spain is more fitting to old America than the NE cost of the US now, and is quite creepy.

Where this movie lacks is the charictors. Not that the acting is even that bad. But I don't understand why they were changed, when the ones in the story were much more interesting, and this is the main reason why this movie drifts away from the real story.

Overall a very entertaining movie!
