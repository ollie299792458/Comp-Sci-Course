I never saw this movie as a kid- since "The Little Mermaid" was being shown in theaters at the same time this was, I opted for that film.

However, finally watching this movie as a teenager I really wish I had seen it on th widescreen.

We have the tale of Anya- a "nobody" as she puts it, without a real name, past or family. Her only clue? A necklace with the words "Together In Paris" enscribed on it.

It's a beautifuly done movie, breathtaking animation- how can you NOT get shivers up and down your spine during the "Once Upon A December" scene? I know I can't. Rasputin in the cartoon looks rather like his historical counterpart, very, very creepy. I rather enjoyed how they made him "Undead" as in real life he was VERY hard to kill. (I don't remember HOW many times they attempted to kill Rasputin.)

Other than Rasputins looks, and several smaller details, the movie is largely historically unaccurate, but wonderful nontheless.

My one complaint? Sometimes Don's animation goes.... funny when he's trying to animate humans from a particular point of view. It could be just me, but I think he has that problem in ALL his animated films. (With the possible exception of "Titan AE")

Either way, add this to your collection. You won't be dissapointed.
