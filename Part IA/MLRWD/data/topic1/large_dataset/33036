So the Ewoks eyes are funny, the dialog and narration could use some work (mainly, more of both would be nice), and the stories are downright cheesy.  The reason I love these films is that watching them brings back happy childhood memories that make me feel as fuzzy as the little furr balls on screen.  I was seven when the Ewok Adventure was shown on tv and that must have been the perfect age to absorb this lighthearted tale.

I could never forget these wonderful bits:
* Cindel and Mace hide in a tree to avoid a rodent of extra-unusual size (a boar-wolf, or borra - favored pets of the Gorax)
* on the quest to find their parents, Mace touches a lake and suddenly finds himself trapped underneath it; his fellow travelers will have to be resourceful to save him
* at night, and all but one of the wisties fly into Cindel's eternal Candle of Pure Light; and the spare, adopted by Mace, turns out to be Izrina (queen of the wisties - though you don't learn that in this story) who will be helpful in the battle against the Gorax
* brave Chukha battles the giant spider and later the Gorax
* Wicket's silly 'stercroozer cresht' and other antics

It seems that modern kids can't really appreciate these SW tv classics, probably because they grew up with far superior visual effects and stories that have come from a foundation of twenty years of SW and other great sci-fi and fantasy tv, videos, games, etc (as well as the prior foundation for SW).  They may be spoiled in a way, but they do not have the hindsight to see how far we have come.  I do not envy them.

The Ewok Adventure is best veiwed in conjunction with the Buena Vista Records Read-Along Storybook 'Ewok Adventure.'  It fills in gaps in the story and actually changes some of the dialog for the first film (I think for the better).

Old star voyager Noa and little zippy Teek are memorable characters in the second film, in which Cindel and Wicket feature as well.  Noa actually does appear with some oatmeal which Cindel had prepared.  :o)  A nice synopsis of the two stories from the Star Wars Expanded Universe may be found on the Official Star Wars Website under Beyond the Movies > Expanded Universe > Television > Classic Television > Ewok Adventures > Cindel (Towani).
