I saw The Girl in the Cafe on cable TV and immediately fell in love with it.  I had only seen Bill Nighey in Love Actually (which I also saw on cable TV) and couldn't believe that it was the same man.  I recognized Kelly MacDonald from Finding Neverland and was impressed with her as well.

It's the story of the Girl in the Cafe that I fell in love with and I thought all the actors were well cast.  I was surpised that it was by the same writer as Love Actually, as that is also one of my favorite films.  The music, casting, and writing in Love Actually is also perfect.

If you like stories where the main character does what is right, no matter how much everyone is against them, then you will love The Girl in The Cafe.

Films that I think are perfect and inspire me as an artist are:

Arthur, Stripes, My Cousin Vinny, Godfather I & II, The Girl in the Cafe, Love Actually, and Rudy.

I can sit down at any point in these films and cannot stop watching, no matter how many times I've seen them.

There are many many other films that I love and from which I draw inspiration like The Associate, Forrest Gump, The Commitments, Something's Gotta Give, The Magnificent 7, etc.
