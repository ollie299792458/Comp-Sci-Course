&#8220;Quills&#8221; was a grotesque, yet intriguing flick.  You&#8217;ve probably read about the detail of the plot and acting in other reviews, so I&#8217;ll skip right over that stuff.
What intrigued me most about &#8220;Quills&#8221; was its political message.  Yes, it&#8217;s about censorship, but it&#8217;s more specific than that, too.  It&#8217;s also a commentary on the current nature of politics and the recent attempts from the conservative sectors of the nation to attack Hollywood for its production of violent and sexual material.
The Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) writes the filthy material.  In the film, he&#8217;s seen as a genius; his work liberates his readers from the repression of the period (and of this one, too).  (After all, the buxom maid, Madeline &#8211; Kate Winslet &#8211; is able to release her suppressed passion for the Abbe through the Marquis&#8217; writings.)  He&#8217;s the artist, insane, reviled, locked away.
Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) is the right-wing politician/party functionary and censor.  He arrives at the asylum with strict orders from the Emperor Napoleon to stop the writings of de Sade. Dr. Royer-Collard&#8217;s true intentions become manifest as the film progress:  he seeks to control the asylum itself, and exploit it for his own profit.  The Marquis only offers a tool by which he can leverage control away from the asylum&#8217;s proprietor, the Abbe Colmier.
Abbe Colmier (Joaquin Phoenix) is the liberal, the humanist.  Filled with good intentions and a firm belief in God and goodness, he runs the asylum with a compassionate touch.  He encourages the inmates to take up the arts of singing, acting, and &#8211; in de Sade&#8217;s case &#8211; writing, in belief that these activities help quell the demonic lunacy of the inmates.  He has no ulterior motive, other than to comfort his fellow humans.
Dr. Royer-Collard is quickly seen as a hypocrite.  He attacks de Sade for his immoral writings, yet lives an immoral life, having purchased a 14-year old orphan girl for a wife from a nunnery, and proceeds to bar her door and window and rape her at night.  Caine&#8217;s character distinctly evokes the shameless hypocrisy of modern-day Republican Congressmen Gingrich and Hyde, who attacked the President for marital infidelities despite their own sordid and unfaithful histories.
And the Abbe is a political na√Øf.  He never discerns the Dr&#8217;s Machiavellian intentions and allows the Dr. to snatch away the asylum and ruin him in the process.  He never even suspects the Dr&#8217;s motives, and believes everything told him implicitly.  Again, this behavior resembles the current-day Democrats as they stand mutely by while the younger Bush tramples the electoral process and the environment and sells out California to the energy companies that contributed heavily to his campaign.
The movie is clearly a warning to the political left in the U.S.  ....
