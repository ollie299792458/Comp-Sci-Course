Sweeney Todd is back, and this time on the big screen.

This is definately not a movie for the faint-hearted. If you are expecting a classic musical with happy songs and joyful feelings, this is not the movie for you. In this adaptation of the musical Sweeny Todd loses all the subtly(&iquest;?) the play has on stage.

This is a very good and smart production that uses the weaknesses of the actors into achieving something good, (like the uneducated voice of Mr. Depp making the character more believable).

The whole thing feels so surreal and cruel it gives you the feeling of the character's madness and pain after the first minutes.

I think some scenes were morbidly added to cause some of the audience to look away off the screen, and were unnecesary, but if you enjoy gore, you'll enjoy some of the cracking sounds.

The talent selection was good, but makes me wonder if some of the actors were put there just because recent success on their careers, or they'd really fit the character, specially the young ones which were very dull and unappealing, you just can't wait for their scenes to be over.

A good job by the Dark Duo (Burton&Depp)
