If you are a fan of the little mermaid you will have to watch this! I got really excited when I first got it, I put it in the machine. The animation was good but the colouring was sooo bad. no shading or anything! Anyway as for the story I thought it was excellent! Many people who have reviewed the film say its the same as the 1St, but its not! The story is completly different! 
All my favouraite characters where in there, Ariel,Scuttle sebastian, a grown up flounder, chef louie and Carlotta! Melody was an excellent new character who really has her mothers spirit inside her! Morgana is brilliant as Ursula's sister. She is slightly jelous of her sister though and she wants to please her mom! "Why can't you be more like Ursula!" Undertow a shark tip and dash are also fun!
I loved this movie but there was one thing missing GOOD SONGS There aren't any apart from the first one. I was glad they put part of your world on at the end! 
Compared to the 1'st little mermaid this is only half as good but buy it ne way
