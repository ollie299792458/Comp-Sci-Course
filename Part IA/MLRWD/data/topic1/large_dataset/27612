My "review" is more of a thank you to Universal Studios for releasing Alice in Wonderland (1933 version), one of the few remaining films that feature W.C. Fields.

The members of the W.C. Fields Fan Club have been writing to Universal Studios for many years urging them to release all of the films of W.C. Fields on VHS and DVD.  Our efforts have paid off by The W.C. Fields Comedy Collection (Volume 1) and Volume Two and now with Alice in Wonderland.  W.C. Fields and film collectors have, for many years, screening this film on 16mm film and poor quality transfers to VHS and DVDs.

Althought W.C. Fields' role in Alice in Wonderland is brief, it is steller, as are many of the other stars' performances.

Regarding the quality of this DVD release, I expect high quality from this release of Alice, as Universal has announced that the DVD has been "remastered".  Also, the transfers of the W.C. Fields Comedy Collections were found to be of high quality and I feel no reason to expect less from Alice in Wonderland.

Thank you to Universal Studios for this release! Now, Universal, please release on DVD the following W.C. Fields films; If I Had A Million, Tillie and Gus, Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch, and Mississippi.
