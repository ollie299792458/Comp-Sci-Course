This film forces us to look inwardly at our own prejudices and to re-think what assumptions we make about people based on their appearance, their ability to speak or the manner in which they speak.  I have met Sue Rubin and have seen her respond spontaneously to questions using FC (she independently types responses).  She is an inspiration to people with disabilities who so often are wrongly assumed to be incompetent.

One prior reviewer has no problem accepting that people with cerebral palsy may competently use assistive technology yet has difficulty accepting that this could work for people with autism.  These comments reflect a basic lack of understanding of autism.  Having autism does not mean one is cognitively impaired.  Rather, autism is a movement disturbance.  Once one internalizes that basic principle, the idea that people with autism are capable of very complex thought processes is not foreign at all.

I recommend this film for anyone seeking to gain a greater understanding of what it means to be human and how we can better ourselves by assuring that we accept and respect people with differences.  Remember that 100 years ago it was assumed that people who were deaf were mentally retarded.  How ludicrous that notion seems today.
