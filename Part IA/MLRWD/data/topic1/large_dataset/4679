im not much into sci-fi because the acting is usually cheesy and the movie gets tired-some quick. Ive seen this movie plenty of times, the first time being when i was 10. i like this movie equally if not more than the first one. this movie portrays the predtor character more of an hunting race rather than just a crazy alien like the first one. Which brings up a point, someone had posted earlier that they didnt understand how the predator came back to life from the first movie to be on this one. It didnt, this is a different predator, its a race of hunters that travel everywhere in hunt of good game. Also someone commented that the ship blew up on the last seen of this movie, it didnt.... it flew back into space at a high speed. if you look closely at the predator trophy room where they have their skull collection you can see an alien skull on the wall rack. all in all it is a great movie too much blood for my liking but the weapons and predators custom and ship make up for it. many great scenes like the subway fight and the unforgettable scene where the predator attacks a group of people that walked in on a couple while making love!!!  Danny glover is simply awesome in this movie. i would recomend buying, but if your still not sure.... its a most diffinet rent!
