This series was a wonderful surprise when I first viewed its episodes on Netflix. Shortly thereafter, I bought the DVDs of the first (and, sadly, the only) season on Amazon. The casting of Harry's and Murphy's characters was inspired; Paul Blackthorne is a genuinely likable Harry, and Valerie Cruz is a fresh rendition of the gutsy-yet-vulnerably human police inspector. The special effects were well-balanced between vivid imagery and believability, not overdone or unduly burdened with "production values" as is so often the case with this video genre. The decision on the part of the tele-playwrites to diverge from the book series' plot lines was a wise move and didn't violate the spirit of the original characters' portrayals in the print series.

I must confess that I only read the Harry Dresden books AFTER viewing the TV series on Netflix. THAT may account for my disappointment with the print version, which I found to be long-winded and over-written, given the time span of the plot lines and the short arc of the action of each story. BTW: I am not shy about reading LONG, INTROSPECTIVE mysteries; it's just that the word count should justify my time spent.

The termination of THE DRESDEN FILES series after only one season is a testimony to the lack of target-audience insight and the inability to recognize quality entertainment product on the part of the network's programming directors and other top decision-makers. But good TV programs are perishable items and often overstay their shelf life, so it may be a blessing that this little gem of a show will be fondly remembered for its great - but very short - run.
