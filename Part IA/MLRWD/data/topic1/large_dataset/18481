This film is one of my early memories, perhaps the first (coherent) memory I have of anything.  I remember suddenly being aware of fantastic, amazing creatures and scenes.  I'm sure this had an influence over my development.

This is not a stupid, immature kid movie.  It is filled with wonder, complexity and imagination.  At times, it has an almost Miyazaki atmosphere.  If there is any complaint, it is that the movie is too short.  It is interesting, amazing and startling.

The story centers on a Gelfling - which is an amazing looking elf like creature.  It is the task of the Gelfling to mend an object with mythic power known as the Dark Crystal.  Adults watching the film will soon catch on to what is happening.  The crystal was intentionally broken with supposedly good intentions.  It was an attempt to split apart the essence of a semi-divine entity so that it could be rid of its evil side.  However, it goes horribly wrong...

It is a film of contrasts and startling moments.  Beautiful elf creatures in fantasy settings clash with scenes of torture and vile totalitarian behavior.  Suddenly, the landscape itself could spring to life.  Amazing patterns reveal themselves on the walls and pillars.

This might be a stunning film - even a scary film - for a child used to the shallow, derivative, watered down (overprotective) garbage that is the usual kids fare these days (like a certain kind of derivative, lame and played out computer animated movie or its equivalent).  One thing is for sure though - after watching this for the first time in many, many years - The Dark Crystal is an absolute must see.
