I hope i can do this film as much justice as the editorial reviewer and others have done. I can not tell you how much I laughed at this movie. 'Now Hi, you go right in there and get me one of those babies'. I thought that was one of the funniest lines in this movie and well,  yes i guess it does tend to be black comedy. But, Holly Hunter was very, very funny in this film. And the way she pushes Nicholas Cage around in this film was quite comical. It certianly did invoke my wilful suspension of disbelief and i can almost see this whole scenario taking place although i'm glad it is just fiction. The bad guys are so hilarious that we start to side with them a little. This Nathan Arizona guy from the unpainted Arizona Furniture store, 'or his name is not Arizona' (actually it is not). Well, he has so much and this poor family of police officer and repeat offender hold up artist have so little that it seems like the rich folks should want to share one of their babies with these characters. Oh poor, H.I. why didn't he just go in and ask old Nathan for one of those babies. Oh well maybe him and Hunter will conceive one of their own after all since the baby does get back to its family. Oops, did i give it away? Ok well I won't tell how this happens but really, you should see this DVD it is great.
