Anyone who has seen Frank Capra's madcap version of Arsenic and Old Lace knows that it is a stunning example of hilarious dark comedy.  The story centers around a certain Mr. Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant), who says that insanity "runs in my family.  It practically gallops." One day he discovers that his two aunts, Martha and Abby, poison poor old lonely gentlemen as a "charity act."  He tries to convince them to stop while committing his brother Teddy (of Roosevelt fame) to the Happydale Sanitarium.  At the same time, his new wife Elaine (Pricilla Lane) battles for his affections. The plot picks up when Mortimer's long lost brother Jonathan (Raymond Massey) shows up-- with an eye to kill.  His little assistant, Dr. Hermann Einstein (Peter Lorre) is a plastic surgeon who does face jobs on Jonathan to avoid detection from the police.  Each one of these performers-- especially Lorre-- do an excellent job of making this screwball comedy a success.  Lorre is both funny and touching in his role as a pathetic man who has played henchman to Jonathan for so many years.  Watch him as he begs Mortimer to leave the house.  How can the viewer not feel pity?  A very satisfying and hilarious film.
