I have to say that I have watched a lot of movies, probably like everyone else on this page. However, I consider myself to be sort-of a film buff and I think 8 1/2 is one of the best movies ever made. I can completely understand why some people do not like the film, or feel that others who do are trying to be stuck up, superior, artsy fartsy jerks. But, make no mistake, 8 1/2 is an amazing movie; and, even though you may not understand everything, that does not make the film "bad". Some movies take patience, maybe even some research, and sometimes a few more viewings, before the viewer can fully appreciate what the director is trying to accomplish. Some of my favorite movies I hated the first time I watched them. Yet, I gave those movies another try because I thought that I must have overlooked something,  that for some reason I was not glimpsing the true vision of the Director.
Most people want to see movies that they have already seen. Many movies are just repeat plot tricks, with the same characters and heros and anti-heros. Doesn't anyone want to see a movie that attempts to unveil a part of the soul, not one that simply aims at that base desire to be entertained. Just give 8 1/2 a try, I don't think It could hurt!
