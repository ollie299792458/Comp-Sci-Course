This was definitely Mel Brook's crowning achievement.  Unfortunately you could never release a movie like this today in our "politically correct" environment.  Although Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder were  terrific (these are common-clave people.  You know, MORONS!), it is the  supporting cast that truly made this the all-time classic it is today.  Slim Pickens first line in the movie is unforgettable, Harvey Korman's  hilarious bad guy (that's HEDLEY!), Madeline Kahn's deadpan impersonation  of Marlene Dietrich, and Alex Karras as dimwitted Mongo all contribute to  the nonstop hijinks.  All are hilarious and each of them steals the show at  some point in the film.  That part where Mongo punches out the horse is a  classic clip.  One terrific character in the film not mentioned in other  reviews here is frontier gibberish-uttering Gabby Johnson, a dead-on spoof  of Gabby Hayes, who appeared in pretty much every Western film from the  turn of the last century up through the Roy Rogers era.  But the true gift  of this film is that every kind of humor is used, from subtle situational  humor to in-your-face slapstick comedy.  Truly a funny movie that is  appreciated by several generations today and will continue to be so in the  future.
