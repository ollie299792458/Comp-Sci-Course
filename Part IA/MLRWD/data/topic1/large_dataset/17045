I must say that the cultural differences are fascinating!!!  From that perspective, this film is very interesting.  On the other hand, Phil Rosenthal is so INCREDIBLY condescending and annoying, that this is a difficult film to watch.  To be fair, I should mention that I find the American version of this show equally annoying.....almost as much as the creator.  I agree with the Russians that this is simply not a good show.  If we're going to export comedy, why not something that has more layers of comedy or even simply more less stupid...."The Simpsons" comes to mind as something that, while not as good as it used to be, is still very smart.  How about something like "The Office" or "Arrested Development" or "Archer" or "Friends" or "Big Bang" or classics like "I Love Lucy" or "Star Trek" or "Twilight Zone"........or a test pattern.  It's embarrassing that a show this bad is being exported, and that the idiot culpable had the nerve to treat the Russians with such condescension. What an embarrassment.
