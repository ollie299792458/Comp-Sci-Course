I am a Taiwanese who lived in Taiwan more than 30 years.  First of all, whatever in the movie... definitely not 1980's... In my whole life, I have never seen soldiers/ secrete polices patrolled on the street and arrested people, liked the movie showed. (The street more looked like 1950's) The historical part of the movie is laughable... During the 80's??? ARE YOU SERIOUS???  Yes, Taiwan did have a period of political horror around 1950's and 1960's. But so did the USA and many many other countries, right??? That should be the lessons that will never happen again and move on with our lives. I don't understand the purpose of this movie... is it trying to heal the wound? or is it simply trying to spread the hatred under the false/ fictional plots? Keep in mind that it is Taiwanese people who spoke and voted for KMT government. I don't think there is much to argue about that! Taiwan is a free island today, probably more so than many other countries. This is the hard work from people who LIVE there. Even as a fictional story, this movie is not well made.
