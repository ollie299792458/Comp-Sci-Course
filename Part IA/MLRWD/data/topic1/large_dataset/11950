This documentary is OK if you like the classic arcade games.  It's worth renting, but I sure wouldn't pay $20 to buy it because it's not worth the money.  The guys in this documentary all need to get a life, and yes that includes the "hero" Steve Wiebe.  He's out of work and can't afford a new Donkey Kong board when his breaks down, so Mr. Awesome buys him one?  Then why is he playing Donkey Kong instead of spending his time finding a job?  Watching this, I couldn't help but feel sorry for his wife and two young children. Also, watching this documentary I couldn't help but think "Does anyone really care who has the highest score on a video game that's 27 years old now?"  Billy Mitchell has got to be the biggest jerk of all time!  Brian Kuh is even more pathetic than he is and worships Billy like some kind of god.  The only one in the whole movie that's halfway entertaining is "Mr. Awesome" just because he is so over-the-top in love with himself that it's funny!  This DVD is good for a few laughs, but not worth buying.  Save your quarters!
