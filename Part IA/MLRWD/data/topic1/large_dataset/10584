I agree. I love this movie. But worse DVD transfer ever. Terrible video. Sound is ok, but not great. And it's a widescreen movie that is improperly mastered in 4:3. So no matter what, it's a 4:3 video with widescreen content. So if you watch on a widescreen TV you get a little widescreen video with huge black borders on all 4 sides. And yes, I know how to use my displays and players. I have also tried it using an HD-DVD player and nice projector system. Same deal. They MUST re-release this title. Both in a proper DVD format as well as HD would be ideal.

This title finally came out on Bluray last year and I forgot to update this review that I bought the BluRay on release!

Way better! Reviews gave it a 4/5 starts on video quality, which is great for an older title transfer. Sadly not much in the way of extras. Still worth it if you have a huge screen as the DVD looks terrible on a 100" screen where as I have plenty of DVDs that are even older, that look much better.
