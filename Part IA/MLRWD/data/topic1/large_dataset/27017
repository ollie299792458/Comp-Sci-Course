This film was deeply moving from my perspective because it was so well produced.  The subtleties and nuances are what truly distinguished the film.  Thus, for instance, the very low current of homosexuality which undergirds the two main characters is always present, always acting, but doing so behind the scenes, in a way that keeps the viewer unsure of exactly where the deeper feelings stand between the two men.  Another nuance is the love-hate relationship our two protagonists share with one another.  They example the classic case of "can't live with him--can't live without him".  [...]

In essence, what I found so truly impressive about the film was its realness, a realness disguised under character persona.  Joe and Ratso had not truly cared about any other male until they met one another and had to rely on one another.  The ending of the film is quite tender, depicting how caring and gentle and loving Joe is in nurturing Ratso during his debilitating illness on their bus trip to Florida.  The film indicates a transformation, an expansion, a growth for both characters, as they come to realize that their lives are much more than about parochial and narrow self interests.

This film won several academy awards (1969) and, in my opinion, deserves its classic moniker.  Both Hoffman and Voight turned in excellent and dynamic and exceptionally convincing performances, and I would say this film showed them at their best acting potential.  I have added this one to my small collection and expect to enjoy it for years.
