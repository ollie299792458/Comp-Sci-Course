I went and saw this movie at a dollar theater on "tightwad Tuesday" for $.50.  Despite how dumb the movie looked to me, I actually really enjoyed it.
The demographics of the audience we saw it with were close to 50% white, 50% black and EVERYONE was laughing pretty damn hard.  I like how Queen Latifa (a beautiful & talented comedian, actress, and singer) was able to make you see that a very smart, educated, upper class black woman can speak English by the book, but may choose to sound more ethnic because that's who she is.  Anyone who thinks we American's don't have any heritage/culture, think again.  Every race/culture/clique has their own version of English, their own style of dressing, etc.  Sometimes they overlap, sometimes they don't but we share a history and an American pride.  I loved the way this movie makes you laugh at the ridiculousness of your own prejudices without being preachy.
Steve Martin used to be my favorite comedian, but as of late he hasn't done anything spectacular.  At the end of this movie he has a chance to show his versitility as an actor, his talent as a comedian, and the ability for an old dog to learn new tricks.  He and Queen Lattifah make an unlikely but enjoyable pair.  And of course I've always loved Jean Smart who plays Martin's ex-wife.
I give it 3 1/2 stars.
