I had never seen the original, so I rented this movie from Netflix and halfway through the first viewing I decided I had to have my own copy of it.  You quickly forget that these submariners are German and become involved in the drama of life aboard a U-boat and the personal relationships between the characters.  The Captain, excellently prtrayed by Jurgen Prochnow, realizes early on in their mission that his superiors, supposedly in charge, have little idea what they're doing; resulting in confused orders, orders that never arrive or arrive too late, and tragic consequences for the soldiers and submariners caught in the middle. The dedication of the crew in keeping their "Boot" in working condition, and the mind-numbing boredom during the intervals between battles, are vividly brought to life.  I won't spoil the ending, only to say that after all the effort expended by these young men (the average age is 18 and the Captain himself was only 30) to get their crippled ship home the result is a heartbreaking tragedy.  The English dubbing is very well-done, although I recommend watching the movie in German with English subtitles--there are a lot of subtleties and nuances that are lost in the translation.  Five Stars and more!
