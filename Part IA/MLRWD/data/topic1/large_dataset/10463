I would rate the acting of the ensemble cast in Six Feet Under as one of the best ever in any TV drama Series I have seen.  The writing and directing are right up there too. However, a note of caution for those considering this set and are new to the show.  It is very intense.

It is called "quirky" by many viewers I have spoken to, and that would make sense considering it revolves around a family-owned funeral home and each episode begins with a death.  The show does have a real ability to "pull the viewer into the story line," which is an obvious indicator that it is well written, but because of it's intensity, watching too many episodes at once "got to me," and may well "get to you" also.

If you are looking for something light and easy going, this is not the show.  Not to say that there aren't plenty of "laugh-out-loud" scenes - the show has a very unique off-beat humor to it, but overall, the characters go through a lot of difficult "stuff."  I personally got a lot out out of it - for a TV drama, it offers an amazing amount of life-lessons and insight that makes a viewer think.

Bottom line:  this is an A+ drama, and I would highly recommend it - but not for someone looking for a light-hearted comedy.
