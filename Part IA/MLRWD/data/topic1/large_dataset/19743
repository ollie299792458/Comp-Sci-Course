I rented this once, I fell asleep. I figured, well maybe I was just tired that night or something. So I rented it again. I fell asleep again. That should say something about this movie. The only good thing about this movie is the animation which is fantastic. But it takes more than animation to make a quality anime. Especially when it's a an anime that's trying to have a "deep" and "one of a kind" story with the time constraints of a movie format. The entire thing from start to finish was boring and I really wasn't liking Oshii Mamoru (although he redeemed himself in my opinion with Jin-Roh). Kusanagi is naked too often too, I never got what the point was with her being naked so often. It was probably just for fan serivice, and that's not a good idea to throw in pointless fan service in a movie that is supposed to be "deep". I didn't notice the music at all so it probably wasn't very good. All in all Ghost in the Shell is just eye candy. I hope that the new GinS tv series is better than the movie.
