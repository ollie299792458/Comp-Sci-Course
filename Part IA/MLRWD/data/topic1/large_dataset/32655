I have to say I was a little surprised at all the violence in this film. Not that I'm not old enough to handle it. Besides it wasn't gorey. It was just mostly made up of fighting. I like battle scenes. But really good ones. The fighting in Scorpion King were good but not excellent ones. The Rock wasn't too bad in this. I do like the guy. I think he's good action hero type. But can he really act? I'm not talking about fighting scenes. I'm talking about just regular dialogue. Which you don't see much of from him through the whole thing. Action scenes he was real good. But I'd have to see him in a few more movies to judge on wether or not he can even act. The movie was predictable (like most reviewers were saying on here). What movie can't you watch that isn't? They all have the basic storyline it's how it's done is what makes the difference. I don't ever watch a movie thinking the ending is going to surprise me. But anyway. This movie is worth watching. It has enough action but the scenes are kind of mellow. In my opinion it doesn't compare to The Mummy. I might add it to my 'Mummy' collection if I can find it for a cheap price somewhere.
