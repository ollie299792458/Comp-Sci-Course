nothing against the film, but it will either leave you wanting go smoke a cigarette or not be able to comprehend much of it at all. i dont want to go too far into detail(this is a film that should best be explored with the smallest knowledge possible) but this film basically centers around the object of fear; a deeply disturbed man who has never been able to feel fear, slowly unravels as he becomes obsessed in learning everything about it: what is fear? why do people fear? what truly causes your brain to feel fear?, etc.

the directing was so-so, at times it created some really captivating scenes, while other times it felt like they were being dragged on. i personally felt it ironic that Shimizu had cast Shinya Tsukamoto in the lead role, as this film seemed to reflect much of the fellow director's trademark subject matter(ex:protagonist succumbing to the pressures of city life, as well as obsession) aside from a few scenes few minutes too long, the imagery is wonderful; disturbing yet very captivating, much like the film itself altogether.

overall decent acting, decent characters, decent direction, & an above-decent & more original horror story.(you must give it credit amongst all the ring & grudge rip-offs being unloaded)
