I can't believe that this series was cancelled after only 2 episodes. God, I hope someone got fired for that one. This has got to be one of the funniest shows I've ever seen, and I haven't even seen the original Clerks. After viewing this DVD, I paln on buying the original. If it's anything like this, it's worth it. There are 6 episodes on the DVD, and all are excellent. The funniest moment is the last half of episode 4: it's a total spoof of Pokemon, and I was on the ground laughing. There's also some cool extras on the DVD, including a couple of featurettes, a film festival trailer for the series (this is a great trailer: it totally bashes the series, which is very funny), a promo which aired during the Super Bowl, trailers for the original Clerks, Chasing Amy, and Princess Mononoke, and best of all: commentary by Kevin Smith and the voice actors for each episode. Lately, TV has seen a lack of good shows(for the love of God, Survivor 2 absolutely , and it's a shame that Clerks: The Animated Series is no longer on the air. But this DVD moree than makes up for it.
