Apparently this movie is considered by many to be a "classic," "a masterpiece," and the best noir film of all time.  While this movie has a decent plot and great acting by Jack Nicholson, people tend to get carried away at talking about how great the screenplay is and how great Roman Polanski was in directing this film.  Compared to contemporary noir films such as L.A Confidential and classic noir films like the The Big Sleep, this movie is a little on the slow side and has less action, less violence and overall less suspense.  For a movie to be a fantasic noir film, I would also argue that it has to have great characters other than just the main lead- namely, it has to have a great femme fatale and great dialogue between that person and the lead.  Faye Dunaway was simply alright in this movie.  Compared to Lauren Bacall though, she just doesn't measure up.  After watching this film and then the Big Sleep several times, I would have to say the Big Sleep is the better movie despite its complicated plot.  Just my opinion.
