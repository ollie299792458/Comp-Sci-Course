Plan B is a witty, moving comedy-drama about Bruno (Manuel Vignau) who tries to sabotage his ex-girlfriend's new romance by convincing her that her current love-interest, Pablo (Lucas Ferraro) is gay.  The plan, of course backfires when Pablo discovers what Bruno is up to and Bruno discovers he is falling in love.

The actors are great, and there is a nice chemistry between Vignau and Ferraro.

Being a foreign movie the film moves at a leisurely pace, but that's okay with me.  One drawback is that there is very little dialogue.  Many of the scenes are played in near silence which is effective up to a point.  Vignau and Ferraro do a very good job communicating their feelings through facial expressions and body language.  The problem is that the lack of dialogue leads to a lot of confusion, at least for me.  I couldn't even figure out who the girlfriend was until the film was almost over (I thought she was the neighbor).  I guess I wasn't paying enough attention.  A little more development for the supporting characters would have been helpful.

Otherwise it was a terrific film.
