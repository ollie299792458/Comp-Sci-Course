Ma Vie en Rose, directed by Alain Berliner in 1997, attacks many of the norms in our society. A major theme of the film is heteronormativity. Ludovic is a seven year-old boy who seems at this young age to defy the rules that force society to conform to a heterosexual identity. His desire to dress like a girl does not necessarily indicate that he is homosexual, but his expression of a genuine belief that he was meant to be a female. Once he discovered that God "mixed-up" his chromosomes, he began to openly express his gender outside of society's conformist view of how he should have. This theme as well as family, gender binaries, and conformity carry out through the film. As evidenced by the expressed opinions of neighbors, teachers, friends, and family, Ludovic and his family's encouragement of his behavior would not be accepted. In the film, Berliner presents the intersection of gender in a stereotypical society.

In Ludovic's environment there is only room for two distinct and opposite genders. Despite the fact that Luovic's belief about his identity is completely innocent, the people surrounding him still feel the need to criticize and pass judgment. Berliner exaggerates the stereotypes of the society, as well as those of the transgender, "bent" community. Primarily by introducing Pam, the main character in the show that Ludovic watches, viewers are given something concrete to relate Ludovic's ideas about femininity to. The fictional character is tall and slim with long blonde hair. She dances and sings wearing provocative clothing. Ludovic watches Pam and imitates her behavior, clothing, hairstyle, and dancing. Because Ludovic genuinely believes he was meant to be a girl, he constantly feels confused and out of place when his behavior is not accepted. Berliner's critique of the one-minded, conformist views of our society should hopefully reach viewers and speak volumes about our ignorance.
