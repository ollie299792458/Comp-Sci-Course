The merits of Hitchcock's experimental film ROPE have been endlessly debated. (See below!)
What I find fascinating about this film is what it reveals about the skill of the actors, especially Jimmy Stewart.  In an ordinary film, a performance is as much the creation of the director and editor as it is the actor.  The choice of takes and angles, the pace of the cutting, etc. all work to enhance or subdue an actor's work.  In ROPE, with its continuous 10 minute shots, the actors' work is plainly revealed. As in a live play, they are on their own to maintain the pace and the intensity of the drama.
Hitchcock's cast doesn't ever let the energy flag.  Farley Grainger and John Dall tear right into the opening, visibly sweating their way through the early murder scene.  The drama shifts tone with the introduction of each new actor, but it is not until Jimmy Stewart enters that the movie snaps into place.  Where the others are intense and theatrical, Stewart is comfortable and deceptively easy-going.  Watch how skillfully he alters the tension and shifts the mood with his control of movement and voice.  Even when he is on the edge of the scene his reactions give the drama focus.  This is one of Stewart's most underrated performances.  He enters this stagy drama, takes a deep breath, and makes it fascinating and fun to watch.
This is still Hitchcock, of course. Note the pacing of the camera, the elegant set and moody lighting, and the cleverly suspenseful use of music.  But ROPE I think is most interesting for this unique opportunity to study Jimmy Stewart's skill as an actor.
Watch it again and see what you think!
