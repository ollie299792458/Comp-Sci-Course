I first saw "The Haunting" before I was ten years old.  It scared me then and, thirty-odd years later, still sends chills down my spine.  It is, has been, and always will be, the classic horror film.  I am  a fan of Shirley Jackson, too, and having read the novel recently for the  first time, I was quite pleased with the movie's interpretation.  I  recently watched the remake and was sorely disappointed - it was very badly  made, the dialogue was sophomoric, there wasn't a single element of  suspense you couldn't picture ahead of time, and with the exception of  using some of the characters' original names from Ms. Jackson's book, it  neither resembled the original story line, nor had the impact of either the  book or the original movie.  I was totally bored and found it generally to  be an entire waste of celluloid. I highly recommend the original movie to  anyone who likes good, old fashioned, horror movies, without the computer  effects, gore or violence rampant in today's films.  You are left at the  mercy of your own imagination watching this film - remember, it's what you  don't see that can hurt you.
