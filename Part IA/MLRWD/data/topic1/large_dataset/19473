First off, delivery time was early (which is ALWAYS a bonus in my book), and secondly this DVD is just amazing. Tommy goes through all the basic rudiments by teaching you the pattern, playing t slowly, and then uping the speed with the Lifetime crew. When I say basic rudiments I mean, paradiddle, double paradiddle, paradiddlediddle, ruff, drag, ratamacue, flams, flamadiddle, swiss army triplet, triplets, single stroke, double roll, taps and accents, which all get daisy-chained together in a neat little exercise. I would only knock it a little bit by his definition of basic, intermediate, and advanced rudiments, but it was just a misunderstanding on my part. Instead of him teaching fancy rudiments for advanced, he plays advanced variations of the intermediate rudiments quickly. I thought it was going to be like, Basic - Paradiddle, Intermediate - Flamadiddle, Advanced - Cheese-fives, but he doesn't get into the fancy (more marching core style) rudiments at all. Overall I still love the DVD and would recommend it to anyone who is learning drums for the first time, or someone who is fine tuning the skills they already have.
