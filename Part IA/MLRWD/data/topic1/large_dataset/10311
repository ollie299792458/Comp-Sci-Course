This miniseries is fantastic, and I'd recommend it to any sci-fi lover. It's a pretty faithful adaptation of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. The acting is incredible in all the lead roles, especially with Leto, Ghanima, Alia, Paul/The Preacher, Duncan Idaho.... I could go on and on. The only performance that didn't really impress me was Susan Sarandon's; she came across as very 2-D and boring. However, this doesn't detract from the miniseries too much since her part is not that prominent.

The combination of great acting, an AMAZING score, and wonderful visuals (some of the CG isn't up to the standards people are used to in blockbusters today, but it's not distractingly awful and the overall picture makes up for it) makes for a truly moving story in miniseries form. If you've never read Dune or its first two sequels, I'd recommend reading them (or something about them) or seeing the first miniseries so you don't get too confused. Herbert's world in Dune is incredibly detailed and textured, which makes for a great backdrop, but you'll get more out of the miniseries if you understand more of the background. This is not to say that you cannot enjoy the miniseries without reading the novels; I know several sci-fi lovers who have done this.

Finally, at this price it's a steal, and completely worth owning, if you're into well-done epic sci-fi.
