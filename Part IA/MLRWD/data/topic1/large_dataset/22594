This review is directed to those who, like myself, are not avid anime fans.  I own three anime DVDs: Ghost in the Shell, Akira, and Ninja Scroll, and I enjoy all three.  However, Ninja Scroll is far the most enjoyable to  watch.  But this review is not a comparison of the three.
I would like to  praise the writer/director of Ninja Scroll for creating such an exciting  and artistic work while at the same time retelling the ancient tale of the  reluctant hero.  The plot was sufficient enough to withstand the weight of  the amazing action sequences and fun sexual content.  The character  development was superb.  Jubei (the hero) is not portrayed an all-powerful  superhero.  Instead, we just see a gifted fighter with an immense will to  survive.  
The action scenes are among the best I have ever seen, with  battle choreography that is comparable to that of the best filmakers.  The  villians are imaginitive and original, not to mention devious.  The plot is  extremely imaginitive, touching on topics that are not common to the  "super robots and cute little girls" world of Japanese Anime:  love triangles, rape, greed, self esteem, and homosexuality. This film was  enjoyable from beginning to end, and if you are searching to expand your  collection into something new, pick up this DVD.  Its pure enjoyment.
