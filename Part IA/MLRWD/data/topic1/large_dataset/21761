1970. San Jose, California. One summer night my family and I piled in the station wagon, a woody, and off we went to the drive-in. My brother and I were told to hide on the rear floorboard to beat the ticket price.(.50 a  kid) We were being sneaky and that shudder of fear set the tone. We parked  backwards with the swing door open: Dads feet hanging over the rear bumper.  The movie started. I was facinated at the scuba diving scene and the divers  later walking over the hill: the sound-track crackling from the metal box  with holes in it.  But from then on I had my little hands clasped over my  eyes. I peeked, wide eyed, between my fingers, three times and 30 years  later I still remember those three scenes. And that of my younger brother,  whimpering, next to me. I peeked for the "meathook" scene and  became paralyzed with fear. My brother started screaming.
2000. Tulsa,  Oklahoma. I know, as an adult, the movie stinks but can hardly wait till  springing it on my own children.(who says parenting can't be fun?)  If I am  lucky, I can also find the movie poster and frame it in our home theatre.  I give the movie a 4  and may my children forgive me as I forgave my  father. (my brother, however, is still in therapy)
