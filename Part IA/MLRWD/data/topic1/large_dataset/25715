I dont know where the credit goes, to Charlie Kauffman, George Clooney, or Chuck Barris. This was a brilliant biography portrayed so brilliantly that I dont know what to do with myself. I have seen the movie multiple times and it only gets better.

  As a movie in film history, one can see its embrace of the independent film genre and film noir. Cinematography and dialogue with a brilliant story and character make this movie an instant classic.

  One might not see how it can be so good. After reading multiple books of Nabokov prior to watching the film, I think I can appreciate it more. Unfortunately just reading random books of his will not do the trick.

  A ridiculous amount of parallels can be found between Confessions and one of Nabokov's most veteran works, Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle.

  Both are autobiographies (Nabokov's is fictional of course), both have the same general tense, dark, intellectual mood, and most importantly both refer to creating something new (TV shows in this movie and books in Ada or Ardor) as child rearing. I am sure there are more but these are all I can remember besides direct quotes and references to Nabokov.

  Hopefully this will enlighten some people on how deep this film really goes. I see it almost as paying homage to an author the way he would like it. indirectly :)
