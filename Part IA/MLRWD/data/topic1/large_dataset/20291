I will just write a quick review of this film on Blu-ray which just came out this week.

One of Ray Harryhausen's Classics "Mysterious Island" was released this week on Blu-ray by Screen Archives Entertainment in Virginia. This was a limited release of 3000 discs. It's possible that Sony is finding that many of their older films are not selling on blu-ray as they had hoped and are possibly not going to release them in that format or maybe this is just an agreement between Sony, Screen Archives Entertainment and Twilight Time to release some of their film library pretty much like other film companies do with Image Entertainment and Criterion. It's possible Sony may release "Mysterious Island" on blu-ray later but who knows?

Since the release is limited the price may seem high at $34.95 plus shipping but the blu-ray is a beautiful transfer with much more detail and completely color corrected. Watching the blu-ray in comparison to the DVD you can see instantly how the DVD colors had faded. It also has the isolated stereo Bernard Herrmann score on the disc as well.

If you are not put off by the higher price or "Mysterious Island" is a blu-ray you must have then don't hesitate. The blu-ray is a beautiful high definition transfer of this Ray Harryhausen Classic.
