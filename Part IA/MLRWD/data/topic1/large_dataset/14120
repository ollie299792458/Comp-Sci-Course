...On my side I can't but admit, that the movie is really very "warm" and is for sensitive people. To my mind the 1st episode of the trilogy is the most touching, I mean the tenderness of the ild couple. The 2nd is sort of experimental, as the young feminist doesn't really know, that she would like a sexual experience with the female (though I believe she hadn't any serious sexual experience till that moment at all). The last story attracted me by the part Sharon Stone played, I haven't thought that after all the men-tempting roles she would do smth like that. There is no doubt, that she played very naturally but it all seemed to be like a big funny game about a child, and not a real problem that female (as well as male) couples face.
I believe it looks like a scientific analysis, and not like a review, but I wanted to express myself somehow. All I wanted to say is this - if you are sensitive enough to feel the tenderness and beauty of love, you should see this movie, and it doesn't really matter, wether it is love between the representatives of the same sex or "normal" relations. (Though I think a woman is more capaple to feel what the other woman wants, than men). I hope you enjoyed the movie too!
