I have noticed that some people have really hated this movie and called it really bad.  I don't think that this is the case.  A really bad movie can still be entertaining because you end up laughing at the movie.  With that in mind, I don't think that Must Love Dogs is a bad movie.  I think it is just mediocre.

There are some bright spots to the movie: my favorite being when Lane's father reads from W.B. Yeats.  The problem is that through most of the rest of the movie, I sat on my couch wondering what the weather was like outside, what I should get my mother for Christmas, and what I should make for supper.  Rarely, if ever, did my attention focus on the movie.  The biggest reason is that I didn't care about the characters.  Given that the leading parts are played by extremely good actors, I have to assume that the movie fell apart in a different place: the direction, the editing, the script, or a combination of all three.  I tend to believe that it is the later.  There are some scenes that are cut off before they can really resonate emotionally.  Other scenes are drug out so long that if you cared about them to begin with, you have totally forgotten why you cared by the time you get to the end.

Ultimately, this had the potential to be an entertaining and enjoyable movie; however, too many things were botched.  If you are a really big Cusack or Lane fan or extremely bored, you might want to pick this up at your local rental store, but I definately would not recommend buying it.  It just isn't a movie that needs to be in anyone's collection.
