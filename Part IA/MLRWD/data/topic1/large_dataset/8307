This movie probably has an audience, but I found it unbearable.  I'll tell you what it's got to offer without spoiling it for you, but you should know better than to watch this.  I knew better from the first twenty minutes, but I watched the rest anyway.  Maybe that's why I felt the need to write this.  Hoping that writing this review will be cathartic.

So what does Havoc have to offer?  There's a down side to spoil everything resembling a good point.

Anne Hathaway is easy on the eyes.  However, you'll have to look past the silly actions taken by her character - the motivations of these are never reasonably explored.  Are privileged teens from affluent families really this irrational out of boredom?  Steven Soderburg did more to show a realistic portrait of this kind of downward spiral with Erika Christensen's character in Traffic.  So don't look to Havoc for realistic characters.

The Beverly Hills guys are funny with their gangsta act, but their predictability gets tiresome.  They're all pretty much the same character (ie a stereotype of the white teenager trying to act gangsta).  The movie Whiteboyz covers this territory more ably.

Moral panic inspiring scenes where teens engage in risky behavior are peppered throughout the movie.  They just aren't very well done.  These scenes seem to be played more for titillation than for realism or drama.  Gross.  These looked like pastiches of scenes from Larry Clark's 1995 movie Kids.  However, Havoc fails to project the same sickening nihilism that is found in Clark's movie.  And here is the ultimate problem with Havoc.  Like a B horror movie, it's not real enough to be scary.  What's the point then?

The characters aren't interesting or realistically written.  The situations are flimsy contrivances.  Nothing surprising actually happens.  You'll have to watch Havoc yourself to make the call, though.  I watched it all of the way through, and maybe that's why I'm so bitter today.
