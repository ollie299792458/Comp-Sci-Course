The supposed plot: Earth has been invaded and destroyed. The main characters father foresaw this and set up a large ship equipped with everything to start a new one populated by all the plants and the animals (Etc) on the first. Naturally there is some opposition to this plan primarily from  an alein race called the Drej. That's the plot in a nutshell.

Lot of potential right?

The conflict always starts with betrayal. ALWAYS.  Everybody betrays everybody else.  Seriously. after the second betrayal I was alright, I figured that everyone  with the group of heroes was loyal and that they weeded out all the rats but NO The cycle of betrayal continues until only the main Character and his love intrest are left.I understand that this element is put into films to evoke surprise when a good guy suddenly goes bad but when someone betrays the group every ten minutes  It makes the plot even more idiotic an predictable.I honestly wondered if someone with a severe mental defect wrote the script.

The animation is unimaginative.  You've got your typical  blond-haired  overly muscular troublemaker with a cliche past,
A cynical heroine, An ugly looking sophisticated alien and of course someone who assumes the role of the father the protagonist never had for very long. Pfft.The Drej look awesome but despite glowing there really isn't much to them. They don't even have an intelligible language just audible gurgling noises with subtitles. That's one of the most pathetic things I've ever seen.

The heroes succeed and the protagonist decides to name the planet Bob after his father.  He (of course) gets the girl and the movie ends.

It's a pathetic poor excuse for  a movie, plot, and script  that depends on the same plot devcice for progression.

Don't buy, Don't rent. Don't watch.
