I'm a huge fan of Gintama, and I was really excited to listen to the English dub for the first time. But I was a bit disappointed in it, don't get me wrong it's an okay dub but there are a lot of times where they pronounced some of the names or words wrong. And some of the translation from the original audio wasn't exactly right in some spots either. There was also some parts where listening to the voice actors made me cringe but that's just because I'm so used to the Japanese voice actors. Not everything about the English dub is bad though, I thought they had some of the characters voices spot on.

If you are not familiar with the series, this movie could be a bit confusing and some of the jokes are hard to get if you don't have knowledge of Japanese culture. If you like this movie definitely check out the series if you haven't already. I think next time I watch this movie it'll be with Japanese audio w/ subtitles, the English dub is just too different from what I'm used to, but then again that's just me.
