The impressive cover of this supposed documentary got me thinking this might be another "Planet Earth" at a much lower price, so I took a chance on it. Boy, was I ever disappointed and angry. The quality of the production isn't even close the the Planet Earth series; the narrative is simplistic and flawed (especially with it's constant focus on a biased and flawed view of the earth's environment). It's not well produced or written and seems to just jump around without a story line or interesting treatment of the topics in the titles. The environmental agenda pushed in this series just made me angry! I struggled to watch the episodes as they continued to pour out their propaganda into many of them! I'm not anti-environment, I'm just a sensible person who recycles, doesn't kill birds and animals for sport, uses water sparingly, drives a very high mpg vehicle, and tries to make my "footprint" on each as light as possible. But if the environmental propaganda is your thing, you may be able to stomach this disappointing series. I'm tired of finding most of today's science and environmental information (nature documentaries, etc.) laced with propaganda which is an unfair portrayal of the truth -- I was so angry at giving money to these idiots I had to return the series and get my money back! I should have read the reviews of the series by previous purchasers. I probably would have been given a "heads up" about making a purchasing mistake. I usually always read the Amazon reviews on things before I make a purchasing decision. When I find a 5 star rating by a dozen or more people, usually it means that the product can be trusted to be well done, accurate and fair, and a good investment. Because I failed to check the ratings first, I got burned. Fortunately, I was able to return it and get my money back. Don't waste your money!
