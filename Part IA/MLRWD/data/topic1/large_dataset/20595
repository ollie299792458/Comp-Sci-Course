This concert from the Mac is essential for two reasons:  1) you get to hear/see the songs left off from the Dance CD and 2) it was probably the last time Christine McVie toured with the band.  Even if you aren't a fan of Christine's songs, her voice beautifully fills in the 3-part harmonies that made Fleetwood Mac so famous.  And those 3-part harmonies were sorely missed on FM's latest album and tour (Say You Will), as good as that record and tour were.
The Dance concert is amazing from start to finish.  There's not a dud in the entire set, although naturally some songs are better than others. (Stevie's Sweet Girl, for instance, while pleasant enough, sounds like a cast-off from her solo albums, and it may very well have been just that.) A few comments:
--Great version of The Chain!  Lindsey, Stevie, and Chris at their harmonizing best.
--Gold Dust Woman rocks.  Stevie really gets into this one and we get a chilling "scream."  They should have bumped Dreams off the CD and included GDW.  Really.
--One of the best versions of Gypsy I've ever heard.  Again, should have been on the CD.
--Buckingham shines on his two acoustic efforts, Big Love and Go Insane.  You really get to see what that man can do with a guitar.  Wow.
--Both Say You Love Me and Everywhere sound better than ever.  The banjo gives Say you Love Me some extra playfulness.
--Rhiannon, great as always, but I much prefer the "Dream on, silly dreamer" version. :(
--Silver Springs - what can I say?  Chilling and intense.
--Encore of Tusk, Don't Stop, and Songbird is a great all-around effort.
Finally, a comment on some of the reviewers' observations that Christine McVie looks bored.  Yes, she's more subdued than Nicks, Buckingham, and Fleetwood.  But in a band of the eccentric and insane Buckingham and the twirling rock goddess Nicks, someone has to play it cool.
