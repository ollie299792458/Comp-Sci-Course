Fantastic!  Tiny Toon fans have been waiting for years to see this out on DVD.
For those not as familiar, Tiny Toon Adventures (TTA) was a weekday cartoon that came out in the early 1990s.  It's animation and story lines were wonderful, contrasted with the majority of poorer quality animated shows of the time.
The "next generation" of Looney Tunes (not baby versions of the originals), TTA kept what made toons fun, while leaving most of the old overdone formulas behind.  While enjoyable for kids, it also had a lot of jokes and references that made the show as much fun for adults as well.  In fact most of the people I knew who watched TTA were young adults, including myself.  But don't bother trying to convince the marketing people of that.  Fortunately the writers and animators knew their audience.
I've seen some box art for this elsewhere, and have to say I think they could significantly improve it, if going to be more appealing to its fans.  But don't let it dissuade you from checking the show out.
Overall one of my favorite cartoon series, and as much fun for us big kids as for the young ones.  I'm looking forward to having it on DVD!
