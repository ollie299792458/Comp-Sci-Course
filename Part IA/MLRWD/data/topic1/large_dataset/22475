GLORY is a grreat movie based on the 54th Regimen in the Civil War, (one of the first all black Regimen).  Based on the diary of Col. Robert Shaw, this is a great movie for all and a great helper for the classroom (trust me, thanks to this movie I aced my American History final with ease).  
Matthew Broderick is young Col. Robert Shaw and he has been apointed to lead one of the first all black regimens following news of the Emancipation Proclamation made by President Abraham Lincoln.  From there, it follows all of his diary entries and his letters to home, showing the pride of soldiers and the strength to win a war.  Plus with the strong supporting cast of Carey Elwes, Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, GLORY is a strong, dramatic and in some parts touching movie.
I have to admit I was a skeptic when I heard that Matthew Broderick was going to be a lead in this movie because when I think Matthew Broderick, I think FERRIS BUELER.  Broderick really showed that he is a true actor in this movie and he did a very good job.  Denzel really showed why he won his Best Supporting Actor with his role and this movie and as usual, Morgan Freeman did very well.  
Now of course, this is the Civil War era and the N word is thrown around a lot.  In most cases, it's used out of context in a racist and/or derogatory way.  You have to get past that because as unfortunate as it is, that was a part of history.  A very unfortunate part of history but still it's there.  Again, this is a movie about war and this movie does push the horrors of war in your face.  Nowhere near as bad as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but the depiction of war in this movie is very strong as well.  This is a great movie and a great recommendation to any and all history buffs or to anyone that's interested in the African American approach to the Civil War.
