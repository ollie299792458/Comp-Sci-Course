First of all, let me say that I totally agree with most other reviewers in saying that Plan 9 from Outer Space is simply one of the greatest movies of all time for the simple reason that it is arguably the worst movie of all time.  What more can I add to what's already been said?  But I do have a question that perhaps other reviewers can help me answer.  I also have an observation to make.

  In the "big scene" about halfway through where Eros brings Tor onboard the Mother Ship" to show off to The Leader, he starts off by giving his report.  The Leader is upset and says "You are many days late.", to which Eros replies, "It was unavoidable."  Immediately at that point, The Leader lets out a low burping-type sound that seems to be totally out of place with the dialogue.  I have replayed this many times over and I have absolutely no idea what he is trying to do.  Perhaps another reviewer can shed light on this.

  Finally, I also have an observation to offer.  Later in the same scene, The Leader asks Eros about the other dead ones that he has risen.  Eros replies, "One is a woman, the other an old man."  I can't help but chuckle when John Breckinridge, or as he was known to his friends "Bunny" Breckinridge says with a little gleam in his eye, "An old man you say?"  Hmmmm.
