This movie is awesome in some aspects, and there are a few things that I didn't like. Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are excellent in this movie - the chemistry between them is awesome! Personally, I think that the relationship between Aaron and Marta is much sweeter than what's between Jason and Marie. The romance (not overly drastic) between Aaron and Marta is tender and inspiring; I like Aaron and Marta's characters better overall than Jason and Marie's too. Jason was really cold in the first Bourne movies, while Aaron is sensitive and caring. And no offense to people who like Marie from the first Bourne movies, but you can't even compare Marie with Marta- Rachel Weisz plays a much better character.
On another note, this movie is a bit hard to follow and is a bit confusing, but if you take it as a side-story to Bourne, and you know the creators (people that are the heads of different government-based programs) of these super-humans are hunting one of their "creations" down, and you're there for the ride, it's awesome. (I saw this movie three times in theaters) I'm not much of a fan for the ending of this movie either - I think it is too abrupt like the writers couldn't decide what to do next with the story line.

Thus my rating is: Acting- 5 stars; Plot- 3 stars; Action- 5 stars; so overall is 4 to 4.5 stars.

I can't wait to get this movie on DVD!
