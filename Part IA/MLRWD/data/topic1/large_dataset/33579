The behide the seens interviews will
gave you give you new insight into the

If you are a bit of a history buff.

  >>P.S. If you are a ture fan and cannot spend
  that much money. You might want to check out
  Ecaflowne - The Series (The Perfect Collection.)
  The 8 DVD's I got said Banda Entertainment Productions.
  I think the only different between,
  Escaflowne - The Series (Limited  Edition Boxed Set)
  and Escaflowne - The Series (The Perfect Collection)
  is this one comes with the black action figure
  falling under Pioneer and the one by Banda comes
  the un-cut movie other-wise I think they are the same.
  I hope that helped Bye!  :-)
