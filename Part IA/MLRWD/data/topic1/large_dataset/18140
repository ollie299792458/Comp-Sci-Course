I don't know how it is that I never saw this film when it came out, but in a way I'm glad I didn't as I wouldn't have been old enough to appreciate it.

Meryl Streep is astonishing. She and the scenery are the best thing about this movie. The woman is a born mimic and her Danish accent threw me off so much that I had to keep looking at her to make sure it was really her.

The movie, as pointed out elsewhere, is slow to start. Audiences today wouldn't give it the time... which would be a pity, because it's a beautiful love story played out against the drama of Africa during the early 20th century.

The score by John Barry is stunning. It did catch me off guard that it was not more heavily influenced by African instruments, but since it is a love story, that is what John Barry achieved, and gorgeously so.

The only weak link in the film is Robert Redford. I don't think he can act, and I don't know why it is that Meryl took the time and trouble to get a perfect Danish accent, while Redford, acting as a British man, didn't even take an elocution lesson with a proper British speaker.

But Meryl Streep was so superb that even though the love story is between her and Redford, she, and what she went through and experienced and felt, all so clear on that magnificent face, overshadow all of Redford's weaknesses.

If you can be patient through the first 30 minutes are so, you will be rewarded. An excellent film.
