Perfume: The Story of a Murder is a fresh and stunning film which effectively combines the best of the world of cinema. From the opening title sequence to the credit reel, the film moves flawlessly from scene to scene painting a picture with careful strokes, creating breath-taking images (scenes outside Grasse in the lavender fields, architecture in Paris[Prague]). The story is masterfully tailored to the confines of a feature length film and the actors capture the time period and feel of the movie very well. The best aspect of this film, however, is the orchestrated musical score. Not only does this music strongly fit within the atmosphere of the movie, it adds an element to the film which takes it beyond another mysterious thriller film. What's more, this score has legs of its own - as an independent collection of music it is representative of some of the best contemporary classical music compositions.The tension and harmony of the film are perfectly captured and distilled in the themes of the score.

While I will continue to accept the ending of this film/book the way it is, I wished for less of a departure from Grenouille's behaviors prior to the last eighth of the story. I think the fanaticism and surreal tones of that section take this film out of a five-star category, but the redeeming qualities remain.
