This movie is an account of flight United 93 during the attack on the U.S. during 9/11.

There was sort of an eerie feel to watching it, knowing what the end would be and knowing that it was a true account.  The movie really drew you in.  I found my heart just breaking for the people aboard that plane and cannot imagine the emotions they must have felt for such a long period of time.  Their courage was nothing short of remarkable.

A couple of things I didn't like about the movie however, one was many of the scenes in the airport tower I couldn't hear, they had the background noise of people talking too loud and it was very difficult to decipher background noise from the main person talking.

Also, I didn't care for the ending, yes it was dramatic, but there was a sense of "is this movie really over now?"  Not sure what I expected from the ending, but it just didn't feel done.

Overall, it was very well done and truly nothing we should ever forget.  My heart goes out to each family who lost loved ones.
