I will start off by saying that I expected a little bit more from this movie, especially since Tommy Lee Jones usually is a guarantee of a good movie. Benicio Del Toro has also done some pretty good movies in the past. This movie is mediocre. The plot is old, and I would say pretty much used up.
The movie is about the ex-special forces trainer L.T. Bonham (played by Tommy Lee Jones) being called in to assist the FBI in tracking down an elusive killer. Several deer hunters have been viciously murdered in the woods of Oregon and Washington, and it appears to be the work of a skilled assassin. L.T. takes on the task of tracking down Aaron Hallham (Benicio Del Toro), which in his past life (working for the military as a civilian expert) he has trained in survival and assassination techniques.
The whole movie is full of little annoying glitches that take away from the credibility of the movie and makes it all seem quite far-fetched, occasionally even bordering on corny. It is a cross between "The Fugutive" and "First Blood (Rambo)," but sadly, it doesn't hold a candle to either.
There is the bad boy that is a highly skilled killing machine that is running around in the woods and in the city (Did anyone say Rambo?), being chased by the good guy, which has almost superhuman tracking skills (The Fugitive?).
I enjoyed the action in the movie, and the actors are good. Ordinarily this would be exactly my type of movie, but due to the corny plot and poor execution, I only give it 3 stars!!!
