This movie is perhaps the worst adaptation of a Shakespeare play that I have ever seen.  The solid acting cannot save this film from it's horrible script.  It is simply an awful adaptation.  All of the beauty of the orignial play is lost in the contrived unbelievable resetting of the story.  It feels like a stupid teen movie meets Shakespeare and it results in a movie that just feels wrong.
An easy comparison is to the modern adaptation of Romeo and Juliet which many people interested in this movie may have seen.  R&amp;J is an extremely stylized film and alhtough it is modernized, it retains the orginial location and manages to incorporate Shakespeare's beautiful words in some very creative ways.  It comes off as a very faithful and unique adaptation.
This movie fails in every way the modern R&amp;J succeeded.  It rapes Shakespeare's original play.
I think the best way to watch this might be just to forget that it's based on Shakespeare's Othello at all.  Then the story and acting might be bearable.  Still, I could not help to find this movie simply devoid of entertainment value, realism, and faith to the play that inspired it
