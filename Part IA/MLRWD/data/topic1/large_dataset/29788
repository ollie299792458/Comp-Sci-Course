Alright, if your reading this review, then you either already own this DVD and want to know what others think, or you are on the fence about buying this. if you are part of the latter, then let me just tell you...this is worth every penny. If you liked the Simpsons, Futurama, South Park, or pretty much any cartoon series worth watching, you'll love this from beginning to end. Each episode contains random points of hilarity and enough hidden jokes to justify rewatching each episode many many times. The way Baby Stewie always seems to have the right thing to say is unbelivable. As a brief example, In one of the episodes, Brian and Stewie are holed up in a motel trying to get to sleep. In the next room, all you can hear is a drug deal stammering along. So, frustrated Stewie says: There's only one way to end this..."He's WEARING A WIRE!!". The deal ends in a shootout, and stewie gets to rest. its moments like this that make Family Guy a show few can resist and something all true fans of cartoon series should have on thier shelves.
