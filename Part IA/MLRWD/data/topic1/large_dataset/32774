Main source: "Predatory Dinosaurs of the World" by

Gregory S. Paul. He trained as a pen-and-ink artist

a la Audabon, then switched to paleontology. He was

one of the prime movers in understanding that many

predatory dinosaurs owed more to the leopard than to

the man-in-a-rubber-suit.

Granted, some of the "person scenes" in this Godzilla

are like fingernails on the chalkboard. However, some

of the human scenes are very good. Jean Reno in particular

is excellent in this movie. See Burton's "Planet of the Apes"

for an interesting contrast in responsibility.

CGI? Let me just say that to my (limited) knowledge, this

is the only Godzilla movie with underground scenes. And they

give me dreams. No man in a rubber suit ever, ever, moved

like this Godzilla. I should be so Animal.

And yes, Hank Azaria's character is named Animal, and he has

one or two good scenes, and his name is kind of a tag for little

kids who may not get the viewpoint of this movie.

Bottom lines: Empathy. I hate to say it, but the Godzilla series

was never strong on empathy. This Godzilla allows you relate to

the Creature; *if* you want to.

In particular, there is one scene, in a storm, where Godzilla

climbs like a leopard up near the top of a skyscraper.

Lightning is flashing, thunder is rolling. Then the Creature leans

its head back, and does that sky-saw-guitar roar thing.

I hope you can relate to the "I'm alive" thing :-)
