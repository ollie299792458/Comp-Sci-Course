With top acting, directing and production values, it's a shame Rob Reiner and his writer put liberal posturing over all else in The American President.  Instead of providing Douglas with a worthly conservative foe, the lazy script practically puts a big "S" on Douglas' chest while presenting the Richard Dreyfuss character (of course the only conservative in the movie) as a shallow, manipulative bully.  The nadir of the movie, though, is when Douglas' character utters the line about american voters that they will drink sand in the desert "...because they don't know the difference."  So there, Reiner and writer Sorkin think the average american voter in an imbecile--just what you would expect from the unfettered narcissism of Hollywood.

So, does the movie work?  As a romantic comedy, it skates by on the undeniable charisma and chemistry of the leads.  And no one said Reiner wasn't a slick director, moving his movie along at a brisk pace.  If you have a liberal bent, you'll probably love this movie beyond question.  If you are remotely conservative...or even moderate...you'll rate it o.k.
