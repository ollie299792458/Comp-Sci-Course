I am not the biggest Petty fan.  In fact I only own his Greatest Hits CD.  After watching him play in the Super Bowl, I went and bought this DVD set for the 30th anniversary concert DVD.  I was not too keen on watching a 4 hour long documentary, but thought since I own the DVD's, I should watch it at least once.

OMG, was I wrong... 4 hours just flew by.  What an amazing documentary.  No narration what so ever, this is the true story of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers as told by the band members themselves, through old cam corder and tv footage.  Celebrities such as Dave Grohl, Eddie Vedder and Johnny Depp (all fans of Petty) make appearances.

It was very sad to see that the world is just about making fast selling music and not long lasting music.  That's what makes Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers one of the last acts of it's kind!

To sum it up, I am not a die hard Petty fan, but this documentary is probably the one of the best out there.  I certainly appreciate and respect TP a lot more now.
