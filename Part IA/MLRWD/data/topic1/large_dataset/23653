I hear that scenes were cut from the original print so as to get a "R" rating, for what it's worth. Now on with the review. Small town with a dark past of a bloody Valentine's Day murder tries and rebounds some 20 years later with another Valentine's Day celebration.......AND SO IT BEGINS....with the killings that it is. There's plenty of death to be had here complete with a spooky setting (a mine shaft). The ultimate problem with this film is the fact that the original killer does not return somehow, to kill again and make good on his promise of yore. The orginal murder victim's SON does, however, and even escapes at the end thus setting up a sequal that never came. There are several really chilling scenes at work here and the film tries its best to be a top-shelf horror, but the final revealing of the killer was WAY too telegraphed to push it into the realm of better than average films of its genre (Nightmare..., Halloween, Friday the 13th..) nor does it match other less-slasher, thriller type movies such as The Fog (with its beautiful ambience). At best My Bloody Valentine will be relegated to a second or third-rate horror film that could have easily been much better.
