Halle Berry should have won and an academy award for this one.  Her acting talents really show through in this film.  Not only is she a very talented and smart actress in my book but also have you ever noticed no matter how messed up her hair is or how dirty she looks in any of her films she still has that natural beauty (even without makeup) that offsets all the dirt and other garbage that Hollywood tries to use.  What a flawless face.  Anyway , she portrays a psychiatrist/doctor in the film who treats a specific patient (Penelope Cruz)for mental disturbance who is possesssed by a ghost entitie which eventually she (Halle Berry) will encounter later in the movie.  The twist/plot shift in this movie IS GREAT.  I never would have guessed.  She has a car accident and is accused of killing her husband.  Thats all I am saying.  I don't want to go into the specifics of this film because that would ruin it for someone who has never seen it.  All I can say is that this is the type of movie that I could watch time and time again.  I do not see how someone could rate this film a one or two star film.  This DVD will have a place on my shelf after I go out and buy it.  I LOVED THIS MOVIE.
