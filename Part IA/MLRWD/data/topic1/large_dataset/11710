I've loved this movie ever since I saw its first release back in the early 1980s! It is, to me, the perfect type of horror flick. It is genuinely creepy without the overdose of profanity, blood, guts and gore so typical of today's genre films. The creepy atmosphere of the film's location adds much to the suspense of the film. I would not spend one moment in the house in which they reside.

What I like about the film is the despair that Bette Davis' character feels after losing her daughter without a trace some 25 years earlier. This is not just a horror flick, but a mystery film as well; every moment Ms. Davis is on screen her sadness is conveyed with skill. I cannot imagine the pain of losing a child, but in this film's case she was not even afforded the simple knowledge of knowing what led to her daughter Karen's disappearance. Actually, I like all of the performances in this film, although I think a few of the scenes feel a bit forced.

Another aspect that is quite effective are the use of wide angle lens whenever the "watcher" is present. All in all, each of the film's elements including the sound and special effects add immensely to the creep-out factor of this movie. I noticed some of the other reviewers here feel the ending was a bit of a letdown. I totally disagree! The hairs on my arms stand up every time I see the film's climax. I actually get goosebumps watching the final moments.

This is the kind of horror film that I like best (much like George C. Scott's 'The Changeling,' also released around the same time). 'Watcher in the Woods' is creepy and scary, yet not to the point that I wouldn't be able to sleep afterwards. This may not sound like a compliment (but it is), this is a great (safe) horror flick! It can be enjoyed by young teens and adults as well. It is on my list of my very favorite of films; I strongly recommend it!
