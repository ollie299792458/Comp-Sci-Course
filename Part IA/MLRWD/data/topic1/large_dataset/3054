Broadcast news is a fantastic example of great mid-80's mainstream comedy. It'd make a fantastic double-feature with Tootsie, with which it shares a bunch of traits, like:
- an incredible cast of supporting actors.
- a bunch of seemingly throwaway lines and situations that make you belly laugh at the time and then creep up on you later.
- some moderately serious (simple) questions, asked in an effortlessly funny way.
- a particular sort of mid 80's look and feel. (I was surprised to feel a little nostalgic while watching this again.)
Holly Hunter is amazing in this movie, just amazing and charismatic and lovable and genuine, and Albert Brooks brings a real(ly funnily neurotic) pathos to his corner of the love triangle. Bill Hurt never really comes clear for me in anything, but like Brooks, he's perfectly cast here. (It's creepy that Hurt gets top billing on Amazon and the DVD box. Among the three main characters, his easily pulls the least weight. Holly Hunter's the emotional center of everything in this movie, she's making the choices and carrying every scene, and her name should go first.)
After you watch this one, tell me if you think Cher, in Moonstruck, deserved the Best Actress Oscar over Holly Hunter in Broadcast News (and Meryl Streep in Out of Africa). Yeesh.
