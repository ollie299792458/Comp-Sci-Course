Lady and the Tramp-its that magical movie that I have loved since I was little (I'm only 13 here). I always thought the movie had everything. Drama, Romance, Comedy, you name it! I absolutly love the orchestra and the music (Peggy Lee is one of my all time favorite singers, so she gives the songs a fresh taste, unlike many Disney flicks). I think the animation of Lady and the Tramp is stunning still to this very day! Yes, aside from how much I love this film, Disney finally released this masterpiece on their Platium Collection line featuring enhanced audio and sound plus the best digital restoration you could possibly have! I very much enjoyed watching the movie in its original widescreen format (since I owned the cruddy VHS with full screen). Watching the whole movie again just overjoyed me so much!

Even though I had a blast watching it, there was one downside.

In Bella Notte, when the choir is singing the song, they took out the beautiful orchestra and made the choir accapella. I thought it kind of ruined the whole scene (heck, it does always make you want to cry!)

Bonus Feature wise, Virtual Puppy didn't work on my sister's computer but it worked on mine (the game is a little addicting). We were a little dissapointed that Peg wasn't put in one of the puppies to adopt! lol. The board game was a little irritating because you HAVE to have seen all of these movies to play. I love all of the behind the scenes rare footage!

This DVD is a must have for anyone! Its a classic! The Greatest Disney movie of all time.
