I was going to buy movies 1 and 3, but this set was a but cheaper in the end, so I grabbed it. My personal opinions on the quality of these films is 1, 3, 4/2. 2 and 4 are tied.

Video quality: All movies are 2.39:1. Live Free or Die Hard Is certainly the best-looking, but no real surprise. One looks the poorest, since it was not remastered. 2 and 3 are fine. not super-awesome, but good.

Audio quality: A mix of Dolby and DTS. naturally, DTS sounds better. Being a newer recording, 4 sounds the best of the set, and 1 the poorest. I really hoped that the levels would have been fixed for the original, but no.

The originally still a favourite movie for me, even after all these years. All-in-all a very good action movie set. If you want a more detailed review, just look at individual reviews.

I never look at the extras, so I cannot comment on that. The packaging is pretty good and discs pop in and out securely; not too easy, not too hard. they stay in place and are raised from the surface - something i really hate about too-thin disc cases.
