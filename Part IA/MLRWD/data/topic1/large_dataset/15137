A Place in the Sun is a movie about classes-the have's and the have-nots. It displays the struggle of a man haunted by a choice at a major fork in his life's road.
Montgomery Clift was an excellent choice to play George Eastman because he was foreign(fish out of water) and that added to the mysterious element. Dark, handsome and mysterious. His poor choices lead him to a self-appointed hell-being an affair with one of the working class women in his Uncle's factory to pass his time. The plot thickens when he finally meets the object of his affection, a wealthy young socialite(a very young Liz Taylor)and she unexpectedly falls in love with him.
His co-worker announces she's pregnant and he falls into a state of torturous gloom...plotting for her demise so that he can be with his socialite and live the glamorous life.
Set in the 50's-you can feel the pressure of the out-of wedlock child which would not have had the same impact as in present society. But the class division still rings true.
