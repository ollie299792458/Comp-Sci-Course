Set in the distant future, a spaceship carrying some 40 people, mostly ones wanting to settle on other planets from their own, hits a meteor shower and crash lands on a distant planet killing all but about a dozen of them. The survivors, led by the second-in-command Carolyn Fry, find themselves on a hot and humid landscape with constant sunlight from three orbiting suns. The marooned passengers soon learn that escaped convict Riddick isn't the only thing they have to fear. Every 22 years, the planet's three suns go into a total eclips and cause a 'lasting darkness' where the darkness brings out the planet's real inhabitants; Deadly creatures that lurk in the shadows, waiting to attack in the dark. It is the 22nd year and the planet is rapidly plunging into the utter blackness of a total eclips. With the body count rising, the doomed survivors are forced to turn to Riddick with his special eyes to guid them through the darkness to safety. With time running out, there's only one rule: Stay in the light.
