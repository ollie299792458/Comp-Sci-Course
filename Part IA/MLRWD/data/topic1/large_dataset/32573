I recently watched Hoosiers for the first time, which is somewhat surprising since I'm such a big Gene Hackman fan. Unfortunately, even the venerable Mr. Hackman was no match for the colossal awfulness of Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack for this movie. What the hell were the producers thinking? Nearly every scene is musically manhandled, telegraphing to audience which of two things they should be feeling: maudlin sentimentality or triumphantly "goin' places!". The insufferable bombast of 1980's over-production that begat John Tesh, in particular the gallons of gated reverb assigned to the synthetic drums (this is supposed to be 1952, for crying out loud) ultimately sank this movie for me. Hackman and Hopper both turn in solid performances and the supporting cast is decent, but along with a few inexplicable story turns (we never have the slightest clue why the bitchy character played by Barbara Hershey falls in love with Hackman's Norman Dale, for instance), the dreadful score drops what could have been a four-star movie to a two. I can only assume that tacking a "modern" (at the time) soundtrack onto an otherwise fairly likeable period piece was contrived to drive movie-goers into the cineplex.
In hindsight the overall effect is regretably and awesomely awful.
