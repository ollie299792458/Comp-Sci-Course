This movie is so endearing when you first watch it.  I was in my pre-teens when I first watched The Parent Trap and for awhile I couldn't get enough of it.  Finally, when I turned 19, my parents bought it on DVD for me as a birthday present.  I do not get to watch my movies much, but I love this one.  It is one I never did grow out of yet and I don't think I ever will.  It is the story about two twin daughters, Susan and Sharon, who meet at a summer camp and find out that they are twins.  They then come up with a plan to switch places to bring their separated parents, Mitch and Maggie, back together.  Susan goes to Boston and tries act like a refined young lady while Sharon goes out west to be a tom-boy girl.  They run into some problems, but they are able to bring their parents back together in the end.  This is a funny, loving, and a wonderful movie to watch, especially for young teenage girls.  It may be some-what out-dated, but it is still a great and touching movie.  Please, parents, if you are shopping for your young girl, buy this movie for them.  I enjoyed it.
