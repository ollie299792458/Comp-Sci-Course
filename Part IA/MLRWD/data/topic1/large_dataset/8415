Sorry for the two star rating, but even though we find the Family Guy "FREAKIN' SWEET," this DVD was really nothing more than an expanded version of three "Family Guy" episodes.***  As far as the "uncensored" scenes go, we did NOT have that option on our DVD, and the "cuss" words were "bleeped," which was a bit annoying considering we were expecting "Family Guy Uncensored."...regardless, there really was not much that would have been different from any other Family Guy episode that we would have watched on the television.  And so what if it is a cartoon:  the episode in which Stewie DOES search for his father left us with more questions than answers!  Now THAT'S a comment/observation from a total Family Guy fanatic who is probably reading waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much into this otherwise FAB creation.  We love the Family Guy, but be warned:  Unless you are a complete Family Guy devotee', do not expect much more than what you already get on television.

***It so happens that tonight's Family Guy Season Finale (05-21-06) is this particular Family Guy "vignette"--just as thought in the original personal review...
