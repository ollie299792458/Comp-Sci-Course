... and not the way I wanted her to.

This was a very badly done film. Regardless of what you were thinking going into the movie, about the Chaos comic book or just a pretty anime you saw at the store or some random DVD you rented, this was a let-down. The animation reminded me of skittery copy-and-paste flash files on the internet mixed with a very badly recorded videotape of Thundercats in a lightning storm. The characters popped out of the landscape more often than not --- similar to a computer game or old cartoons where you can see what they're going to grab before they reach out for it. The landscape seemed flat, not unlike the characters, and the plotline reminded me of just why America should not produce "anime" films without major guidance.

Usually, I can handle mildly okay "anime" films... If the plot is bad, I appreciate the animation or vis versa. I had no choice. Lady Death was eloquently dressed, sure, but she also was a half step away from showing herself to the whole demon population. I'm not sure I understand why she even changed into PJs... it's the same outfit... The wolves and insane horse were very cool, but Lady Death herself seemed awkward, with her quick transition to Goddess Figure from Sweet Swedish Maiden. She didn't seem to achieve much at the end of the movie, and I was not pleased she had a legion of troops, as originally she did not seem of that nature. And Niccolo? I have no idea what the producers were thinking with that one... he seemed pretty and feminine and at some points so fake I was thinking maybe in the movie he was truly someone else in disguise. No luck.

Overall, Lady Death is a film I suppose you could watch or rent or own if you really felt the need to see it once or again and again. If you want to oogle at a pretty woman bursting out of her clothing, then perhaps this is the film for you. If you want semi-decent animation and a coherent plotline, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.
