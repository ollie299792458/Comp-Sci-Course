Caddyshack is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and still laugh out loud. The movie is filled with jokes and coined phrases that I hear quoted everyday. Golfers all over use quotes from the movie on the golf course. Quotes such as "rat farts," and "be the ball." I really think this shows the movie's impact on those who watch it. Also, the plot is phenomenal and is so unlike any other movie you never grow tired of watching it. The plot is mostly composed of confrontations between characters. Examples would be Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) and Judge Smails (Ted Knight), also Carl (the greens keeper played by Bill Murray) vs. the gopher (puppet gopher). Not to mention Lacy Underall (Cindy Morgan) who makes quite an impact on Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe). This is not a movie just for those who enjoy the game of golf. Rather it is for anyone who seeks classic humor and wishes to understand what their buddies are laughing at when a quote is muttered from the movie. The aspect of the movie I like the most is the quick "one-liners" the movie is jam-packed with. They are just so clever and witty you can't help but repeat them.

Caddyshack first came out 1980, but is now on DVD and in excellent picture. The new DVD includes special features with outtakes, rare footage and interviews by Chevy Chase, Bill Murray and others. This movie is a wonderful buy and you will get your money's worth.
