i watched this film after watching many so- called disturbing movies.I am well educated, but had little knowledge of fascist Italy at the time of viewing.I was also aware of the controversy surrounding the film and its director at the time of viewing. Bearing all this in mind,I would suggest that any of these reviewers cannot seriously be suggesting that this is a "work of art, beautifully shot, very dangerous film, symbolic in meaning" etc.it just isn't. the film is littered with homosexuality, which in light of the fact that pasolini himself was gay is not surprising. the context in which it is presented I think is merely coincidental. i just think he crammed it in wherever possible. the scat is as revolting as you would imagine- in the days of no internet, i should imagine every scat freak out there would have gone to extreme lengths to see this.

This comes a cross as an in depth view of what fascists would get up to if allowed, and in that scope, has nothing new to offer- of course they will do depraved acts if they can get away with it.

It has little storyline to offer, the 2 stars are for the acting- the fascists are quiite convincing.

Overall, its poor, and anyone who thinks that im missing the point- im not. I did my fascist homework after viewing in order to see if i could substantiate any of the other reviewers positives, and guess what- i couldn't.

the violence is tame compared to some more modern films, although still relatively disturbing.
