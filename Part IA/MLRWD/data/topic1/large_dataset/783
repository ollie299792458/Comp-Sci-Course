OKay, I can understand where some people might view this movie as corny, hoaky, silly, and yes, perhaps even a bit naive.  But when they write a review saying that their inner child has died because of this particular flick, that is by FAR too harsh a statement.  This movie is really quite adorable, what with a mention of all your favorite characters from the originial NES game that launched an empire.  People don't seem to understand that this particular item is a movie, subject to marketing ploys and directorial lisence.  I mean, let's be serious, had the movie been made as cartoony as the game, what would we have had on our hands?  Garbage.  When present works of art in gaming are recreated for the silver screen, certain lisences and liberties are required to be taken, as more often than not, what you have is not enough to please a movie goer audience.

I loved this movie.  I was content to at least hear mention of all my favorite characters, and quite happy with the brand new plot.  In fact, the way that all the elemtents of a cartoony and silly game were incorporated into a made-for-an-older-audience movie was really quite ingenious.

See this movie, if only to allow yourself to reminisce.
