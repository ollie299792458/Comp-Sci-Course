This whole premise of this movie is false.  Spurlock's whole point in "Supersize Me" was in response to the courts finding that in order to prove that the food that McDonalds serves is not nutritionaly healthy one would have to eat nothing but that for a month which was a rediculous finding that the court assumed no one would put to the test.  So he did.  Also his whole point did not rest solely on whether he gained weight or lost weight, but that the diet was incredibly unhealthy.  To argue that McDonalds food would be ok to eat exclusively is retarded, so this movie isn't actually a rebutal of Supersize me at all.  This is just another unnecessary and fake response to what the right wing regards as an attack on the rights of capitalists to sell whatever they want to an intentionaly uninformed public.  Does the multi-billion dollar corporation of McDonalds really need Tom to defend the way they market their deep-fried,sugar injected "Crappy-meals" to our children? Poor McDonalds!
What's up next for Tom Naughton: Experts agree that the world is flat!  Polution is good for you! Don't believe anyone that tells you something you don't want to hear!
