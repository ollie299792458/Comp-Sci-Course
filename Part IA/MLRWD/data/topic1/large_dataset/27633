This isn't a review of the show but a complaint with Amazon. I gave it 5 stars because the show deserves it and I don't want to lower its rating with my Amazon complaint.

I am a huge fan of the show and loved season 2. I just bought it last Friday so I could watch it again before season 3 starts up. I normally don't have problems with Amazon but they let me down this time. I was up to episode 5 on disc 2 when it froze up and skipped to the next episode. I tried a few times to get it to play but it kept freezing. When I looked at the back of the disc, it had a rather large circular scratch. I looked at the other discs and number 3 had this same scratch. This was brand new so it was a factory defect, not Amazon's fault. The problem I have is that Amazon will not replace it. Sure, they will send me a refund which is nice and all, but I wanted a replacement. They told me that since it came from a 3rd party seller, the best I could do was get my money back. Well, when I made the purchase, it clearly said sold and shipped by Amazon. There was no mention of a third party. My problem with all this is that I bought it for a lower price than  what is now listed. So, if I want to get another copy, I have to pay the current price. Sure, this show is worth what it is selling for but it's still not right to make me send mine back, get a refund and then buy at a higher price. Amazon has been good to me in the past but this recent incident leaves me a bit jaded.

All that being said, I can't wait till Sunday an the start of season 3. Best show on TV.
