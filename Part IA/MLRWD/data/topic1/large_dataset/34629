Ok, Let me start by saying I have read both positive and negative reviews on this...which is why I am posting my own opinion.

First of all a little history....WB had this complete film sitting on the shelf for a couple of years now, and just released this on DVD yesterday (October 6th 2009) in a limited store release. I still can't wrap my mind around why they did not release this in theatres at Halloween time this year since it would have been a perfect movie. I had emailed WB contacts last year, and I am sure some other eager fans waiting to see this film did the same, about releasing this in some form or another since it has been finished for 2 YEARS! Then this summer..there were previews before Friday the 13th in theatres...yet still no release of TrT...so finally we get the film, that somehow went straight to DVD (no complaints here)...That being said...

This movie overall has a perfect 80s horror film feel. I just think of the "sucker in the mouth" scene. It is good cheesy fun. If you are a fan of Evil Dead 2, Drag me to hell, Nightmare on Elm St, or Tales from the Crypt...then I think you will like this. The movie is not scary, but I dont recall anyone ever telling me "this is the scariest film you will ever see"...and it isn't gorey, but I dont remember hearing that rumor either...WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID...don't watch this expecting some scary bloody massacre....you wont find it. This is most like a good creepshow with intertwined stories that end up being done very well. Visually it is pleasing and the story is pretty original. Plus you get a new face of horror with Sam (the "kid" on the cover)

So in conclusion. If you like 80s horror and you arent looking to crap your pants from being scared or hide your eyes from gore...this is for you. It is entertaining and funny. I think it really is as the DVD case says "the best Horror movie in 30 years" (taking you back to the 80s)
