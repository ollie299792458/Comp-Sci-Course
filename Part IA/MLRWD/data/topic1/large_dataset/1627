Marc Sanger can be applauded for his outstanding heartopening documentary on a group of people living under a tunnel in New York City.  Watching the DVD we get to know each of the characters and see ourselves as one of the same. They bleed and have a beating heart like all of us yet many of us close our eyes when we pass them by on the street corner. After being turned off by the educational system and the contradictions of our present society I left college and traveled across the country.  I found my home on the streets of Berkeley California. Living out of my backpack I slept next to junkies and broke bread with abandon war vets.  I know from my experience that many of those on the street have dreams and wisdom that rises above the average well to do human being.  Marc Sanger gives the viewer the opportunity to become aware of one of the United States Of America most neglected epidemics.  It would profit many in our own country if we left our homes and ate at a soup kitchen.  Then maybe some of us that fail to appreciate what we take for granted would do so.
