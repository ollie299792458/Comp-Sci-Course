This movie was just awsome ,I love movies but it rare now a days to come across great ones anymore,TV should put more of great movies like this instead of all these spec. FX ,Movies now just seem to have alot of explosions, car chases,gun fights,It was nice to see a movie were what you see is what you got,Just filming great actors,no tricks,or FX.This movie should be on everybodys bucketlist.This movie got great reviews by almost every 1 who watched it,That tells me TV should play more movies like this,because this is what people like to watch,not movies were 85% is explosions and gun fighs,You can get up from a new movie now a days come back a 1/2 hr. later and the same people will still be having a shot out. and in almost every single movie now a days some 1 gets kidnapped and they have very predictable endings,the boyfriend or husband saves the girl at the end,who could have guessed that,This movie in my opinion falls almost....into the documentry section,because it does give you an idea of how it was in the 70s in a mental hosp.Great ending,That you would never have even thought about.ENJOY !
