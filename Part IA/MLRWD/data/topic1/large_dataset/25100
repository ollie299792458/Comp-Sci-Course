This movie is nothing but fun. I have watched it at least 80 times, if not more. My laserdisc copy is almost worn out, and my VHS copies of this have seen better days, too. I would LOVE to see a deluxe version of this movie on DVD. Widescreen, with one B/W version and the original Color version. I know that a DVD with the color version would sell tremendously well. There are a lot of Prince fans that would buy it. That being said, everytime I watch this movie, I notice something different about it, that I never noticed before. Since the part that is supposed to be serious is not, it gives you the viewer a guaranteed chance to laugh and be lighthearted. Knowing some of the strange things that Prince has done over the years, you can't help but wonder if that wasn't exactly his intention. To make a comedy , a parody, if you will, of the overly dramatic movies in the 20's and 30's. I think it is well done, and even non Prince fans would enjoy it, if they realize going in that it is a parody. A Fun diversion.
