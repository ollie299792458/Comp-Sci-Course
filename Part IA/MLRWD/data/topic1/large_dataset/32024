I saw this nearly 30 years ago on cable at a friend's house and just saw it again a second time on DVD. It remains one of the most remarkable movies I have ever seen. Like a lot of boomers I grew up watching a lot of old 1930's films on TV: The Stooges, Bowery Boys, Betty Boop, et al. This movie summons all that in glorious nostalgic detail, but (and this is the key) it does so without the fake "innocence" of old Hollywood and let the excrement, swearing and naughty bits fall where they may. Its weirdly precise chaotic poetry seems insane at first, but the truth is that the story  isn't all that far from what a typical Grecian myth synopsis reads like, only here it is enacted by lunatics, drug addicts, tap dancers, punk stars and some occasional 2-dimensional cartoon characters. Wisely, the filmmakers don't bother with actual jokes, they just shock and shock and shock you again with audacious sophomoric imagery plumbed from the depths of the American psyche. Whether you hate it or love it, you will have a hard time forgetting it.

It was great to see this in an age when nice but tame films like NAPOLEON DYNAMITE and JUNO are hailed as "indie" visions. Watch this (and throw in a few John Waters' classics) and you'll learn the true meaning of "indie"!
