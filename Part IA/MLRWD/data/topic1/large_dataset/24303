Hitchcock shows that suspense doesn't always have to be who done it. Watching the affable Scottie (Jimmy Stewart) sink into his surreal, waking sleep is as excrutiating as it is unforgettable. This is Stewart's most original part, as Scottie is completely out of character of whom he normally plays. He has far more depth as an actor than he's given credit for.
Hitchcock made the comment that, when working with Bernard Herrmann, the story they presented together was 60% film and 40% music. Herrmann was one of the few movie composers who were interested in the color, look and taste of a musical composition, a score that could stand on its own. Even more rare, he was able to pull it off. The swirling, bittersweet score matches and amplifies Hithcock's movie, underlining Stewart's obsession and confusion.
This DVD is packed with the goodies one expects of DVD's nowadays (interviews, behind the sceens, commentary, etc.) and a most revealing alternate ending. This was an "edit" for foriegn release that required some kind of "closure" for criminal acts, which is blasted on the radio that Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) listens too. But the rest of the scene was brilliant *SPOILER* Scottie slopes in, is served a highball by Midge, and he simply stares out of the window while drinking. No talk (the radio was turned off) or music You hear the traffic below. A very simple yet profound ending. *END SPOILER*. This DVD was the first time I saw the movie, and I honestly thought it was a better ending.
Regardless, one of the best films ever made.
