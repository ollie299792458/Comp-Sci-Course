After watching Funny Games, I cannot comprehend the reasons for which people are upset and appalled. During my viewing, I kept hoping this movie would live up to its visceral reputation, but it was stuffy, stolid, and moved much too slow. I understand Haneke wants to manipulate the audience into feeling guilty as active participants in senseless torture, but with this film as the catalyst for such emotion? Really? Am I supposed to feel bad for these exceedingly pretentious people? The family is obnoxious--especially the impotent father and emotionally overwrought mother. I wanted them to suffer the second they began guessing opera singers and classical composers in their luxury vehicle. There were many opportunities where escape was possible, even easy, seeing as the captors were skinny, initially weaponless, prep school boys. Their entry into the home was even less comprehendible. Who the hell puts up with that from a complete stranger? I would have been too cheap to even give out my eggs, anyway. In all, I felt absolutely no sympathy for the family--and at least hoped their torture would be acerbic and compelling. Instead, I was subjected to the most genteel, accommodating, and BORING torture/murder ever. Their games could have been more inventive too. Far worse things could have happened to that family, and do happen to people every day in the news. The only shock is how self-righteous Michael Haneke is with this material. I'll admit it, I enjoy violence in cinema--but I don't feel bad about it, and the director's attempt to change that failed.
