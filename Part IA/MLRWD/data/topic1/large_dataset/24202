If you still have a bad taste in your mouth from Happy Feet, which to me was somewhat creepy and not very entertaining, then take a swig of the minty freshness of Surf's Up.  This is not so much a penguin movie than  a knarly surfing gig. Animated in documentary style, the directors keep the basic, feel good about yourself story line, fresh with graphics that are extremely eye popping. Real life emotions are plainly shown and understood in the facial expressions and body language of each character.

Cody wants to 'get away' and takes his chance in a surfing contest at a beautfiul rendered island scene that gets more WOWs from me then such films that go for reality. Polar Express comes to mind.  This movie hits every mark that I can think of.  Children and adults will enjoy this.  I am 41 and when Cody is making his board with the father figure Geek, I turn back into child working with my father's help building ANYTHING.  You will see.  Shia Labeouf the voice of Cody is an exceptional find.  As Steven Speilberg seems to understand since he will be in 2 of his movies that are coming out.  And Jeff Bridges as Geek...Well what can you say.  GREAT.
