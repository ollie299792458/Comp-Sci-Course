I haven't actually read of the Lemony Snicket books, so I am reviewing the film entirely on the merits of the film itself, which is probably how it should be reviewed.

This is such a wonderfully dark and creative work, entirely reminiscent of Tim Burton's earlier works like 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'A Nightmare Before Christmas'. I thought it was beautifully filmed with outstandingly dark and creative sets and the entire piece was just fun and funny to the core.

The acting was also superb, particularly Streep and Carrey, while Billy Connelly's characters was somewhat dull compared to the eccentricities of the other characterisations. Furthermore, I thought the Lemony Snicket narrative touch was brilliant and the opening and closing credits were some of the best I have ever seen. I particularly loved the artistic and dark closing credits.

While I have heard that three of the books have been compressed to make this work, it doesn't feel rushed, but rather, an enjoyable ride for children and adults alike.
