I can't say I enjoyed this film so much, The first sequence could have been more promising (yes I know about the deaths involved), still doesn't make up for the fact that the storyline is not very interesting. The second sequence of Kick the Can is not bad but again feels empty, The movie does get better as it moves along however. I do appreciate the special effects in this film done today everything would be CGI and I think the CGI ruins the fun of on set effects. So maybe we are lucky it was made in the 80's. My one real disspointment more so than no EXTRAS!is the fact that WARNER BROS keeps on editing out the original WB logos that open their films from the 70's and 80's to replace them with the new logo while the new one looks sharp and clear unfortunatly it never fits the film it is showing so to speak. It ruins the nostalgia of watching the film the way it was originally presented. Really big pet peeve. I wish Warner BROS would realize it is more work to replace the log only to wasting time ruining the overal viewing of the film.
