At first, as the storyline intercuts heist scenes with post-release interviews of hostages, we get an inkling of the tough investigation it'll take to separate fact from deceit ... and then the plot gradually self destructs until we realize that there's NOTHING to investigate (not a joke). All the plot elements (such as they are) have been delivered to us on a platter. And the platter is very low-cal.

The evil villain is the one you thought it would be the exact second you saw him. The brilliant plot to bring him down is hatched by a deus-ex-machina genius whose knowledge of the villain's financial past and present is left unexplained. Let's not even go into his motivations (something like "I can"). The high-priced troubleshooter played by Jodie Foster shoots no trouble. Yet she still walks away with a paycheck after abundantly flaunting her VIP status and hinting that she has secret talents we can only guess at (cat-throwing?). Worst of all (from a moral point of view, since the movie does seem to have moral pretensions) is that the villain's evil past is a simple "MacGuffin", a trivial plot device, used to justify our sitting through yet another heist film. The details are left so vague that we neither understand the character nor have a sense of the environment of possibilities, temptations and constraints in which his wrong choices were made. One original aspect of the film: there's no corrupt Senator.

Why would anybody want to buy this film? That implies you'd want to watch it again, when you already know if you've watched it once to the end that it holds none of its promises.
