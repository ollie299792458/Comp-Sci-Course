I had the opportunity to view "Elvis on Tour" theatrical release on July 30th, it was great to see the King on the big screen, and I have also pre-ordered the blu-ray version here on Amazon but after seeing the theatrical release my hopes of WB doing anything good with this film has torpedo all my expectations.  They have altered the original film mainly the opening credits replacing the opening audio of "Johnny B Goode" exchanged it with "Don't Be Cruel".  I should be happy that it has been transferred to blu-ray, but I have no idea of the quality of the transfer until I receive it from Amazon.  The bonus video showed before the feature film was not very good, WB and Elvis enterprises is sitting on hours upon hours of video never before seen before, what are they thinking?  Can money still be made if they let decades go by before re-releasing?  Will it be altered and censored so we view only what they want us to see?  We have seen Elvis at his best and his worse, we are big boys and girls, I think we can take Elvis at any point of his life because he was just that great and gifted of an entertainer.  Where is my bonus material?  If anyone has an idea how to make these companies involved with Elvis rethink ideology other than stop buying the scraps they throw at us, I am all ears.
