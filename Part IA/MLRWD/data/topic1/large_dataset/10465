This was the funniest movie of the summer, hands down (yes, I saw the Hangover). Going into this movie I was expecting a light-hearted lame family comedy based on a TV show I never watched (therefore full of references I wouldn't get) but was blown away at what I actually saw. This isn't a family comedy at all but a raunchy comedy full of sex jokes and even a drug trip. From the opening scene of the movie with Will Ferrell on the Today Show with Matt Lower and explaining how he went on a 10,000 calorie binge to the end of the movie with Will Ferrell on the Today Show with Matt Lower, this movie does not stop with the laughs. Will Ferrell and Danny McBride, two of comedies best improvers, in their first movie together, have an even more organic feel to them then Will Ferrell did with John C. Reilly in Talladega or Step Brothers. What killed this movie was a few bad reviews from people who were either huge fans of the show and didn't get what they expected, people expecting a family movie where there wasn't one and, the big one, the terrible idea of releasing it on the same weekend as The Hangover (a much more publicized movie by the director of Old School, Will Ferrell's second best movie). If this movie been released a week later (all it would have had to compete with is another failed Eddie Murphy comedy, Imagine That), a more accurate ad campaign that displayed it's true dirty, hysterical nature and PEOPLE GOING TO GO SEE IT; it would have done a lot better. Don't miss out out this uproarious comedy of WF and DMcB at the top of their game.

P.S - MATT LOWER CAN SUCK IT! (You'll get it when you see it)
