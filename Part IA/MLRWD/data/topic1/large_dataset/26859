This is my first watch of a film in this genre and I can't say I'm disappointed. The shot choice was excellent, the dialogue was not only convincing but touching and the music was great. My only criticism would be that it seemed to end far too soon. This is probably due to the open ended ending.

The way in which each scene is composed doesn't try to hit the viewer on the head with the conflict, but it hits home enough with tidbits of dialogue so that it really goes to the heart of the piece. Two people,  who are so obviously different in what we learn about their upbringing and the interactions between Jackie and her mother, are both in a world much their own. This is what I feel drew me into this film. I like that the focus wasn't really on how dramatic their lives were because of their relationship but it was more on how two people can know each other and still misunderstand one another.

In a nutshell this film was beautiful, painful and well worth a rental. I'd give it a four out of five because I think the ending could use some work, but I wouldn't let that stop you from watching it.
