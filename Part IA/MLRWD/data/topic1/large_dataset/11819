After being intrigued with our American LIFE ON MARS, we tuned into the UK set, and were totally blown away. The character of GENE HUNT is iconic, and as memorable as any cop, including DIRTY HARRY.

If you aren't adept at strong British accents, and many of the relevant parts of the culture of UK 1973, it still won't set you back.

If you hollered and screamed at the ending of the USA series (I did, in disbelief, pain and exasperation), don't worry. You can rest assured that you can scream all over again, with joy and pain and tears (I did!). It's over. What a great sense of loss!

Hang on, you can still see GENE HUNT, and CHRIS SKELTON and RAY, but don't even THINK about checking out ASHES TO ASHES before you get to scream at the 8th episode of UK Life of Mars.

And just for fun, after you've checked Wikipedia and found there was a pilot made for USA TV, with none other than Colm Meany (STAR TREK) playing Gene Hunt, and if you can find it, you're officially an obsessed fan. (I am!)

Phillip Glennister has created a GENE HUNT that is beyond the poor script they gave Meany, and IMHO, far superior to our dear HARVEY KEITEL's  GENE HUNT, which at first viewing looked to be memorable....

Enjoy the UK version, spread the word, and put this on your "DO NOT LEND" shelf.
