The first "Hoodwinked" was original, clever and well written.  The animation was a little weak, but the main thing is always story and a good story can make up for many shortcomings.  It was filled with fun puns and I have enjoyed watching several times on DVD too.  It was just fun.

"Hoodwinked Too" tried to be "more of the same", but it wasn't even close.  I laughed twice and cringed a lot.  The puns were forced and with no story to save it, it fails on too many levels.  I wonder who thought it was funny to try and mention or imitate every clich&eacute; in every movie and TV show ever made.  Most of those references made no sense.  Though I have to admit that one of the times I laughed was at the reference to "Silence of the Lambs".

As with the original, the animation is extremely poor.  The characters don't move smoothly and mouth movements rarely synced with the words.  But in the original you didn't notice it that much because it was so good.  This time it was painful to watch.

Even Patrick Warburton couldn't save this movie and that should tell you something.

Don't waste your money.  Just watch "Hoodwinked" and enjoy that.
