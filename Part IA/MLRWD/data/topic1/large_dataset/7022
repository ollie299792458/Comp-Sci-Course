... I've seldom been as bored as I was watching this film. It's not terrible, it's just been done a million times before. The acting is good, but the characters are cliches. The "gee-golly gosh" good kid, who gets involved with a (gasp!) older woman who has (oh no!) baggage in the form of kids and a ne-'er do-well ex-husband who (big surprise) doesn't like the above-mentioned "nice" kid sleeping with his ex. Things go badly, and alas, alack (WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD)beaver cleaver gets capped. His parents, understandably, are upset by this. They grieve, they are angry, they want justice. Yadda-yadda-yadda. Finding no help in our justice system (cliche #257) they take matters into their own hands with pathetically predictable results. I sat in a theatre for close to three days...uh...I mean HOURS waiting for this movie to distinguish itself, it never did. I'm completely baffled by the praises that have been heaped upon this picture and I recommend you rent it rather than spending money to see it in the theatre. At least that way, you could fast-forward, or better yet rewind and be done with it.
