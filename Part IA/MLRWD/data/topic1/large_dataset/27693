Johnny Got His Gun is one of my favorite films and by far the most depressing I've ever seen. I recommend it to just about anyone... however, I have a few issues with this DVD.

First of all, it IS edited. I have a VHS copy and Kareen is definitely shown nude from the front in it. I'm not sure what else was cut out, but based on the different running times mentioned in other reviews, there must be more and I find this annoying and unnecessary.

Also, I'm not sure if it's just my copy, but I am unable to watch the music video or the interview with Timothy Bottoms. When I try to select them, the trailer plays. This is something I have to take up with the company, I guess, but just beware!

The quality of the DVD itself is fine. The sound isn't that great, but I didn't expect it to be... and it's audible to healthy ears. The problem is those with not-so-great ears have no way to follow it since there are no subtitles. What the hell, people? It's 2009!

I am still thrilled to finally have this on DVD since I'm not sure how much longer my VHS copy will last, but I'm not entirely pleased with it and recommend buyers take these things into consideration before excitedly purchasing like I did without looking into reviews/specifics of the DVD.
