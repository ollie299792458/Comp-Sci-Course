Put simply, Open Range is one of the best Westerns to come out of Hollywood in quite some time. I won't recap the story, but will offer a few quick thoughts on the film.
First of all, the gunfight may be the best Old West shoot-out ever filmed! There's only one gun battle in the entire movie, but it goes on for about fifteen minutes and is well worth the wait. The events leading up to the battle are never boring, and the movie holds the viewer's interest.
I only have two complains. There is a scene where "Boss" makes a statement that is very blasphemous. This is unfortunate and I wish it would have been left out of the film. Other than that, there's not a lot of bad language or offensive content (besides the realistic gun violence which is too graphic for the younger crowd). My other complaint is that the film drags (slightly) after the climactic shoot-out. It takes fifteen minutes to wrap up events that could have been handled in about five. But, that is a minor complaint.
Overall, this is one of my favorite films ever produced. If you love Westerns, chances are you'll love this movie. It's old fashioned, basic, and to the point-the way Westerns should be!  Too bad they don't make many like this any more.
