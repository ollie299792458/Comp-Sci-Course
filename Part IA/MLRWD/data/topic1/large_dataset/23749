Why have Criterion choosen to not include extras with this release? It is a landmark film. It is a classic. It was important then, as it is now.  People who want to watch it (again and again) would like to know more about  the background for the film and why it is so important. This kind of  information should have included.
The original title was supposed to be  "The killer amongst us". The Nazis were uneasy with this because  they worried that the title meant them.
The film is about a child  murderer. Unfortunatly this makes the film highly relevant today. The  murder of the girl with the baloon is a landmark scene. How many times have  we seen copies of it in other films. In this , Langs first sound movie, he  uses sound techniques that was far ahead of its time. Perhaps he did not  invent the sound bridge(sound from one scene carries over to another), but  it is the earliest film where i have heard one.
Also, after the murderer  (brilliantly played by Peter Lorre) notices the "M" mark on his  shoulder, watch closely when we watch him staring at us through a shopping  window. You will se that he has a ring around his head, made up of the  knifes on display in the window. It is the story, characters, filmtechnique  and gems like these that makes you watch the film again and again.
The  last few seconds of the film is cut in many versions. This because Lang  manages to turn the motive(revenge) to something  different. Watch it and  decide for yourself why one would like to remove the ending.In only a few  second and a few words, the whole purpose of the film is changed. It is  brilliant. Very clever!
