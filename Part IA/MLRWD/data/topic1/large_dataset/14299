I am a movie buff who is always on the lookout for good deals on movies, and I came across this entire set of Planet of the Apes movies for a very good price.  I was surprised I didn't have it in my collection already but now I do.  This was on VHS but that does not matter.

My favorite of the five films is the third one, Escape From Planet of the Apes, where  Kira, and her husband and unborn baby come to earth.  It is the first time I had seen any of these movies since I was a child and I didn't remember a lot about them.

I had seen other complaints from other fans who did not like or appreciate certain scenes being cut from the films, or certain scenes being changed or edited.  I don't know about that considering the fact that I had not seen them for years, but I will be on the lookout for other versions to compare.  To me it doesn't matter, nor does format.  As long as I get to see something. Often times scenes are cut or edited to make the film flow better.

All in all, if you like and appreciate science fiction of any kind, you will not be disappointed with this.  As usual, there are two ways to enjoy it.  For the entertainment value and then for the thinker, you can compare it to real life and how humans exploit those of our own race, animals, the environment, perceive God, and abuse technology. Bottom line, the apes give us a taste of our own medicine and we don't care too much for it...so it can be appreciated for the irony in this alternate reality.  If a viewer, whether casual or deep thought viewer carefully pays attention to the messages contained within the films, maybe...just maybe...the world would be a much better place.

Oh and my young son, age 11, is always being introduced to new Sci-Fi as well and he really enjoyed these.
