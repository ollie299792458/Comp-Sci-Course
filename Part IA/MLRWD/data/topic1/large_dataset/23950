I love DVDs that have extra's so I was pleased that this film had as much on it as it did considering how negative the reviews are and the fact that it did not break the 100 million mark in the US.  Worldwide box office and video sales well exeeded the cost of the film so the filmakers should be happy.  I guess they were confident ahead of time that it was worth putting in 2 commentaries etc.  From what I read there were many other scenes filmed that were not used and at least some are included.  I hope they do a extended version one day.  If the dvd/bluray sales do well enough who knows?  I am a big Connery fan and even though this film did not thrill me when I first saw it in the theatre I enjoy it more now on DVD just taking it for what it is.  I will get the blu ray version after I get my big screen tv if this does not look as good as it does now on my 27inch Sony.  It is crystal clear and fits the bill overall.  Connery still makes you believe he is able to do the job even though at this date he was 73!  It helps of course that this is a fantasy film and not a modern day true to life drama.
Good popcorn flick as they say.
