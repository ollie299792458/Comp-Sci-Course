With that rich baritone voice and British accent, I'd pay good money just to listen to Clive Owen read the phone book.

That aside, I was genuinely drawn in to this story.  It's hard for me to get wrapped up in a love story, so when I do, I remember it!  Generally I find Hollywood's version of true love to be, well, Hollywood. Very clean and simple and a bit flat. This film was so full of characters with such altruistic personalities, it was hard not to want them to live happily ever after!

The film makers seemed to leave out a lot of plot either for time or budget purposes.  It would have been nicer to have a more detailed explanation of exactly what the CIA guy was finagling.  The viewer has to figure out a lot for him/herself.  More background on the Angelina Jolie character might have been nice too.  At first all we know about her is that she's recently married, then she goes to Ethiopia.  Next thing we know she's working for the UN?  What exactly was her UN function other than the very shallow scene we see of "setting up aid"?  Maybe I need a second viewing, but without giving too much away --what exactly had the Doctor done to irk the Chechen warlord? I'm not sure that was explained. It seemed like a lot was missing and there should have been deleted scenes included on the DVD.  Well, maybe a director's version will be released eventually.

All in all, it was an entertaining and thought-provoking film.
