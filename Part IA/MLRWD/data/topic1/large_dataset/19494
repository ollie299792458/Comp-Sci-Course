I wondered why this movie didn't get as much hype as most other Disney productions, then I realized- it's not Disney!!

The graphics were not nearly as spectacular as they're said to be and the story felt almost "choppy". The characters lacked emotion in all the wrong places. I would think that if I saw my first born killed, I'd be a bit more upset than Rameses was. Or if water became blood right before my eyes, my jaw would drop at least a little.

But my biggest problem with the movie was the soundtrack. Each song was very poorly written. No catchy choruses, no really lively numbers, nothing. One of the best parts of seeing a good animated film is that colors, gravity and the laws of physics are not an obstacle. The artists can create whatever song and put it to whatever setting. The imagination of the songwriters and illustrators definitely fell short.

One song in particular, "You're playing with the big boys now" was the most dissapointing. The lyrics merely repeated the name of the title over and over again and I found that the animation for the number itself was scary and just disturbing. I wouldn't let my children see if for fear of them having nightmares.

I think that the animated movies should be left to Disney, because they alone seem to know how to do them right.
