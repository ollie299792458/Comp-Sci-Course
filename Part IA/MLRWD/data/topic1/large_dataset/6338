It was like the stealth movie.  Antonio Banderas (Zorro) starring in a movie based on a Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park) book and  . . . nothing.  Most people never even heard of this film that inexplicably slid right  through the box office with barely a whimper.  But they missed a good  one.
The 13th Warrior is loosely based on the Crichton novel Eaters of  the Dead.  Banderas plays an Arab of high birth who is banished from his  people for falling in love with the wrong woman.  He is sent as an  ambassador to the barbaric people of the North where he meets up with a  dangerous, yet fairly affable group of Vikings.
The plot gains speed when  a child seeks out the leader of the Vikings to help defend a different  Viking kingdom from an evil force.  When an oracle determines that 13  warriors must go to combat the evil, Banderas is drafted because the 13th  warrior must not be a northman.  The thirteen "volunteers" head  north to combat the evil force  that decapitates and eats its  victims.
Make no mistake, this is a violent, bloody movie.  But in the  best tradition of classic fantasy, it is engaging and exhilarating.  The  battle scenes seemed to be filmed from the midst of the action, and the  blows appear frighteningly real.  The sword play is direct and brutal.  This movie aims for a dark, serious tone and largely achieves it.  
Though the action scenes are terrific, the most appealing part of this  film is the Viking characters.  Though many of the roles are filled by  unknown talent, the performances are right on.  The Vikings are violently  repulsive, yet decidedly brave, noble, and loyal.  They, like the movie,  are decidedly smarter and more subtle than they would initially appear.  Banderas' Arab character goes from outsider to warrior as he slowly adopts  the noble courage of his Viking companions.
I'm sure most critics  dismissed this film as meaningless violence.  But it's much more than that  if you take the time to look.
