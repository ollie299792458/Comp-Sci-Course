I'm shocked at all the negative reviews for this film.  It was highly regarded by many film critics and many expected Woody Harrelson to get an Oscar nomination. I saw this film in a theater in January and thought it was terrific with a great performance from Woody Harrelson. He's also surrounded by an amazing supporting cast who all excel.  And yes this is a dark film about a certainly not-very-likeable, troubled, and out of control LAPD police officer and his gradual descent, loss of control, and relationship problems.  People have complained that there is no story. Well, that IS the story. Plus there's the subplot of an internal investigation and the investigating officer that is trying to take him down.  This is the kind of film that Robert DeNiro might have made years ago with Martin Scorsese directing. And while it certainly isn't a fast paced action film I didn't find it slow and boring as many have complained.  The average film goer now has become accustomed to fast paced quickly edited action films and can't appreciate a slower paced well done psychological character study.  And that's sad!  And no, the ending doesn't tie everything up neatly.  It's open for interpretation and allows you to come to your own conclusion of what is going to happen with this man. There again, a lot of people have to have a very concrete ending to a film and can't draw their own conclusion. The DVD transfer is very good.
