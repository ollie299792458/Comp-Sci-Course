In this phase of his career, Charlton Heston is the '70s Bruce Campbell, but without the irony.

The Omega Man is an excellent movie.  It's not a fine film, that's for sure.  But it's a fun movie.  It's got it all--a great scenario, a totally ridiculous over the top performance from Heston, and a script drawn from a decent horror novella turned into some kind of comic-book-seque blaxploiation sci-fi romp.

If you don't like this movie at least a little bit, then you are beyond hope.  You are incapable of having fun.

Yeah sure, it's not very close to the novel.  But big deal.  If you want accuracy, check out Last Man On Earth (also very good).  Or just read the book again. The Omega Man is a fun new take on the story, with vintage '70s cheesiness you just can't possibly dislike!  Not to mention an incredible soundtrack by Ron Grainer!

The DVD is fairly bare bones, but it does come with a cool featurette that was used for promotional materials at the time.

It's a nice transfer and all--but there is one scene cut from the film that I wish they had included as an extra. (Heston meets a woman in a tomb...she's actually in the credits, but the scene was cut for the theatrical release)
