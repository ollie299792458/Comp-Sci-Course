'Days of Heaven' is a slow and dream-like look at the lives of working-class people at the first quarter of the 20th century in the United States.  The story is being told through the eyes of a little girl, but Richard Gere, Brooke Adams, and Sam Shepard are the stars of the film.  It was directed by Terrence Malick, who has made only a handful of films, but each one is unique and is a gem.  This movie is no exeception either.  It is more or less a love story between two men in love with the same woman.  The movie uses this story as a backdrop for its stunning and memorable images.  Many scenes are likely to stay in the viewers' minds for a long time.

What is lacking in the movie, though, is a strong screenplay and complete character development.  Many scenes leave left me empty simply because there was not enough dialog, and the characters seemed passive.  Maybe the movie was supposed to be that way, but those two aspects are its main flaws.  If it had better dialog and characters, it probably would have been one of the best films I've ever seen.  Nonetheless, 'Days of Heaven' is often a beautiful journey to another place and another time.  The movie is depressing, but that time period and place was one of great struggle and misery.
