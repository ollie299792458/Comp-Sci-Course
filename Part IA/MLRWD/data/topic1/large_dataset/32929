I saw this film when it came out and found it thoroughly heart warming. What I missed was Greg Kinnear's finely turned performance as the father. True he was nine years older than when he turned in his Oscar nominated Best Supporting Actor performance in "As Good As It Gets." It was easy to overlook his performance there in favor of his model good looks. But seeing the film again recently, he accomplishes a marvel portraying a gentle but not effeminate Gay man who is totally devoted to his work as an artist. Fast forward nine years to "Little Miss Sunshine." He is now forty six and well into middle age. The good looks are blunted but still there. He is now portraying a father just as convincingly as he portrayed a drop dead gorgeous young Gay man. The two performances are an object lesson in acting which submerges the actor completely into the character. For comparable subtlety and skill I can think of only Meryl Streep. It's time this phenomenally gifted actor received the parts and recognition he deserves! "Little Miss Sunshine" is a wonderful film, but try watching it with your attention focused on Kinnear. It's a revelation.
