I have been watching this movie since I was a child in the 60s. Never have I ever seen such a magnificent job of restoration of a classic film. Not only is the picture unbelievable the audio is perfectly restored as well. Watching this in Blu-ray is like watching it through a new set of eyes. I watched it on a 50 inch Pioneer Elite plasma screen with an LG 390 player. I just received it today the 23rd of December, I paid extra to have it shipped overnight. No Christmas in the past 30 plus years will be Christmas without having watched this film. The restoration is so clear that I have seen detail in this version I have never noticed before. For instance, if you carefully watch the scene after the last ghost has departed and Scrooge has awakened and is conversing with his char woman, just after he says " I feel as giddy as a drunken Man", he steps toward his dressing mirror. You can see a man's face reflected in the mirror and slowly peek out of the shadows. Most likely a stage hand or lighting grip who got in the way and had to duck back into the curtains. They kept the scene intact, how could they possibly improve upon that take. Back then they probably figured no one would ever notice, they didn't fathom the development of Blur-Ray. I have never been able to see such detail before. This restoration is simply amazing and well worth the money. Merry Christmas!
