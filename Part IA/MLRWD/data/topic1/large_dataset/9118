You must always take the good with the bad, and, in my humble opinion, if you really want to savor the wonderful moments in a masterpiece like "Gone with the Wind," then you must learn to watch and appreciate pieces of absolute squirrel droppings like this movie...  and I mean that in the most endearing way...  really.  Non-plotted excuse to get AHH-nold into as many action set pieces as possible that ends up with unintentionally, but innevitably, hilarious results.  Schwarenegger plays uber-UBER-soldier John Matrix (nothing like a nice, macho name to get things started) who can carry tree trunks under one arm, dive out of moving airplanes, tear seats out of cars, scalp people with garden tools, rip entire phone booths off the ground, hold scum over a cliff upside down by one leg, bulldoze gun shops, and SMELL bad guys coming from a mile away, all without breaking a sweat.  Cliched, contrived, and overly violent, the only way to enjoy this movie, is just to go with it, because by the time you get to the finale, where Matrix, in typical over-the-top action-mayhem style, kills everyone in sight without so much as a scratch to himself, you will have, hopefully, given up on any realism seeping into this movie from any source, and begun to realize what a farce it really is.  But hey, even if you don't, the film delivers a marvelous anti-climax, where the previously unstoppable hero is suddenly in danger of being done in by an over-sized splinter in his gut, and he's forced to duke it out with a chubby, chainmail wearing Freddy Mercury look-alike, who doesn't look like he could out box Strom Thurmann on a good day.  Relish in the absurd pond scum that is "Commando!"
