Drew Barrymore, Lucy Lu and especially Cameron Diaz are terrifically entertaining as the newest Angels in this amusing, well-made big-screen take on the classic TV series.  Though Bill Murray has little chance to use his comic gifts, mostly everything else about this high-octane caper is entertaining and self-consciously bigger-than-life.  The Angels are each given a human side, from the get-go -- this is a clever throughline, making these women memorable and distinct.  They seem to be having a ball together, and showing off some impressive, athletic kung-fu kicks, twsits and turns. There is an air of self-deprecation (Diaz dancing; Lucy cooking; Drew's boyfriend) that adds a sweet, funny undercurrent to the Matrix-like action sequences, which show plenty of skin and outfits.  The sexiness comes across a both a weapon and as a celebration.  The movie seems to bear the overall stamp of Drew Barrymore's professional persona: generous with its cast, fun-loving, empowered and distinctly feminine.  It's a surprisingly good time for all.
