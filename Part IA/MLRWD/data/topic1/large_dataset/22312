Hi,
Must I say I was a bit wary of seeing a series notoriously depicting lawyers' professional and private life at large? Be they Bostonians, or whatever. Attorneys boringly tend to be the same, worldwide, and that's an understatement when it comes down to believing in simple ethics, for starters.
Now, be it a make-believe or not, I had a feeling I was coming closer to the real world, which I kinda got to know in the past. These people have a lot of shortcomings, they make a very profitable business out of the ordinary people's shortcomings, there's no telling where they will go to outsmart the shadowy fringes of law.
The fact is the screenplays are usually very smart, asking real questions and giving sometimes not-so-satisfactory answers, the way it definitely goes in the day-to-day reality. I like that. That's real life, with real bright non-nonsense, no-heroes who are definitely knowing this business brings a lot of difficult daily choices to be made along with it.
I also like the way people there skid at times a personal reflection or two about the powers-that-be. Denny Crane's references to "Antonio", "Dick" or "Jebb" are choice pickles to keep in mind when the time comes to look back at what these last unfortunate years really were.
BL is a thing you wanna keep for your kids, so that they might possibly get smarter for their own future.
