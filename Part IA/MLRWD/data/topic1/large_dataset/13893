As crazy and over-the-top as it is, "Eyes Wide Shut" is a surprisingly truthful depiction of marriage.  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play a husband and wife who have been married for almost a decade.  They  have a child together, whom they both cherish.  Their life seems  blissful--they're both attractive, wealthy, and they obviously still enjoy  eachother's company.
In the span of a couple of days, their marriage  undergoes some extraordinary, radical changes, beginning with Kidman's  seemingly sudden decision to be brutally honest with her husband.  After  her revelations, Cruise becomes caught up in a wild set of circumstances  that lead him to realize that he has been going through life with blinders  on.  
There has been much discussion about the graphic depiction of sex  in this movie, and while it's definitely explicit, it's also clearly meant  for viewing by adults only.  Cruise has nightmarish fantasies of his wife  in the arms of other men, while at the same time he's confronted with  temptation after temptation.  Some of the scenarios don't seem particularly  tempting in and of themselves, but coupled with Cruise's mental state, they  are believable.
In some ways the movie is shockingly ordinary--the  feelings Cruise and Kidman convey are felt, even fleetingly, by all of us  at some point during our marriages.  Of course this is all displayed  vividly, Kubrick style.  Cruise doesn't just find himself amid any  "regular" orgy, but rather in a bizarre, secret ritual.  But  overall, the movie seeks to point out how complex a relationship a marriage  really is, and to warn about the dangers we face when we take our spouses  for granted.
