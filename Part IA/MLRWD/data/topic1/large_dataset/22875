This is an incredible film! For many years I was under the impression that silent films were all jerky, funny looking and boring. Then I saw Fritz Lang's Metropolis and all that changed. I was introduced to the world of  the German Impressionist film...and this is the Granddaddy of them all. A  great transfer of the film to start helps in viewing. A lot of the problems  with the old silent films are that the light levels keep fluctuating. But  when a company takes the time and expense to clean up and restore a film  the results are wonderful. The film is color tinted. (Not colored ...it's  like the siepa opening to the Wizard of Oz kind of thing) to make the  contrast level pop. The tiles are very cool to look at, as they were  recreations of the originals used. The commentary track is extra  interesting to point out the wonderful bits that can be over looked by the  average Joe. (Like the reasons some sets have angles and some have curves,  The light patterns following the footpaths..etc..) A wonderful piece of  filmmaking is a must for all film buffs to see the origins of a bunch of  toady's more artistic shots in cinema.
