This movie can make me feel better no matter what the status of my life. In fact, most times it not only makes me feel better, it usually brings tears of joy to my eyes. It's a remarkable film and my favorite of Miyazaki's works and that is saying more than anything else I might.
The plot is relatively simple. Two young girls, Mei (4) and Satsuki (10) movie into a new house with their father. The house seems to be swarming with spirits of the "Dustbunnies" and the like. However, Mei finds herself a new friend in the cuddliest spirit of them all, the King of the Forest, Totoro. Totoro is an endearing creature, resembling a largish bear-bunny hybrid, and he befriends the girls and helps them with various things.
That being said, some people complain about the DVD's lack of features. Indeed, it is a tragedy that we're not privy to the savory Japanese release, something I was fervently awaiting myself, but it's not as if we're being robbed. It's a ten-dollar DVD! The same price as the VHS and it lasts longer and I've yet to hear of a problem with this edition of the DVD (as with the Neon Genesis movie). 
Disney really takes the films for granted (almost refusing to release the amazing "Spirited Away" for a time), but the fans with wear them down I believe and we'll see a special edition soon. Need proof? Disney was forced to push back the release of "Princess Mononoke" to DVD because there was an outcry against them for not including the Japanese language track. Take THAT Disney!
In closing, the only other thing I can offer is this: more often than not, I'm watching this without the audience of my younger siblings. Actually, they've only seen it once. I keep the treasure mostly to myself. Although I might enlist them to help me with a tree-grow dance this spring...
