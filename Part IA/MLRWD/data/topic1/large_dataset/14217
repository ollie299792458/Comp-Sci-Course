MATCH GAME is a true classic from 1973-1982.  I have thoroughly enjoyed these classic episodes.  I could not believe they finally made it to DVD.  The packaging was very attractive; it caught my eye.  The video and audio qualities are decent, but there are inconsistencies with the volume as there are on GSN.  Some of the tickets plugs are missing, mostly from the shows prior to 1979, which I did find disappointing.  Seeing the consulation prizes--thirty second inserts showing members of the studio audience, brought back a lot of memories.  I have tons of episodes taped off of GSN over the years, but I am missing a lot from MATCH GAME '75 & '76, so like a lot have said, it would have been nice to see more shows from those great years.  The B&W kinescope of the 1962 NBC pilot was nice to see, showing how it all started with Gene Rayburn and Johnny Olson.  Brett Somers' moments on the discs were quite nice; better than not having anyone from the show at all sharing memories, right?  Some shows I would not have selected as the best shows, but there are a lot of great ones, especially the school riot.  In any event, MATCH GAME will always be a true classic.  Hopefully more "Best of..." volumes will be released and maybe eventually complete years, since most of the shows are available, as they have been airing on GSN for quite some time.
