Wow, Paul Newman plays a white man raised by the Apaches being insightful and bold. He decides to live live like a white man after inheriting a boarding house from a white man who took him in while he lived in both worlds growing up on San Carlos reservation and getting some education in the white man's world. In addition, he knows the day of the Apache Indian is quickly coming to an end as he knew and believed in.
The supporting cast is really good, especially Richard Boone playing the tough bad guy as well as anyone could play it. The cast takes a ride on a stagecoach that is carrying an Indian agent and his wife that have been stealing from the San Carlos reservation and Boone and his band of outlaws realize the coach is carrying the cash and this is where the story kicks into the another level where the people show the dark sides of human nature. Newman knows people well enough that he takes the low, middle, and high road in the the movie. I love Newman's role all the way through the movie.
This is a dark western and viewers should realize that things don't always turn out the way they want or should.
A great, gritty, tough, and intelligent western.
