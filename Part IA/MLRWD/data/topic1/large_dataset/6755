i have to say that this 1 got away from me @ the movie theater. i missed the chance to hear all the gun fire in true surround sound. i had to rent this when it came out. & when it did, i went to a local blockbuster & checked out for an all nighter for @ least 4 movies. this was the 1st choice. i had issues w/the dvd. took it back,got another & it had the same problem. it wasn't my player, it was the dvd. so, i bought it @ a good price w/amazon. & for the 1st time since it came out, i got to see in it's whole run time, w/out any issues. so, which brings to the dvd featuers. it's cool that they have what it is on a regular dvd. liked what was on it. i'll be watching this 1 when new years' eve, rolls around, back to back reindeer games.

the story was very intersting. the fact that's a remake of 1 of my favorite directors. i really can't see the diffence between the 2. of course, i've only seen the orginal 1 time, it's probably a good time to rent it. i loved the cast as well. great performances from several actors new, & veterans, too. if you love a good shot 'em up, no holds barred movie. then pick this 1. i think it;s worth a shot. (pun intended)
