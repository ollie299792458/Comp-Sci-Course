I remember seeing this movie when I was 5 years old in 1974.  Fortunately for me, I forgot "whodunit" and was able to enjoy when I saw it again as a teenager.  Having viewed the movie at least 20 times since then, I find it hard to see how plebian works like "The Usual Suspects" garner such rave reviews when such obviously better fare like this exist.  Everyone involved in this film gives it their finest effort.  Only with many viewings  does one get the opportunity to observe the details that are so interwoven into the script and acting.  The story is among the most perfect murder mysteries ever penned, and the performance of the cast is resplendent.  Throughout, the cast crackles with sparking witty dialog that is matched perfectly with the deftest of facial expressions and gestures that continuously lay clues at your feet until your so confused that you'll be begging at the conclusion to find out who the murderer is.

So few movies stand up to repeated viewing and thus are seldom worth the cost of the DVD or the space it takes up in your home.  Buy this movie so you can watch it, so that your parents can watch it, your children and your grandchildren.  Heck, you will probably want to mention it in your will!
