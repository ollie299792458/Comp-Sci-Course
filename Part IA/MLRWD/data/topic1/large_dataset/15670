Saw V is awesome and just as good as the first four! As I've said, it's another awesome piece to add to Jigsaw's puzzle! I love all the flashback sequences with Hoffman and Jigsaw. Hoffman thinks he's the only one to survive Jigsaw's traps during the time of Saw III and IV, but Strahm makes it out of his trap. The next day, the police hold a memorial service for all the cops who died while trying to capture Jigsaw. Hoffman receives a letter that says "I know who you are." So, he tries to frame Strahm to look like Jigsaw's apprentice. Meanwhile, five people have to play a game and work together in order to survive. Some of the traps were pretty cool. Strahm revisits some of the old Jigsaw traps, like Paul's razor wire trap from the original Saw. Jill receives a box from John/Jigsaw, but we don't get to see what's in it, maybe we'll find out in Saw VI! I love the twist ending! In conclusion, I'm glad Saw V was made and adds more to the story! If you love the Saw series, you'll love SAW V!!!
