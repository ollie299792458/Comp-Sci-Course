I saw this movie a year or two ago and wanted to watch it again and again.  I have only been able to find it on the internet.  Meryl Streep (Gail) portrays a former river rafting guide.  She decides to take her family on a white-water rafting trip for her son and to try and save her marriage with her husband that is hanging by a thread.  They meet up with a couple of strangers that seem to be in trouble.  Gail offers to help them down the river.  But what she thought were two helpless men, turn out to be criminals and take over the family.  They have to band together to outsmart the crooks.  It is a very good movie worth watching!  It has a little of everything: humor, excitement, suspense, thrilling, and a happy ending.  Be careful having your kids watch this, though.  As the movie progresses and tensions rise, there is some minor language that makes the movie realistic.  According to kidsinmind.com, the "f" word is used only once.  All the rest are common words you would expect to hear from a regular movie.  I give it two thumbs up!!!
