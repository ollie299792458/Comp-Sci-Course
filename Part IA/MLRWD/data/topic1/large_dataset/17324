Well, let's start with the positives first (in order of importance):

--First, the the heart of it all. David Tennant is delightful as Hamlet. It's a 4-star performance easily, possibly even a 5-star performance. Tennant played 3 series as a mad man with a box. Well, here he is playing a mad man (or is he?) without a box and it is just as entertaining. Purists may not like the extremes to which Tennant takes Hamlet's madness (calculated or not), but it is a wonderfully refreshing performance.
--Audio is crisp and clear.
--Production values are high.

And now the negatives (in order of importance):
--Final scene with Fortinbras discovering the wreckage of the Danish court is omitted. Not only does this leave the production ending on an odd note, but it renders all of the allusions to Fortinbras superfluous.
--This production attempts to "modernize" Hamlet to the present day (or at least something not far off from it--guns, video cameras, and casual t-shirt and jeans dress are present). That's not a bad thing in and of itself. But the attempt is half-hearted and uneven, serving more as a distraction and source of potential confusion than anything else.
--Patrick Stewart's performance as Claudius is remarkably different from the one in Branagh's production. It isn't bad, it isn't wooden, it's just very subdued. I suspect the change is due to the director rather than the actor.

Nonetheless, for Hamlet fans (other than, perhaps, purists), I'd rate this a "must see".
