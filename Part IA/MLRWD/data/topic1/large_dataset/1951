After Season 1, did we have any idea that he'd be able to top it with season 2 and in such a huge way? Chappelle's Show, Season 2 on DVD is the 2nd collection of the most hilarious skits ever aired on TV, from the mind of a true comedic genius: Dave Chappelle. Classic skits like Samuel Jackson Beer, The Racial Draft and his exploration into the "white people can't dance" myth in the 1st 3 episodes just barely scratched the surface...who knew that Prince, Lil Jon (YEAH!), P Diddy and of course Rick James would be his next vehicles to have us crying with laughter! These skits are ground breaking, all done with seemingly no fear. The "racial humor" he's created is not just the usual brand of comedy that's been done a million times before...he makes all stereotypes and the ignorance from all races, sexes, creeds and ages seem as ridiculously hilarious as they truly are. Dave Chappelle speaks directly to his generation and is absolutely understood because of the total truth behind his every word. It just doesn't get any better than this! With hopes of a 3rd season gone for good (A celebrity with priciples more important that the almighty $$$...Who knew?), it is a definite must have DVD loaded with extras and is uncensored! You'll have it to hold you over until he's back again...and he will be back! You can't keep a man this good down!
