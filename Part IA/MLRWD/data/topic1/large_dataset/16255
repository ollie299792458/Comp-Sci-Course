I'm one of the South Pacific's maniacs!  It is a religion not a rationally option. "It was born with me..."

But please we need a more decent edition. This one suffers of 2 or 3 problems

1) It's not anamorphic

2) Most of the differente takes "stops " a little before changing to another view - most notable in Lt. Cable first visit to Bali Hai

3) Original Theatrical Exhibition edition with the  "Bloddy Mary"/Bali Hai' sequence after Cockeyd Optimist/Some Enchanted Evening' sequence and not in the opposite way as it was presented for television broadcast

... And to a maniac, more extras are welcomed as interviews with some of the artists (Kerr and Gaynor, I think they are not dead...), making-of documentary and, of course, the extra scenes that transforms the 151 m regular version in the Originally shown version with 171 minutes

And, without doubts,  using the original TODD-AO print, as it was used (Thank God...) in this (yet) available DVD

And  as last request, a copy of the documentary THE MIRACLE OF TODD-AO presented before the projection of SOUTH PACIFIC during the first exibition of a TODD-AO movie in the United Kingdom and Portugal (1958/59)

(ALL in a beatiful box with 2 discs in a special de luxe edition)
