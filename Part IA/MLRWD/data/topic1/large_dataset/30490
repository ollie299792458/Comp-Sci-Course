well I wentt o see Scary Movie..... really looking forward to it after watching the commercials and stuff. but not knowing really what to expect. critics were all over the place on this one. Ebert gave it a thumbs up said it was funny. cranky hates these types of movies but enjoyed it.... blah blah blah.... not bad reviews I guess, TIME said it was good too.  so off the SCary Movie.... (Oh yeah saw the trailer for Blair Witch 2... bought chills down my spine). well off to Scary Movie..... right off the bat it's a parody of Scream... nearly exactly the same.... with an extra fart joke here and there. hahaha the movie is gross right in the first  5 minutes .... if that grosses you out, then leave immediately... cuz it gets grosser!!!! the movie is a take on most popular movies, like I know what u did last summer, Urban Legends (I think), Scream 1 &amp; 2, Blair Witch, Matrix and a few other movies which I won't mention. it's just joke after joke.... some work, and some don't....  the movie parodies are great... they are very perfectly timed.... my friend who was sooooo hesitant on watching it, laughed hard (the guy who told me to watch Titan AE, Gone in 60 Seconds.... ugh!)  the gross factor in the movie is UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!! if you thought, something about Mary, Road Trip or American Pie or South Park was gross. this movie is far worse~!!! I won't spoil it.... but the sexual nature of this movie is all over the place!!!! I was grossed out like twice.... which is saying a lot!!!  but all in all, if u like the Scream movies... then you'll like this.... if you can pass the gross factor. I laughed fairly hard since there were a lot of jokes I got since ethey were movie related. but the story was just a Sream parody.
