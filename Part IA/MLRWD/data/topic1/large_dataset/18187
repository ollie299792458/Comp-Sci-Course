Katharine Hepburn went from box office poison to box office magic with her magnificent performance in "The Philadelphia Story". She, along with the stellar ensemble cast, make this movie one of the all-time greats. At the center of the storyline is Tracy Lord (Hepburn), a somewhat pompous young woman, who is set to be married in a society wedding. Her intended, George Kittredge (John Howard), is a common man who has made good in the mining industry. When her ex-husband, C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant)appears on the scene as a pawn in a blackmail scheme initiated by "Spy" magazine, he brings with him writer Macaulay Connor (Jimmy Stewart) and photographer Elizabeth Imbrie (Ruth Hussey, who incidently was nominated for an academy award for her performance). In exchange for getting the scoop on the Kittredge / Lord-Haven nuptials, the publisher of "Spy" has agreed not to publish the story of a supposed "fling" that Tracy's father is having with a New York dancer. Therein lies the plot of the movie. However, on a deeper level, the movie addresses an awakening of sorts as, over a two day period, Tracy Lord is referred to as "the ice goddess", receives a dressing down by her father who call her a "prig", and by her fiance who "compliments" her by tell her she is like a goddess who is to be worshipped. The most touching line in the movie is when she says, "I don't want to be worshipped...I want to be loved". So there you have it...hopefully you will be enticed to watch the movie. You won't regret it. The movie is full of laughs aside from its more serious moments, I especially enjoy the performance of Virginia Weidler as Dinah Lord, Tracy's much younger sister. Watching her sing "Liddia, O Liddia...etc" is a delight in itself. She's a real character. Katharine Hepburn refered her in her later years and was quite fond of her. Anyway, if you're a Katharine Hepburn fan and can stand not having her teamed with her beloved Spencer, this is the movie for you!
