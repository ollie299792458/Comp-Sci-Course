I just watched this movie for like the 3rd or 4th time.  I remember renting it after it came out, since I had liked the first, and I wasn't impressed.  But then I bought the first and second a little while ago, and in watching it again, I found that it really grew on me, and for some reason actually scared me more the second or third time.  I just watched it again, and was still scared.  I don't understand the harsh criticism, I will say that the movie has only okay acting really, apart for a few scenes, but it is still pretty adequate.  There are a few things that may make you want to immediately turn it off though, like how the people act and talk, and especially that sheriff, who for some reason seems pleased that the horrible things happen at the end.  Although I just read that the movie company re-edited the movie, so that may be why it is so poorly received, im not sure.  Some of the editing is oddly sequenced. However, definitely give it a chance, and when you watch it again you will pick up what those quick creepy edits are throughout the movie.  I definitely think it is a good creepy, psychologically scary movie, although much different than the original.  If the director had his way maybe it would have been 10 times better too.  Even if you hate the movie, the plot and concept are still pretty original, you have to admit.
