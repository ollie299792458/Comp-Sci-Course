I own the three "mutiny" films -- the 1935 version, this one and the 80's Mel Gibson version (with Anthony Hopkins)simply called "The Bounty." Although the Gibson one is certainly the most authentic to the true story, my personal favorite of the three is this 1962 version with Marlon Brando. This movie is, for some strange reason, completely mesmerizing and engrossing! Its one of the most beautifully photographed films I've ever seen and Marlon Brando is great as Fletcher Christian.

The movie has historically been criticized as a dud, which is simply inexplicable. Many people loved the original '35 version and simply weren't open to a remake. I'm unbiased on the issue and own all three. Take it from me, the Brando version is far superior to the '35 black & white version in all departments. (I think perhaps people are just nostalgic about that older Clark Gable version). I also really love the more realistic Gibson version and highly reccomend it, but this Brando version is simply more compelling and more awesomely photographed.

One great scene depicts Fletcher Christian (Brando) after the muntiny secluded in his cabin on the ship, utterly depressed, while his fellow mutineers party it up on the island. This is a great, realistic scene. Christian knows he can never go home again.

One of my top five movies ever!
