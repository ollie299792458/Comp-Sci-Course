I came into this film with possibly unrealistic expectations.  I had heard so much about it, that I thought there was no way it could live up to the hype.
It did.
The Seventh Seal is an amazing movie.  It concerns a disillusioned Swedish knight (von Sydow) who returns from the Crusades to find his home being ravaged by the plague.  On the shore, he meets a masked robed figure who claims to be Death.  Rather than running in terror, the world-weary knight challenges him to a game of chess.  The game is played over several days, during which Bloc gets a look at how the townspeople are reacting in religious terror to the plague.
There are two parts of the film to be addressed.  Bergman's writing is anything but subtle.  It is the writing of a young artist just finding his voice.  He is trying to answer question life, God and morality.  The film asks how one can maintain faith when God is silent.  In this respect, the film is powerful in its bluntness.  Consider the masterful scene in which von Sydow confesses his questioning of faith to a man he thinks is a priest.  How he manages to find life, hope and possibly meaning amidst the rubble of his home in the family of entertainers.  The movie becomes a dark comedy in the late stages, including one of my favorite all-time movie lines as an actor begs for his life.
Bergman's directing is also excellent.  The aforementioned confession scence is remarkable.  The closing scene justifiably famous.  This is one of those films where the black and white medium is perfect.
This movie is well worth your time, even with he hefty price tag.
