This independent movie stars some pretty big name actors, Josh Lucas, Jon Hamm, Rhona Mitra, & James Van der Beek to name a few. Be forewarned though, this story of abducted and missing children is very, very grim. The acting is quite good, and the technique of telling this story, switching back & forth between two time lines, is done decently.  The movie is a bit slow as others have commented, but given the subject matter, this only adds to the sense of terror and despair.  This movie relates to a narrow range of people who have had these horrifying kinds of experiences thrust upon them. For the rest of us, it is nothing short of our worst fear as parents, and this film will leave most of us greatly disturbed.  Two stars for the acting and directing, but the subject of the film was too overwhelming for me.  I had to put on a kinder, more upbeat movie right away. Note that in a few of the extra features, several of the actors tried hard to put a brighter spin on this movie, feeling that there was some hope and a bit of redemption, but I definitely didn't see it!
