Makes you think... it could have done with less display in the rape scenes, but the visual does drive the point stronger... either we are more repulsed by it, take part in it, or both.  That's how twisted we can be.

I was so angry at the hypocrisy and unfairness that I thought Grace should have been more cruel, but that almost makes her one of them.

Maybe its not what the director intended, but Grace makes a good metaphor for Jesus, except when she turns out to be just human, like all of us and chooses justice over mercy.  I can't imagine choosing otherwise.

We have all betrayed, used, and abused Him (directly and indirectly) and others in some way (what we do to others, we do to Him).  Don't get me wrong, God is patient and forgiving in ways that humans can't be, but justice will be served eventually, but God is hoping we will change before it is too late, before we bring the day of judgment on ourselves.

For those of you asking "if God's almighty, why is there evil..." - God is  not the one committing the crimes, people are.  God is the one begging us to stop, but he does not chain us down, he has given us free will.  There will come a time when everyone's thirst for justice will be satisfied, no matter how much they have suffered.

I even wonder if there will come a time in heaven when those that have suffered from others will realize that the punishment for their oppressors has been sufficient, and at their request God may gladly set them free...
