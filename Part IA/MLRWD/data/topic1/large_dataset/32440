I was reluctant to buy this since I already own Lilo & Stitch on DVD and the posted special features didn't look all that different from the previous DVD release. But since this is one of my favorite Disney films I went and got it anyway.

I'm so glad I decided to buy this.

The biggest thing missing on the other DVD release was a commentary and I was legitimately surprised to find one here after Chris Sanders' recent turmoil with Disney.

The entire second disc is a documentary on the making of the film. Whereas most "making of" featurettes for animated films last about 10 minutes and focus on the voice talent, this one is 2 hours long (more than 30 minutes longer than the actual film) and covers almost every step of the production you could think of. From the origins of the story, though major plot changes, on down to playing with the Happy Meal toys.

Even better than the actual documentary are the "footnotes," clips that support the main piece. These include earlier versions of scenes, drawing sessions with the lead animators, and interviews with animation legends Joe Grant & Maurice Noble. My personal favorite is the production style guide that defines basic rules of the Lilo & Stitch look.

This is right up there with Disney's 2 disc version of Atlantis for the sheer amount of extras. If you're an animation fan, you have to get this.
