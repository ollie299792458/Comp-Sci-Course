If you're interested in this "movie", then it's probably because you are already a Farscape fan, and I don't need to go into why that program was an extremely under-rated joy to watch.  On the other hand, if you ARE a Farscape fan, then you also know that you HAVE to watch Peacekeeper Wars because of the abrupt (and very unsatisfactory) ending of the series finale.

To make a long story short, Peacekeeper Wars is necessary to tie up all of the loose ends of the brilliant sci-fi series Farscape.  The ending is exactly what you expect will happen, albeit not quite as happy for all of your favorite characters as it could have been. Peacekeeper Wars uses familiar plot devices, action sequences and (sometimes frustrating) interpersonal conflicts of the diverse crew of Moya that you fell in love with long ago.  Unlike Serenity, which arguably wrapped up the even more unfairly under-rated Firefly series, Peacekeeper Wars is very faithful to the mechanics of the original program, and there aren't that many jarring surprises.  Of course, unlike Serenity, Peacekeeper Wars is NOT a stand alone feature and will only confuse you if you haven't bothered watching the entirety of the Farscape series.  (And let's face it, you should anyway...it's good for your sci-fi karma.)

The only truly sad part about Peacekeeper Wars is that once the credits roll, you know that the story is finally over.  Of course, in every good sci-fi flick there is always the possibility of future open-ended 'adventure', but in this case, at least you get to lay the series propertly to rest.  It's actually a shame that more shows as beloved by its fans as this one don't get similar treatment.
