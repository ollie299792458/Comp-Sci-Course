I hope that sometime in the future historians will look back and see that the day Jim Henson died was truly one of the saddest days in entertainment history.  I say this because I hold the opinion that what Jim Henson was trying to achieve with The Muppets (in all their guises) is what all artists should strive to do regardless of medium.  Somewhere in all the mayhem that is the world of Muppets is an inherently pure desire to entertain and put a smile on people's faces.  That's not to say art shouldnt be thought-provoking or controversial (a la Eminem or The Meat Dress) but what we all should strive to achieve is the 100% achievement of the goal that Jim Henson accomplished with his felt creations.  They make us laugh while teaching us more about the world and ourselves than I feel will ever be given to their credit.  Children of the last 3 generations have grown up with the Muppets in some form or another because we as a society trust them never to steer us in the wrong direction.  Muppets make mistakes just like we all do, but in the end they know the difference between right and wrong and always try their best to go in the proper direction.  I guess that's why I always cry when Gonzo sings "I'm Going To Go Back There Someday": because to see a Muppet sad after trying so hard to make us smile... well... lets just say that sometimes an image, a word, a song can speak more truth than any of us will ever know.
I miss you Jim Henson.
