Those of you who think or are making the statements that another release with more extras and at a much lower price is not on the horizon are, in my opinion, the people trying to sell this item for the considerably profit margin. Whether or not this practice is morally repugnant is one of personal choice, but to suggest, by proxy, that they better buy at this price or forever be "out of luck" is suspect.

As for the movie itself, I like it. It has a tongue and cheek feel with some great gore. Roddy Mcdowall hands in an excellent performance and the vampire next door story runs well from beginning to end. It's an 80's movie that was on the "B" shelf with mostly unknown actors, barring of course Mr. McDowall, it transcended its genre and budget. When I saw it as a teenager when released to theaters I was very surprised by it and I think it has withstood the test of time.

FYI, for those who know what I am talking about, an HD Quality version is available online for free!
