Having begun to experience Miyazaki's genius with My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, and Ponyo, I guess I was expecting something that would affect me as deeply and make me laugh as sweetly...  It just wasn't to be.  The characters are developed enough, so maybe it's the voices chosen for the actors?  The voice of Sheeta reminds me a little too much of Eilonwy in The Black Cauldron, which was to my ears, grating at its best.  Pazu is a bit too "happy go lucky" in his tone for much of the beginning.  I don't know....  It just didn't affect me like the others I mentioned.  I still talk about aspects of Spirited Away and Ponyo with my five-yr-old, but this one isn't mentioned much and my kids don't ask to watch it as much either.  More could have been done with the robots, I think.  The ending was almost anticlimactic, due to such a long build-up, and a bit too obvious.  Loved the pirates, and I think they are my kids' favorite characters, also.  I get Mayazaki's lesson and moral overtones referencing Japan's experiences with atomic weaponry and the devestation that followed, just didn't get as much from the delivery aspects, like I did in Spirited Away.  Still way better than any unimaginative Disney remake of a classic fairy tale, so I still gave it five stars!!
