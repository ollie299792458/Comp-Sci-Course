I should say first that this should be a good movie, at least on paper.  John Hurt and Richard Burton turn in solid performances, and everything about the production -- set design, costumes, etc. -- looks just as it should.  But there is something lacking in this adaptation that makes it pale compared to the book.

Orwell's _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ was, largely, _about_ reading and writing, and the power they give to people.  As such, it is a thrilling novel, and a great pleasure to read.  Seeing John Hurt writing in Winston Smith's diary doesn't quite cut it for me; the essential spirit is lost in the translation to film.

Beyond this, there are also some more mundane elements of the plot and characters that were cut to fit the screening time.  What I missed most was Smith's growing frustration with Julia being "only a revolutionary from the waist down" and his schoolboyish admiration (affection, really) for O'Brien.

The only real highlight of the movie is the constant voiceovers coming from the telescreens regarding the progress of the war and the rooting out of traitors.  Orwell's vision is captured perfectly here, and the woman who read the "news" voiceovers gets the tone exactly right.

All in all, the movie is nowhere nearly as compelling as the book, and isn't really worth the trouble.  In the time it takes you to procure and watch the movie, you could be halfway through the book.
