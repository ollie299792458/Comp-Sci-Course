Minuses: 1-Poor graphic effects with the cannon fire and columns marching at Marye's Heights. 2- Actors aged their 10 years after Gettysburg, waited too long to film. 3-Music not as good as expected. Dylan's last song was ruined...it could have been sung better by others I believe.
Pluses: 1- Correct rendering of Christianity within both sides. Despite detractors, reading period articles verifies this. 2- Excellent location choices. 3- Bringing back Jeff Daniels. Too bad Berenger couldn't be there too. 4- Duvall as Lee; great to have an actual direct descendant of Lee's play the part! 5-Installment of slavery as wrong in key areas. Possibly not enough of that shown, but the point got over. 6- Verifications of state's rights as a major player. Think about it...600,000 Southerners fought; 11,000 of them plus or minus were actual slaveholders. Regardless of your stance on slavery, do you really think 589,000 people would want to die for the wealthiest 11,000??? Sure, it was about slavery, but it was state's rights too. This movie pushed that idea. They will get in trouble for it, but that's the way it goes these days.
