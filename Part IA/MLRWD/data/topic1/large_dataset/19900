Every Sunday nite for the past three weeks (wow, what a streak) I rent movies. That's just procedure. I got Zoolander last Sunday along with They Call Me Trinity, which I have already submitted a review for.
Here's what I thought of Zoolander:
!) Ben Stiller is wonderfully original and funny as the equal opportunity idiot in his role as Zoolander.
2) Owen Wilson has fine style and is a wonderful actor.
3) Mugatu was just plain hideous to look at.
4) The "walk-off" segment of the movie was just plain stupid. Who proves anything coming down a runway? 
5) What is with that pulling the underwear out of your pants thing? Ouch!
6) Matilda was fine in her role as the perky reporter type. And she's also hot.
To put it simply, Zoolander was a selection for Sunday nite that I did not expect to pan out. Thought I'd be watching The Practice or something instead. 
I'd watch this movie again, but it only deserves four stars for horrid fashions and for the somewhat awkward scenes (the run-off) and for.....you guessed it.....MUGATU!
