I have heard some reviewers whine and complain about how horrible this movie is because we are led to sympathize with the bad guys. One reviewer, Daniel Wahl, even rants about how the movie industry is taking a happy wonderful genre and turning it dark and horrible. Well, I want to say that I personally can't stand those syrupy sweet, unrealistic musicals where everything is so nice, the good guys always win with a minimum of effort and all is right with the world. Also, this is not some spur of the moment musical. It is a classic, having been written and rewritten as a classic Broadway musical and various movie versions, one starring Marilyn Monroe. It is based on the real trials of two women in the thirties who did get away with murder. It is dark AND sexy, and the scene with the lady murderers singing about killing their men is one of the sexiest in the movie. If you want sweet and cheerful, get the Sound of Music (gag me with a spoon.) If you want a truly spectacular movie musical, get Chicago.
