Take a binder. Put some doodles on it and it is interesting. Now take that same binder and erase all your doodles. It looks bland and boring. American Splendor is that erased binder. It is boring but people put that into genius.
The film goes nowhere. It is a biography, but it doesn't have a plot at all so it fails to really grab my attention. It is not funny. Nothing about it is funny. It is depressing, but at the same time flat. The characters aren't that interesting as they are all the same. Boring. How is that genius? I don't feel entertained or enlightened while watching this film. People will praise the worst things just because they are different. This biography isn't being nominated for best film of the year as some thought. The reason? It isn't that good.
You dont have to be a "critic" to tell someone when something is good or bad. This movie is bad. It starts lifeless and it ends the same way. Lifeless. Do you want to watch someone who makes every situation miserable?
Well, the movie is doing bad on sales for a reason at least! Same goes for not winning any awards.
