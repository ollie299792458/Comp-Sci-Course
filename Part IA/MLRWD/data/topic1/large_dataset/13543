Just about all the reviews on this page are about how the remasterization is, so I'll talk about the film itself.

It starts out looking like the beginning of an Andy Griffith episode. In the small town of Suddenly meet Ellen Benson, an everyday sweetheart single mom who's husband died in the war, her Opie-like son, and the town police chief whom with she shares a mutual but repressed on her part attraction. All three are lovable, but painfully ordinary. Next we learn the president will make a two-second train stop in their little town, and CIA agent are swarming the train station. A visitor claiming to be such an agent (Sinatra, who took 15 mins. to show up)asks to "check the house". You saw it coming. Sinatra's Jonny Baron is a hitman hired to kill Mr. President, choosing Ellen's house overlooking the train station as a shooting point. The day goes on, and the death count rises,and Baron somewhat inadverdently reveals more of his psyche.  But what would have been just your average home-invasion thriller is made into something more with Sinatra's tour de force performance and a very compelling script showing a thorough anatomy of a madman. After your average happy Hollywood ending, suburbia has reverted to its normal state.
Like The Manchurian Candidate, Suddenly! was withdrawn from circulation by Sinatra after the JFK assassination and showed up thirty-odd years later in a cheap public domain version.The film is not at all scary (this is coming from someone who's never seen something scarier than Jurassic Park)yet manages to be thought provoking and fully entertaining.
