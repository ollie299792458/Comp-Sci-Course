I read "Holes" several years back for a children's literature course I took in college.  I highly enjoyed it!  It was one of the best books I read in that class.
So when they introduced the movie, I was quite interested.  Part of me was hopeful it would turn out well, the other part of me was skeptical that it would be anywhere near as good as the book.  However, my fears were dashed.  This movie was FABULOUS!
The story jumps back and forth a little between three different tales -- the story of Elya Yelnats, the main character's "no good, dirty-rotten, pig-stealing great-great-grandfather"; the story of Stanley Yelnats IV himself; and the story of a legendary outlaw, Kissing Kate Barlow.  The three stories are interwoven quite ingeniously.  In some cases, you aren't completely sure what the connection will be, but then when you find out, it fits perfectly.
The story IS slightly altered, of course, as most books-brought-to-movies tend to be.  But it very much keeps the spirit of the original book.  The boys are very believable -- I especially love Zero!  Sigourney Weaver makes a wonderfully nasty warden.  And John Voigt does a wonderful insane portrayal of Mr. Sir.
This movie will keep you laughing and curious throughout.  And if you enjoyed the book, you'll like this film!
