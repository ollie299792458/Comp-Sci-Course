after reading so many glowing reviews, i have to admit that i was very underwhelmed with the Love Hina anime (and manga).  i agree with some of Angrymofo's comments and review that is buried somewhere down the comments list.

1.  at it's heart, it is a soap opera... who loves who and why.  that in itself is fine except that there is really only 1 main story - keitaro and naru.  and just when keitaro seems to have worked things out with his emotions... all of a sudden, Naru has issues.
2.  jokes are constantly repeated.  how many times can we see keitaro getting punched into the air after an inappropriate accident?  first time it was funny but, after the 15th time, it loses some impact.
3.  it is a story of insecurity.  every episode is basically someone being insecure.  (eg keitaro fails his test,  naru fails her test, motoko fails her test, shinobu is worried about failing her test...) again, i felt that this was a theme that was way too overdone (and frankly, my sympathy was wearing out b/c the insecurity was so stupid.  arguably, i guess they always are.)  and the plot devices are repetitive - just change the name of the person having the crisis.
4.  the characters that i liked the most were the most underdeveloped.  (mutsumi and mitsune).  24 (25) episodes and 3 ovas should be plenty to do more.  the manga does a better job.

what started out as an interesting and humorous series gradually turned into a tedious soap opera and one that i wished would just end.  i guess this type of anime is just not my cup of tea.

to be fair, there are moments that are quite funny and i had no problems w/ some of the ridiculous events that occur (since i don't expect logic in anime).  the only other humorous anime that i really enjoyed would be... maybe, Azumanga Daioh (5 stars, imo).
