Amazon should let you rate DVDs in 3 categories: storyline, visuals and packaging/extras. This rating is for the visuals.

I've seen the Japanese R2 release of Origin. In terms of character designs/development and plot,this movie offers nothing new. You'll have Akira flashbacks when one of the characters starts transforming into a plant. Were it not for the unique, yet satisfying soundtrack, you could comfortably watch this on mute.

Where this movie absolutely, completely crushes is in the mix of 2D and 3D animation. The backgrounds are incredibly detailed and vibrant. The action sequences are fluid and look natural, almost lifelike. Visually, everything just seems to click. The art team obviously put a tremendous amount of work into getting this movie close to perfection. If you've seen the Korean animation flick named "Wonderful Days" in R2, "Sky Blue" in R1, it kind of has that look and feel. Offtopic: Wonderful Days also had the same problem of weak plot, but stunning visuals.

The soundtrack is pretty good, with 20th century classical music, J-pop tunes and what sounds like Eastern European-influenced chant.

GONZO is doing it big time. In addition to Origin, they also released "Brave Story", another 2D/3D masterpiece, in Japan last year. If you like the eye candy in Last Exile, Origin is the movie for you. Although it does not have the character design complexity of SteamBoy or Karas, it is definitely in that class graphically.  If the story had been deeper and more involved, Origin could have done for Anime in 2007 what Ghost in the Shell did for it back 1995.
