This is really a pretty bad movie. Read the book instead, it's much better. The movie, unfortunately, never could have lived up to the book.
The movie is not terrible, it definitely has some good points. The  cast is excellent, perfect for the movie. There is one thing that really  stands out though, and makes it lose a lot of what it could have had - the  lack of special effects. Now, when I went to see this, I didn't go to see  just the special effects, I went to see a good movie. But for one like  this, FX are a big part  of it. You never even saw the giant squid! Plus,  they cut out what is probably the best part of the book (I won't say what  it is in case you read it).
Also, the ending is utterly confusing and  stupid. The book's ending made sense (to me at least, apparenly not to a  lot of people that reviewed the book). The movie's ending is very strange  and pointless - they didn't change it a lot, there's still the same end  result, but it's quite bad. Also note that they originally had a different  ending, which test audiences hated, so they changed it. Hmmmm . . .
My  advice in this case is read the book instead.
