John Wayne gives probably his most endearing performance as Sheriff John T. Chance.  "T, for trouble" said Angie Dickinson, Wayne's love interest in the film, and one of the few women who was ever able to stand up to Duke on the silver screen.  Dean Martin's performance as "Dude" Chance's drunken deputy, makes me cheer everytime I watch the movie.  Obviously, Walter Brennan's performance as the old cripple is unparalleled, and his comic relief adds to the genuine enjoyment of this movie.  Ricky Nelson is good as the cocky young gunslinger who's out to make a name for himself, although sometimes it seems like his role was simply thrown into the movie to give it more of an appeal to younger viewers.
If you want a great western with drama, humor, romance, and action, look no further than Rio Bravo.  I would have to say that this is my favorite John Wayne film, although El Dorado and True Grit both run a close second.  A film for western fans and non-western fans alike.  No larger-than-life heroes, even with the presence of Wayne, but the bad guys sure make you hate them.  Rent it today!
