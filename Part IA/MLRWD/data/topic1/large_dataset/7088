the best movie of Toronto Film Festival for 2005! i saw this film with a friend on a night where we didn't know what else to watch, and how lucky we were to have seen this film from Danny Boyle. movies like "Millions" are rare nowadays, a type of movie that makes you leave the room thinking "i have learned something today, what should i do next?".

set in a suburbia in England - Damien, his brother Anthony and his father Ronnie, starts a new life after their mother's death to a new home, in a new middle-class neighbourhood. Damien, a child with quite a character and vast imagination, communicates with saints and martyrs, he even knows about their past lives and miracles [frankly, i think this is how he deals with his mother's death]. when a bag full of money fell in front of him, he questions himself, what would a saint do if he has a bag full of money? give them to the poor !

his brother Anthony however does not think the same. with England changing to Euros, they've only a time to spend all their money before all their millions become worthless and Anthony decides to spend the money on his family and friends.

the movie plots itself to keep you thinking "if i am in their position, what would have i done?". the movie leaves you knowing that money REALLY can not buy all the happines in the world.

my favourite scene in the movie would have been of Damien and St. Peter, where the saint talks about the truth behind the miracles, which would leave a viewer realizing that sometimes a small miracle is just a small act of love.

this movie is a great film to watch with the family or someone you love, prefferably during the holiday season as the film was set in that time frame as well. this movie is not suspicious at all, it's surprisingly unusual. i underestimated the cheesines of the opening in the movie and that same cheesines left me applauding in the theatre and left me thinking

...i learned something new today, what should i do next?
