Day of the Dead is, contrary to opinion, not the finale to George Romero's living dead franchise. A fourth film in the series is currently in preproduction with no firm release date. Day of the Dead was originally slated as the epic Zombie movie of all time but budget cuts forced Romero to rewrite his lengthy and effects heavy original script (I have read it and little survives into this picture). This said, Day of the Dead is one of my favourite horror movies as it combines the best attributes of fine horror film making - good direction, committed acting, interesting story and well executed special effects. Written off as talky and boring by most critics at the time, more recent reviews have described Day as an example of "a master filmmaker at work". Loathe to appreciate semi-exploitation films like Day of the Dead critics have had no choice but to take a second look at the film and own up to what a great director George Romero had matured into by 1985 and with his subsequent (but sporadic) future projects. Day of the Dead is a tightly directed, well acted brutal horror film that belies its (relatively) small budget and is what I define as a keeper and one of those films that increases its effectiveness with repeated viewing so enjoy!

P.S. Land of the Dead is good too!
