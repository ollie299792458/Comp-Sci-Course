I loved the movie; however, the packaging with the ultraviolet digital copy is not what I will tolerate. I've been through that frustration so much with the new films. Personally, I look forward to downloading only the digital copy on I-Tunes.

The decision means I play it on my Apple TV setup. The film is in my library, where I have easy access and where I can add it to my I-pad or I-pod. And if in the next while something happens to erase the film from my library, I can download it again from I-Tunes from the home site, where you can put it back into your library without a charge.

I won't be buying the packaging. Why do that? I don't need another film to stick on a shelf.

But I will buy this film. It's why I gave it five stars. Although I liked all three equally well, the first and third are my favorites. I love the way the writers and producers and director tied things together.

What more can I say about the cast? It is an incredible movie.

But like I said, I'm tired of the Ultra Violet mumbo jumbo. I'm tech savy, but that option is a rip off--no way around feeling that way.
