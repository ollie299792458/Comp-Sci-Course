I didn't know what to expect from this movie to be honest.  Upon finding out I was 3/4 German and studying behaviors of Nihilists, my friend said I would probably like a part of this movie with a ferret and three German Nihilists.  I also watched a Youtube Poop (comedic videos of cartoon shows with overdubs and other material on youtube) where the "Is this your homework Larry?" scene's audio was overdubbed on a few scenes of "Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog" which depicted an angry Dr. Robotnik and Grounder the Robot interogating Sonic about his homework and the stolen car and money. My friend said it was also made by the succesful Coen Brothers who also made one of my favorite movies, "No Country For Old Men". With the main character as an unemployed slob (Jeff Bridges) who does pot, drinks white russians, gets mistaken for a multi-millionaire with the exact same name, and hangs out with a Nam vet (John Goodman) and an oblivious master bowler (Steve Buscemi), I was laughing at the movie's comedic value and amazed at the compelling story and great plotline. I recommend that everyone watch this movie at least once, because it would be a shame to miss out on this funny and well-done masterpiece. If you like heists gone wrong, angry cripples, friendly porn company owners, hot trophy wives, german nihilists, and nude feminists, this movie is for you.
In other words, I give this movie a 5/5 for being original and funny.
