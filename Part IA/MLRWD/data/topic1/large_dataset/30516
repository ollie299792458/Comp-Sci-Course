I have to admit that I was not looking forward to seeing some of the more serious and socially conscience episodes of the Golden Girls during the fifth season, considering the fact that I did not watch them in syndication. Fortunately I bought the dvd set and realized how great those episodes were, like the 2-part episode Sick and Tired. It had a whole new meaning to me after learning it was based on the show's creater and writer Susan Harris. Clinton Avenue memories made me a little teary eyed, considering Estelle Harris ended up suffering a similiar fate. I suppose the show needed to reflect the times and they did it with such grace and humor!!!

I especially enjoyed Dancing in the Dark episode because all the Gals got all dolled up and went to this classy nightclub. It made me wonder if places like that really exist for older people that still like to hang out and go dancing! Perhaps they'll be around when I become a Golden Girl, but in the meantime I'll continue to enjoy Dorothy, Blanche, Rose, and Sophia on dvd!!!
