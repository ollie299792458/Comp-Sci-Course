Make no mistake, this is a movie made by musicians, *for* everyone, but *about* the power and magic of making music.  If you are the kind of person who can hear Glen Hansard tell his band "OK, it's in 5/4" and go, REALLY?!! then ONCE is the movie you have been waiting for these many years.  I have shown it to audiences of 12-18 year old kids who sat riveted through the whole thing, (very mild) adult content and all, when three years ago they'd have been watching cartoons.  If you love gentle romance, music, Ireland or any combination of the three, I cannot recommend ONCE highly enough.  The one suggestion I would have, especially in showing it to others who don't hear a lot of Dublin accents, is to turn on the English subtitles.  It really helps to know exactly what they're saying when they get going fast or the crowd noise rises.

And it's not central to the movie or the review, but I can't leave without saying - How cool is it! - that Glen Hansard has a leading role in the two great Irish music movies of modern times.  Fair play, as he'd say. Ten cent!  Brilliant.
