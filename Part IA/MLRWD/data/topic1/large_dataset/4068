Indeed the epoch of manifestation of God through the Prophets climaxing in the Old Testament, markedly ended with St. John the Baptist transitioning the History into era of Christianity. Of course with Jesus on the ground, the manifestations of God were no longer of prophesy but of miracles and awesome presence of God for thirty years. In the 2000 years to present day the eyes of spirits for succeeding generations, have seen generous manifestations of God, not much in miracles but in advancement of various branches of science, technological innovations, medicine, clarifications in theological philosophy, and inspired artistic works be it of painting, writing, poetry or cinematography. Philip Yancey is one of the writers I consider to be spiritually inspired in the mastery of Christianity. I have read almost all of his books including this book: Prayer.

I recommend it highly together with other Philip Yancey's books for all Christians.

I pray that Yancey continue to hold high the banner of Christianity with pen and paper hoping that one day before he retires will write about the First Christian - The Blessed Virgin Mary.
