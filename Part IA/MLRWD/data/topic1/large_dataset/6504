The original film is 116 minutes while this cut version is only 108 minutes.
Eight minutes of action cut!

The original film was released at 2.20/1 aspect ratio while this panned and scanned version is cropped to 1.77/1.

Both of these faults make this Blu-Ray version totally unacceptable.

Buy at your own risk.

I just noticed that Amazon put cover photos of the box and it shows the film as 116 minutes and 2.40/1 aspect ratio.

I have just ordered the film due to this new information which is totally different from what is listed on the description page for this Blu-Ray.

It's too bad that Amazon can't get their act together on their descriptions of films.

UPDATE: May 4, 2012.

I received the disk yesterday, which was sent in a bubble envelope without any invoice, played it last night and enjoyed the film greatly.

What they sent was 116 minutes long and 2.40/1 aspect ratio.

I would like to up my rating from 1 to 4 stars for this great film.

My only complaint is the packaging. The clam-shell case has cut-outs on the front and back only covered by the printed paper exterior label, a very flimsy experience.

The packaging, I rate at 2 stars.
