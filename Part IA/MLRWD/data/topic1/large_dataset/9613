I don't think it is possible to be sorry that you took 100 minutes out of your life to watch this film.  "Frozen River" is a flat out masterpiece.  It is stark, low key and simplistic in its production, but the power of the story, its characters and their decisions will stay with you long after you've seen it.  This is by far a film that is so real and so timely that you almost feel as if you are standing alongside these characters, following them throughout their days.  It is best to just experience this movie.  Don't read too much about it, don't try to find spoilers, just let it absorb you.

Melissa Leo gives one of the most quietly understated performances I have seen in recent memory, and at the same time, it is also one of THE most powerful performances in years.  Her Oscar Nomination was no fluke and you'll see why.  Misty Upham was absolutely heartbreaking.  The entire film/production is just top notch.  I was surprised by "Frozen River," and three days after watching it, am still haunted by its beautiful desperation.  What a great film.
