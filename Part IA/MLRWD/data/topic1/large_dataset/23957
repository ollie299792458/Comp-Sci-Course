It's often said that "everyone sees a different movie". One thing is clear from reading the reviews here, this is a "love it or hate it" film. Hollywood has released no good comedies in a long, long time. I almost didn't see this one because I expected it to be as bad. Was I glad I was wrong! There will never be a 'chase' movie as good as "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World", but Rat Race comes closer than any so far. Take a look at the other reviews and you'll see that not everyone likes dumb comedies. If you like to turn off your brain for two hours and just laugh, this is for you. If you are interested in what movie critics are looking for: character development, believability, I suggest you look elsewhere. Everyone in this movie is just fantastic, especially Jon Lovitz. I recently saw him live on Broadway in Neil Simon's "The Dinner Party" and I was amazed how he could bring the house down with just one expression. He does the same thing here, especially in the Hitler scene which is the film's highlight. Another nice surprise is how well Cuba Gooding Jr. does comedy. I never really cared for him before and thought he over-acted in movies like "Instinct". The nicest thing about this movie is it's completely unpredictable. You never know what to expect. I for one didn't expect to find a movie so good that I would see it in the theatre three times in one week, something I have never done before. This is a fun movie to see with a group of friends who want to have a good time. How about a sequel?
