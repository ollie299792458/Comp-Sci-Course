I'm going to disagree in part with many of the culture war polemicists and suggest that this movie is not primarily intended to push a particular set of socially liberal values, although it's fairly evident to me that the director identifies with that camp.  Instead, I saw the film as issuing twin condemnations of the knee-jerk responses humans often exhibit upon encountering life's complexities: the urge either to forcibly recreate the world as a tightly controlled utopia aligned with our own ideals, or to withdraw in detached cynicism and employ gallows humor and escapism to ward off issues we prefer not to face. The former pitfall is reflected in the deliberate heavy-handed inflexibility of the 1950s stereotyping, while the latter is exemplified by the initial mindset of the Tobey Maguire character.  
I believe Pleasantville urges us instead to confront the complexities of existence and interpersonal relationships head-on--not mindlessly, as in a 1950s sitcom, but armed with an informed value system born of personal experience as well as social traditions.  Sexuality gets a lot of play here because it is the quintessential primal urge, but the film also suggests that there are worthy goals beyond "scoring", and other barriers to enlightenment besides excess clothing. After the symbolic transition from b/w to color is complete, some of the characters do end up realigning themselves with "conservative" traditionalist values.  The key is that they do so intelligently and autonomously from a perspective of personal experience.  The message I heard was not that one morality is superior to another, but that the unpredictability and instability that inevitably accompany the gift of free will are no excuse for failing to exercise it.
