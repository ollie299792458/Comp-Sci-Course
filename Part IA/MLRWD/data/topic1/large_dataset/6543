John Carpenter has managed to create his own genre throughout the past three decades and had become an auteur from early on, with films like Halloween (1978), Escape from New York (1981), and The Thing (1982).  But this time he regurgitates the "gotcha!" moment filled horror films that are all too present these days.

The Ward is a supposed psychological horror film that contains a zombie-like ghost that haunts a mental asylum but instead of maintaining a creepy atmosphere and having an intriguing way to retell the popular story of a haunted asylum, Carpenter simply rips off other schlock films The Grudge and The Ring remakes.  He utilizes the tired approach of "gotcha!" moments when things are just around each corner and never attempts to intrigue us with a premise that's new.

Also, the film is entirely predictable and to add insult to injury, it rips off Fight Club and Identity, in which the latter was a terribly predictable film on its own.

The Ward didn't bore me but bothered me because I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters within it; and hiring Jared Harris hadn't helped either because even his presence and acting skills could not save this dreadfully dull experience.

This is not a John Carpenter film by a stretch, even if his name is on the DVD and Blu-ray cover boxs.  This film is a rental at best.  Or even better, watch it for free if you can borrow it off of a friend who had the misfortune of purchasing it.
