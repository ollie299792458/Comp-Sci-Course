the only thing that keeps this movie from getting one star is the fact that john wayne is in it, and the terrific band of actors who play the outlaws.  the downfall of this movie is the character played by kim darby.  she is supposed to be a 14 year old girl in the old west and yet she some how seems to bully everyone she meets to do exactly what she wants them to do.  the whole sequence with the horse trader in town is the perfect example.  there is no way all these men living on the western frontier would let a little girl push them around no matter how good her lawyer supposedly is.  the biggest travisty is the way she pushes around john wayne's character.  he is supposed to be such a big bad marshall that half the time he can't bring back his prisoners alive yet he bows to this little girls every whim.  i'll agree with eariler reviewers that the last act is great and the band of outlaws with dennis hopper and robert duvall are great but it's not enough to save the movie from kim darby's character mattie ross.
