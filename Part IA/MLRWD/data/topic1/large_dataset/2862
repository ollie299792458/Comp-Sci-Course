"Hearts in Atlantis" is a touching and nicely done film. It has a good story to it and it is greatly enjoyable. It is about a young boy who lives in a small town in Connecticut with his mother and his the events that take place when a man(Anthiny Hopkins) comes to stay in their house with them. There is much more to the story, but you have to go see it to find out what else. I greatly enjoyed this film. There have been so many awful films this year that it was nice to see a really good one for a change that I did not walk out of feeling any bit of disappointment for. I think Anthony Hopkins did a great job in this film and should definitely be recognized for it when oscar nominations are decided. Also, the young boy in the film is good too. It was really nice to see good acting by a young actor for a change, most child actors couldn't act to save their lives. I also really liked director Scott Hicks directing style. He makes some of the best looking films out there and he really uses his gift with this film. So if you read this review, take my advice and go see this film because it really is one of the better ones out there today.
