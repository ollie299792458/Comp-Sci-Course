I was in my Hollywood video store with a bunch of 99-cent coupons for rentals and not many ideas on what I wanted to get, when I spotted the cover of this video.  Although I consider myself pretty savvy on all things movie-related, I had never heard of this film and I did not recognize the actress on the cover. I did, however, recognize Mark Ruffalo's name and found the storyline intriguing.  So, for 99 cents, I took the bait.

I was extremely satisfied with this selection, moreso than with a lot of blockbusters I'd rented over the years.

It's a bittersweet story--well-acted and believably portrayed.  This story not only entertains but also teaches lessons, the main one being that life is short and we only have one chance to get what we want out of it.

The main review does mention the dissatisfaction some critics had with the fact that the main character (Annie) pursues a romance with a total stranger.  This bothered me somewhat as well, especially since she was so in love with her husband and he with her.  And this poor man, played by Ruffalo, gets drawn in by this woman he has no idea is using him.  But that said, nothing diminishes from the spirit of the movie--the warmth, the pathos, the intrigue.

My Life Without Me is one of those films that draws you in and keeps you there . . . till the very end.
