Looks good.

Sounds good.

Treasure trove of bonus features. It's great to hear Serling trash his own work in the audio from the Sherman Oaks course. You can actually hear him smoking!

BUT...

The Blu-ray logistics don't appear to be quite right. I purchased this item this week and have only tried disc 1. When you play an episode with commentary activated, there's no way to play it without that commentary. Unless you activate a different commentary or audio mix. But once one alternate audio track has been activated for an episode, there is no option to watch the episode "clean." It latches on to that alternate audio and won't let go. Unless you go back to the main menu and then turn off the BD player, then turn it back on again.

Am I using an old, out-of-date BD player? Nope. Panasonic DMP-BDT350 with the latest firmware update.

I hope Image Entertainment isn't planning a 2013 release: "The Twilight Zone Definitive Blu-ray Series With Correctly Working Menus/Special Features" in hopes of more re-buys.
