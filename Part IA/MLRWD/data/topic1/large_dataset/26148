Boys Don't Cry is one of the most intense and devastating movies I've seen in a long while.  The feelings of hope and longing, and their counterparts  - despair and disillusionment - that so often are part of a homosexual's  life are very well described.  As the story develops it becomes clear that  it will lead to an unhappy ending, but to which extent its ending will be  an unhappy one is hard to imagine till one gets to it.  Whether the movie  accurately reports what happened in real life or not, does not make its  fatal outcome any less tragic.  The acting in Boys Don't Cry is superb.  In fact, along with the plot, I find the acting to be one of the movie's  strongest and most valuable aspects: all actors and actresses in this film  deserve to be highly praised, but especially - I will admit - Hilary Swank.  
However, Boys Don't Cry has its weak points as well: one of them is its  cinematography, which I found by no mean up to the movie's standards: the  visual language is, in my opinion, dull, and at times even ridiculous in  its mocking of modernistic techniques that simply clash in the otherwise  conventional context.  The soundtrack too could have been better planned.  That's why I decided to rate this film "four stars" and not a full five.  Overall, I guess, Boys Don't Cry was more concerned with content than with  form.  And when it comes to content, one most certainly has plenty think  about after watching this remarkable movie.
In the year of the World Gay  Pride, I wish Boys Don't Cry - or a film of the same caliber - had been  chosen as an emblem of  the psychological, social and material traumas  homosexuals are still confronted with in our society, in the year 2000.
