Out of all the Royal Rumbles, this is by far the best. Some would disagree and say that the 91' Royal Rumble (Ric Flair wins), the 99' Royal Rumble (Vince McMahon wins), or even the 02' Royal Rumble (HHH wins) are better; but, to me, this was the most entertaining. Remember, I said the best Royal Rumble, not the best pay-per-view. When I say Royal Rumble, I am speaking of the Rumble match itself. From the beginning with the Hardy's going at it - to Drew Carey's enterance - to the Hardcore Rumble - to Kanes complete domination - to Austin coming out with Undertaker and Kane in the ring - all the way to the last man who stood alone..which we all know is Austin..this Rumble did not have one moment where it lost your attention. I have watched this Rumble over and over again. One of my favorite gimmick matches of all time.
The rest of the pay-per-view was stacked as well. All 3 of the major titles were on the card. The tag team championship (Edge/Christian vs. the Dudley Boyz), the intercontinental championship (Benoit vs. Jericho - Ladder Match), and the world championship (Angle vs. HHH). Oh, I totally forgot; the show stopper itself..the women's championship match between Ivory and Chyna..sense the sarcasm. I highly recommend this DVD/Video. If you're a fan of the Rattlesnake, as am I, this is a must have for you.
