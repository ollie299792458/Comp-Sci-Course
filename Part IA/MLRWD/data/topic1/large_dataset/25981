A tour de force performance by the underrated JOHN CUSACK fuels this creepy adaptation of Stephen King's short story.
CUSACK plays Michael Enslin, a cynical author of those coffee table pictorials on supposedly haunted mansions/hotels.  Enslin, embittered by the death of his little girl, boasts that in none of his investigations did he have any ghostly encounters...until he decides to stay overnight in Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel where over 50 people met mysterious deaths.  Creepy hotel manager Samuel L Jackson warns Enslin that no one lasts more than an hour in the room and he almost refuses to let him stay, but Enslin persists and his night of terror begins.  The movie has some good jolts, and although it's script is sometimes muddled and the ending a little anticlimactic, 1408 is a good ghost story and Cusack dominates it with his performance.  In a non-horror genre, this performance would be generating Oscar buzz, but it's rare that the academy honors this type of film, although Cusack is that good!!
