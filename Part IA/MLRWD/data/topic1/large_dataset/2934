After seeing this movie when I was little, I instantaly loved it! A 23 year old in college who now officially owns the movie on DVD still brings me tears of joy by watching a film by Jeannot Szwarc. This movie is divided into two parts, the origins about a carpenter of toys became the worlds greatest joy to children and the counterfit who wants to take over Santa's job the ruthless B.Z..but eventually deafeated by two wonderful children (Joe and Corniella) with a little help with good ole Claus and Patch...don't forget the reindeer...Director Szwarc, really brought the film alive by using simple methods on making a film..I know he cares for his crew and cast members by not sending out into harsh working conditions and not spending a great deal of money by going to NYC or other places around the world. Even though NYC looks very real in movie. In the movie we see people who really cares for each other and remain loyal to their friends even in the time of trouble. Every one in the film did an excellent job...5 stars+...MAD PROPS!!!
