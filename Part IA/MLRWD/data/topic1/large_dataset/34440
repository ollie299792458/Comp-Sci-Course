It takes a specific type of thriller for me to really get above 3 stars, as many do, a lot of times many thrillers are pretty average and essentially different renditions of other thrillers.  It's not to say I don't at all like a lot of thrillers I see, but many of them are just rehashed ideas.  This particular action thriller was unique and had a fresh new idea behind it.  This movie does contain elements seen in past thriller movies and what have you, but the fact that the main character risks his life to go out onto a ledge in order to draw attention away from the heist taking place and risk his life in order to prove his innocence is something different than what I have seen in most thriller movies.  Is it the most amazing thriller I have ever seen?  No, not quite...but it was still in my opinion a very good one, and the actors all did an excellent job in this.  If you're into action thrillers, I do highly recommend checking this one out.  I will likely actually buy this one down the road sometime probably.
