Okay, kids.  First, PLEASE stop calling this an '80s movie.  It's not - it may have been released in 1989, but it's a prototypical '90s movie.  In fact, it may arguably be the first of the pack of young-disenfranchised-Gen X-teens-looking-for-love movies that typified the early '90s (see also: "Singles," "Reality Bites," etc. ).

For those of you who are too young to have seen this movie when it first came out, you can't begin to understand the effect it had on its target audience.  It's about as seminal as the John Hughes/Molly Ringwald movies were to the '80s (THOSE are typical '80s movies).  It's a brilliant treatise on teen angst in the early '90s, when people spent a lot of time weighing socially-conscious, indie "slackerdom" against more conventional (and lucrative) "sell-out" paths.

This is also the first teen movie I can remember seeing where the leads behaved like actual people - nothing contrived or jokey.  The romance seemed normal (or, okay, maybe a little bit better than normal - that scene where Lloyd holds up a boombox outside Diane's window is iconic for a reason) and believable.

I guess some aspects of this movie probably seem a little dated or difficult to understand for people who didn't grow up then. However, for my money, this is one of the most honest, thoughtful, and enjoyable contemplations of love and angst in the Grunge Era.
