This is a movie that will make you weep. Reviewers who scorned it obviously have no soul, especially the puerile person who said the highlight was the sex scene. There are a couple sex scenes, but no nudity. The purpose of the movie wasn't to titillate, it was to tell a romantic tragedy of people falling in the love at the wrong time in the wrong place.
Christina Ricci, a truly gifted young actress, plays the daughter of Russian Jews, separated from her only surviving relative, her father, by continents and years. We see him at the start of the film in 1927. Beset by the reality of persecution and economic woes in Russia, he decides to make a new life for his family in America. After he leaves, devastation is visited upon his small hometown. The grandmother sends the little girl off with other children to seek refuge in the west. She wants to go to America but is instead adopted by an English couple and raised in England. Stripped of family ties, she is gradually stripped of her language and culture by her adoptive parents and the harsh English school system.
We later see her as a young woman. Still remembering her father, she goes to Paris to earn money as a dancer and singer and so be able to afford the boat trip to America. In Paris she meets up with fellow Russian ex-pat Cate Blanchett, the star dancer in the Moulin Rouge type setting. They get the opportunity to be singers in the chorus of an opera. John Turturro is brilliant as the egotistical Italian tenor and Harry Dean Stanton is also welcome as the humble opera director.
Johnny Depp plays one of the gypsies hired as bit players. It takes a while, but eventually Ricci and Depp meet and share their lives. It's an unfortunate time because the Nazi war machine is steamrolling across Europe and jackboots come marching into Paris. It's not a safe time for any Jew. Ricci's dilemma is whether to stay with her new love and risk their lives, or pursue her dream of finding her father.
