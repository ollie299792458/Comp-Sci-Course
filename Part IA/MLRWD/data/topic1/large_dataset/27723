I'm a big fan of horror films, and, with the current lack of anything good, I was excited to see this when it first came out.  I left the film feeling completely suckered - and I also kind of wanted to punch Rob Zombie in the gut and kick his teeth out.

The film has a lot of cool visuals, and in that sense, it's more like a music video than a movie.  You don't really get a plot - you get to watch four victims being brutalized for an hour and a half.  This isn't horror, it's not fun to watch, it's just annoying...

and, as an aside:  inter-splicing scenes of someone getting slashed up with scenes of topless strippers is, in my opinion, a gross sexualization of violence - not a brilliant artistic statement.  I know that this happens in almost every 'slasher' film (think big-breasted girl getting chased down by crazed lunatic) - but the nature of it in this film makes me think that rob zombie more interested in his own self indulgence than he is in making a film.

it's true, I was disturbed by the film - but more in a 'carsick' sort of way than a 'wow! that film really made me think!' sort of way.  Some might say  "causing disturbance was Zombies original intent, and you were disturbed.  Therefore, the movie did what it was meant to do! you should give it five stars!"

I'd say that that reaction is a cop out - poeple shell out money to be entertained, not to be an unwilling victim to the directors whim and intent.
