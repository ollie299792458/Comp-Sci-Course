This may well be the most compelling of the films made about nuclear war (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001WTVUW">The Day After</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00062IDJW">Testament</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00021R7CG">By Dawn's Early Light</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008R9KL">Miracle Mile</a>, etc.).  It's certainly the most graphic.  Indeed, the film pulls no punches in its depiction of events following an all-out nuclear war that is sparked by a coup in Iran.  The focus is on the residents of Sheffield, England as they watch world events quickly spiral out of control.  The performances are good across the board, adding credibility to the proceedings.  You actually feel for these people and, as such, its all the more difficult to watch them perish (both quickly and slowly).  The film is full of unforgettable moments: residents watching as fire trucks leave for safety before the bombing commences, artwork being taken down from a museum wall and carted away, Ruth's journey from her parent's home amid rubble strewn with charred bodies frozen in a rictus of agony, a bloodied mother clutching her dead baby, and many more.  Threads is not for the squeamish.  It's also a very depressing film.  However, a film about the horrors of nuclear war should not be fun.  Softening the material would do a disservice to the film's anti-war message.  Yes, it's shocking and very, very brutal.  But, it has to be.  Maybe one day mankind will wake up and realize that the concept of waging and winning a nuclear war is madness of the highest order.
