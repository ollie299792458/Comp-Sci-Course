With Ozu we enter a whole new landscape that contains subtlties upon subtlties. Wind upon the ocean. The embarrasment of older parents shuffled off to jazzy seaside. An unknown but somehow recognizable temple on a hill-top.An ungrateful and grating daughter.People loping along on a tour bus. A vivacious continuously grateful daughter- in law. well-- This is Ozu and as people onthis review-page have summed up the story line I won't go into that. But look to Ozu for what you won't find elsewhere: the world in semi-tones. The world in little moments that we so busy  spending that their resonance eludes us.
This is a great film. But a very quiet one. It unravels before you like your own family might: parents come to visit. are going to spend time with them. Don't spend time with them. Shuffle them off to seaside. Dissapointment. Shuffle them off to Daughter in law. Some success there though some guilt. Father gets Drunk. Things just keep going on.
I've watched this film at least 3 or 4 times and never tire of it.
Don't look for action or even monumental drama and enjoy.
