No, Kenneth Branagh was not arguing his British heritage, he's trying to convince amnesia victim Emma Thompson that he is not the reincarnation of her former life husband who is trying to kill her.  The supernatural meets Hitchcock meets American classic film noir, and Kenneth Branagh managed to complete this gear shifting, classy film for it's day.  It got great reviews in 1991, it's still considered to be top notch 15 years later (judging by all these reviews.)  With a super cast: Andy Garcia, Thompson and Branagh, Wayne Knight, Campbell Scott, Robin Williams (in a scene stealing performance) and veteran foreign actress, Hanna Schygulla, who plays a small but key role.  Branagh, actually doesn't play a Brit either, he plays two roles: the quirky American private eye, Mike Church, and the overbearing, German composer/conductor husband, Roman Strauss.

It was a real change of pace from the Die Hard type thrillers that were being hammered out at that time, but it was a welcome change.  When I originally saw it back then, I could tell that although different, I was definitely watching something special.

Branagh, hot off the success of his first film, Henry V, where he was director and star, he managed to pull off this gem of a thriller, again taking both director and lead actor roles.  It proves that he is one talented fellow, and his former wife does an even better job perfecting her American accent.  Emma Thompson is radiant in both roles, one set in the past and her supposedly reincarnated self in the future.

Not a fast paced thriller, but it has it's moments, and the twist ending is really juicy.  I also liked the visuals and cinematography, especially in the black and white sequences.  It had a simple, but stylish look, which I think makes it hold up very well today.  One of the best films of the early 90's.
