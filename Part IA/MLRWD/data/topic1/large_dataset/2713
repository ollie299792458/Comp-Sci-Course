WHERE EAGLES DARE has been number 1 on my DVD wishlist since DVD was invented! And that is a very long time to finally view this Great Comic-Book style WWII adventure in all it's Widescreen Glory! Conceived by Richard Burton himself, who commisioned his friend Alistair Maclean to write an action/adventure screenplay which might revive his lagging screen career after one too many Taylor/Burton pairings, this is the ultimate macho/buddy/nazi bashing/over the top action extravaganza. GUNS OF NAVARONE looks like a picnic in the park compared to the non-stop action in this wonderful. wonderful film. The dialogue sparkles. The Heros (and Heroines!) are smart and funny and ruthlessly daring! The villians (and Villianess's!) are so stereotypically Evil they could be at home in any HAMMER HORROR FILM (as many of the actors playing them were!). Many people don't realize that this is the first film in which Clint Eastwood actually has real lines to speak. Burton chose him personally as his fame from the Spagetti Westerns was at it's peak that year. I like this film because it surprises the viewer...just when you think it can't get any more over the top, it DOES! Highly entertaining ad worthy of many, many reviewings especially with friends! If you've seen it before on video, you haven't seen it yet!
