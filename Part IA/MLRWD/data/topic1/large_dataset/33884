Brendan Fraser has been put on this Earth to make movies that are only supposed to entertain. This is one of them. The movie does not try to go any further than it should, it only tries to get laughs. And at most points, it succeeds. 
Elliot is a loser who has little to no social skills at all. He is heavily attracted to a coworker, but does not offer her anything that she is looking for. In comes the Devil, played by the worst of the worst, Elizabeth Hurley. She offers Elliot 7 wishes. He only has to say what he wants, and it comes true, if it were not for that terrible actress that plays the Devil. The Devil ruins every one of his wishes, and this is where the film gets way to predictable. At the end of all his fantasies, you can pretty much predict that things will not work, but they attempt to get laughs along the way.
 Overall the film is watchable, but it does not take advantage of all of its opportunities. This film could have done much more, and offered us bigger laughs, but it went for the easy out and did not get too ambitious.
