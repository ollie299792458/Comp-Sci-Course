Ever since I was a teen this has always been my favourite movie. I can quote from the entire film as I've seen it about (no joke) 500 times. All I can say is to watch the movie. Everything that makes a movie brilliant is here: Actors, script, cinematography, music... To see Joseph Cotten standing alone at the end while the woman walks on by is so bleak. Orson Welles evidently felt that Holly Martin's betrayal of his character was bad, which I always thought was strange because the character of Lime was presented as all show: his was a fake exterior; when you thought about him and his actions he WAS a bad person. He was one of those people who are always the center of attention and have everyone wanting to be around them because of the fun. The more one thinks about him, minus his glamorous and romantic exterior, the more one realizes that there is a rotten core to the man. This movie presents  questions about good and evil... About murky thoughts and actions and what people are willing to do about them. Holly Martin will not be the romantic interest because he  just isn't the romantic interest; not compared to Lime, anyway. Brilliant film!
