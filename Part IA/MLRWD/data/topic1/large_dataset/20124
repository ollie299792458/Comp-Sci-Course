It's kind of a paradox: the biggest Verdi work staged in a mini opera house. As all reviewers do mention, the result is surprisingly good, and heavy cutting in second act is not a big drawback to this 2001 performance. By then, the main singers were very young (and also unknown), which is a major merit, rarely seen in opera: you see the plot characters played by people of the right age.

The two ladies are indeed excellent. Beautiful Kate Aldrich wins first place for her total command of voice emission, acting and Italian phrasing. She delivers a fierce, passionate Amneris. Soprano Adina Aaron IS Aida: she looks like an Ethiopian princess, and she has everything else the role requires, though her Italian diction here is not quite perfect. The gents squad is also good, and my vote here goes to Enrico Iori, who plays a powerful Ramfis, sometimes a little too haste, but solid and promising overall. Scott Piper, a tender voiced Radames, has the right look and a beautiful instrument, but here and there he loses focus (and pitch) in this difficult role. He goes to falsetto in some high notes (Bergonzi's hand?), which may annoy some purists, yet he sounds fine and adequate to the small theater. In my opinion, his voice is better suited to Alfredo in Traviata, another Zeffirelli-Busseto production worth having.

Maestro Stefanelli forces make the very small orchestra sound like a big one. There's Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS sound, picture format 4:3, subtitles in Spanish are so-so. As a bonus, "The making of Aida" is quite interesting: you can see Mr. Zeffirelli instructing the young artists about the different roles acting demands.  It's nearly 10 years now this DVD was recorded, and still is one the best Aidas around, though its small scale sets it in its own league.
