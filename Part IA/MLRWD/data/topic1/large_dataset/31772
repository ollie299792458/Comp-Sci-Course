This review isn't knocking any of the titles, all of these are definitely Bogie's signature roles and all of them should be in your collection, as some of the greatest films ever made.  But why only 3 stars, you ask?  This set has an unusual history.  It actually was only announced after Warner Home Video had already announced the Humphrey Bogart Signature Collection Vol. 2 and suddenly realized they had never made a volume 1 (somebody probably thought the old Humphrey Bogart Collection with the single discs was the first volume).  This was easy to fix, as WHV had these already-released films readily available to combine into what could have been an essential box set.  Unfortunately, this release came out at a transitional period for them.  Warner's new trend for box sets were slim cases (normally, a welcome solution to conserving shelf space), however the 2-disc version of Casablanca and Treasure of the Sierra Madre were already packaged in ways that normally wouldn't be accommodated in a box set.  Instead of putting these into slim cases as well, they were boxed as is, and as a result the box is a little warped (a similar problem that occurred with the John Wayne-John Ford Collection).

My advice:  You must own these movies and watch them repeatedly, but you may be better off buying them all individually if you're obsessive like I am about your product arriving and staying in good condition.
