The film is absolutely beautiful.  It is one of the Criterion Collection by The Archers, who were Powell and Pressburger.  Another, perhaps better known, example of their word is "The Red Shoes."  This film is equally lovely.

With the breathtaking backdrop of the Himalayas, a group of nuns journeys to open a new mission in the back of the beyond.  The Sister Superior is played by Deborah Kerr, one of my alltime favorite actresses of the 20th century.  There are about four other nuns in the party.  Their destination is Mopu, built hanging off a spectacular cliff and owned by a local dignitary.

The "General" who is the dignitary who owns Mopu, deputizes Mr. Dean, his English agent, to give the nuns all assistance.  Dean is opposed to the idea of their being at Mopu and from the first, clashes with the Sister Superior.  There is also an undercurrent of sexual chemistry flowing between them, which makes their exchanges all the more interesting.

Other engaging characters are Sister Ruth, a young nun with some serious psychological problems, Angu Ayah, the old caretaker of the place, the Little General (played by Sabu), and Kanchi, played by Jean Simmons, who, without saying a word, nevertheless communicates very well.

The film's ending is strong and a delightful surprise which I will leave you to discover for yourself.  The film's only fault is its relative shortness.  Alas, would that they were able to make films like this in the modern era.  Just enjoy this one!
