Kurosawa fans need not be deterred by the negative reviews here - they are over-wrought for the most part and evidence of extreme loyalty to the Criterion Collection.  No doubt Criterion has done much to earn the respect and loyalty of cinema fans, but let's not be silly here.  For whatever reasons, Criterion lost the rights to this film and the blu-ray is done by Studio Canal.  The questions one should ask are: 1. is it the best available? and 2. is there likely to be an improved release in the future.  The answers are, yes it is the best available presentation of Ran and no, an improved release is unlikely.  Most of the so-called defects appear to be characteristic of the elements used - and may even represent the original look of the film.  I saw Ran in the theater, but it was years ago and I could not claim to be able to remember enough to compare the look then to this BD.  But others who have seen recent presentations seem to agree that the image on the Studio Canal release more closely approximates the original than that of any previous version.  And the most egregious defects are virtually undetectable in a normal viewing situation.  So the discussion is academic for the most part - this is the version to get if you want to won this film.  Once you get past the chatter, you will find that it is a beautiful transfer of a great and beautiful film.  It is not perfect - but it is the best you can get.  Enjoy -  and after watching for yourself, you will likely  wonder how anyone could give this less than a 4 star rating overall.
