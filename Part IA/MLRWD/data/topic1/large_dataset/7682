On 7 December, 1941 my grandfather was caught in the middle of the Japanese airraid on Wheeler Army Airfield on the Island of Oahu, a few miles from Pearl Harbor.  His war stories included many harrowing  expirences but that day was never discussed.  Now that he is gone and his  memories with him I gave little thought to the attack except as a  historical family footnote.  Then I saw this movie.  Whether it was dull or  facinating is irrelevant to me as it provided a window into the past and I  saw, for the first time, that day much as my grandfather saw it. It gave to  me an understanding not just of what he went through but what American  soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines suffered through for four years.  This movie is not only a masterpiece of historical film but a link to our  nation's past that can never be broken for the sake of those who gave their  lives for our freedom and those who lived the rest of their lives wearing  the scars of that war - both physically and emotionally.
