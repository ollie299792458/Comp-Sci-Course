"Interiors" (1978) is Woody Allen's most serious film. His equally intelligent "September" (1987) runs a close second. If you've enjoyed either one make sure you see the other. To fully appreciate  "Interiors", it is good to note the context in which it was made.  After Allen made the smash-hit "Annie Hall" (to this day  hilarious and heartwarming) he wanted to prove the breadth of his talent  with a film of a totally different tone. Hence "Interiors" was  born and there is certainly nothing much to laugh about here. The colours  are cold and the characters are caustic and critical. That being said, the  film is superbly done. The mother of the household is in internal chaos and  to compensate she makes the interior of her home too perfect for human  touch. We delve deeply into the spiritual interiors of her daughters and  live through their frustrations, resentments and aspirations. Sometimes  it's hard to see them in so much torment. This is a melancholy film where  no-one has little reason to smile and rarely does. But it is a brave,  honest and perceptive work which Allen and his actresses should all be  proud of. An interesting aside is the names Allen has given his characters.  The only character who realy loves life is called "Pearl". Maybe  the other characters in the film need to find this essence in themselves.  The cool mother is named "Eve". - ironic as Eve means  "life" and "lively" and the mother is anything but  lively. She is however, like the biblical Eve in that she aspires to make  her home like Eden. The Renata (Keaton) character means "reborn"  which she is through her poetry and detachment from her mother.  "Joey" jumps around from job to job trying to find herself. The  acting, writing and photography are exceptional. This is "Hannah and  Her Sisters" without the laughs but with much more depth. If you are  prepared to accept the total solemnity of it all watch this fascinating  insight into the human condition.
