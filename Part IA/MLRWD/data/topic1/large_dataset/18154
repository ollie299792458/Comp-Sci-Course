Very slow moving film. To say it is boring, is kind. Great premise, but horrible execution. It's almost like they took useless scenes that any other director would cut out and discard, but this film is as if most of it is composed of scenes that should have been tossed out. They add very little to the story.  Many of the potential plot points are barely developed. If this was a Film School assignment, I would give it just a C for at least keeping the camera in focus; the rest would get a D.

I would avoid this one unless you have nothing better to do than waste the time.

I know there are those who will be all angsty about negative reviews like this. That's OK. Not everyone agrees with Ebert all the time either. Let's keep this in perspective: I think most will agree the film is not of the caliber of Dracula, Halloween, Carry, Elm Street, The Shining, or similar 'films'.  It's a B movie at best - something worth a watch on a Saturday afternoon TV movie. Most video games are more entertaining. Do yourself a favor - watch a good horror movie. It could also tell you something when they have this DVD marked down to $10 at some retail outlets. Even Amazon has it half price.
