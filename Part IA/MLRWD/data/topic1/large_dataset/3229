This movie may have easily been in my top 5 of the year. Like most other audiences, when this movie came out, I expected a kids movie that could entertain kids and no more. 
SURPRISE! I didn't see this movie in theaters, but many newspapers and magazines gave it great reviews, which caught me off guard. I waited until the DVD came out, then I rented it. Ultimately, this led to buying the movie!
This movie entertains all, at least for those who like rock. There isn't the usual Jack Black humor; it's a new kind of humor. One that entertains. And the music in this movie was picked well. The songs sang in the movie by the band are great and catchy. 
Entertaining : 5/5 This movie keeps you in your seat and moves very quickly, yet it isn't too short. You leave wanting to see more band performances.
Acting : 5/5 I'm giving a 5 because these kids basically do not have any acting experience, yet they carry on nicely with Jack Black and the other cast members.
One interesting thing was that the kids in the movie actually play their instruments. Also, the behind the scenes on the DVD were cool. 
I recommend this movie to all audiences, especially to those who like rock!
