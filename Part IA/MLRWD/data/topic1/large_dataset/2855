The movie is adapted from a book titled, 'What Was She Thinking?' and subtitled, 'Notes from a Scandal.'  Well, what WAS she thinking, an attractive art teacher in a safe marriage, having an affair with a 15 year old student at her school?  The movie revolves around this affair, so that for the narrative to make some sense, we need to get some clues as to what she is thinking, perhaps some faint crack in her marriage, a memory of an adolescent romance, a last adventure before middle age, a powerful connection to the boy.  There has to be something to make the risk that she takes worthwhile.  Whatever it could be I didn't see it. So that after watching the movie, I'm still in the same place that I was before I watched the movie.  I still don't have a clue what she was thinking.
Instead I saw sordid lovemaking in the dirty grass by the railroad tracks. What was she thinking?  Maybe that's the point; nobody, including the art teacher herself, knows.  But if that's the point, what is the movie about?
To say the least, the structure of the movie is a bit creaky, but if you enjoy Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett then you should watch the movie; they're great.
