This is as close to a perfect science fiction film as anything that Hollywood is capable of: there is no gratuitous violence or promiscuous sex, no swearing and no blood and no death, no explosions or natural disasters or gunplay or swordfights or monsters or aliens or robots or mutants or cyborgs or comic-book-type-superheroes or mad scientists bent on world domination,  none of the things Hollywood likes to ruin science fiction with.  Instead good acting and flawless direction, coupled with special effects that don't overpower and dominate everything else in the film and a great--not good, but GREAT IN CAPITALS--story and a wonderful little moral message about not losing our fellow feeling for other people, the sort of social consciousness that no one could possibly object to.  If you have kids, buy this thing for your kids, then buy another one for yourself.  If you don't have kids, buy one anyways.  The film is adapted from a 1943 short story written by Henry Kuttner (one of the leading science fiction writers of the day) with his wife, Catherine (C. L. Moore the original Goddess of Dark Fantasy greatest unmitigated literary genius of the early twentieth century) who were then quite popular and influential but have in the decades since fallen into almost complete obscurity.  There is a book called "The Last Mimzy" which should be considered the essential companion to the film.  The story in the book is similar to, but not identical with, the story of the movie; and there are sixteen other stories in the book, all of them every bit as good (with most of their collaborative work, Ms. Kuttner declined a byline).  They wrote hundreds of stories, novels, and film, radio, and TV scripts under dozens of pen names.  Perhaps the best is "Fury", from 1947.
