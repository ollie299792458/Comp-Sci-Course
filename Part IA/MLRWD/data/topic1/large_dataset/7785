January 22-23 1879 will go down as one of the greatest and bravest days in British military history.
The battle at Rorke's Drift, or as the Zulus  called it "Jim's Place" is magnificently portrayed in this 1964  epic filmed on location in Natal.
Michael Caine perfectly plays the part  of Lieutenent Gonville Bromhead, a gentleman and professional soldier who  along with Lieutenent John Chard of the Royal Engineers (played by Stanley  Baker) masterminded the defence of the small missionary station at Rorke's  Drift.
80 men of the South Wales Borderers 24th Regiment Of Foot defended  the missionary station and it's 36 wounded men in the hospital against  4,000 zulu warriors.
The Natal scenery and costumes of both the British  soldiers and Zulu warriors are a highlight.
The battle scenes were  graphically ahead of it's time and the narration by Richard Burton (himself  a welshman)certainly adds to the drama that would unfold.
One criticism  is levelled at the characterization of Private Alfred Henry Hook, who in  the movie is portrayed as a drunken malingerer. He was in fact a gentleman  and small landowner who was a well regarded soldier. He was awarded the  Victoria Cross for his bravery in evacuating the sick and wounded from the  burning hospital.
Overall, as an avid historian on the Zulu War of 1879,  I found this a compelling movie classic which has been watched over and  over again by me and my 3 brothers( Tom, Chris and Sam)
