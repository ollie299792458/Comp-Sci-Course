It's rare when one finds a movie that's enjoyable even when the main characters are boring and the plot entirely mediocre.  Sally Bowles, an Oscar-winning Liza Minelli, is a good singer, but not an interesting or endearing character.  Brian Roberts, a thoroughly boring Michael York, never succeeds in being anything but bland.  The two love stories aren't particularly engaging...so why did I enjoy this movie so much?

For one, Joel Gray is incredible as the Master of Ceremonies.  His character is never seen as doing anything except performing (he never has is even named) and what a performance it is.  The movie kicked into a higher level when he was on screen, though part of that credit should probably go to Bob Fosse for choreographing the Cabaret sequences.  I particularly enjoyed how the song and dance numbers paralleled (or perhaps mirrored) the action in the movie.  Think of "Two Ladies" while Brian and Max compete for Sally's attention, or perhaps "If You Could See Her" while Fritz and Natalia are courting.  Furthermore, it was refreshing to see a musical in which all the music didn't strain the credibility of the viewer.  Watching West Side Story, it's hard to imagine that these tough-as-nails Jets would really be throwing each other up in the air or snapping their fingers while singing.  Most musicals require suspending disbelief, but in this one all the music came at the Cabaret (except for "Tomorrow Belongs to Me," which was also entirely believable)

Lastly, it would be impossible to omit how subtly and wonderfully the rise of Nazism is portrayed.  While Brian gets beaten up by the SA, most of the Nazi rise to power is depicted slowly and steadily.  The last shot of the film perfectly finished the trajectory, and if you're thinking of Sally and Brian as the credits roll then you viewed the film differently than I did.
