Yes the ones that started the series off are the best ones but, this one is not too far behind.  This takes off right where the first one left off.  Laurie being takin to the hospital with Michael right on her trail. Michael will stop at nothing and will kill everyone that gets in his way.  He is EVIL on two legs.  This movie, like the first one, still produces good scares without much gore at all.  His emotionless mask still scares the hell outta me and the score still makes the hair on the back of my neck raise.  The great thing about the Halloween movies are they aren't as far fetched as the FT13 series or NOES series.  Michael slowly follows his prey where Jason or Freddy will be chasing someone one sec and then they will be right there the next sec.  IMO Jason and Freddy are inferior to the superior Michael Myers.  Michael just has more of a scary aspect to him.  Anyways this movie is great and one that needs to be in your collection right next to the first one.  Me on the otherhand have 3 different versions of the first one and all the rest of them (excluding part 3, which had no business even being in the series) in my collection.  These are movies I grew up with and still watch when I want a good scare from time to time.  PICK UP and ENJOY!!!!!!
