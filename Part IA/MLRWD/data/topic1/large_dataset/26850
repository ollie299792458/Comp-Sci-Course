Alan Cumming is the Most wonderful and versatile Actor I have seen to date, and this movie proves to be no exception. His 80's Sandy Frink Is an extremely accurate portrayal Of The Typical highschool Nerd, and He manages to be Funny without berating the character. His 90's, Bill Gates-esque character is also brilliantly portrayed, persuing his beloved while silently rubbing his success in the faces of everyone at the reunion. he Manages to turn up at Every corner, making a Hillarious scene more funny, And His sensitive lusting after Michelle is enough to make any girl's Heart melt. What I really want to know was if It was really Alan Under all that make-up in the dream sequence. 
As for the Movie as a whole, It was wonderfully  funny, albeit a little dragged out with the dream sequences, And the finishing Dance scene to "time after time" caused me to wet myself. All of the actors were great, Especially Jenine Garfalo, But Cumming's Performance blew me away. 
See it. It'll make you all the better for it.
