If I had known there was such a problem with this transfer, I would've waited until Universal got their sh*t together and fixed the problem.  But I was so eager to buy the "Special Edition" that I didn't even think to check the reviews.  After all, when's the last time you bought a "Special Edition" DVD that was virtually unwatchable?!
I loved this movie when it came out in theaters in 1983 (my first Python movie), but I've never seen a transfer this bad.  Obviously no one at Universal reviewed the movie on DVD before the disks were unleashed on an unsuspecting public.  I can't believe Python fans haven't stormed Universal Studios and demanded action! 
Just read the other reviews -- I have nothing more to add really.  Jagged horizontal lines afflict any horizontal motion on the screen.  I wanted my girlfriend to see it for the first time, and it pretty much ruined her experience.  We managed to watch through to the end, but it's like seeing your favorite band in concert with constant feedback from the speakers -- a mixture of pleasure and pain. 
I think a class-action lawsuit against Universal for selling a seriously inferior product with glaring technical flaws is in order.
