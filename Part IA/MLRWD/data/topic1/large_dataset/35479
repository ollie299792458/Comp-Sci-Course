Ferris Bueller's Day Off is without question one of my favorite movies.  I've seen it many times and when it was first released I was going into the seventh grade.  It's one of the many movies I grew up on so it obviously has a special place in my heart.  Having said that I was disappointed with the Bueller....Bueller...Bueller.  The extras are okay but unspectacular.  The mini documentary containing interviews with cast members then and now doesn't offer any insights of great depth and magnitude, just the usual, it was a wonderful experience tripe, though you do learn that Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck, who plays Ferris's best friend Cameron, became buddies while performing on Broadway in Neil Simon's Biloxi Blues.  There's a making of doc that was made back when the movie was released in 1986.  Writer-director John Hughes can be seen in interviews from that year but he's conspicuously absent from the interviews taped for this DVD. It would have been nice to hear what he has to say now. A good DVD that is worth having, especially if you're a fan of the movie but it could have been better.
