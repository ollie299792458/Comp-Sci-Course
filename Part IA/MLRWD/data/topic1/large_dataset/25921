This movie has some excellent gore shots in it and clearly time and money were devoted to create the effects you see in the film. Hats off to the director and his crew for pulling this movie off.

The movie does not, as others have noted, have a good balance between the comedy and the horror. I think in most any horror movie you need a little comic relief to break the tension so you can take a breath. This flick attempts too much comedy interspersed with the horror. 5 minutes of scrapped humor in the script would have made a world of difference.

Overall though it was a fairly tolerable movie and I would have gladly pulled cables on the set for free just to watch the process unfold.The ripped head shot was excellent and my definite favorite of the kills.

It definitely delivers on the gore and the sudden scares. It delivers a little bit of sleaze with all the boob shots in New Orleans and also between our two naive female characters shooting for Hollywood.

If you are looking for a marvelous revamping of the genre then this might disappoint you. If you are in the 35 and over crowd looking for the type of movie that you grew up with,lots of physical horror effects and no CGI, with then this is a excellent revisit of the era albeit a little cheesey.

Either way, I think most any fan will find something they like in the film.
