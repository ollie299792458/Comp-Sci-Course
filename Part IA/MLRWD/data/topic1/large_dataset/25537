Why, you ask?

1. This is the film which most closely followed Fleming's original novel. Even "Goldfinger" took more liberties. This is an almost page for page rendition of one of the best books.

2. Lazenby > Bored Connery. Though he didn't have the pedigree of Connery (or any of the others, right through Brosnan), Lazenby not only held his own in the part, but after seeing Connery sleep through the later films (and do it again in the retched "Diamonds Are Forever"), he was a breath of fresh air.

3. Low budget, by Bondian standards. No big volcanos filled with henchmen. No ninjas. No Outer Space. No big set pieces at all.

4. Gorgeous cinematography. You really feel like you're in the mountains.

5. "Kojak" strikes just the right cord as Blofeld - somewhere between the earlier "sitting around stroking an evil cat" version and the cross-dressing, fancy lad Charles Gray edition (BTW, can you tell I HATED Diamonds Are Forever?).

6. Diana Rigg is to this day the most beautiful Bond Girl, and the romance is believable and sweet.

7. The Best Bond Theme. The only close second is McCartney's "Live And Let Die." And the best credit sequence - the montage of earlier films is brilliant.

8. The wonderful Louis Armstrong melody, last heard in "The Jacket."

9. Most of all, the downbeat ending. Gut-renching and out of character for the series.

This is the Bond film to end all Bond films.
