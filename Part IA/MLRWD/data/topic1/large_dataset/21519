I have wanted to see this film since I stumbled upon a picture and brief  review in some magazine before its release.  What took me so long I'll  never know but, I'm glad I finally did.  After viewing, I now own  (ironically enough, I have had &amp; loved the soundtrack for over a year  now).
As a film, the technical aspects are undeniable. Visually and  aurally, this is a true treat for the senses.  There is not a bad  performance to be found.
As a story, it helps if you are privy to some of  the inside references that permeate this film.  Where they do not make the  film impossible to follow, certain knowledge of the era and the whole Bowie  phenomenon do help to make a little more sense.  The correlation to Oscar  Wilde and Bowie's media manipulation via memorable quotes.  The space jewel  as perhaps a vague reference to the Five-Year theory that Bowie attributed  Marc Bolan's untimely death to.  The subtle beauty of Lindsey Kemp as a  pantomiming drag-queen performer.  Where no character or event is a direct  representation but, simply an allusion to various people and happenings, it  does help if you know of these people and/or happenings. The only real flaw  is the failure to explain the importance of Jack Fairy.  My theories on  this are too numerous.
If you were formed and molded by the glitter era  as I was, see this film and remember!  If you were not, see this film and  learn!
P.S.:  The filmmakers had the last laugh on Mr. Bowie after all.  He refused to be associated with the production but, aside from the title  (which comes from an unused track for Ziggy Stardust), listen to the  backing vocals at the end of the Bowie Produced, Lou Reed song Satellite of  Love.  That's Ziggy himself!
