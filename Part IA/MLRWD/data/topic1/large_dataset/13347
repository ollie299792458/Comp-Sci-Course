In many ways this is a perfect film. It was obviously a labor of love with most of the famous cast probably working for union scale with some points if the movie was successful. The story is simple. It's about an old hermit, played by Robert Duvall,  living in the backwoods of Tenn during the 1930's. He reaches an age when most of his few friends are passing away and he decides to plan and conduct his own funeral while he is still alive to enjoy it. Bill Murray plays a slightly dishonest funeral parlor owner. It's a marvelous serious role for Murray who most people only remember for his comic roles.
Sissy Spacek plays Duvall's one-time lover. Since most of the town folks either don't know the hermit or fear him, there are very few friends that the Duvall character wishes to invite, but he does want a big funeral that brings together everyone who has ever known him. He wants them to reveal his true story. He eventually comes up with a sure-fire method of attracting thousands of people to his funeral.
His plan works and along the way the hermit's mysterious and fascinating life story emerges. Lucas Black, Lori Beth Edgeman and Bill Cobbs play key supporting cast roles. Part of the joy of this film is the feeling of reality in it. The small rural town, the log cabins, the feeling of the Depression Era all come through on the screen. In addition to the famous actors, many of the crew members do double duty. This is a fascinating look at how a good story and straight-forward acting are the keys to making an enjoyable movie. This movie probably set a record for low budgets. Antique Car fans are liable to overdose on the collection of vintage autos included in this excellent film.
