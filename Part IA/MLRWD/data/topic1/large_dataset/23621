I just don't understand all of the positive reviews of this movie. Val Kilmer's performance is so over-exagerrated, and so is the rest of the cast, especially the young lady who is begging to be put on the mission.
As far as the story... who couldn't figure out that it's the presidents daughter who's been nabbed? Doesn't the secret service's involvement tip us off? I get the impression that I was supposed to "GASP" when we learned this bit of so-called suspense. I actually laughed because I told my son a half hour before that it's got to be the Prez's daughter. And the whole scene where the Prez's daughter exposes herself and is told that she can't smoke American cigarettes in the middle of the city because their enemy would smell it and know just where to find them, is a total farce and is so laughable. Talk about the bad effects of second hand smoke. I could pick a dozen more things that aggravated me about this film but they aren't worth remembering. With all of the other "twist's" that were supposed to be planted throughout, I was just busy saying, "Come on!"
My 16 year old son and I always talk about movies after we've viewed them, and I was surprised that he agreed with me on so many bad points about this film, even though we disagree about many things.
I am always leary about any action film from Warner Brothers, and even though they do release an occasional good one, this is just another contrived WB release, and one that I would never recommend to anyone who enjoys intelligent, well crafted films films. I am also really ashamed of Ebert &amp; Roeper's Two Thumbs Up on this film and I'm so glad that I didn't see this film at the theater.
