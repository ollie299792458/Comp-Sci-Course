Everything about this movie is utterly impeccable. The story (based on Richard Ellmann's biography of Wilde) is as historically accurate as it is entertaining. The acting is perfectly incredible, with wonderful performances by Stephen Fry as the tremendous but simultaneously tragic Oscar Wilde, and Jude Law as his complex young lover Lord Alfred "Boise" Douglas. This movie is an absolute must for any fan of Oscar Wilde, or anyone with an open mind who enjoys learning about extraordinary people. Please do not let some of the homosexual themes in this movie intimidate you away from watching this movie. I will admit that at first I was a little uneasy about watching a movie with homosexual love affairs in it, but when I watched this movie I felt like they were absolutely not overdone but historically correct and they fit perfectly into this exceptional movie about the wonderful Oscar Wilde. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who is mature and open-minded enough to see it. I think you will fall in love with this amazing story about the compelling wit, charm, and life of Oscar Wilde.
