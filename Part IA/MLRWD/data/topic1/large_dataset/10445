Many spoilers ahead.

No collection of 1950s science fiction B-movies is complete without "Red Planet Mars," certainly the most unusual of the genre. RPM is a "message" flick if there ever was one, but the writing comes nowhere close to the quality of that in "The Day the Earth Stood Still," or even "Rocket Ship XM."

Like most sci-fi flicks, the dialogue in RPM gets preposterous when science is actually discussed. There was no need for a mythical "hydrogen valve" even in 1952 to build a transceiver capable of communication with Mars, except as a plot device to introduce the requisite evil Nazi scientist.

Leaving aside the surprising discovery that Mars is inhabited by Christians (or anyone else, for that matter), the plot gets pretty confused towards the end about which messages were real and which were fake. I don't think I would be contemplating sacrificing my life, as the main characters did, to protect the knowledge that some or all the messages supposedly from Mars actually originated in South America. After all, the Evil Empire has already fallen, and a newly-religious Russia is now run by a priest.

RPM does not so much include a message as bludgeon the viewer with one. Still, it meets my criteria for '50s B-sci-fi: You can watch it until the end without gagging, and it's worth a tub of popcorn and a glass of screw-cap wine.
