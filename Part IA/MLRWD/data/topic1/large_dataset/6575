I have taught this play for ten years and have welcomed the modern version as a way to reach my students.  Daniel Day Lewis does a fabulous job as John Proctor.  "Because it is my name... because I lie and sign myself to lies!  Because I am not worth the dust on the boots of those that hang!"  My students are drawn to the movie b/c of the "new" hollywood actors (Ryder and Lewis).  I will say I see the lightbulbs come on for my students in the courtroom scene in Act III where the girls repeat Mary Warren.  Everyone (but the judges) seems to know that the girls are "foolin".  The added scene (ActII, scene II) is better left out, as I feel that most of us in the audience "get" John and Abigail.

I think the tone of the movie mirrors the tone in the book excellently.  The conflict between Giles Corey and Thomas Putname (AND Rev. Parris) was well represented in the movie.  And THANK YOU Arthur Miller for including Giles Corey's sentence of PRESSING - students LOVE that - and it is SO telling of Corey's character.

I recommend this movie to American Literature fans and anyone lucky enough to teach this play.  (After all this time, I'm sad my time has come to an end... I've been moved to World Literature...)
