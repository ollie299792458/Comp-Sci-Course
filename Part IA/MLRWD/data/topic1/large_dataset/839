The early 1930's of Chicago mob rule with the great "immigrant" performance of Paul Muni as the crazed smart suave mobster that overtook both North and South sides of Chicago during prohibition is a tremendous movie that was a landmark in motion picture history and should not to be missed by any fan of this genre.
The movie is non stop entertainment with great character portrayal and the great addition of showing the alternate ending scene on the DVD casts this movie in so many lights that it is little wonder it is considered the classic that it is.
The sociological importance on viewing gangsterdom sympathetically as a  way out of poverty where the individual pulls himself out of his straits by any means necessary despite murder and brutality OR the idea that principles of good and evil prevail and murder is murder and deserves to be punished is made explicitly clear by the two contrasting endings.
It may be easy to empathize with "scarface" and his distinct manipulation of the elements but his maniacal jealousy lacking loyalty, his paranoia and ultimately the distrust he shows for all even his sister is crystal clear by choosing his ultimate death as the coward deep down he is.
The psychological drama of depicting the 'immigrant" made into a larger than life persona, unstoppable, achieving the "will to power" boundlessly, the craving for American success, money, the Blond, by overcoming one's own inferiority complex by ruthless behavior and finally justice gets it's due is certainly the public service this film is about.
Not to be missed, prophetic that this film preceded Hitler and the murders of the post Holocaust world we live in.
The advent of the Tommy Gun in the flick was a precursor to the gas chambers of the concentration camps.
