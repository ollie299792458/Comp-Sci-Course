Most of us are resisting Stephen Hawking's scientific assessment that time travel to the past is impossible.  We all seem to travel to the past in our dreams and in our daydreams.  So fooey, Professor Hawking!  We are traveling to the past...in our minds.

This movie was a superb example of what a group of middle-aged men might do if they were transported to their past.  It portrays the best and the worst of man's regrets, remorse, and his striving to maintain control of his mind-boggling emotional state when faced with re-living his life and making the same choices all over again or creating change to those scenarios that might change the entire world.

I loved this movie as an escape from my mundane life.  Yes, I am like those men in many ways, perhaps a hybrid of them all.  I dream of having my own Hot Tub Time Machine and re-creating myself with the knowledge of the future.  Don't we all know that hindsight is 20/20?

So, if you had pubes in 1986 and your life did not turn out satisfactorily at this point in your time-line, Hot Tub Time Machine might be right for your entertainment needs.  Just make sure you are mentally stable enough to return to your current situation after watching this reminiscent movie without losing your marbles in the fictional past your mind will re-create and the present you know is impossible to forge...because there really are no Hot Tub Time Machines except in our minds.

Enjoy it.
