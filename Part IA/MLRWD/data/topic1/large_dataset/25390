I've seen just about every zombie movie there is and I must say THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE YET! Blood & gore action from the moment you put it on until the end. The scense are very, very graphic and if your someone who gets easily grossed out this movie is not for you! I love the zombies in this movie and how they start off dumb until one of the main zombie characters named "big Daddy" starts teaching them little things like how to use the guns & to work together. also, the zombies seem to try to make believe their still alive by "trying" to do some of the things they used to do when they were alive. As for the non zombie actors in the movie, their all great as well. John Leguizamo plays the part of a goodguy/badguy who is second in command of a whole crew of delinquents that go into theses towns full of zombies to get & bring back food & supplies for the other living people locked inside a "zombie free" area. But his reckless ways come between him & the first in command (Simon Baker) Set out to reach different goals these two bump heads threw the whole movie. Then there's the powerful, rich "big man" (Dennis Hopper) who cares only for himself and has his hands in everything from politics to drugs, to even murder. Makes you wonder whose the bad guys the zombies or the living. My favorate character is the guy who plays Simon Bakers best friend in the movie. He's mentally special (a little slow) in the movie but is completely loyal to Simon cause Simon saved his life by pulling him out of a fire(they don't show that in the movie but he talks about it) So here's this guy with his face all burnt up & a little slow who everyone makes fun of him but what makes him so awesome is his loyalty to Simon and how he always watches his back & the awesome part is that he's a perfect shot with his guns, like a proffesional gunsman. Anyway I can't tell you the movie, but deffenetly pick this up if your a zombie fan.  ICY
