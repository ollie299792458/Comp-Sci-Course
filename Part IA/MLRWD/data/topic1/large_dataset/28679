Just saw and I loved every second of it -

-it showed the human side of superman, the sacrifice and the heartbreak that comes along with it and the realization that he will never have what he truly wants in life but has to keep fighting anyway - the scene with him hovering above the earth listening to all the people was iconic

-the point of him having a son was touching and the final scene where he repeats Jor-Els words was sweet / bookmarking the beginning and the end of the movie

-the visuals were outstanding - I believed a man could fly

-the use of Marlon Brando throughout was inspired

-the acting was great by all - Brandon Routh MUST come back as Superman - he is the man of steel and Clark without a doubt
the rest of the cast was very good as well even Kate Bosworth and so was the son - nothing ever got sappy

-I loved the ending - he did not get the girl but some things are more important

Tremendous movie - on par with the first one, the first one gets the nod solely for Christopher Reeve - honestly Superman Returns had the better story

Chris Nolan needs to bring back the entire cast
