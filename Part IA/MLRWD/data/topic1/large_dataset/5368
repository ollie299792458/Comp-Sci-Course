This movie is the pinnacle of what science fiction in film should be -it's emotional, thought provoking, gut wrenching, and awe inspiring.
Jeff Goldblum is magnificent in this film. The FX are the initial draw, but the characters are so well drawn and the film so expertly acted, that you, the veiwer, almost believe that that a man could really be undergoing a transformation into a fly. Try watching the "Insect politics" scene- a truly brillant bit of film making-  and not being horrified and saddened that the characters in the film are suffering through such an ordeal.
  This film represents Cronenberg at his hieght as a director. The scripting is tight and skillful and the makeup and animatronics on display are as enthralling as any current CGI-relient blockbuster's FX. This film proves that a slavish devotion to realism is not needed in order to make veiwers emotionally connect with a film. All that is needed are a skilled set of filmmakers coming together to make a film that matters... and a bit of luck doesn't hurt either. Watch this movie. Own this movie. And love this movie as I do. You want regret it.
