Jason and the Argonauts was a favourite of mine as a child.  Back then, I didn't have the same discriminating tastes and scepticisms towards special effects.  Even today I find that special effect work of Ray Harryhausen stands up remarkably well.
  The classic story of the Golden Fleece is aided greatly by Harrynhausen's monsters, such as the Giant Talos or the horrible Harpies.  But nothing beats the final skeleton battle. This sequence remains an astonishing work.  It is a seamless battle between humans and special effects skeletons.
  The acting is the old-hollywood style, but for the subject matter it is perfect.  Heroes seem like Heroes, villains like villains, Hercules like Hercules.  The pace is quick and the locations are excellent and always very authentic.
  Jason and the Argonauts may not impress everyone.  Many of today's kids will merely exclaim "that's so fake looking!".  But those with more imagination and a greater appreciation for classic story-telling will dig Jason and the Argonauts.
  Also, anyone who is growing tired of the over-used CGI, which often looks too much like a video game, this is a refreshing change.
