I don't know when it is coming out over on Region 2 in the UK, so I am still eagerly awaiting this long awaited sequel. However, and it is a BIG however, it may absolutely suck without the aid of Daveigh Chase, UNLESS Dakota Fanning is REALLY CONVINCING! I don't know why Daveigh is not in this anyway, as she sounds perfectly fine in the series. And their voices are NOT THAT similar. I know Disney has a habit of making sequels where they replace one of the leading actors, and I just can't believe Daveigh won't be in this. She was flawless in everything else, the movies, series, even computer games! With some Disney sequels, the replacement voices are quite convincing, such as Mark Moseley replacing Eddie Murphy in Mulan 2, but in the case of Dan Castelleneta replacing Robin Williams in The Return Of Jafar, that didn't do it any favours, because it turned out to be terrible.

So therefore, Dakota will have to put in a really convincing performance as Lilo in this one, otherwise people will notice the difference too easily and there is the best chance it will suck. But as it is still a Lilo and Stitch movie which we have waited a very long time for, I still intend to check it out.
