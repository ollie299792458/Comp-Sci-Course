Only when a work of art leaves room for ambiguity enabling subjective interpretation, can it really be personalized and only if the creativity of the artist allows you to subtly imbibe his fecund thought, do you get to feel comfortable with it genuinely. If it happens to be a movie, you'd call it a memorable success if you get to identify with one aspect of it. What do you call a movie if it enables you to identify with almost every aspect of it ? let it be the pace, stylization, narration, cinematography, soundtrack, screenplay or action, I think this movie would leave an indelible mark on every open minded viewer's psyche.
What can one say specifically about this one ? having seen and imbibed almost every subtle nuance of every character of this movie and closely observed every aspect of it for countless times, wish I culd give it a 5+ rating. 
A very eerie coincidence was how accurately this movie models what I call "grungy determinism". I guess I can identify with every action of Capt. Willard, and infact behave and think like him personally (even be4 seein this movie). I found the philosophical significance of the boat rowing towards the heart of darkness way beyond the petty battles between nations/ideologies that are represented in this movie. The way Willard had given up on redemption and presented a realistic and disaffected notion toward duty, is philosophically a mile above any of the major protagonists I've ever seen in modern cinema.
The soundtrack containing Jim Morrison's "the end" is soo apt and strikes a seemingly foreboding note with the climax. 
I think life would've been absolutely barren w/out apocalypse now, pushkin's poetry and everclear jello shots ;)
