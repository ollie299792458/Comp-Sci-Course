I have been a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JVWR9U">The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First Season</a>fan from the first season... from the first episode. But I wait for each episode to start heading off into a direction that is too indepth or unrealistic for me to enjoy anymore. Instead, each season, writers Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson, never fail to keep the episodes real and in touch with - well - reality.

The actors who portray their characters - Ian Somerhalder as Damon Salvatore, Nina Dobrev as Elena Gilbert, Paul Wesley as Stefan Salvatore, and Joseph Morgan and Klaus - are absolutely great at what they do. They bring the show to life, and make you believe that this is really what's going on in Mystic Falls, Virgina. They are so indepth that you get to know, not only what is on the surface, but what is in their background, their entire past, they snap, they soften - every situation imaginable for a character's personal growth is portrayed excellently here.

This season, it picks up right where the last episode in season 1 left off, and we really learn more about all of the character's backgrounds and the motivations behind multiple characters. We see Damon's character advance and mature, as well as see his true nature (Sorry, I'm a bit biased, he's my favorite character). We learn a whole lot about this Katherine, AKA Katerina Petrova and what a doppleganger is. We learn about Stefan's not-so-innocent past. We see Caroline's character advance, mature, and grow into a stronger, self-sufficent person. And a whole lot more. Each episode is like a grand finale with little room for dull moments.

Even if you're not a fan of the vampire genre, this is a series that is very genre flexible (unless you very strictly hate fantasy, sci fi, and horror) because it is so realistic, there is something that you can relate to in every character, situation, etc.
