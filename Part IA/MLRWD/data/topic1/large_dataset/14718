Whoever said that 24-year olds and older shouldn't watch cartoons obviously hasn't seen Shrek. The comedic quad of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphey, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow gives this high-tech modern fairy tale its charm. With plenty of "in" jokes and an "alternative"-sounding soundtrack that is a welcome relief from schmaltzy Disney music, Shrek is a movie that young kids will want to watch over and over, and the parents won't mind. They'll be laughing right along with it. Not only is this a well-made, funny, and endearing movie, the surprising ending is very affirming, especially for kids who might feel "different" from other children. I especially recommend this movie for ANY parents who have children with esteem issues, or who might just need a boost of self-confidence. One warning, though: the movie DOES contain a smattering of swear words; but given the current state of television and most movies, the words are easily explained by parents who sit down and watch the movie with their children. If I could have given this movie ten stars, I would have.
