I've been a fan of Eastwood's spaghetti westerns since the original theatrical releases, having owned them in VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, and now Blu-Ray. These blu-rays have by far the best video quality I've ever seen of these films on a TV (a 52" Samsung LCD in my case). The disc box says these are restored versions of the films and they certainly appear so to me. The picture sharpness and detail are excellent and I did not notice any of the typical "old-film" artifacts such as specs or streaking; very clean pictures. The box states all three films have 2.35 aspect ratios, and while I didn't actually measure them, they appeared that way to me. Colors also looked very natural on all discs.

I listened to the DTS-HD Master Audio sound tracks bit-streamed out to my late-model Onkyo receiver. Though the original film sound tracks were recorded in mono, these surround tracks seem well done, with surround signals moderate and and not artificial sounding.

Supplementary content is minimal though interesting, a look at a collection of promotional posters and other materials used world wide in the original theatrical release promotions. I would have liked to see making-of documentaries and commentaries by Eastwood and the films' producer and director, but overall I'm not complaining. These are the finest home video versions of these films I've ever seen and I'm happy to now have them.
