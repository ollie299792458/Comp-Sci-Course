This movie is unbelievable and anyone that says otherwise is ignoring raw human instinct after all this is all that this movie is raw instinct.  This movie is filmmaking at it's most basic in every aspect.  The chorography the dialogue the soundtrack the way the actors move in the movie all just basic raw emotion the way it gets to you no thought is needed.  The lighting is so good it's bad the dialogue is so cheesy it's good.  If you get the DVD go to title 1 chapter 16 this might be the best few minutes of movie ever filmed.  The movie so plainly puts out the idea that Maverick is a wild man that doesn't do any thing by the book.  The dialogue by Kelly Mcgillis, "My review of your flight performance was right on, but I held something back I see some real genius in your flight performance Maverick, but I can't say that in that taxpayers I was afraid everyone in that taxpayers room would see right through me and I don't want them to know that I've fallen for you.  Title 1 chapter 16 has the best movement of characters in a movie I've ever seen.  How the character of Hollywood leans in to talk to Maverick in the class to say "gustiest move I've ever seen man" and how Maverick kind of shrugs his head.  How after the class Maverick is walking a few steps ahead of Kelly Mcgillis with that cool 80's walk.  How Charlie chases after Maverick in her car how those cars at the intersection perfectly stop.  The way that Charlie's car comes to a skidding stop the way Maverick walks over to her car the way he takes of his sunglasses.  The whole love scene that follows I mean this is art.  Every film student at NYU should take a whole course in these 5 minutes of Top Gun.  I mean that it so beautiful I want to shed a tear.
