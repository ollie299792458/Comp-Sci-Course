"The Terror of MechaGodzilla" is a very forgettable Godzilla movie that unfortunately marked the last appearance of Godzilla in the original series (which lasted from 1954 to 1975). Like most Godzilla movies from the 1970s, the story has something to do with an alien invasion. It also involves a prehistoric dinosaur called "Titanosaurus" rampaging around Tokyo. MechaGodzilla, Godzilla's mechanical clone, comes along for the ride, this time being controlled by the aliens.
The alien invasion story in this movie is simply not interesting, engaging, or funny. Mostly, it's just boring. The monster action is curiously kept to a minumum, and besides the opening credits (which are mostly stock footage from the previous entry, "Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla"), Godzilla himself doesn't show up until the 47 minute mark.
The DVD is unfortunately not presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It is shown in a severely cropped 1.33:1 version. The picture is quite scratchy with muted colours, although I must confess, it was a bit better than I expected it to be. The only special feature is a preview for the "Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters" video game, but that isn't particularly special if you ask me.
