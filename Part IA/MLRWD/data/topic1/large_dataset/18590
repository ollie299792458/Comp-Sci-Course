This has clearly divided people (as intended?) and while it is an absolutely fantastic movie, I wouldn't say that it is the best from the Dogme group - that particular accolade probably lies with 'Festen' (aka 'Celebration'), which is one of the best films ever made, in any genre.

 However, it is much better than Trier's later 'Dancer in the Dark'. The plot, outlined in detail elsewhere, is somewhat secondary to the overarching themes of faith, obsession, loss, and life in general.

 Much like with the first 5-10 minutes of 'Buffalo 66', you might find yourself wondering if the film has been edited properly, or just thrown together as a joke. But it will grow on you, if it hasn't already. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, but if you are looking for something with a little substance, this is a powerful, landmark movie.

 You might enjoy Buffalo 66, the Idiots (and anything else by the Dogme guys), if you enjoy this. But make sure you watch Festen, as it is a fine, fine movie.
