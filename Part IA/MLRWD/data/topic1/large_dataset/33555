This review of Joel Schumacher's homage to the martyred Irish journalist is written to honor her on the tenth anniversary of her death.
 Cate Blanchett is riveting as the title character, who faces down incredible danger, not only to herself, but to her family as well, as she tries to make her job as a journalist more substantial by reporting on Dublin's growing drug problem, rather than sticking with comparatively minor stories such as church scandals. I feel her performance had more substance than that of Joan Allen's in another film based on Guerin's life.
 Brenda Fricker is Veronica's likeable and concerned mother, and the other standout performances are by Ciaran Hinds and Gerard McSorley as Guerin's two main nemeses.
 Guerin's tragic end, although foreseen at the beginning can make a viewer reel. But the equally powerful aftermath is noteworthy, too. It was literally and figuratively a case of "getting the Irish up", and  the decrease in the drug problem, and the persecution of the drug lords, and the confiscation of their ill-gotten gains.
 Perhaps Guerin could be considered the unofficial Patron Saint of journalists. This film magnificently captures the grittiness and terror of the underworld, and Guerin's bravery in facing it.
 As Christ left an imprint on the cloth with which Guerin's presumed Patron Saint wiped His face along the Via Dolorosa, so too, did this Veronica leave a powerful imprint upon her country and help change it for the better. The name, "Veronica" means "true image", and she definitely held a mirror up to her countrymen and women and made them see and face up to an unflattering truth about a specific problem in their country. Peace to her spirit, and peace and strength to her widower and son.
