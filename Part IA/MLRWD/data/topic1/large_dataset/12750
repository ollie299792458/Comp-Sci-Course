To say that this concert is great would be a huge understatement. Before buying, I read through many reviews at amazon after one or two reviewers commented on the audience's participation (singing along with Stevie too much). Needless to say, I'm glad I did as so many other reviews suggested and purchased this dvd. Stevie is amazing and his accompanying band and singers were great too. I loved every minute of this show (watched it at least 3 or 4 times since I bought it)from start to finish. I cannot say much without repeating what many have already stated, but if you're a fan of Stevie Wonder or have even so much as a remote interest in his music, I would definitely recommend this concert.

The picture and sound quality is very nice and like the audience members at the show, I couldn't help but find myself singing along and enjoying the music. It's a really good show to have a great time in the comfort of your home with the surround sound turned up. As always, amazon was right on schedule with the delivery and the goods arrived in top shape.
Long story short: I was highly entertained and amazed by this concert. It was worth every penny!
