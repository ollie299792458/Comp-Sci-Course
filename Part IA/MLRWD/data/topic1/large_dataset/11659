I first saw this movie on TV when I was a kid, and I can't even count the number of times I have seen it since.  I first was happy to have it on tape, now I bought it on DVD from Amazon.  I just can't watch this movie too many times.

This story is from a book by William March, published in 1954.  It was made into a broadway play in 1955 and in 1956 the entire cast from the play was used for the movie.  Patty McCormack was outstanding as Rhoda Penmark, "the bad seed".  The entire cast is fantastic, and the writing, direction and cinematography keeps you riveted until the very last moment.

This film had an alternate ending that I saw off and on when it was on TV years ago.  I finally got a copy of the book several years ago, and the end of the book is different than either one of them.  Not only do I highly recommend this DVD, but I also recommend that you watch the movie first (usually I would do it the other way around) just so that you can see how faithfully the writer of the screenplay followed the book - until the very end.  I was surprised to see that it doesn't match either ending that I had seen in the movie!

This book and film was very shocking for its time, and people had a very hard time accepting that a little girl could be a killer.  That is what made it such a unique and awesome thriller.

One thing I love at the end of the movie is that they bring out each actor to take a bow just like they would in the live play.  They all deserved Oscars as did the movie.
