A film like this only comes once. Yes, I might agree that it has similarities with other movies but it is a great ride.
Young modern cowboy Caleb meet young vampire girl Mae and is introduced into the fold. To stay he must kill.
From the first shot of a mosquito buzzing on Calebs arm towards the end showdown and the last freezeframe, Near Dark is a masterpiece on it's own. Kathryn Bigelow (the director of Point Break and Strange Days) cut her teeth on this vampire-something flick, together with screenwriter/director Eric Red (The Hitcher, Cohen &amp; Tate). In the cast I am with delight able to watch such good and often underrated actors as Lance Henriksen (Millenium), Jeanette Goldstein (Aliens), Bill Paxton (Titanic) as three parts of the vampire family. But I do not forget the two stars, both Jenny Wright and Adrian Pasdar make characters that I really care about.
So, what is Near Dark? A beautiful dark love story.
One of the best things about Near Dark is showing the vampires (if that is what they are? we are not told but they drink blood and they get sunburned.) as pretty normal people (they don't fly around hissing with fanged teeth).
And then it's the music by Tangerine Dreams (Firestarter) which is just perfect.
It's one of my favourites, as a vampire flick and as a film.
Every time I see this film it gives me goosebumps when Jenny Wright says:
"Look, the night, it's so bright that it will blind you."
