this film is a deffent tear jerker. george (played by kevin kline) is a architect who loses his job and then finds out that
he has cancer, he decides he wants to tear down his shack of a
house that his father gave to him and build a beautiful house and he wants to do it with his son sam (played by hayden christensen). as george is rebuilding this house he is also re-
building a relationship with his son and his ex-wife(played by
kristen scott-thomas), but he's also building relationships with
his neighbors as well. the most emotional part is when sam learns that his father has cancer and he's dying, when hayden hits the wall with his fists i felt it. this is a beautiful movie about love, family, and life and i think every one should
see it especially to see what a talent hayden christensen is, he
is going places and if they don't believe me they should watch
star wars II and III as well as shattered glass, then they will
see what a true talent this young man is.
