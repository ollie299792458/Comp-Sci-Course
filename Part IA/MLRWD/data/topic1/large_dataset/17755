This is a wonderful film in the sense that it makes you truly appreciate your life as it is. Susanna Kaysen is a character that is deeply disaffected with everything and it makes her very unhappy. Unhappy to the the extent that she has to be sent to mental instution to give her a new, more postive perspective on life.

The film charts her slow evolution over 18 months of voluntary institutionalization, showing the female mind at its lowest but also the few sparks of hope that begin to appear as time goes on.

Angelina Jolie is remarkable as ever, bringing an intense passion to her role, showing Lisa to be astounding but self destructive creature. Ms. Jolie deserved her oscar for this role. I cant imagine anyone else playing Lisa with such conviction.

The same goes for Britany Murphy. Her role is small but crucial. For me Daisy was the most disturbing character and as a result the most interesting watch. She is deeply unstable and, as the film progesses, we see she is in such a state with good reason. Britany Murphy is at her best here.

My one problem with this movie is Winona Ryder. Casting her just seems too easy for me. Like Hollywood producers were sitting around asking themselves who would be "edgy" enough but still with enough boxoffice appeal to get butts in the seats. Thats not to say that Winona Ryder didnt do a good job. She did. I just feel like there was probably someone out there that could have done better.

I do love this movie. It says a lot about how we see the world and how this view affects us and how we interact with society. Not everyone would react the way Susanna did but it suggests the fragile nature of the human mind and how easy it is to just let it all cave in on you.
