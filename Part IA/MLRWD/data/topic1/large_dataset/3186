Have you ever watched a movie because there was nothing else on?  Perhaps you have seen the trailers and thought you knew the movie already.  Needless to say, you come in with little to no expectations.  For this movie, I expected to get some reading done, but found myself watching the movie and getting a laugh or two.
Business agendas and love do not go together, and this movie highlights that fact.  While Matthew McConaughey is trying to win an account by getting someone to fall in love with him, Kate Hudson is writing a story about losing a guy in just ten days.  In both cases, they are not in complete control.  Kate's editor tells her she must write the story while Matthew's competitors choose his girlfriend.
The comedy comes in what should be a romp through the things that a woman may do to scare a man off; however, the true comedy comes in the patience the man shows when the woman's tactics get a little unbelievable.  The tactics, like planning their wedding and life together after only having been dated a few days, seem a bit much.  The characters seem to know that this is extreme and because of this, I don't think the extremity hurt the movie.  Just trying to cope good naturedly takes everything they have.
I would recommend this for some light viewing.  Don't try to make too much out of it.
