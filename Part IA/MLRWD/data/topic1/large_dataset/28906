THIS REVIEW IS OF THE BLU-RAY RELEASE

Since the LA Confidential has been reviewed and discussed at great length since it came out over a decade ago, this review will focus on the technical aspects of the Blu-ray release.

Video Quality: The picture quality is demo material. The best thing I can say about it, is that it looks like a 35mm film is being projected on my TV. The image is very clean and sharp, by retains the texture of film. Colors especially looks as they do on film. Overall, the picture is night and day better than the original DVD release. Retail stores should be using a comparison between these two releases to promote Blu-ray.

Audio Quality: I'm not thrilled with the sound. In the Dolby 5.1 mix, and especially the Dolby TrueHD, the sound levels and bass of the sound effects have been turned up extremely high. While this gives your audio system a good workout -- friends have complimented how "cinematic" my speakers sound when watching this disc -- I frankly find it annoying. Every time a door is shut or someone is punched, it sounds like someone is whacking a bass drum. Automatic guns sounds more like an anti-aircraft guns.

Special Features: WB has included a slew of new special features, most of them weighed towards the actors. I didn't really find them all that substantive. What's missing is a commentary by or lengthy interview with Curtis Hanson. He is the genius behind the film after all.

If you like LA Confidential, this is a mandatory purchase for the fantastic picture quality.
