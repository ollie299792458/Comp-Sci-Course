This is, without a doubt, the best "nature film" I've ever seen.  In addition to absolutely beautiful -- artistic -- footage of wondrous creatures, great and small, there are also shots, from various angles, of scenes that I had never seen before:  gulls dive-bombing a school of fish (amid leaping dolphins); schools of fish swirling in a perfect cone shape, morphing into a perfect sphere; a mother (dugong? seal? I don't remember) holding her baby close with her flipper (that image actually brought tears to my eyes); newly hatched sea turtles making a desperate, instinctive run for the safety of the sea (only to be picked off, one by one, by waiting birds); a very weird creature vacuuming the ocean floor for dinner; and many others.  The videography was almost poetic - I loved a shot of one of the divers swimming next to a shark.

Other people have complained about the narration, but I thought it was perfect.  I think the idea was for viewers to focus on the images, and Pierce Brosnan's narration was almost subliminal.
