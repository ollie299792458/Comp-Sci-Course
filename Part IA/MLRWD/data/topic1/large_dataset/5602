Hawaii Five-0 the original series ran for 12 seasons from 1968 through 1980, and starred Jack Lord in the unsurpassed role of his career.  The show's feel was authentic, perhaps in part due to most of the cast residing in Hawaii at the time, Jack Lord in fact remained all his life.  Another note of realism was from Kam Fong who played Chin, and was a former real life policeman.  A very important co-star was the backdrop of the beautiful island paradise that is Hawaii, and they filmed all aruund the island of Oahu at parks, beaches, attractions, luxury hotels and in millionaires' homes, enticing armchair travelers like myself to come visit (which I fortunately got to do on several occasions).  The stories were solidly told, with plenty of chases and action, and there were many recognizable guest stars of the 1970s on this Season 5 six-DVD set, whose episodes are listed below along with their featured guest stars:
