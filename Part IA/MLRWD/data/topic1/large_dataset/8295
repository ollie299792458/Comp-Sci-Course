This is a fictional account of a group of young Russian volunteers who joined the army to fight in Afghanistan towards the end of the Soviet Union's occupation in the 1980's. The first hour of the movie takes place in a training camp and events parallel many US films about military training. The last hour and half takes place during deployment in Afghanistan. As such, the movie certainly reflect the US experience there. Compare the recent documentary "Restrepo" (named for a US soldier, 2010), and an older movie, "Beast of War" (regards a Soviet tank crew, 1988).

Actors and acting seemed natural for their situation and no particular effort was taken to make the war heroic or glamorous, the Soviet era being over and forgotten by a new generation.

For the Russian language sound track, the English subtitles have been carefully edited for a general audience.  But beware screening the spoken English version in mixed company. The disclaimer hardly covers the 2 1/2 hours of army talk. (Makes you wonder where the translator learned English!) Also note that the English sound track is poorly synchronized with speakers lips.
