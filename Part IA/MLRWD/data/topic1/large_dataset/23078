At last a 1960s Science Fiction classic, the ORIGINAL Planet of The Apes gets it's deluxe treatment. However, I question why Eric Greene's ( Author of Planet of the Apes as American Myth, 1996, McFarland and Company ) commentary is in text form? The
audio commentaries with Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Natalie
Trundy and John Chambers appear to have come from interviews or something. Composer Jerry Goldsmith's audio commentary was interesting. I suppose that for people who could not afford the six disc Planet of the Apes: The Evolution, the two hour documentary, Behind The Planet of the Apes is perhaps a welcoming sight. Hopefully Fox will continue to re-present the
rest of the Apes series in deluxe form such as this. Note: I went through six of these sets, due to what the seller informed me was a bad batch, whereas the picture freezes and jumps back to a previous chapter, or won't play period. Finally I had to
reluctantly settle for a full screen version, in which playback was perfect. Enjoy.
