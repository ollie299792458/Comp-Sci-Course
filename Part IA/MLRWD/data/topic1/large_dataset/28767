I am a native Houstonian. I personally know many of the Enron players and both defendants in the current trial. I had the pleasure of seeing this film on opening night at the River Oaks theatre in Houston a year or so ago. Many in the audience were former Enron employees whom I recognized, as well as other distinguished and not so distinguished locals. Many laughs and "tee hee's" were heard from the audience throughout. At the end, most of us applauded wildly, as this was a great film, great entertainment, truthful, insightful, and above all, quite undersandable, especially the new accounting phrase "mark to market". This DVD , seen by me more than a year later, and while the Enron trial of Skilling and Lay is in its fourth week ( Fastow was cross examined the day I watched it), had an impact on me that was even greater than when I first viewed it with others in the theatre. It is very, very well done, and I recommend it wholeheartedly for those of you who like history, drama, comedy, financial complexities, documentaries or just want a good night of being fully entertained.
