i wish i could have that time back! i wish i could have gave this zero stars. this is by far the worst of the franchise. not only are the effects bogus and lame, the story is completely garbage. there is no connection to the characters,plot,or story as a whole. i feel as though i knew what was gonna happen long before it did. it should have followed with the franchise and tied things together with all the previous movies. the acting was HORRIBLE! even (Bubba) the guy from forrest gump was bad.feels like  maybe this was more of a film student class project with his friends as the cast.very unlikeable movie and hard to stay focused and keep attention. i hope this is not where they leave this beloved franchise, and someone else takes the reigns and does this some justice. this installment could have killed the whole series.  so do yourselves a favor and keep your money in your pocket and if you have to waste your time,watch it at friends house, so that you arent out any money. but make sure you bring a pillow and blanket, because this will put you to sleep.

i hope i could help in your decision on this movie. feel free to follow me on twitter @blupit30
