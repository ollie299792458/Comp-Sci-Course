First off, let me say I'm as far from your average SF/Horror fan as you can get: over 50, female, and have read and loved SF for nearly 40 years. This is a wonderful, terrible movie, with a great soundtrack, beautiful special effects, humor (including at itself and the genre), good to great acting (I love Natasha Henstridge, Pam Grier is fantastic, and this is the kind of movie where Ice Cube's acting talents truly shine!). There's absolutely no use in asking why things happen in this movie, people do stupid things just to keep the action going (remember Prison Break? and at least the effects and the acting pull you in and keep you there). It's gory and the costuming is wonderful, the zombies are some of the creepiest I've ever seen. It's not going to challenge your intellect, but you're not watching a Carpenter movie to be dazzled by philosophical questions, are you? The pacing is good, and for a Friday night slugfest, it's better than most. Turn your brain off, make the popcorn, sit back and have a bloody good time!
