At 28 years of age, I like many others have grown up with Oprah having seemingly always been there. All I knew was, she's THE Talk Show Queen. If you asked me why she is the Talk Show Queen, my answer would have been - she has been on TV forever.

But over the last few years, I have become more familiar with the show. And as this DVD demonstrates, Oprah Winfrey is more than just a Talk Show Queen.

It is so touching and FUN to see the stupdenous joy she so easily spreads. It is amazing to watch the out-of-my-skin excitement of the teachers all receiving a car and of the teachers in the audience of one of Oprah's Favourite Things shows. Not only is Oprah generous but she bestows her generosity on everyday heroes: teachers, hardworking mothers and more recently (and not on the DVD) volunteers of the Hurricane Katrina rescue effort.

Of course there is going to be Oprah bashing. You can't make everyone love you, some people are not capable of loving others and giving recognition.

But the truth of the matter is: Oprah is a wonderful, inspiring and truly magnificent human being. There is no one else like her and there never will be.

Oh, and the DVD pack is a great collection of snapshots from the show for those who missed out on the early years. :-)
