Having watched this movie several times, I have to say that it still has the same allure which it had when I first watched it 11 years ago. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action or character driven drama. This is, in my opinion, an all-time classic and a must-own movie -  ranking right up there with the likes of Casablanca, Tombstone or Saving Private Ryan. All of the characters in this movie are first-rate and pull the plot together superbly. The authenticity behind the all of the characters and the scenes is very impressive and adds a great deal of depth to the film. It boasts a fantastic balance between action and character development - with the extra time used to really get you involved with the characters and to see what is driving them as people. Some may say that this movie is too long, but it is time well-spent and can be appreciated by those who like to get involved with the characters and not just watch a storyline unfold. I really appreciate how the movie portrays both the "good guys" and "bad guys" - involving both of them in the story. This is truly an epic movie and deserves to be watched by anyone who appreciates a truly great movie. If you watch it once - you will want to see it again.
