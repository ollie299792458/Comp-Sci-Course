I Timothy 6:9 says"... those who want to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction."

As with Daniel Plainview in "There will be Blood", Ben Kalmen descends into a similar abyss of depravity and self absorption and thus becomes the "Solitary Man".

Brian Koppelman has crafted a Godless, hedonistic world as we focus almost exclusively on the Michael Douglas' character while all the rest of the great ensemble cast remains in orbit around his increasingly darkened sun.

Inexplicably the movie is listed as a comedy  - though to my mind there is very little to laugh about - in fact I found the story compellingly depressing. The gentlest character is played in an understated way by Danny DeVito as an old college friend turned deli owner who demonstrates genuine, though some might say, undeserved compassion. Another Douglas character,  that had similar issues but played comedically was his part in the remake of "The In-Laws"

Part of the compelling nature of this movie revolves around the inability of the Douglas character to recognize his own fallibility. He persists in the reckless and dangerous pursuit of pleasure, all the time living in the potential shadow of heart failure. It is the opening scene of the movie that provides the metaphor for the entire film as Ben chooses to ignore a potentially damaging diagnosis of heart disease.

In the end the movie is appropriately ambivalent as the screen turns black without us knowing whether Ben Kalmen turns towards home or continues towards his inevitable destruction.

The movie is justifiably rated "R" and has an extremely mature theme including a rather graphic sex scene - central to the plot  - but distasteful nonetheless. The language and and subject matter are intrinsically adult in nature. That being said, this is a good, if somewhat depressing movie, but worthy of adult viewing.
