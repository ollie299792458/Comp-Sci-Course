Disney's animated "Alice in Wonderland" is a mixed blessing.  Fun to watch, but ultimately flat.  It's also a beautiful, wildly colorful film.

Sadly, this "new" edition is a STEP BACKWARDS from the previous DVD release, called the "Masterpiece Edition."  Snap it up now before it disappears.  The colors and contrast on this new DVD are washed out and the image is a bit blurry.  The colors are WAY off, and there's even a bit of shoddy DNR (digital  noise reduction) that isn't apparent on the previous, far superior version.  What a shame they don't consult Disney artists to fix these issues.

Even more sad is the fact that the Laserdisc release of "Alice in Wonderland" 10 or so years ago has FAR more supplemental extras, very few of which are included here--including two entire different versions of the film.

Instead, you get lame "interactive games," which aren't interactive, and aren't fun.  The menus for the film are also piss-poor.

Disney, do better.  Now.
