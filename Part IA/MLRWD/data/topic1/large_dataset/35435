I really love Woody Allen.  I haven't seen all of his films or anything, but "Annie Hall" and "Sleeper" are among my top ten favorite movies of all time.  I think the seventies was his best decade.  The eighties also proved productive, but the nineties, middle of the road.  He definetly had his moments ("Everyone Says I Love You" and  "Sweet and Lowdown") but he also had some stinkers  ("Deconstructing Harry" and "Celebrity").  I decided to  see this movie based on good reviews and my almost unwavering love of Woody  Allen.  I watched it the whole way through, waiting for it to get good, but  I'm sad to say, it never did.  I found the characters to be annoying and  the continual strife between the characters was not pleasent to watch and  got old after a while.  I don't even think it was that effective.  Woody  was as always, excellent, and Juliette Lewis and Mia Farrow pulled their  weight, but I thought Judy Davis, an actress I'm not to fond of anyway, was  miscast.  I also did not care to much for Liam Neeson's and Sydney  Pollack's performance.  Not a movie I would recommend to a 70's Allen fan,  but if you liked "Deconstructing Harry"...  See  "Interiors" or "September" instead.
