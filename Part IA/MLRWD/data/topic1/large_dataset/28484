I am a big horror buff. I have seen the best of them and the worst of them. I turned off the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre because I found it excessively gorey. Other than Mirrors, my favorite horror movie was Boogeyman. I am not a fan of gore. I think the best horror movies are psychological and scare you either because you know it definetly COULD happen or because it is based around a subject that has some degree of mystery around it. Mirrors is based around the premise that mirrors are actually portals to another world and are able to control your body. The concept is frightening enough, but their implementing of the concept left me afraid to look at mirrors for several days.

I'm not going to say that the movie is free of gore. There was a moment where I had to avert my eyes because the image before me was so gruesome that I simply couldn't watch. But the moments of gore are few and far between and they aren't the main factor that gives you fear. The film relies on getting into your head and planting fear of an everyday object to terrify you. And it succeeds. Beautifully.
