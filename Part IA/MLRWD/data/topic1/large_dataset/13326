this movie was meant to be a disaster.To begin with,did the producers or the director realize that"the queen of the damned" is part of the vampire chronicles?did they realize it would have been more relevant to adapt "the vampire lestat" prior to "the queen of the damned",to keep some chronological coherence?I suppose they didn't.
So then,here is this movie,based on Anne Rice's novel(you gotta be kidding me).
First,the cast.In "interview with the vampire" by Neil Jordan,which is a good adaptation of the eponymous novel as well as an excellent movie,I thought there a big mistake in the cast;indeed Antonio Banderas in the role of Armand wasn't really convincing,nor credible,Armand supposed being around 20 years old when he was made a vampire by Marius.
However,in "queen of the damned",the whole cast is a big mistake,a huge joke,with a special mention to vincent perez,ridiculous as Marius.When I first saw "interview...",I got the conviction that Tom Cruise Was Lestat,forever.To me,no one could play this character after him.So,to see the long fair haired fugous french young man turning into a dark haired gothic bloke comforts me in my opinion.Aaliyah did a better job than the rest of the cast but still her performance is everything but astonishing.
Then,the screenplay.What can I say?Did you guys really read Anne Rice's novel?If yes,were you sober?So Marius did create Lestat?Well,hum...that's interesting!And what about Armand and Daniel?What about Louis?This screenplay is just a very very poor piece of work,while it should have been the central element of the movie.A fashionable metal rock soundtrack doesn't make a good movie,a great and solid screenplay often does.
Anyway,you'll have understood it,if you are a fan of Anne Rice's vampire chronicles,avoid this dvd and this movie,because it would just be a waste of time as well as a torture for your mind.
