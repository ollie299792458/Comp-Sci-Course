I thought the movie was very good in that an attempt although a very week one, (but an attempt all the same) was made to tell the story of Indigenous soldiers defending their homeland in a last gasp against European Imperialism.  Unfortunately, like most movies, the story is told from the European's point of view where the viewer is coached into cheering the British when they fire repeating rifles at oncoming Zulu warriors armed only with rawhide shields, short stabbing spears and tremendous courage.  Yet the Zulus defeat a military that boasted for decades up to that point as being the greatest on earth.  The viewer once again is coached into feeling sympathy for the British once defeated even though it was the British who broke the treaties, crossed into restricted lands and threatened a people who up to that point honored their right to settlement in (their) land.  This movie again takes a stab at depicting a more accurate portrayal of the wars that took place on continents like Africa, India and the Americas and it will disturb many who are comfortable in their fantasy that Europe just walked into these lands and had their way with the savage.  These Africans were highly intelligent and very skilled at not only closed combat, closed order drill and unit tactics but they excelled at battlefield logistics by having supply and reinforcement units at their disposal to continue the fight for days.  I know this because as a former military man, it was required reading to study Zulu tactics at West Point at one time.  Anyway, a nice departure from the usual.
