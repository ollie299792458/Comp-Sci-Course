I caught a promo of this DVD in one of the many film circulars I get, and, as a fan of Preston Sturges, couldn't wait to get it, but this film, for all the commentary I read, was a huge disappointment. Not that it wasn't hysterically funny in parts - the scenes in which "reality" sets in on a fantastic flight of vengeful fantasy were classic - but some older films don't sit well precisely because their comedic line has been overshadowed by a bleaker modern reality. Especially disturbing was the fantasy murder by shaving razor. Mind you, there is no blood and you are assured this is a total fantasy, albeit dark and extravagantly overplayed, but it somehow doesn't come across as funny these days. Don't get me wrong. This is not a slasher film by any means. It means to be funny, but the dialogue, good as it is at times, gets lost being too cute, the orchestral sound flutters at an unacceptable level, even with remastering, and the only part worth seeing, just for sheer physical humor, is at the end, when Rex Harrison cannot (when he finds it) get a recording machine to work (shades of your first 10 computers), trips over electrical cords (what a dance!), cuts himself with the razor, spills ink all over his checkbook, and can't find bullets for his gun. Again, I find Mad Wednesday and Sullivan's Travels absolutely terrific, which is why I was expecting more from this film. Maybe I wasn't in the mood. There are excellent comedic moments, and I love the classical pieces being played (despite the crummy sound quality), but somehow the "parts" didn't quite make a whole. Okay, I'm out in left field on this, but, sorry, that's my impression.
