There are very few movies which I can honestly say qualify as my "favorites." Even fewer among Christmas-themed movies. But "A Christmas Story" is certainly one of them.
Why? Because I laughed as much watching it the 23rd time as I did the first. Because I can watch it every year and never get sick of it. Because I enjoy it as much now as I did as a kid (although for different reasons).
The genius of this movie is its simple, heartfelt story and loveable characters. Every character seems to remind you of people you really know. You can relate to them and the story they're living. Who doesn't remember wishing and begging for that one must-have present?! And how exciting it was to open it up and see that you *actually* got it?!
Who doesn't have parents who do things that are more-than-slightly embarrassing? Or whom you admired and feared at the same time as a kid? Or have a pesky brother, sister, cousin, or would-be friend who just wouldn't leave you alone? Or ever get pushed around by the school bully? (Unless you were the school bully, that is.)
This movie is superb in that it appeals to all audiences. There is no violence, no blood-and-guts, no tragedy or trauma. There isn't even foul language -- although you'd think so with all the huffing-and-puffing the Old Man does. If you listen carefully, you'll notice that not one swear word is used in this movie -- only words that *sound* like swear words. Example: When the Old Man gets mad at Mother for "accidentally" breaking his Major Award and then "using up all the glue" -- he shouts "Nottafingga!!" Not really a word, is it?! But it sure sounded pretty bad!
Over the years I have grown fond of the movie's characters, and I look forward to watching it every year and "visiting" with Ralphie, Randy, Mother, the Old Man -- even nasty Scut Farcus!! I think it would be difficult for you not the feel the same way about this movie.
