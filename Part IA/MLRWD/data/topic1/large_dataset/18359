This is everything I remembered! "Living Single" myself (pun intended), I felt that it was only right for me to relive my childhhood memories of watching Kadijah, Maxine, Sinclair and Regine. Queen Latifah was my role model in a sense back then and I related to Kadijah's character the most. I lived through the fantasy of someday meeting my Scooter. I could always appreciate Maxine's wit and independence, another character I looked forward to watching. Even watching the love unfold between Overton and Sinclair was awe inspiring.

The First Season of Living Single is everything I imagined and remembered. I am extremely upset that Seasons 2-5 are not available for sale. Warner Bros. claim that it was due to the poor sales of Season 1.....BOOOOOO!!!!!!

I need all of the seasons in my life right now. I want to see Overton and Sinclair get married, Kadijah leaving to move in with Scooter and Regine finally finding her man.

BONUS: I finally learned the mystery line with the them song. It is "True Blue and Tight like glue." Now this doesn't make any sense but this line is referenced in and episode on Disc 1 where Overton says the exact same line.
