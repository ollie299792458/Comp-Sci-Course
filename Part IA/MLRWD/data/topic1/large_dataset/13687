I hate seeing the spotlight reviews with negative comments.  This was not a continuation of the story we were given, but also the last mini-series was a tale told by Merlin himself, and Martin Short's character Frik says that it was not how he remembered the happenings. This time we view the events after the Death of Arthur, when evil seems to overcome the goodness that King Arthur and Camelot has now for hundreds of years we all keep in our harts.  What makes an Authurian story good is by reminding us of this.

A new cast & crew does not bring about the magical presence of before, but each cast member creates a different artform for their characters in this "day after" action story.  We are shown the flaws and goodness of characters who will rise to become the next heroes of Camelot.  This is what makes the magic for this movie.  Merlin is not the same character, he is more bitter and carries guilt of the fall of Arthur, much like the Merlin in classic writings.  Do not judge this movie because it is not a sequel in general terms, judge it as its own art and its own story.

Their is hope for goodness when Camelot rises again.  For with a new story comes new heroes.  The Arthurian Legend grows with a new action-packed film.
