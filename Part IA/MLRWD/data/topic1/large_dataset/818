For one thing, none of Bacon's paintings are seen in the film. Apparently, the owners of the Bacon estate wouldn't grant permission. This would have been okay if there had been a story presented in the film, but there wasn't. About half the movie is made up of abstract, disconnected scenes of Bacon and his friends making negative comments about life and insulting eachother and others. The other half is made up of abstract, disconnected scenes of Bacon's lover popping pills, engaging in sado-masochism with Bacon, and clips of his nightmares. Bacon comes off as a ghoulish monster with no redeeming qualities and his lover, George as a helpless, empty shell of a human being. I bought this video based on the all around good reviews I found on the net and because the great Derek Jacobi and talented Daniel Craig are cast in the leading roles. Alas, I suspect the good reviews must have come from some special standard for reviewing film with homosexual content (gay is good!) and these fine actors talents were wasted on this dog of a movie.
