I didn't think this was a bad prouduction and it had some solid points like Plishka's Alcindoro and Benoit, Zeffirelli's awesome direction, and a great Marcello and Schaunard. Vargas and Gheorghiu turn in solid performances but they are nowhere near the caliber they were in Traviata. Both seem not to be able to take their pieces at a proper tempi, they make Von Karajan's seem fast by comparison. This is not the conductor's fault as the rest of the opera plays well.

I found the extra features interesting, but distracting from the opera. Sure I've seen and heard Boh&egrave;me a few times but I still want to see the performance as is and get into the story and music. Save the backstage stuff for the special features. Add to this the fact that Renee Fleming does more acting while interviewing cast and crew members during the performance than any opera I've seen or heard her in and you just have a big, jumbled, thing that is almost good on your hands. With the truckload of other La Boh&egrave;me recordings and DVD's out there(a lot of them great) you should be alright without this.
