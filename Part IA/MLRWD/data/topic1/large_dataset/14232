Glen Morgan and James Wong gained notoriety by writing a few good episodes of the 90's TV sensation "The X-Files." Their later collaborative efforts on the show (notably, the episode "Kin") were not up to the same standards as their earlier work, but they soldiered on, running the show into the ground. Flash-forward to the the first decade in the 21st century and horror movie remakes have become an easy way for a studio to turn a buck. The Christmas holiday is a well-known "money" weekend for movies; people are stuck with little to do and often go see movies to relieve the boredom. Put "those guys who did stuff on X-Files" on a remake of a horror movie that is set during Christmas and release it on Christmas Eve....how could it go wrong, right? Well, it did go wrong and it pulls the X-Files legacy down with it.

Morgan and Wong produced this mess and Morgan "wrote" the script and directed the movie, which is just sad. Fans of the X-Files will notice a similar feel in certain scenes, but any similarity ends at the visual level as this movie is a poorly executed mess. You will also notice several homages to the X-Files: the yellow-skinned antagonist being one, the obsession with eye injury being another and finally, the in-breeding. What is it with Morgan and Wong and inbreeding? Regardless, "Black Christmas" is an ugly, boring mess that grinds on inexorably to its conclusion. It's a shame that a cast filled with talented, gorgeous young women like Katie Cassidy, Michelle Trachentenberg and Mary Elizabeth Winstead have no better lines than "F___ Christmas!" and "Christmas sucks!" but I guess that's what happens when a movie is churned out by two guys who hit their stride with "Jose Chung's from Outer Space" and that was....what? 1997?
