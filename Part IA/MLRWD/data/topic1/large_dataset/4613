As the beautiful visuals of Clint Eastwood's "Flags of Our Fathers" unfold, it is easy to get caught up in the excitement of battle and forget the point that Eastwood is trying to make: sometimes the real heroes are the ones forgotten, left dead on Iwo Jima in this instance. Everyone has seen the photograph of six men planting a flag on Iwo Jima. It has become a symbol of American valor. However, as we watch the three surviving men being sent back to America on a nationwide tour full of reenactments and autographs, all for the purpose of selling war bonds, the obvious difference between real and fake heroes is defined. The circumstances surrounding the incident are surprising and interesting.

Clint Eastwood does a fantastic job with his direction. This film is not about the entire battle, it only focuses on the flag-raisers and the critical moments for them at Iwo Jima. Eastwood juxtaposes scenes from the battle and from the tour perfectly, and the cinematography is astounding. This film pays tribute to the men who died and still die to defend American freedom, and does so in a respectful fashion, while still being fraught with gunfire and explosions.
