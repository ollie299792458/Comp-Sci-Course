Ive seen both the original Japanese version and American version.
The downside to the American version are the various cuts they made. Not only the Chun Li shower scene, but also her fight with Vega (Balrog in the Japanese version) in the hotel room, which was the best fight in the movie. Also Ryu's fight in the very beginning and various other tidbits here and there.
The upside is that they redid the sound track, and the new rock tunes actually add alot to the movie. It also sounds like they redid the sound effects and everything .. bones seem to have more *crunch* when broken in this version.
The voice overs arent nearly as horrible as many dubbed movies are. It still doesnt compare to the superior Japanese voice acting...but it could be worse.
The action is fast and furious, as it should be. The plot is generic .. as it should be :)
I think this movie is over priced considering it is edited regardless of the "Uncut" title and the fact that theres no Japanese language/English subtitle option.
I'll be buying it used .. but i'll be buying it.
