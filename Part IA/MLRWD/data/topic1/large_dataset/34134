Absolutely excellent independent horror/dark comedy!
It was much better than I had expected (I was expecting a low budget campy flick) and was actually quite hilarious

The story is about a teenage girl who is totally into purity and remaining abstinate and even promotes a club called *Promise* for preteens in which kids pledge their premarital abstinence by wearing a ring. Early in the film, she meets a young man in the Promise Club who fires up her dormant libido and gets her thinking some impure thoughts. What ensues gets ugly when the two end up at a lake. In this scene, the young man's libido takes over and the real reason for Dawn's abstinence becomes apparent; she has a set of shark-like teeth hidden in her vagina which engage any time she's being mistreated, chopping off certain male appendages. She eventually turns the deformity to her advantage and uses it throughout the film to get her revenge on all the males who disrespect her.

The film never crosses over into gritty exploitation but is definitely not for everyone.
