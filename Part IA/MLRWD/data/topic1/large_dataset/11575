Two thumbs up.  My husband is in the Navy, so <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009329ZF2">Battleship</a> was a movie we wanted to see for the ships if nothing else.  We missed it on the big screen (cue the screaming baby), so were eager for the video.  To our surprise, it was much better than we expected from the previews.  The plot is pretty good.  Great action, although it does get a little Transformers-esque over the top a few times.  Fun characters with enjoyable dialogue, which for me is what makes a show.  We liked it enough that we rented it a second time to watch with friends.  If you like Sci-Fi action with some jokes, this is for you.

As a warning, while waiting for Battleship I rented <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007X16YCM">American Warships</a>.  It is a bootleg version of the same plot (using a WWII museum ship to fight aliens) but with cheesy acting and almost no special effects budget.  I would only recommend it if you enjoy MST3K-ing movies.  In that case, American Warships is a prime candidate.
