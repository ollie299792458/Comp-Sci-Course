Roger Moore once again returns as the suave agent 007 in Bond's 9th outing on the silver screen.  I've read other reviews saying that it's the worst Bond of all.  Well I'm tempted to disagree.  I thought that this was an excellent movie with a moving plot and story-line.  The movie starts out  when MI6 headquarters receieves a golden bullet with the number 007 on it,  sent to them courtesy of Scaramanga's girlfriend.  This means that 007 is  Scaramanga's next target to kill, so it's up to James Bond to find  Scaramanga and figure out what is all behind this.
"The Man With The  Golden Gun" includes some documentaries that look interesting.  That  is the nice thing I enjoy about DVD format, all the extras included in all  of the movies.  I can't wait to see the trailers and of course, the  documentary entitled "Inside 'The Man With The Golden Gun.'"  The  thing I found dissatisfying is the widescreen aspect ratio of 1.66:1.  I've  never heard anything such as that, so I'm guessing it's going to be close  to the formatted screen.  It will be close, but we will soon find  out.
This is Roger Moore's second stab at James Bond, as he seems to fit  into the role much easier and much nicer.  I felt in "Live and Let  Die," he was a little uptight, due to the fact that he was relieving  Sean Connery.  Here, has found his portrayal of 007 and fills the role  nicely.  I enjoyed this movie very much and can't wait to see it on DVD.
