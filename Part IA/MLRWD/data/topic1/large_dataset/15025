I am definitely in the minority here, but for me this movie didn't work.  The cast is incredible and the acting is really, really good but I just didn't find the situations that funny.  Steve Martin is one of my favorite actors and I enjoyed watching him as well as all the other siblings as they interacted.  The acting alone would have lead me to give a 5-star rating.

What bothered me was so many of the "humorous" situations weren't humorous.  The disfunction in many cases was so over the top as to be bothersome -- one character was such a juvenile delinquent and so messed up that you could envision him taking a gun to school and opening fire (I didn't find that funny).

TO PARENTS:  Everyone describes this as good, clean fun and while that is true for parts of the movie, it often was anything but clean.  There are multiple scenes in the movie that are totally inappropriate for kids and I was caught off-guard by that.  I watched this with my family (including my 14-year-old) and we ended up fast-forwarding through some sections since the topics were very racy and VERY graphic.

Wanted to like it, but didn't.
