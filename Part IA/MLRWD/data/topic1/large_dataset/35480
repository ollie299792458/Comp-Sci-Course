W.T.F.  Why the hell are there so many bad reviews in here about this movie?  This movie was hilarious!  Think about it; Natalie Portman, a Minotaur raping a skinny little guy, a character created just so they can say "dick-less" servant, and a forest full of naked hotties are just a few elements of this film that make this a very good movie!  If you had high hopes for this movie, then you're just not thinking right.  That like grabbing a glass of 7-up and expecting water when you take a drink.  I'm just saying.

Seriously though.  Take it as it is.  A fresh swing at a stoner type comedy.  It isn't a re-make of any other movies, unlike a lot of the other movies on the shelves right now.  You don't have to be high or drunk to enjoy it, although I'm sure it might enhance it.  If this isn't your cup of tea, then chalk up your rental fee as a loss and STFU.  As for the rest of us that liked it, I'm going to wait a couple months and watch it again and laugh my ass off...again.  Btw, If Natalie Portman is reading this.  "hi"
