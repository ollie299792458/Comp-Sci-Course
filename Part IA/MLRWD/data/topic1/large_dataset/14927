While this story is sheer fantasy, it is sweetly intended but sorrily lacking in plot development, character interaction ( such as: Why didn't anyone visit Stuart in the hospital?) and overall momentum.
The building of affection between the two main characters, not to mention conflict (the foundation of any good story) was almost absent from this film.
The struggle of emotion between Kate (a modern executive woman of the 21st century) and Leopold (a man transported from the 19th century unvoluntarily) is almost non-existant since there is no real conflict adding dimension to the story.
Hugh Jackman offers up a good performance despite a lacklustre plot and co-star.  I fear Meg Ryan has played this role so many times that she lacks the sincerity to do it justice - though, in her defense she cannot be blamed entirely since the premise of the story doesn't exactly lend itself to becoming a romance that leaves you desperate for them to be with each other.  I found myself almost indifferent to their success - occassionally (and mildly at that) feeling a slight wish if only for Hugh Jackman's character, Leopold.  
Jackman deserves Golden Globe consideration for making this movie as tolerable as it is.  Simply put, this movie is sweet yet lacking in substance.
