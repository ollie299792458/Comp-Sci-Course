When I first saw this movie in the theater, I soon came to the realization that many of the viewers could not comprehend that Jim Carrey was starring  in a dramatic role.  They assumed that his innocence and happiness was the  common Jim Carrey-goofiness, and unfortunately they overlooked the most  brilliant aspect of Carrey's acting.  Truman Burbank was brought up in a  perfect world, and for this reason, Carrey portrays him as happy, yet not  quite satisfied with his life.  Every time Carrey smiles to his neighbors,  his friends, or his wife, you can see a true emptiness within his eyes that  only talented actors can produce.  The Truman Show also has a wonderful  supporting cast with the performances of Ed Harris, Laura Linney, and  Natascha Mcelhone.  My personal favorite was Laura Linney, who portrayed  the perky wife/obsessed actress whose job it was to live with a man whom  she couldn't stand, not to mention act as an advertiser for the show's  sponsors.  While the performances in the movie were superb, the plot  undoubtedly unveils the greatness of this film.  Packed full of  philosophical inquiry and the realization that no one can be sure of the  assumed truth around them, this film leaves the audience thinking about  their own worlds long after they have left the theater or shut off the VCR.  This kind of reaction to a movie does not happen often, and when it does,  it is clear that the film is a true original.
