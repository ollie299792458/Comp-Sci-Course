Halloween has long been my favorite holiday.  And every year, as the air gets colder and the leaves start to turn, I begin what could best be described as a mild obsession with all things Halloween-related.  Naturally, I am a die-hard horror movie fan.  But I'm also a sucker for non-horror movies such as "Monster House" and "The Nightmare Before Christmas", for their Halloween themes.

"Trick 'r Treat" immediately appeals to me for both its Halloween imagery and its dark humor.  Indeed, it is a lovely and loving tribute to the holiday.  The mischievous spirit of the season is captured brilliantly.  On the horror front, it's ok, but if horror in general is what you're after, you might have better luck with another movie.  Many of the scares in this movie were not especially scary.  There were some good, atmospheric creepy bits, but nothing that gave me the sorts of cold chills or jump starts the way some other movies do.  In compensation, however, there is a lot of very dark humor, and Dougherty pulls no punches in delivering the comeuppance to the characters who break the traditional rules.  They get what's comin' to them but good.

If you like Halloween, you'll find lots to like in this movie.  There are scarier movies out there, but few that capture the spirit of Halloween so well.
