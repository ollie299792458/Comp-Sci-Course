If you have ever felt that somehow your life could be different if only your parents or ancestors or tribe or forefathers had somehow done things differently, this is a movie with a wonderful, up-lifting, freeing message.  If you are part American Indian, you will appreciate the theme and subtle underlying messages even better.
  The movie does a great job at subtly poking fun at some American Indian stereotypes, but never too seriously, (and never insulting to us white folks!)  No violence, no horror, just a beautiful, funny story that kept my family (boys ages 5-14, husband, brother and sister-in-law) interested to the very end.
  The cover to the VHS tape is misleading.  It is a poor representation of what to expect from this movie.  The girl on the cover plays a very small role.  The VHS cover makes you think the movie is a cliched "road trip with two guys and a girl movie" and it is not!
  Thank you to the producers, writers, directors, and actors for a fine movie!  Please, follow it up with more.  Hey, Victor!
