For this I rushed home from school to plant myself in front of the tube by 3:30 each weekday? Believe it. No soaps for you, Mom! My folks absolutely hated watching the show with me, even more so than pro wrestling. The arguement over which one would take me to see the movie that introduced She-Ra had to be heard. Do I see their perspective now? Kinda. It's mindless fun at best for adults. Yet, mindless fun is often the best kind! Kudos to Filmation for pushing not just toys, but morals like friendship, honesty and self-confidence. Unnoticed by the PMRC parents of the 80's in the rush to hang Mattel execs, but they missed so much, didn't they? Where o where did Skeletor keep coming up with those sundry magical devices to threaten Eternia and Castle Greyskull? How come there was never an action figure of Lizard Man? Such questions find no answer herein, but so what? Me, I plan on forcing my parents to watch an endless loop of MOTU in the crappiest nursing home I can find. Just kidding, Mom. I love ya.
