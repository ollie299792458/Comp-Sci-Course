Premise of the movie: Wesley Gibson is a young professional who has grown up without a father, and never learned to stand up for himself. His girlfriend is cheating on him with his best friend, his boss constantly berates him, and Wesley goes through life bored and complacent. While picking up his anxiety medication, Wesley is approached by Fox (Angelia Jolie), who tells him that his father has been killed, and that his assassin is now after Wesley. This is where the action begins - Wesley is introduced to the 'Fraternity' and told that his mission is to avenge his father's death. He goes through extreme and often brutal training that taps into the skills he never knew he had, only to find that all is not as it seems. (Cannot say more without ruining the movie)

I'm not one to rent action movies, but I thoroughly enjoyed 'Wanted'. Besides the amazing cast - Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman to name a few - the special effects were stunning, the story compelling and the movie definitely very entertaining. I watched this with a few friends, and we had plenty of "Woah! Did you see that?" moments. The only negative to 'Wanted' was that it was almost too fast-paced. At times, the movie felt rushed, and the story line could have been stretched-out more without losing the fast, action appeal.
