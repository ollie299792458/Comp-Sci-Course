This is a very serious movie. It is about overpopulation of people, pollution and corruption (very much a part of the Bush adminitration). Don't bother to read the book "No Room, No Room" it is nothing.
The movie makes a sense of need,security and wanting of the old days and the "Good Life". It is sad, horrifying and terrible what happens but probably very "true to life" in the very near future.
The movie is accurate but outdated because of the old cars used (they should be newer in the year 2020) along with the old videogames and style of the city itself. But the story is very strong and accurate of what the near future will most probably be like. Food shortage takes the cake here.
It is sad to see Edward G. Robinson in his last performance here and yes He dies in the movie too.
So beware man...keep killing the trees keep killing the animals keep burning that gas and oil  but... we will all pay for it soon.

One of the most accurate of the Science Fiction movies.
One of my top ten!
Please see it!
