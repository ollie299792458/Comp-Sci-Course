Big Fish is a wonderous masterpiece featuring a story tailor made for the imagination of Tim Burton.  If ever a director and storyline were destined to be matched, I have to believe this was the case.  Big Fish is larger than life and features a tremendous performance by Ewan McGregor who just continues to raise his stock with every film.  McGregor stars as a young Edward Bloom out to experience life to its fullest.  Always an adventurer, the critical point in this film is the discovery at an early age of how he is to die.  This discovery is made by staring deep into a witch's glass eye (one of the many tales woven through this film).  Big Fish does beg the question then, that if you know how you are to die, does fear of living life leave you liberated?
Albert Finney stars as the older Edward Bloom as he prepares for death and Billy Crudup is cast as his son William who goes on a discovery of the truth to exactly who is father is before it's too late.  Burton does a tremendous job of weaving in details that keep the viewer see-sawing back and forth as to the truth of Edwards tales all the way to the end.  Big Fish is a visual experience to be enjoyed.  The only disappointment has nothing to do with the video at all but the DVD had few extras that I craved after the movie left me begging for more.
