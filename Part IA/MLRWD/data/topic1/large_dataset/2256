I'm not going to give an in-depth review of this film (considering that there are many good ones out there), but I have to say this my all-time favorite Disney animated film and have been eagerly awaiting the Platinum Edition of this movie since... well, since Disney started the Platinum line. If you may remember, when Disney started releasing DVDs, "The Little Mermaid" was one of their first releases. Suffice it to say, the LE was overpriced, completely barebones, had a grainy transfer, and the menus left somewhat to be desired.

Well, Disney has finally rectified that problem. On October 3, 2006 "The Little Mermaid" will be re-released as a new 2 disc set. The movie has been digitally restored with a new anamorphic transfer and will feature a brand-new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix (along with regular Dolby Digital 5.1). The extras offered will be games, never-before-seen deleted footage, music videos, trailers, and many other goodies (hopefully a commentary will be included).

Suffice it to say, throw out or give away that outdated 1999 Limited Edition DVD and replace it with this one. There's too much good stuff in here (plus improved sound and picture quality). This is a double-dip that can't be ignored.
