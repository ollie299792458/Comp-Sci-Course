So far, Hollywood has been making the majority of Resident Evil films and for the most part, though tolerable, arent all that great.

This film isnt a masterpiece the way i would of liked it to be, but i wasnt expecting that. If anything i expected things to stay truer to the story and events in the games. And i believe it does that. And thats a big plus.

Now as a movie, its not bad. The computer graphics they use in this film are pretty good, but ive seen better in films like Beowulf (though i noticed someone said the visuals in this are better than that film, but thats a just not the case)
This film looks like we are watching an Xbox 360 game in a lot of ways. But it is still good looking. For a film that didnt go to theaters, its pretty good. Its on the level of Final Fantasy: Advent Children.

The acting is decent. And the events that take place are interesting and keep you watching. And the "boss", as it were, at the end, is awesome to watch, pretty worthy of a Resident Evil boss.

I like the setting this movie is in, taking place within an airport, and i could see them using this story for an RE game maybe in the past, but i guess they might of saved these side plots or left over ideas that didnt make it into the games and placed them in here for the movie, perhaps. who knows?

I liked seeing Clair and Leon together as partners again. Brings ya back to the RE 2 days. So i think this movie will be a decent Resident Evil fan pleaser, for the people who love the games and who follow the series.
I, for one, beat Resident 2 and owned Resident Evil 4 (which was GREAT) and cant wait to play RE 5, so i really appreciate Capcom actually going out there and giving us a new film to watch.
