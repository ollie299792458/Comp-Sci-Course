Dexter is one of the few shows I actually buy on DVD (or Blu-Ray this year).  The idea of the character is unique among the genre, and the first seasons carried it off so well, better in many ways than the books, which is also a unique quality.  There is always some significant suspension of disbelief (how many times do people get to sneak into Dexter's house before he gets an alarm?  Even the cliff hanger:  Dexter would never have been so careless to allow it to happen, except when it's convenient to the story.  Dexter only works two hours a day, stays up all night, and is fine.)

Season six is different.  There is a continual darkness to it that wasn't there before, which I think happens because we don't have the lighter side:  no Rita, no Cody, no Astor.  Only we have a weaker villain, so the general darkness is mismatched to the weak bad guy, and some too easy resolutions to conflict.  Edward James Olmos could have been put to better use, and there are many opportunities to make the storyline tense that just zipped by.  We also had the focus on Debra's problems, and less on the other characters than we have seen in the past, including adding a new detective with very little character development.  In fact, we find the characters uniformly not liking the new guy in one episode, and then the theme disappears.

On the other hand, the cliff hanger means that next season has to be really different.  Unless it was a dream.  Deb as LT with LaGuerta as the boss with no one to intervene.  Either the show jumped the shark this year and we won't find out until next, or it is really going to get interesting.
