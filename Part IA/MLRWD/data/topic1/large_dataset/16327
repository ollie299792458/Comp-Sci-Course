The first line of Superman: The Movie is Jor-El (Marlon Brando) telling the Kryton Council "This is no fantasy."  This line is symbolic of the movie that is about to follow.  When one watches Superman you do not feel as if is a fantasy.  Superman takes itself totally seriously and it is therefore an immensly entertaining and believable viewing experience.  The video quality of this DVD is excellent.  This is the first time I have seen this film since I was young.  Now that I'm older I can truly appreciate the riveting performance Christopher Reeve gave as Clark Kent/Superman.  Reeve provided each character with a distinctive personality.  This lent credibility to the story.  Reeve's mannerisms also gave the flying sequences authenticity. The greatest compliment I can give Christopher Reeve is that whenever I think of Superman I will instantaneously think of him.  The supporting cast of Superman were also excellent.  Marlon Brando (Jor-El) and Gene Hackman (Lex Luthor) both gave outstanding performances.  This DVD also has additional scenes that were not in the theatrical release.  These scenes are not frivolous and really add a new dimension to the film.  For example, there is more of Jor-El emphasizing his son's purpose on Earth. Superman: The Movie is a great film because it has one ingredient that future comic book adaptations have lacked, emotion.  This is inherent in the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder).  Superman is undisputably the Citizen Kane of comic book adaptations.
