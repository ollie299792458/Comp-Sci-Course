Yes, this is an iconic performance given by Brando as the loutish Stanley, who operates on a different level of sexual manipulation than the equally manipulative Blanche. They both know "Death--the opposite is desire" and the struggle to win is as riveting now as when the film was first shown.

But the audiences with whom I have seen this film have come to see the brutish Brando tear his T-sirt and cry Stella, but have all left discussing one of the greatest performances ever committed to film, that of the great Vivien Leigh.

She not only drifts out to madness is a sea of words, but she is alternately cruel and vulnerable as she does so. It is truly harrowing to watch this intelligent creature struggle so hard to find the salvation she seeks in this squalid New Orleans of the 50s.

Brando has claimed that Leigh was the perfect Blanche--and, as such-the film becomes about this tortured creature (whose very worst punisher is herself)perhaps more than the play ever was. The Pulitzer radio broadcast indicates that even the original Blanche (Jessica Tandy) was unable to make the Williams text as organic.

The new dvd edition promises a lot of extras and a glowing new transfer. It's about time that this great performance of Leigh's got all the right home video attention!
