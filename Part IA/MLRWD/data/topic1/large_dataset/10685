After being such a big fan for so long it is easy to see how strong independent women everywhere have a tendency to cling to these powerful glamorous women.  In a world where women rule and the topic is sure to be titilating who wouldn't be enticed?
 I was however thrown for a moment when I realized that a show named for sex had been planted in the middle east and my beloved characters whom I have cherished for so long were no longer behaving the way I would have expected strong mature intellectual women to behave in a culture clash society where propriety takes a front seat.
 I cannot believe that these women would be so naive as to believe that an "anything goes" mentality is permissable everywhere.  One warning and near imprisonment apparently is not enough to entertain this valuable lesson before another public display is nearly getting all the girls arrested.
 I have to say while reaching for comedy, the writers reached too far and completely distorted what could have been a truly fantastic movie.
