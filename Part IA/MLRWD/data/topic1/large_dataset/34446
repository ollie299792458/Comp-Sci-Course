Well put together documentary (for what it is)! I agree with the last reviewer in that it focused more on the east coast / Boston scene. I also could see how people would be dissapointed in this movie. It pretty much skipped over the San Francisco scene where hardcore was huge and very important. I was hoping to see some good Farm footage, but that didn't happen. I don't think you can capture the hardcore movement of that time accurately in just 1 DVD. You don't really get to see many movies about this time in punk, mostly before and after so I am grateful to have it. There are a few out there but this is by far the best one. Well researched and executed, hopefully there will be a part 2 sometime in the not so distant future. It is also good to see these people now after not seeing them for over 20 years. Greg Ginn, Kira, H.R., Bad Brains,C.O.C, Cro-Mags, Murphy's Law, SSD, Ian MacKaye, Circle Jerks etc. The Film has some great rare show footage (Henry Rollins beating up a punk that's screwing with him, funny stuff). A definite must have if you were around at that time. Someone Please make a San Francisco hardcore scene Documentary!! Check Out "We Got The Neutron Bomb" book. You will love it!
