I have been to quite a few renaissance faires mainly for the music and I must say that Castles & Dreams captures all the fun spirit of a Renaissance Faire concert.  Even with occasional sound problems (which are much less here than in their "Past Times with Good Company" live CD, which was terrible!), the enjoyment Ritchie and Candice have for their music and audience shines through.  I understand that they edited it down from three hours.  I wish we could have had all three hours on the DVD, even if they had to add a third disk.

The extras on the album were fine. I enjoyed the 'alternate camera view' of Ritchie's guitar work, on disk 1. However, the menus on disk 2 (special features) were confusing and difficult to navigate. The song videos were good, but there were a few 'fan created' videos that left us stunned, saying "um, can we stop this -- now?"

All in all, however, I have to give this a 'five star review' mainly because of all the concert DVD's I've seen this one is superb.
