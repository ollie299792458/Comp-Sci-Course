... for an increadible journey. Vanilla Sky is so sad, so true, so brilliant. I saw the original, which is raw, sloppy with a lot of mediocre choices and solutions. Vanilla Sky is a beautiful tale, a message so rarely received: ... well, I shouldn't tell my version, it's best told in the movie.
I join the long line before me: I never was a fan or admirer of Tom Cruise. That all had changed with Magnolia. In Vanilla Sky, both him and Cruz act so credibly, they redefine and reset the standards of acting in a few minutes of the movie at the end and after that very night they spend together. Their expressions are so subtle, their sadness is so true that it's hard to believe it is "just" acting. Well... the love story part isn't as we know.
Last note: This is a good case study comparing Open Your Eyes and Vanilla Sky. The latter is modern, easy to connect to and to be moved by, the original misses the point: the audience. E.g., showing someone angry doens't make the viewer angry, it makes them uncomfortable. What's wrong with contemporary European art?Trying to make a profit on a movie is not a sin. It may even help the cause, gives you a "down-to-Earth" attitude.
(I was born and raised in Europe, and I hope they will once again return to continue making great movies. They somehow skipped the last 15 years.) 1st Hollywood bought their scripts and made [odd] versions of it, now they make them work.
