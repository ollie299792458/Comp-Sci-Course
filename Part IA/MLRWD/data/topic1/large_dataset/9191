If this movie was a low budget movie of an ordinary director -like texas chainsaw mess..- i could call it "the sickest comedy ever". (Yes, there are scenes that u normaly lough at, but u just cant!!!)
But this movie is far beyond the sickest, most horifiying and dýsturbýng movie ever. It is just something that hard to describe!
"Funny Games" of Michael Haneke is like "Happy Days" and "Reservoir Dogs" of Tarantino is like "Snow White" when compaired to Salo!!!
Technically directing and acting is superior. But there is more than that in this movie. 
There is no arguments like; "love" or "hate" or "enjoy" for this movie. U just hate what u see!!! And u shock and after a while u start deep thinking while feeling real bad... U think of how "low" and "evil" that the human kind can be! U start hating the human kind. (And even ur self!)
SALO -120 DAYS OF SODOM-  will change ur life !!! (Bealive it or not!!!)
Note: This movie is rated 18 but in my opinion ýt has to be rated 28 !! -Its not because of the extreme sex and violance scenes but the movie it self!!! 
CAUTION: PARENTS BE ADVISED THAT IT CAN BE EXTREMELY HARMFULL FOR TEENAGERS. IF U BUY THIS MOVIE KEEP IT IN A SAFE PLACE.
(ý mean it! No kidding!!!)
