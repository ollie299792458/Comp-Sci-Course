This flick is an amazingly well made throwback to the classic sci-fi films that made sci-fi films what they are today. But although it pays homage to its predecessors, it stands alone as a truly original masterpiece of story-telling, cinematography and direction. Considering this film was made basically out of the director's garage, from a budget that amounted to the life savings of members of the crew, it's astonishing what they were able to pull off - wonderful make-up and creature designs, believable special effects, highly detailed miniatures, and breathtaking cinematography shot on a top-notch camera. The less you know about the story of this movie the better, because there are several twists and turns in the well-crafted plot that will truly surprise you. The dialogue could have used a little work, particularly among the aliens - it seemed far too human - and the opening special effect shot could have been a little better. But DO NOT write this film off for those reasons! This is not a stupid sy-fy original movie or a B-grade DVD. This is a quality flick produced from a sheer passion for the material. It's just a shame that director Sandy Collora didn't have more money. I would have loved to see how his writing and direction could have blossomed under a bigger budget.
