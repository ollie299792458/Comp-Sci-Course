Animusic is just amazing to watch. The 1st time I watched this I actually felt inspired by my fellow man....I had that type of feeling from it. The technology that goes into making this, melding with the art forms of music and animation is astoundingly fun to watch and listen to. The music is excellent, the musicianship, though computer generated is dynamic and interesting. (I'm a musician and hold a little bit of a thing against stuff like drum machines vs live performances... However in this case !) The instruments have personalities all their own. Each song is performed by different sets of instruments that play flawlessly and with character. I've played my copy for dozens of people and it is always a smash and an inspiration. Being a psychotherapist, I have used this with several of my clients to jog them into working towards something when they were down and stuck. This is classic. Bye the way, the second DVD that came out a year or so later isn't as good as this 1st one in my opinion. The 1st song on the second one is great but it falls off a bit from there. This 1st one is a must have.
