I was excited to see this movie after seeing its production on the final season of Bravo's Hollywood reality show "Project Greenlight" because the director seemed talented and after watching a season of people struggling to make a movie, let's face it, you want to see what all the fuss was about.

From what I had gathered from the show, the horror concept was a tongue-in-cheek, fun-flik in the vein of Evil Dead 2 so of course I didn't expect sophisticated suspense and freight but I assumed with such a promising director, the film would at least make strides in campy horror. Well, this film ended up being beyond campy to clearly rushed and thrown together. With this movie being the director's first Hollywood film, and the rest of the staff having so many issues, it seemed like the film may have suffered, but if you're watching the movie beyond the blood and special effects you can see where something seems missing.

I saw this movie months ago and it's so forgettable I can only remember two things about it. For one, Jason Mewes (Jay from Jay & Silent Bob) has a cameo playing himself. Secondly, the movie could win an award for most unnessasary scene for the sequence where the monster has its penis cut off, which then causes it to wiggle on the ground. I expect nudity and violence in my horror films just like anyone else but does any horror fan really want to see a monster's castration scene? If anything, I guess the scene managed to do something "new" in horror films.
