As a gay teen myself, I had a bit of trouble finding an opportuniyu to watch this movie without my parents finding out.  I ended up watching it alone in my basement with sound turned low and one ear open for the door leading down the stairs.  And despite the cold hands and nerve racking tension, it was absolutely worth it.  The movie follows the life of a young gay teen Jaime who live in an apartment complex with his single mother.  His neighbor Steve (nicknamed Ste) is Jaime's romantic interest.  Ste is a victim of domestic violence from both his older brother and drunkard father.  The plot of the movie centers around the relationship that develops between Ste and Jaime, and the exploration of their sexualities.  
  The story is told with brilliant realism, and each character has a palpable feel and aura. Each character's actions are realistic and believable.  Jaime's mother very obviously cares deeply for her son, and their relationship is believable as well.  The soundtrack is superb as well; the tone and words of each song fit beautifully with each scene.  This does not mean that the movie is without flaws.  There are few confusing loose ends (Ste's involvement with drugs, Jaime's mother's boyfriend) that feel incomplete.  The British dialogue and slang can be difficult to understand, and the film as a whole may be a tad on the optimistic side.  However, a closer, more careful viewing may make some of these clear.  And the fact that I am willing to sneak another viewing of this film despite the anxiety that goes along with it should speak volumes for the film.  This movie was extremely uplifting.  When I finished it, I felt like I was walking on air.  
Bottom line: A great great romantic film.  Not to be missed.
