This is the perfect representaion of the emotions that run through a lifetime.  Larry McMurtry is quite the creative wizard, without whom there would be no basis for such a touching piece of film.  Emma has her moments  in life...those moments would make any one of us lose control.  With the  strength she finds within and that which she has acquired from her mother,  it is no wonder she can get through an adulterous hubby, a son hit with an  "I hate my mom" phase, a telephone dependant mother, a life of  constant uprooting, and cancer.  I could not fathom going through all of  that all at once.  This movie gives me hope.  This movie shows me how much  I take for grnted...how much I need not do that anymore.  Mrs. Greenway has  her own problems with Emma, aging, and her astronaut neighbor.  The chain  of events helps her, in the end, to cope with her daughter's fate.  Garret,  the neighbor, is a refreshing perk among all else that goes on in this  funny, sad, and just plain endearing tapestry.  This is a classic and  timeless story that is often used while referencing or explaining something  else.  If you haven't seen it, do so.  If you have, see it again...for each  time I watch it I learn something new...a feeling that I never knew I am  capable of feeling.
