Based on the long running and (in Hong Kong) best selling comic book of the same title, "Storm Riders" is best viewed as a comedic romp like "Dragon Tiger Gate" (likewise based on a popular HK comic book).  Pretty boy Ekin Cheng plays a happy-go-lucky Lightray (or Nightcrawler) to Aaron Kwok's a brooding, muscular Orion (or Wolverine type), while Shu Qi and Christie Cheung stand around looking good, respectively, in buckskin leather or sheer fabric, and Super-Kung Fu Sword Overlord Sonny Chiba (chewing scenery left and right) has a ball being a cross between a blow hard and an evil demigod like Darkseid or Thanos.

"Storm Riders" is utterly mindless, and occassionally silly entertainment.  Those looking for `old school' Shaw Brothers `bricks & baseball bats' gong fu action, or literary wu-xia (like "Hero", "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" or "The Night Banquet) should look elsewhere.  If one is looking for clean kung-fu fantasy entertainment for the kids, this should suffice.  It can be fun.  Just make sure you aren't expecting too much.
