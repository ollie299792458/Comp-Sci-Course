This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's got well-drawn characters with amazing subtlety.  It's got a ton of heart, humor and pathos, without flinching from realities and concerns of the people it presents.  The battle sequences big and well-choreographed, though one might complain there aren't as many explosions or splurting blood as we're used to nowadays (though I would say none of that is a substitute for this high of quality).  Though very long by most any movie standard, the pacing is perfect and never leaves you bored.  An ensemble cast elevates it further and really inhabit the characters they play, especially Toshiro Mifune who makes it a lot of fun.

The Blu-Ray transfer is very well done.  This movie has certainly never looked or sounded better. The extras are the same as in the previous 3-disc DVD release as far as I can tell; which is to say the extras are extensive and a pleasure to watch.  The cost, as with most any Criterion Collection release, might be prohibitive to some, but if you are a fan of great cinema then the quality and extras are easily worth it.
