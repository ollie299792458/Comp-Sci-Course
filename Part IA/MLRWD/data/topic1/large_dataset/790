In the Awakening, we see what a blessing it is to be alive--to be able to wake up in the morning, brush our teeth, and even comb our hair.

The patients in this movie are alive but they are not. Then they receive the gift of life, for a time. I left this movie with a deep sense of thankfulness for being a non-disabled (i.e., able) person, free to live my few years on earth without much physical impediment. As there is nothing that's holding me back (except my laziness and other sins), I owe it to myself and God to live with all my might, while I do live.

I suppose dying (as one gets older and his physical ability dies slowly long before the last breath) is somewhat like what the patients experienced in this movie. It is a cruel thing, and there is nothing noble about it.

A very moving scene: Robert De Niro, as the symptoms (tic) come back and start to gain control over body, fears what is coming and says, "This is not me!" What a misery it is when I do things that I don't want to do, but there seems to be some force (inside me) that makes me do it!
