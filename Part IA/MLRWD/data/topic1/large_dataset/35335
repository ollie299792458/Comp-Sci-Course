"Alien" is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.  From the amazing set production to the design of the alien itself, and the brilliant construction of the characters.  It is also very scary, even today!  I  can't remember any other film I have seen that has given me so many  nightmares!  It's awesome!  I am happy to say that I am a fan of the  "Alien" series, which unfortunately took a nose dive with  "Alien 3", and went even deeper into the depths with "Alien  Resurrection".  The ingenuity and brilliance is the aspect that all of  the other "Alien" films lack, including the second one.  It's  pure originality and brilliant filmmaking.  I am extremely pleased with the  20th Anniversary release of "Alien" on DVD.  Although it doesn't  have the production footage of the laserdisc box set, it has all of the  deleted scenes, trailers, artwork, and several different soundtracks of the  film, including the entire film in an early production soundtrack before a  mix was made.  My personal favorite is the design of the interactive menus  on this DVD, which lets you waltz around the rooms of the Nostromo  Spacecraft each time you make a selection.  All in all, this is an  excellent DVD, and I strongly recommend that you add it to your collection!
