Watching this series is truly a commitment of time and patience but it does pay off. In the honored tradition of BBC productions of the era, the sets are somewhat flimsy (walls shake when doors are slammed shut - you could make it a drinking game in some episodes). The costumes are well done but not entirely period correct - you know, the late 60s/early 70s hair along with a slight spin on the costumes (think more SF Opera one piece costumes rather than Dickens Faire period correct costumes). In early episodes - some of the actors seem to be rushing lines and it can be hard to pick up what they are saying - and there are no subtitles available for the hearing impaired.

But the rewards are great - you see the development of complex characters, you see Soames as truly unlikable at first and then changing as he grows older and learns from his life. You also see some of the actors improving their acting skills - and you get a rich story that is very true to the original story written by John Galsworthy. It's far more complex and engaging than the 2002-2003 miniseries - with some fantastic double entendres that are just left out of the new series entirely (in favor of batting people over the head with overt sexuality). Quite a masterpiece, indeed - add all to your queue and settle in for a rich and well executed production.
