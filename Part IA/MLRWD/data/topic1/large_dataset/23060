There are some who say that fans of Simon Templar should not see this film, but I say that Templar fans should make up their own minds. Some detractors accuse this Saint of being unrealistic and "corny", but fans of The Saint who dislike fictional escapism and "corny" entertainment should really find a new hero. There has always been a great deal of escapism and "corn" in The Saint canon, films, radio shows, comics, and TV shows. This Saint is certainly no worse, and in many ways is far superior, to other later day Saints like Ian Ogilvy or Simon Dutton. They each had their strong points, but Val Kilmer's Templar is by far a more intriguing character. I have very little knowledge of Val Kilmer's other work, but he's engaging and entertaining in this role. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is that the origin of the character is revealed for the first time. Some have said this only takes place at the start of the film, but in reality the entire film IS the origin. It includes Simon's journey from criminal to Saint. His transformation, and three "miracles", kept me hooked from start to finish.  All Simon Templar fans should give this one another look. This Saint is a damn good picture worth seeing.
