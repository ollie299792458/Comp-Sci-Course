Oh my.  I never thought I could say this, but I just watched the best movie I think I have ever seen.  Kathy Bates was absolutely the best actress that could have been casted for this role.  I have never been a big fan of Bates, but my opinion has been renewed now that I have seen her performance as Dolores Claiborne.  Jennifer James is astounding as the supporting actress.  This is definately not a feel good movie, I was on the edge of my seat and completely disguisted at some scenes, but that tells me that the actors in this movie are profound.  For a two-hour movie, I don't think I looked away once, aside from the scene with the abusive dad and the little girl on the ferry I could not stomach that.  Kathy Bates is convincing in 100% of her scenes, she does not skip a beat. Not one.  I agree with all the other reviewers, this movie should have recieved multiple Oscars- Best Music Score, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Motion Picture for 1995.  Stephen King brought the magnificant colors, and the movie makers painted a beauitful portryel of Dolores Claiborne.
