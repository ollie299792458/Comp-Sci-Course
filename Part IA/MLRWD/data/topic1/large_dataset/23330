William Powell and Myrna Loy made 14 movies together, 6 of which were Thin Man movies as Nick and Nora Charles. This set is 5 of their other films.
1. Manhattan Melodrama- With Clark Gable as a childhood friend of Powell who is a criminal now. This is the movie John Dillinger saw shortly before he was gunned down. 4.5 Stars
2. Evelyn Prentice- A drama and the least of their efforts on this set. Still anything with Powell and Loy is worth watching- 3.5 Stars
3. Double Wedding- Fine Comedy with Powell as a beatnik artist and a Loy as a conservative businesswoman. Powell is slated to marry Loy's sister but we know that isn't going to happen.- 5 Stars
4. I Love You Again- GREAT comedy with Powell as a former con man with amnesia and Loy as his unhappy wife. Funny and clever and one of the alltime best screwball comedies. 5 Stars is an understatement.
5. Love Crazy- Another fine comedy with Powell being a little more silly and less sophisticated than usual. 4.5 Stars.

The chemistry is there in every frame as their talents just seemed to complement each other and fit the situation. They were both great in their own movies but it was certainly special when theyteamed up. A 5 Star set.
