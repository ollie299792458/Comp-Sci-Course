Greetings fellow amazonians I bought this because spaceballs was my favorite movie growing up and working as a carney you don't get much free time except late at night so I felt these other movies would make a great addition to my collection. Mongo, who works at the funhouse, wanted to see them too. He had never seen mel brooks before and wanted to see why I was so excited.

First we watched spaceballs which was funnier then I remembered with barf and pizza the hut. Then it was onto blazing saddles which started out ok, but when mongo saw the character "mongo" he started to get upset. He couldn't believe that his mother would have named him after that guy. I told him that the actor may have been his real father, he never met him, so it could be a family name. He really didn't like that! He jumped up on my couch and started ramming me with his spiderman helmet. I finally had to ducktape him to a chair to calm him down, but that didn't work either he broke the chair, picked up my blu ray player and threw it out the window. Finally, I saw him run threw the night with an aluminium baseball bat beating my blu ray player through out the fairgrounds. Thanks amazon for making me insult my best friend and have him destroy my trailer.
