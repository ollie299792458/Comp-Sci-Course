I'm a big fan of Bruckheimer's films. When I saw the trailer for GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, Bruckhiemer's remake of the 60's classic, I was thrilled. So when June 9th rolled around and the new Bruckheimer flick hit theaters, I was there, and I loved every minute of it! The movie has a simplistic but addicting plot: Memphis Raines (Nicholas Cage) is a retired car thief who is trying to stay away from his old life of crime. His little brother Kip (Giovnni Ribisi), however, has grown up to be just like his hero, Memphis.  Kip decides to to get involved with a dangerous boost, in which he must steal 50 top-of-the line cars. When Kip gets into trouble, his boss kidnaps him and finds Memphis. Memphis has two choices: Steal all 50 cars in 48 hours, or watch his brother die.
Memphis takes the Boost. 
He assembles his old team: Otto (Robert Duvall), and expert on stripping down cars, Donny (Chi McBride), an old timer car thief, The Sphinx (Vinnie Jones), a rough and tough friend of memphis, and Switch (Angelina Jolie), Memphis's old girlfriend. After careful planning, Memphis and his friends start what could become the most impressive car boost ever.
The rest of the movie if packed with intense police chases, ear-shattering explosions, and oh so many beautiful cars! As with any Bruckheimer film, the viewer leaves the movie with a feeling of adrenaline, and Gone in Sixty Seconds is no exception.
The perfect mix of action, acting, music, and effects make this movie one to own. If your looking for a feel good movie with lots of eye candy, you've need look no further. Gone In Sixty Seconds is your movie.
