I disagree with the description of "hokum" (in the product description) as this film portrays the period it is set in better than any film during those glory days of Hollywood.  The story of course is fiction, but such ironic historical events happened in ancient and medieval times.  Lost heirs to thrones, bastard children of royalty and many other situations were not unusual.  Europe reached a point with respect to royalty where many of the royal families of different nations were related.  By the time of World War I the Czar of Russia and the King of England (who were related) looked like twins.  This movie is good historical fiction and portrays the culture of the place, time and ethnic groups (Vikings and English) better than any movie made up to its time and as good as any made since.  For that reason I used it many years ago in medieval history classes that I taught.  The amount of Viking cultural elements brought into this movie, as well as the accurate images of buildings, towns, costumes, ships, etc. make this movie a "gem".  It also makes an effort to not be extravagant with costumes and buildings in the Hollywood way.  So if some artifact in the film is elegant looking (such as Kirk Douglas' eye-covering Viking helmet), it's probably accurate.  That helmet is. If memory serves me correctly, I believe there is a scenario involving some European kingdom that is actually very similar to this movie plot.  If I am correct, perhaps it was known to the writers of this movie.  Keep in mind that even Shakespeare's Macbeth was based on a true murder story and struggle for a throne.  I've always felt, as a history student and teacher, that this movie (The Vikings) and The Warlord with Charlton Heston & Richard Boone were the two best film portrayals of medieval times from earlier Hollywood years.  I also believe the two films can stand toe-to-toe with movies made since.  Amazon has the Warlord available also.
