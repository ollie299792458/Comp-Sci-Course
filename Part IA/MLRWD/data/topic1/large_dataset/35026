This  movie has so much violence and shock value, it is almost like you are watching some documetary on some true loony. And this guy is as loony as they come. What he said didn't make sense, but I guess that just shows how loony he is. The death scenes are great, and the misogynist factor isn't as much as you would think. You think this is misogynist, you should see Last House On the Left. I haven't seen I spit on your grave, it just looked like a cheap rip off to me.  Anyway, i reccommend this movie to any horror fan.  Light on suspense and "jump up and spill popcorn everywhere" scares, but heavy on shock and extreme violence, this movie is one of the many great movies to come out of the "golden age" of horror films.

You see, I wasn't around during this time, but luckily for me, Anchor Bay has done an excellent job restoring this, and many other old horror movies(the best horror movies if you ask me, these new ones coming out are dumb and laughable, if you've seen Saw you know what I mean), on DVD. I won't ever be able to watch them on the big screen, but I can watch them(and their great extras) on my big screen TV. Being born in 88 sucks(except that Chucky and I have the same birthday, YES!!!)
