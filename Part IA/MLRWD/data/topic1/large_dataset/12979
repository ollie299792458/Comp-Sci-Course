I absolutely hate to deduct a star from this movie.  It's my favorite play, but therein lies the problem.  Williams and Kazan were forced to alter much of the dialog, and more specifically, the ending of this movie to fit censorship standards.  As happy as it makes me feel to see Stella not go back to Stanley in the end, I know that's not the way it's meant to be.  Neither is Mitch supposed to stand up for Blanche at the end.  This is a great movie.  The acting (specifically on Leigh and Brando's end) is superb.  The cinematography and general direction is beautiful.  It deserves all of it's awards, and it's reputation.  It's the standard by which I judge all other Blanche and Stanley's by, but I simply cannot overlook the horrible injustice that was done in editing the story to fit someone's arbitrary moral standings.  The fact that this movie will forever be compromised is one of the greatest tragedies in American cinema.  It's just awful, and if I loved the story any less I would give it a 1 star rating just to register my disgust.
