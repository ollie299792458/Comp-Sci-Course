Battle Royale. This movie was a huge let down. The effects were not adequate. The actors were not believable and the story line was lacking in detail and substance. Great idea, however it was not portrayed well. And I just didn't understand why everything had to evolve around love? It was a bit silly. Some scenes were simply too exaggerated, long and dull. This movie lacked in direction. There were simply too many flaws in the plot. For one, if a person were to be in a situation like that they'd work together as a team and defeat the villains. One particular group of students happened to find a loophole in the hunger game for survival, however happened to die by the hand of another stright after. Also I understand the director was attempting to portray the theme of "desperate times call for desperate measures," and that even friends would turn on each other, but it was not executed well. The idea could have made this movie a masterpiece, but the soundtrack, the actors, the camera shots and effects dragged the picture down to the bottom of the ocean.
