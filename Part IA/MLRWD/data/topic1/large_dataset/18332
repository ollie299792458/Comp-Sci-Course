After having read all other reviews and just watching this wonderful movie again, I want to write about my opinion on this film.
First of all why is the length of the movie such a big deal? I just don't get it. Movies from the nineties and after are usually at least 135 minutes long, so 153 minutes is only 18 minutes longer. Not much of a difference.
Then there is the great soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann who made the score for 8 Hitchcock movies and for "Cape Fear".
I also believe that Tom Rath is not only haunted by his war time memories, but that he sometimes thinks that Maria, his love in Italy, probably would have made a better wife, because she was giving and caring, but Tom's wife Betsy is not giving at all and expects too much from Tom (instead of getting a job and contribute to their life style of which she is so unsatisfied).
This is an excellent film from the fifties, at least as good (if not better) as "Strangers when we met", "Peyton Place", "A Summer Place", "All that Heaven allows", "Susan Slade" and "Imitation of Life".
Watch the film first, then read the book by Sloan Wilson (who also wrote "A Summer Place", another wonderful novel). You won't be disappointed.

Gregory Peck made some unforgettable movies like "To kill a mockingbird", "Roman Holiday", "Twelve O'Clock High", "Gentleman's Agreement", "Cape Fear", "Mirage" (finally available on DVD) and "The Bravados" (his best western), but "The Man in the gray Flannel Suit" will always be my # 1 Gregory Peck movie.
