I find it odd that this movie garnered such medicore praise. It was far more original and entertaining than many other fantasy film attempts out there, the bland/boring Eregon and the sad maiming of The Dark Is Rising novel for film come instantly to mind. I found Inkheart on the same level as the better films in the genre, good companions for the filmed versions of Narnia, Harry Potter, and Funke's other excellent novel-to-screen adaptation, The Thief Lord. Inkheart balances drama with comedy in much the same vein as classics like Time Bandits and The Princess Bride, and its nice to see Urban Fantasy onscreen as we did in Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 2. Some critics complained about the literary aspects of the story being overbearing, but I see this as an attempt to pander to faux-hip technology by those not wanting to seem so un-trendy as to have ever loved books. Some of these same critics went on about kids reading books with Harry Potter novels being no big deal as well. Maybe they think people are better served texting or twittering mindless drivel all day long on their Blackberries. Whatever. Ignore the critics and read. And see Inkheart.
