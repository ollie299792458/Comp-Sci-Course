The Transporter is very entertaining, because of an explosive mix both on and off-screen.  Off-screen, French directing teams (some from Ronin) created awesome cinematography and driving scenes, mixed with Yuen-driven (the credited director) hand-to-hand action scenes, all mixed with--of course--Jason Statham's fighting prowess.
On-screen, Statham has a rare combination of actual acting and physical prowess.  Shu Qi is beautiful, and her character has more going on than just to be saved by Statham (some viewers apparently missed this).  There is also an apparently well-known French actor who works as a semi-friendly inspector, and he does a great job.
Problems with the movie are predictable for something so action-oriented: plot holes, some impossible stunts.  It also has some unique problems, which add to the movies's charms: such as French criminals high and low speak American English (?), Statham tries to do the same (and gives up halfway, like Costner in Robin Hood but reversed), and Shu Qi and the French inspector are at times unintelligible.
But at a basic level, the movie is all about Statham kicking ass, about Shu Qi looking beautiful, and lots of explosions over a sunny European seaside setting.  It all comes together nicely (if often absurdly), and is highly recommended to those who need a truly nonstop action title to round out their collections.
