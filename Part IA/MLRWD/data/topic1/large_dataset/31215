This movie is a period piece, it is medieval France, and a gorgeous young lawyer, Richard Courtois leaves Paris for the simpler life in a country town. Soon he must decide on defending a pig, owned by a mysterious woman Samira, the pig has been arrested for the murder of a young boy. Animals were tried in courts back in those days, though it sounds comical and has comic areas it is drama and has nudity hence the R rating.  It is a very interesting and enjoyable story, I highly recommend this to all my adult friends.
