I've always been a fan of the Mad Max movies, but never got to see "The Road Warrior" until I found this DVD. It was only $9.99 at Kmart, and I figured, "2 movies on 1 DVD for 10 bucks, including the one MAD MAX movie I've never seen, sounds great!" So I bought it, watched it, and loved it!
Alot of people are complaining about the DVDs Full Screen aspect ratio, lack of special features, and poor picture quality... I have to say, I don't know what everyone's talking about... I can't stand Wide Screen (16:9) format, looks like you're squinting all the time! I'll admit, "The Road Warrior" didn't have many special features, but "Beyond Thunder Dome" had plenty. As for the DVDs picture quality, it looks fine. Although "Road Warrior" looked a little fuzzy, it was definitely better than anything I've ever taped off of TV.
I don't regret buying this DVD, and I'm happy with it.
I got 2 great movies on 1 disc for cheap, so I've got nothing to complain about.

If you're like me, and just want to watch MAD MAX 2 & 3 at home on your DVD player, then buy this DVD.
If you're a cinema junky who's obcessed with dual aspect ratios and loads of special features, then you're better off buying each movie separately.
