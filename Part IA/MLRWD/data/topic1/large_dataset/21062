USA Today gave this DVD Four stars!  Here's the review:

2004 World Series DVD

* * * * (Four Stars), 2004, MLB Productions, unrated, $20

Or, The David Ortiz Show.

Back story: As a die-hard Yankees fan who wore pinstriped diapers, I approached this 93-minute overview the way I would a full retrospective of feature comedies starring Saturday Night Live alumni. But it's easy to share the jubilance of the DVD's warm celebratory tone and to praise a Boston postseason assemblage that begins doing everything right by having Red Sox fan Denis Leary narrate. Ortiz's hitting, pitcher Curt Schilling's queasy ankle heroics and the soul of a city lick this story's built-in dramatic problem: four straight wins over the Yankees in the American League Championship Series after being down 3-0 - then four more straight over the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series.

Extras, extras: Terry Francona's introduction as new BoSox manager; final at-bats in the playoffs and World Series; post-Series boogie.
