The 1933 Alice in Wonderland is a weird example of early sound cinema and one of the first attempts to capture fantasy.  Unfortunately, the film was received so badly by audiences that it killed the genre until Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 and The Wizard of Oz in 1939 revitalized it until WWII killed it again.  Lewis Carroll's satirical story of Victorian manners has never been definitely captured on film, mostly, I think, due to its highly symbolic imagery and chaotic spirit.  Some stories, like Twain's Huck Finn, and Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby, just work better on paper.  I think the other problem with Alice is that the story and characters are too aloof to get the audience involved.  Unlike the Wizard of Oz, there is practically no emotional center to the story.  We know very little of Alice and the episodic and nonsensical nature of the story just reinforces its superficiality, which is death nell for effective film fantasy.  Disney was able to solve this problem with another episodic and rather cold story, Mary Poppins, by seriously reworking it to make it the joyous moving fantasy movie classic it turned out to be.  The other problem with Alice is the horrendous decision to cover the stars faces with masks, whereby obliterating the stars' personas.  MGM learned from this error in judgement and made sure the human characters could be seen through the make-up in the WIzard of Oz.
