Anyone who says they like this movie for the social comments or cultural conflicts will tell you that they buy Playboy for the articles.

This movie takes place in the Amazon jungles.  It involves a tribe of mostly naked "Indian" women.  These are not giant Amazon beauties.  These are petite, but very cute women.  It is unrealistic.  Native women running nude in the jungle, wearing only paint, do not look that good...so, invitingly smooth and tight.  These are not indiginous or native women.  These are actresses who have appeared in other movies.

Other than that, this is a pretty good movie.  The jungle scenes are gorgeous.  These scenes, along with nubian little bodies really transport you to another world...a world of wet dreams.

There is also a very good action story here, with the hero searching for his lost son.  There are cannibals and destruction of the rain forest.

But, don't believe that garbage about this being a study of different cultures, of civilization meeting native Americans.  It is just a very good action story, with some sex thrown in, using the destruction of the rain forest as a backdrop.  It is very mesmerizing and involving.  But, it is not very realistic.

The only real problem I have with the movie is that there are some contrived plot twists that you could see were coming.  For instance, one character is conveniently killed off as an easy way out of one of the complicated plot lines.  It's been done to death on Bananza and other TV series.  I think it would have been better to allow this character to live and see how the hero would deal with the situation.
