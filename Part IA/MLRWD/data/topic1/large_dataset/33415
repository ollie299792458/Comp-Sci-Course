Fans of the French piece "Tous les Matins du Monde" (Alain Corneau, 1991) will enjoy this creation of French-Canadian Director Francois Girard, whose prior forays into film include documentaries  involving Bach Cello suites and television specials starring cellist Yo-Yo  Ma. It's no wonder then that Girard was able to capture the sheer majesty  and fascination of the violin; in this film we follow this captivation  through the centuries. Samuel L. Jackson plays Charles Morritz, an expert  in antique musical instruments. The story opens with Morritz' arrival at an  auction, where a very significant and unique Bussotti violin is being sold.  As the film flashbacks throughout periods of time in the violin's history,  we visit its making in Cremona, Italy, its burial in the hands of a young  Austrian prodigy, the musical career of a Victorian virtuoso, and its  banishment from Revolutionist China. As Morritz studies the famous  instrument, he unearths deep secrets about its origin, and must face the  ultimate dilemma himself: "What do you do when the thing you most  wanted, so perfect, just comes?"
The music, composed by John  Corigliano, won the 1999 Academy Award for Best Score. Violinist Joshua  Bell (who also starred in the 1999 film Music of the Heart, playing  himself) provides the music of the Red Violin, and was able to capture the  different centuries as if he had played in them himself. The part of the  Austrian music teacher Georges Poussin, played by Jean-Luc Bideau, is  especially delightful in its comedic undertones; also not to be missed is  the tarot card reader who is setting up the story; her role ties the film  together and gives it the continuity needed in this kind of format. Overall  it is a very engaging film full of passion, music, and history.
