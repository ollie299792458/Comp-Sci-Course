It is great to watch a young and buff Richard Gere evolve from a self-serving bad boy to a caring and involved friend.  I absolutely love the scene where Zach helps Segar walk the wall of the obstacle course, including watching the guys go wild with happiness over their triumph.

Debra Winger is a good actress, and you have to hand it to both Gere and Winger that they could pull this movie off when their lack of rapport was legendary.  To be fair to Gere, Winger (at least at that time) was known as a habitual problem child on the set of this and other movies.  I believe shortly after filming AOAAG she went into rehab.

I enjoy this movie for a lot of reasons, but I would hate for young girls to watch this and think that the young women (Paula and Lynette) could be so easy and still get the guys in the end.  If Paula had had more self-esteem, she would not have allowed Zach to "kiss it all better" after behaving so badly toward her in the hotel room.

Easy girls may get the guy for the short haul, but the Paulas and Lynettes are unlikely to form quality, lasting relationships with men that truly respect and value them.

That said, we generally watch movies to escape and to be entertained, and overall this is a compelling, well-acted movie that I still watch from time to time.
