I love Weeds alot, and as I'm from the UK I am not able to watch it when it airs. :(  Season 1 - 4 were all 5 Star quality. Season 5 was okay i guess, saved by the fantastic finale.

Shane has just killed Pilar and Nancy does what comes naturally to her, and runs.

The best thing about this season is that the family (and Doug) comes to terms with there actions over the last five years.

Shane is a little scary and untill like the 7th episode he is portrayed as a evil, but misguided child. Nancy has always dragged her family through the mud, but she makes up for it in this season when she hands herself in.

Silas is the one character however that i followed the most, he was never the character i liked the most in previous seasons but he is the innocent soul trapped in a prison. I was gutted that he didn't have he's happy ending, but at least we get him back fro the next season.

The first 5/6 episodes were fantastic, the series dipped a little towards the middle but teh finale was amazing.

Great Show, Great Season.

Bring On Season 7
