I for one am shocked my parents let me get all the way to college before I saw this film. It is so good and so fun on so many levels that it should be with us as long as the technology exists to preserve it. There's a war going on; there's deceit; there's nationalistic flag-waving; there's heroism; and in the midst of all this, there's a love story. If ever there was a "chick flick for guys," this is it. In addition to the war and romance, there is also sharp, sly dialogue that still amuses nearly 60 years later. Throw in some of the best talents of 1940s Hollywood and you've got that marvelous clich&eacute;, the "classic." If World War II were to somehow disappear from the history books, yet "Casablanca" remained behind, an audience could still watch, understand, and appreciate it.
Who would like it? Good Lord, who wouldn't? Maybe a few Nazis; perhaps the Arab Anti-Defamation League; and the humor does occasionally angle toward the masculine viewpoint. But even so, the famously "tough" Humphrey Bogart gets to be war hero and sensitive romantic lead all in one.
This is the way Hollywood movies should be (and all too often are not) made.
