Before I say anything I want you to read this before you read the other negative comments about this movie. Despite the reviews of the bad plot and blah, blah, blah horrible and judgemental reviews from the magazines..  This movie is one of my Top 5 movies of all time. Finally a mystery movie that I cannot predict what's going to happen next. No bad acting in this movie and the plot and the story are perfect the way they are.. If people were bored while they were watching this movie, then maybe they need help, because this movie is anything but boring. The way the number 23 shows up in various criminal names, bombing dates and even the characters birthday and time. Carrey plays a man that becomes obsess with the number 23 and finds out when he reads the book that it sounds like the author is talking about him and maybe the book was meant to find him. The wife thinks he's crazy, having read the book herself, she thinks it's just another book that leaves an impact on a person. However, his 13 yearold son believes what his father is saying.. Overall, the only thing I would change is to have more information on how to get the number 23 from names, dates, and words. There is many twist and turns in this movie and the story presented by Mr. Fingerling in the book is amazing and the characters are classic and realistic like the conniving people populating the world today. Buy this movie, it is worth every penny.
