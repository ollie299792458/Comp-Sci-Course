But besides, or despite, the music, the film made me sob at the end. Not so much because of the events on the film, but because of the events of our currently-as-ever devolving culture. The establishment have definitely won the 60s. I live it everyday. It occurred in about 1970, or maybe even in 1968 with Nixon jumping on the band wagon for peace (hypocritically, of course). But definitely by the time this film came out in '79. Rolling Stone magazine does it every time they give a negative review for somebody being too idealistic. I agree with the Tao te ching on this one: If it wasn't laughed at, it wouldn't be reality. Likewise, with the idealism of the hippies. Where are they now? Where have they been, and what the heck are we doing in Iraq twenty or thirty years later?!!!!!!! Wise-up people, and don't let the churches and think-tanks fool you. They're out to maneuver you for their own gain -- end of story. Let the Sunshine In and DANCE.

The message of the film: If you can enjoy yourself in the world, why aren't you doing it NOW? If you're too hard-up for pleasure, this film might help you begin.
