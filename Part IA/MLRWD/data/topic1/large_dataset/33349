I loved MIB, but I avoided MIBII because of the bad reviews. I finally saw it on cable tonight. Bleah! I knew it wasn't going to be great, but I didn't think it could possibly be as dull as it ended up being. There were a few good lines and some semi-interesting special effects, but good SFX are a dime a dozen these days. Otherwise... 
Tommy Lee Jones sleepwalked through this one. Will Smith I usually like, but he's turned into a one-note actor. The chick who played the pizza girl had no function in the movie besides providing a temporary love interest for Agent J and a ridiculous heartbreak for both J and K at the end; she pretty much got toted around by the other characters. The script is creatively bankrupt; it's a terribly short movie (about an hour and a half), yet feels padded with useless moments and unnecessary characters. The story (what there was of it) could have been told in one of the half-hour episodes of the MIB cartoon. The action had an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink feel of sheer desperation. One can imagine the "creative" minds behind this turkey saying, "Ooh, let's flush the agents down a big toilet! Ooh, let's show Michael Jackson as an alien!" (now there's a stretch) "Ooh, won't Tommy Lee Jones look funny in a mailman outfit?" Ho ho, hee hee.
MIB II is like a tossed salad made of everything in your fridge. Every so often you bite into a tasty bit, but the rest is just one big odd-smelling, unpalatable mess.
