I won't go into a lengthy synopsis since others have done so, but I was very VERY pleasantly surprised at just how well put together and endearing this animated romp was. Particularly since I was terribly disappointed in Despicable Me and couldn't make it past 20 minutes in of Desp Me.

Much like The Incredibles it 'stars' a superhero (actually supervillain) and gives his history over the years, followed by a sequence of events which turns the tables on the situation. It even has a nerdy guy transformed into a superpowered villain to battle our protagonist ala Incredibles.

Not since The Incredibles has a movie found the right mix of hilarity coupled with exciting action  which has you wondering "how is this thing gonna turn out?".
I found myself really caring about the characters and this has certainly never been true with a Dreamworks animated feature before.

Great Flic!!

The 'Button of Doom' feature is a 15 minute short on a separate DVD. Chronologically it takes place just after the end of the full feature. If you are like me and want more Megamind it's worth the extra sheckels. The quality of the production is identical to the 'big feature' and is just as funny and exciting.
