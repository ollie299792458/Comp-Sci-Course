I was young when this television series came out. I loved the show than and still do. For those who don't know, the first four seasons are in black-and-white, the last in color. The DVD displays in the classic format, it is not widescreen but it still plays well on a flat screen HD TV. The other major thing is that the order of episodes this box set is setup follow the order that they were syndicated in, not in how they actually appeared. This is important because if you do not know this, the sequence of when things happen does not always make sense, characters will appear and disappear out of sequence. To get the order that they actually appeared, go to IMDB and search for the Combat series and look at the episode listing. This will require you to jump around within the season's DVDs but I feel it is worth it. We have only started with Season 1 so I can't tell if this is also for the other seasons. It is also obvious at the end of each episode the trademark year will appear. Also like other reviews have said, initially the discs seem hard to get out from other CDs or DVDs. I have found that by pulling up on the side a little and pushing firmly in the middle button, they will pop out. Enjoy. My son is watching these with me again and is enjoying them as much as I did.
