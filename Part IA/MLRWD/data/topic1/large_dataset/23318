"East of Eden" is a wonderful adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel. Elia Kazan directs a visually and emotionally moving piece of cinema with the help of performances from James Dean, Julie Harris, Jo Van Fleet, and Raymond Massey.

The extra features on the second disc are wonderful, including a long deleted scene with the brothers Kal (James Dean) and A-aron (Richard Davalos) talking together in their bedroom. I've read in biographies of Dean that the scene had to be deleted b/c for some reason it was illicitly homosexual in nature with the two of them wrestling on the ground with Dean shirtless.

The other features include a well written documentary on "East of Eden" with interviews from Elia Kazan, Julie Harris, film historians, and Steinbeck's own son. Color wardrobe tests with all principle members of the cast and a long vintage documentary "Forever James Dean" with loads of scenes and history about Dean make this a cherished DVD for any Dean or Steinbeck fan.
