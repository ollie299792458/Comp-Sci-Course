The Missouri Breaks is a film that teeter-totters between being an excellent example of the gritty and realistic western genre and a film that appears to be reaching, ultimately failing, to achieve greatness.

Much in the same vein as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, the Missouri Breaks does an excellent job of portraying the day to day hard bitten, dust eating. the interplay between Jack Nicholson and his band of truly unforgettable fellow horse thieves, as they attempt to scratch out some time of living is the high point of this film.

I seriously wonder if Marlon Brandon wasn't suffering an emotional breakdown during the filming of this movie..his character, the sadistic "regulator", appears to be bouncing between many different roles...it is as though brando couldn't agree with himself as to how to play this character. If you are going to disguise yourself as a woman, why do it in the dead of night when no one can see you?... colonel kurtz and the regulator!

the music is very disappointing, appearing to emulate ennio morricone's "spaghetti western" themes (a fistful of dynamite, my name is nobody, ect..) but failing... the composer couldn't decide if this was a comedy or a serious movie.

still and all, an excellent film.
