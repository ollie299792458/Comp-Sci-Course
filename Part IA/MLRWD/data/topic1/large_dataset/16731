Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence is so many things: witty, subtle, satirical, and tongue-in-cheek melodramatic, not to mention populated by deceptively complex characters. Martin Scorcese's adaption, unfortunately, is none of these.

A fan of both classic literature and costume dramas, I understand that there are always necessary changes that must be made when converting a book to film. However, when the entire tone and purpose of a work is changed, I have to object. Wharton's somewhat affectionate fun-poking at her New York society is completely drowned out by weepy music and over-the-top romance. Not even her own writing can save this movie, as evidenced by the stiff and misguided narration, which takes its passages directly from the book.

All in all, although beautiful, this adaptation is lazy and inconsistent.  The acting goes from extremely dramatic to completely flat, and I'm not convinced that anyone involved with this film really "got" Wharton's novel. After viewing it, I was baffled by the discrepencies between the glowing reviews and what I had just watched.

If you enjoyed the movie, but have not read the book, then I highly recommend it. The Age of Innocence is a wonderful American novel, and the story is told in a much more playful voice with more richly developed characters.
