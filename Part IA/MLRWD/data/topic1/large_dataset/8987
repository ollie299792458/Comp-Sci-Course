The Burrowers belongs to a new style of movies in the horror genre, a combination of monster thrills and old wild-west action westerns. As such, it represents a curiosity worth exploring by any fans of horror.

What I found particularly interesting, aside from the concept of slimy creepy crawlers, is the honesty and innocence with which the characters greeted their fate  - an utter acceptance of the possibility of death, which is in sharp contrast with the sanctity of life characteristic of the modern day horror films.

The movie begins with a grizzly action scene - murder of a family in a little house on the prairies of Dakota.  The scenes curiously resemble the hide and seek qualities we've seen in `The Village' and the mysterious peasant deaths in The Brotherhood of the Wolf. And as the family is destroyed, the viewers adventure begin. We suddenly embark on a trip with the group of cowboys whose task is to find a survivor to this violent incident. And the deeper the group advances into the Indian territories, the more they face attacks by unknown and unseen monsters.

Soon the mystery begins to untangle as the of main character, a brave Irishman, begins to put the pieces together. This act of boldness is the first venture into the possibility of the impossible - imagining that their troubles are caused not by viscous Indians, but by something supernatural and a lot more dangerous.

As one by one the characters meet their fates, the viewers are drawn deeper into the dark mind of the movie creator where fear, death and feeding converge.

At the end of the movie one is left with a sense of outrage at the primitive mindset of the men in charge. We glimpse the rage and weakness of all immigrant in a land where rules are either scarce or nonexistent.

High grade for the acting, concept and representation. Movies in similar fashion:

) The Village
) Brotherhood of the Wolf
) Predator
) Wild Wild West
