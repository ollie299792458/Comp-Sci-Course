I really love this movie. In my opinion, it's the second best horror film ever made (closely following Stanley Kubrick's brilliant 'The Shining'), but there is one thing I simply cannot understand.

Not only do several of the customer reviews give away the ending of this film, but the official Amazon.com review does as well. I'm not going to say what these reviews give away, because I don't want to add to the problem, but trust me, much more is revealed than should be. Some famous person once said that you should go into this story (and any Ira Levin story) knowing as little as possible about it. I can attest to this. When I first saw this movie, all I knew about it was that it was a horror film by Roman Polanski, and I'm glad of it. By the end, I was as freaked out and paranoied as the heroine, much more than I would have been had I known the the plot twist that occurs, literally, in the last scene of the film, but which the Amazon official people seem to think necessary information prior to viewing. Anyway, my advice is this: if you haven't seen this movie, read nothing else on this page. Go and rent the movie. It's fantastic, you'll enjoy it. And Amazon: please take down that review. You're ruining a classic film for thousands of movie watchers.
