I accidentally stumbled upon "30 Rock" a couple of weeks ago when NBC was airing the episode "The Head and the Hair" and I was not only laughing out loud (literally)--I was genuinely charmed by this show.

Tina Fey (creator, writer, producer) stars as head writer Liz Lemon for an SNL-like skit show, "The Girly Show." All seems well until a new head honcho (played fantastically by Alec Baldwin) comes into control and demands that she hires a Bobby Brown-meets-Martin Lawrence star (the hilarious Tracy Morgan). This causes all hell to break loose and the series inevitably centers around Liz trying to find balance between these crazy men, her career, and maybe a love life--to most usually disastrous results.

The thing about "30 Rock" is that you must hang in there--for while it is funny from the beginning, it really starts picking up and building steam within the 3rd or 4th episode. You can see the actors really meshing and the chemistry is sensational. Fey does a great job being the centered yet often out of control Liz, leaving a very pleasant and hilarious impression.

I find this show to be a truly modern "Mary Tyler Moore." Like Moore, Liz wants the career and relationship but struggles to get it right. She also has a similar dynamic as Mary had with Lou Grant with her boss Jack.

With this show and "The Office," NBC is beginning to reformulate today's sitcom. No more laugh-track, but a lot more laughs.

And "30 Rock" received 10 Emmy nods--not too shabby!

So please...watch this show! It is brilliant, smart, wacky, sweet, and undeniably funny. Keep good shows like this on the air!
