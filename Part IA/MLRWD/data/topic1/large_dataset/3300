Just coming off reading the essentialy Orwell (1984 and Animal Farm), I decided I could finally check out the film without any guilt of not having read the book already.
I have to admit, I was disapointed in alot of ways, and not just in the "it can't match the book sense".  First off, I was glad that the person I was watching with, and myself had both read the book in the not too distant past, or both of us would of probably been at a great loss on a number of subjects.  Many details, and elements of the 1984 world, while shown, are not adaquately explained, and would just serve to confuse the viewer more.  Elements such as the background history of the world, the thought police, newspeak, the Ministry's, the characters and their thoughts on each other, are all only touched on by minor scenes, if at all.
  In all frankness, the movie probably needed to be twice the length, with alot of narration to explain the world.  The movie often felt rushed, and the scenes at points butchered and the storyline brought to its most skeletal elements.  How they felt they would be able to bring the true horror and suspense of 1984 without Winston's thoughts, I can't fathom.
  Hopefully this will be made again, and it will get a proper full length that the classic novel deserves.  With age of fashionable radicalism in a political era thats garnered more than a few comparisions to Orwell's "Big Brother", its amazing that the time hasn't been taken to give this classic its proper film due.
