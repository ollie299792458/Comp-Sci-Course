Enjoying Boondock Saints 2 is all about going into the movie with the right mindset.  If you go into your viewing of Boondock Saints 2 expecting a movie you'll be seeing at the Oscars, you may come out disappointed.  If you go into your viewing just looking to be entertained for two hours, you'll come out happy.

BDS2's biggest bane is that it features some really poor acting out of a few characters.  I love Julie Benz in Dexter, but her "southern accent" in this movie is just horrible, and her portrayal as a hardened female FBI agent is just corny.  Fortunately, both the accent and the "she-woman hear me roar" stuff kind of disappears as the movie goes on.

Like the first film, the brothers steal the show here.  Rocco is replaced by another similar character who provides some good comedic relief, but the brothers themselves are HILARIOUS, and at the same time total badasses and the most convincing actors of the bunch.

Like the first film, a semi-serious plot is kept light hearted via some over the top shootouts and a great mix of humor.  There is a ton of fan service in this movie if you liked the first one.  The finish is pretty good, though nowhere near the level of pure epicness of the courthouse scene from the first movie.

Simply put, it's not as good as the first one, but it's still a very fun two hours if you don't take it too seriously.
