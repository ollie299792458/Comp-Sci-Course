If one is a lover of 1960s-70 movie fare then GET CARTER must be a stand out and as has been often stated very reminiscent of John Boormans POINT BLANK made several years earlier and starring another great one off talent namely Lee Marvin.Get Carter was in my opinion, Caines greatest and most believable role as Point Blank was Marvins and both movies were excellent vehicles for both actors to show off their prodigous talent.Hodges and Boorman likewise had many similarities in their direction styles and talent in getting the most from the actors they worked with and these two movies are no exception.For my money Get Carter and Point Blank were way ahead of any other GANGSTER movie in the 60s except for the KILLERS in the early 60s and probably until French Connection and The Godfather arrived in the 70s. In my view the casting of Get Carter was almost as brilliant as the acting with stand out performances by the likes of Ian Hendry to name just one.Caine had many memorable leading roles as well as co starring roles with Zulu also being a standout, but for sheer acting ability Get Carter in my view was his best role although that may be a bit premature as he is still turning in better than average performances in his usual understated fashion.
