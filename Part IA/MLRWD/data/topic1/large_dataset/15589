The lie "...I tried to help her, but she'd gone down" is the turning point of George Eastman as sympathetic mama's boy to evil incarnate. It takes two or three viewings to recognize the blurred layers of deceit Montgomery Clift has cunningly crafted to buy our compassion.
Factory co-worker Alice Tripp (carefully portrayed by Shelley Winters) and socialite Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor) complete the dangerous love triangle George Eastman indulges in for shady purposes, and which degenerates into romantic deception and, finally, murder.
This is the second film version of Theodore Dreiser's novel "An American Tragedy", updated to fit America's post-war substitution of reality with the slick Fifties facade of affluence. Eastman is living a twisted version of the American Dream, his climb up the social ladder appearing almost accidental until Alice's death, which suddenly shocks the viewer into confusion over Eastman's motives.
Director George Stevens' ("Giant", "Shane") voyeuristic approach and Franz Waxman's cognizant score perfectly and cynically weave what film legend Charlie Chaplin hailed as "the greatest American movie ever made".
Be sure to look for intriguing supporting performances by Raymond Burr ("Rear Window", "Ironside"), Anne Revere ("National Velvet", "Gentleman's Agreement"), and Ian Wolfe ("The Scarlet Claw", "Star Trek").
