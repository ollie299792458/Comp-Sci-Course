Raging Bull is one of the best films of all time not because of its boxing scenes but because of the humanity that is presented. It shows a man, confused by sexuality and city life, hanging on by his teeth, who finds  refuge in boxing. Sexuality is a key note of this movie because at all  times, it is Jake's driving force in life. He wants the girl, the  satisfaction of having "conquered" her, and a radiant aspect for  his depressing life. He boxes not only as a release, but to keep food on  the table. He's a combination of Stanley Kowalski (A Streetcar Named  Desire) and Rocky. Sexuality is his language, and he must box to survive.  These themes clash occasionally although he tries his best to separate  them, and that creates the side of DeNiro's character we relate to. He is a  mean, crude, nasty guy on the outside and in, but we see his struggle and  love soaking up his mental anguish. Perhaps we have gone through similar  situations. Or maybe we want desparately to see somebody with real problems  to make ours look petty. I prefer to believe the latter. An outstanding  movie from a gifted director. Scorsese continues to amaze me.
