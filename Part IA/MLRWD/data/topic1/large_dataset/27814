This movie inspired me to be a race car driver, a rockstar, a comicbook super hero,neurosurgen.Peter Weller is brilliant.You can't go wrong with the guy who played robo-cop.King's X RULES!!!!!!! I like the old asian guy and aliens and the car in the begining and the midget, I don't remember if there any, but if there was it was cool if there wasn't who cares.They should make a sequel if they do they must(it is a must not a should but a must) add midgets. Any way King's X ROCKS!!!!!!! I really liked the cool space ship and the special effects and the comedy and the plot and I lked the part when the guy told the other guy, "Laugh all you ca monkey boy" that was funny. I like the part when Buckaroo Bonzai jumps. Some times in stage King's X jumps. Speaking of King's X, boy oh boy they ROCK! Back to Backaroo, I love the part when the little kid had a shotgun, that was cool and funny. Jeff Goldblum was very very very funny because he dress up as a cowboy and his name was New Jersey. Jamie Lee Curtis was in it but only for a moment.I wonder if Jamie Lee Curtis know who King's X is? Christopher Lloyd is very good in it.I consider my self a loyal Blue Blaze Irregular.
Luis Smith as Perfect Tommy was genius.The president played by Ronald Lacey made me pee my pants but the secretary of defense made me crap myself. Best movie ever (Don't forget about King's X).
