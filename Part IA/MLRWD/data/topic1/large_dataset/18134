I have seen this DVD more than a dozen times--it's one of my two-year-old's favorites--and the occasional comment here that the video is less than superb are dead wrong.  I have seen it on a first generation  Pioneer DVL-90 player as well as a new Sony DVP-S550D, and with either  player the presentation is astonishingly good--particularly considering  that the film is now more than 35 years old.  The introduction with Shirley  Jones gives you some idea of the care with which Warner has addressed the  transfer.  The introduction clearly was prepared before the final video  transfer, and uses a few snippets of scenes that clearly originate from an  earlier transfer.  The snippets are fuzzy and lacking in vibrancy.  The  film itself is sensational, as can be seen from the brilliant colors of the  period costumes and the band uniforms.
I have also seen the old VHS and  laserdisc editions, and any comparison of video quality is absurd.  On  audio the "Lida Rose" sequence demonstrates the effective use of  all three front channels.  There is, of course, little in the surrounds, as  this is a musical and not "Die Hard".
The musical is itself a  joy; superior to most due to the wry wit of the author.
This DVD is a  must-purchase for musical fans.
