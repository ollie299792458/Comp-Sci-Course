This film annoys me: The original is about 2 women who work together as a team to try to better themselves, but they are thrown into various "roles" by society.  In the remake, Lana Turner is supposed to be this struggling mother, but from the very first scene you see her as the glamorous movie star that she was - and when she befriends Annie, the black women who is also struggling - she immidiately puts her in the back room off the kitchen and keeps her there for the rest of the movie.
While the original had much to say about race relations, this one is basically a vehicle for Lana Turner and Sandra Dee to strut around in designer gowns.  There is even a totally stupid sub-plot where Lana Turner (mother) and Sandra Dee (daugher) are in love with the same man !!  It gets worse, near the end Sandra Dee is getting ready to graduate from her all-white private school. But where is Sara Jane, Annies light skinned daughter?  Presumably at the public school, but this is never even mentioned, and no one sees anything wrong here.  The whole movie is about Lana Turner becoming a famous broadway actress and having glamorous parties while Annie waits on her hand and foot, even giving her foot massages.  When the movie does finally try to get serious and make a point, it falls flat on it's face because they've spent so little time developing any real story or character developement.  It is too bad, because the performance by EVERYONE (with the exception of Lana Turner, who gives overacting a whole new meaning) are deep and good, and could have been so much better if only the writers had bothered to give them a REAL story.  It is worth watching I suppose, but if you're like me, it'll just make you mad because you'll realize how good this film COULD have been with a bit more effort and nerve.
