THIS MOVIE IS SO AWSOME. I USUALLY HATE HORROR MOVIES BUT I CAN WATCH THIS MOVIE WITHOUT BEING SCARD. I REMBER SETTING IN MY DEN WITH MY MOM AND DAD WHEN I WAS ABOUT 8 OR 9 AND SEEING THIS ONE PART IN THE MOVIE WHICH I THINK IS FUNNY: FRANK BANNESTER(FOX) IS IN THIS GRAVEYARD WITH A GHOST WHO IS AT HIS OWN FURNAL. I REMBER SEEING THE GHOST NAME:RAY LINSKY BEING BURRIED "ALIVE" WHEN HE IS DEAD IN HIS OWN GRAVE WHILE FRANK WATCHES. FINALLY FRANK GRABS HIM AND GETS HIM OUT. MY MOM CHANGED THE CHANNEL BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT I WOULD GET SCARD.
SO ABOUT 3 OR 4 YEARS AFTER I SAW THAT PART I SAW THE MOVIE ON TV AND WATCHED IT AND LOVED IT SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH. I HAD A SLEEP-OVER AND I RENTED THIS MOVIE ALL MY FRIENDS WERE AFRAIDE TO WATCH IT BUT THEY GOT INTO IT BUT ON SOME PARTS WE ALL SCREAMED. AT THE END OF THE MOVIE ALL THE GIRLS LOVED IT. NOW THEY KEEP TELLING ME IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE. AND IN THE MORNING WE ALL PUT NUMBERS ON OUR HEADS AND WENT RUNNING AROUND THE HOUSE. IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A SLEEP-OVER RENT THIS MOVIE!
