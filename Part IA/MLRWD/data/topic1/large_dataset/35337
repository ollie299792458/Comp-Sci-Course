Lovely storyline about a young girl who recently lost her mother in a RTA and is now back in Canada with her father. She shares his love of the wildlife and protecting the natural environment though they are at odds with one another in the very beginning. She finds some abandoned geese eggs after developers have crushed the trees etc and chased away the wild geese. She hatches these eggs and the young geese think she is their mother - so she sets about raising and training them. Totally imprinted to believe that this 13 year old human is indeed their mother. Problem is how to get them to migrate south for the winter when they don't have a mother goose to show them the way. Father and daughter end up flying in micro aircraft with the 18 or so geese following them all the way south.
Wonderfully uplifting film, funny and sad but overall encouraging and engaging with environmental fundamentals. Lifts one' spirits and suitable viewing for all age groups.  Lovely family film which will amuse, entertain and teach everyone from children to senior citizens.  Absolute must for your DVD collection for showing to anyone at anytime.
