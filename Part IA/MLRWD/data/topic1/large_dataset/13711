This timeless little film is probably the best known French film in the United States. This is due to the fact that nearly every elementary school had a copy which they used to babysit the kids when a teacher was absent. This film is such an effective "babysitting" tool because it completely draws in and engages the viewer no matter their age. Lamorisse truly knew and practiced "camera as stilo". I find this film to be as fascinating and colorful now (at age 34) as I did when I was ten years old. This is truly a film masterpiece, just one of many to come out of France in the 50's and 60's. 
  It is a shame that the DVD is so grainy and the sound so poor, the copy I have is actually a Korean DVD which is no problem as you can turn off the Korean subtitles. It would seem, as some reviewers have suggested, that this DVD was made from a copy of the film stock that was dragged through the streets. It is still watchable but it is a crime that this film masterpiece should be in such a poor state on DVD. Someone has to step up and remaster this film for DVD so that it can continue to reach children in future generations.
