I found this movie slightly disturbing in the sense that it took away from the importance of Biblically true prophecy.  It is just one of several movies that are out today, such as Stigmata, that has falsified the power  behind the truth of the Book of Revelation, the Book of Daniel...and other  important "end time" prophecies ... I hate to tell you  people...but if you want to know the truth...read the following: 
the  Left Behind series...the Days of Sorrow series...Revelation Unvieled...Are  We in the End Time...these books are Biblically founded...and as the truth  is, the Bible is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the  truth...from Genesis to Revelation, people...
what this movie has done  was show, in My opinion, that Lucifer is almost as power as God, which is a  total lie...it has distorted what the AntiChrist means...thus I would call  this movie, along with Stigmata, a bit of "false prophets" ...  
What the ending should have shown was...when A.Schwarzenegger saw and  realized the importance of Christ...Him rebucking and sending the Devil  back into his prison...and gaining a new lease on life...sadly, the movie  did not show this...though it sort of showed that He gained a miracle at  the very ending...with the "vision"...
All in all, it was  poorly done... sad to say...poorly researched and executed...
I just hope  the Left Behind movies come out soon and show the world the truth of how  important and how true the Bible is, in comparison to all those false  doctrines (New Age, Buddhism, etc.) that are out today...
