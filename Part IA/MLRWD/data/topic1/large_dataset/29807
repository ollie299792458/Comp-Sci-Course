Every year, certain films are released that are completely misunderstood,  either by critics, or by the movie-going public and Anthony Minghella's  take on the Patricia Highsmith novel "The Talented Mr Ripley"  falls into this category.
It was perceived as a suspense thriller, which  the trailer did nothing to dispel but it is so much more than that. It is a  thought provoking character study of a man so uncomfortable with his own  personality that he must try an inhabit that of another man, the  unfortunate Dickie Greenleaf. However to do so means a few murders and this  is where the film gets its marquee appeal. Matt Damon invests the role with  such subtlety that you are taken by surprise - no longer the apple-pie boy  of past films, here he is a sad character, and one which the audience feels  for, despite resorting to murder. It is a standout performance which  deserves far greater recognition. Jude Law confirms his status as the new  star in the sky (remember Joseph Fiennes?) and delivers his dark prey to  the willing Ripley. And Gwyneth Paltrow confirms her status as the new  Grace Kelly - so bright at the beginning of the film but by its end her  mood is much more sombre as she tries to expose Ripley. The rest of the  cast are uniformly excellent with Cate Blanchett adding to her CV with  another brilliant turn.
This is a superb movie and I advise anyone who  hasn't seen it to do so immediately. A thought-provoking supremely literate  and at times, bloody scary film.
