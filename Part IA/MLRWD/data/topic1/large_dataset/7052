I saw the previews for this movie when I saw 'Brokeback Mountain' and was waiting impatiently for it to come to my city.  Many 'gay movies' aren't that good.  I was happy that this one is.

  Well-acted, all the characters were believable and likable.  Anthony Stewart Head as Piper Pearbo's dad is a hoot!  A fun escape movie with a little sadness, and yet a happy ending for all.

  Piper Pearbo plays a woman who, at her wedding is immediately drawn to a woman who turns out to be the florist.  Both she and her new husband take to this stranger and they develop a friendship.  When it turns out that the florist is a lesbian, the bride is eventually forced to take a look at the nature of the draw she feels towards this woman.  However, neither woman wants to hurt her husband, a good and caring man.  How it all works out is funny, touching, and sad at turns.

  I'd compare this movie most to something like Reese Witherspoon's "Sweet Home Alabama".  If you liked that movie and you can celebrate love in all its forms, then I believe you'll enjoy "Imagine Me & You".
