I didn't see the original, I never listened to the soundtrack, but this movie was spectacular! Everyone was perfectly cast for the movie.  Jennifer Hudson -- I can't say enough about her acting! She was such a natural and when she sang "And I'm Tellin' You I'm Not Goin'," the audience gave her a standing ovation!

One thing that has bothered me, however, is that they keep comparing this fictional group to the Supremes or with Motown in general.  Personally, I don't see the connection, especially since they had the scene of Deena trying to help Effie (based on the "Dreamgirls" book by Mary Wilson, Diana definitely wasn't going out of her way to help Florence Ballard).  The group could have been any girl group during that time. If there was a strong female lead, she got top billing over the group.  They did the same with male groups.

Jennifer, you did us proud!  Best of luck in your newfound career!!

Anyway, I can't wait until this movie comes out on DVD -- I'll be putting it into my collection.
