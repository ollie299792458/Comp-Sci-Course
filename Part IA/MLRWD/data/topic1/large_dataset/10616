Soon into this movie about New York mobsters. there's a long tracking shot: a young hood (Ray Liotta), flush with money and entitlement, escorts his date (Lorraine Bracco) into the Copacabana through a side entrance; the couple navigate corridors, a restaurant kitchen, and enter the crowded club; there, a waiter sets up a table for them just as comedian Henny youngman opens his act with "Take my wife, please!" Its a bravura sequence by an artist who knows how to make movies better than most.

That artist, director Martin Scorcese, is confident enough to cast in supporting roles his own mother and no less an acting legend than top-billed Robert DeNiro. Clearly, he has his priorities straight.

Liotta stars ingratiatingly as a youngster/adult who aspires to gangsterism under the guidance of the local capos (DeNiro. Paul Sorvino and Joe Pesci). Bracco strings along, enjoying the good life and raising their kids. All goes awry when Liotta falls afoul of the law and agrees to turn state's evidence against his former mentors, landing them in jail and he and his family in the witness protection program. The real man Liotta plays here wrote a best-selling book about all this and Scorcese collaborated with him on the script.

Scorcese shows us the daily operations of a morally corrupt group of temper tantrum sadists, murderers and thieves who nevertheless dote on family, value loyalty, and protect their own. Pesci perfects the first of many psycho killers he's played in other movies. Francis Coppola moved the narrative in a stately manner in his "Godfather" films, while Scorese drives his briskly here. "Goodfellas" isn't yet ranked in the same league, but that the comparison even comes to mind suggests its inevitablity.
