here we go again, with people complaning and b&tching about  the new theme music, listen, the opening theme music which was about 30 seconds long was not what made the show, I mean sure it was a good opener , but when married with children was kicking ass in the ratings do you think people that watched the show just tuned in to watch the theme music and then turned the channel once it ended NO they tuned in every week to see al bundy and his crazy ideas he came up w/ that never work,  the extremely hot , but dumb kelly , bud who never could get the girl, and the lazy house wife peg ...I think you get the idea . Beside I skip though the opening theme music on the dvd, the old music and the new so it really doesn't matter, and if you don't agree with what i same fine, but just remmeber if this season doesn't sell because of people who what to boycott it, they will stop making them as in season 4 will be as far as we get in the 11 seasons married with children was on. For the record I plan on buying every season of married w/ children they put out and if they bring back the new theme music thats cool , but if they don't,I don't think i'll lose any sleep over it.So buy season 4 I Highly recommand it.
