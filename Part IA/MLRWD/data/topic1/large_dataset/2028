I have just finished watching Dances With Wolves for the first time, and I have to say it is one of my favorite movies of all time, after one viewing.
  The movie absolutely captivated me with it's sense of wildness and freedom. I never imagined that I would feel this engrossed in a 3+ hour movie, but I indeed did sit there thru the entire thing, totally absorbed in the storyline.
  The movie was packed with extraordinary scenery and a flawless portrayal of the horse people of the plains.
  The ending was tragic, but true, and I feel even more for the native cultures that once peopled our land, and treated it as it should be treated.
  I am sure most of the folks reading this review have already seen the movie at one time or another, so I must say that this long awaited DVD was worth the wait. The picture was excellent, as was the audio. There is one two sided disc for the movie and an additional disc for special features, which I have not had the chance to get into.
