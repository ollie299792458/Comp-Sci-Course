The relevance of this film is strikingly frightening
today.

The unsuspecting John Q Public (Will Smith) is on
the run, even stripping down to his boxers to symbolize
the insecurity of the average Amercian by the
ever-intrusive government sworn to uphold our ineffective
Constitutional Rights; highlighting modern technology gone
rampant under the guise of protecting our supposedly
inherent natural rights. The right to privacy is trampled
on by NSA agents (portrayed as young prying clowns)under
the command of a nefarious reptile played to a T by Jon
Voight.

The players in the system of illusory rights hound
John Q Public since he unknowingly carries on him
evidence of a Congressman's death and it's at this
point where things slowly unfold for the naive citizen
as he is relentlessly chased by Big Brother via satellites,
ATM and tunnel cameras, cell phone signal tracking, bugs,
etc. hitting home the film's point: privacy is a thing of
the past. It even points out that a natural serene pond
view of geese isn't a safe place for some privacy. The film
gains steam midway as a paranoidal ex-NSA agent, Brill
(Hackman) literally knocks some sense into John Q and
shows him the painful truth; the truth that Joe Blow
easily dismissed during a scene earlier into the movie.

Released almost 3 years prior to 9/11, "Enemy of the State"
bombards the senses with quick editing, hyper-action, and
loud jolts of sound as if to say, "Wake up!" Orwell has been
rolling in his grave for some time now. One reviewer pointed
out Brill's birthday of 9/11 in a quick flash scene. If only
this was a coincidence and not a confirming nod to those who
are privy numerologists, but considering the studio which
released this film it should be of no surprise.

So sit back, crack open a can of soda and pop open a bag
of popcorn and pay witness to one man's life quickly turned
upside down by a power hungry, guilt-ridden government
seeking safety under its ever-intrusive eye.
