Whether one enjoys this film or not, the fact is that the DVD transfer provides excellent, detailed image plus first-rate sound.  Dimitri Tiomkin's score is the work of a master, as well as William Faulkner's dialogues.  Joan Collins,  as usual, is terrible, but since the character she portrays is also "terrible" to a large extent, at the end of the movie she gets what she deserves for her nasty performance: she is buried alive.  This witty comment was made by another reviewer here, and I fully agree with it.  Great.  Now... what would then be the real problem with this movie ?  Alas... the format of the DVD transfer is totally inadequate.  Everybody looks as thin as the aliens of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" or an Indian fakir - particularly those characters placed at the right and left corners of the screen.  However, as they move towards the center of the screen their health improves visibly and they look a little more human.  Insomma, it is unbelievable the perfunctory way some DVD and Blu-ray transfers are made - and, what is worst: offered for sale to bona-fide consumers.
