This was one of a trilogy of hard hitting cop thrillers from the time, which began with Bullit, and continued with The French Connection.  I have owned copies of both previously, but traded them in, but interestingly, decided to keep a hold of this one.

Quickly, Seven ups refers to a group of cops whose use unorthodox methods to entrap the criminals they pursue and they end up doing seven years in jail or more.  No six months or suspended sentences nonsense here.  Roy Schieder is electrifying in the lead, having no doubt been given the part because of his support work in The French Connection, so I guess it's a promotion of sorts!

Like with Bullit and The French Connection, the standout scene is a car chase and in my view, I think it's the best of the lot.  Okay, for three reasons; firstly, it's as gripping, if not more so than the other ones in Connection and Bullit, except to be predantic, French Connection wasn't strictly a car-car chase, but it was a tough act to follow nonetheless, and they did it with this; secondly, it's over a longer distance and so the attention has to be sustained for longer and it still manages to grip; thirdly, (spoiler alert, careful!), the ending to the chase is sudden and it is the wrong one who wins.  The pursuer loses.  That gives it a harder edge funnily enough.  But there is a further payoff to come.  There is also a very deserved mention here for the stunt driver who worked on both previous films and I am not sure if he did the stuntowrk on this too, Bill Hickman.  If he did co-ordinate it or even perform it, then hats off to the best stuntdriver that Hollywood has ever seen.
