I'm hurt. Quite frankly, this breaks my heart.

I don't know what the deal with the other two T&J Spotlights were (I didn't bother touching them after I heard about what a terrible job WBHV did on them)... but hearing about this makes me want to cry. I wanted to buy this, seeing as the box advertised this as the "Uncut" collection (the other two boxes did not advertise this, as far as I know), but after hearing that I wouldn't be seeing Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat, and about 32 or so OTHER shorts that WB didn't even bother to touch, looking at this set at Barnes and Noble will probably make me want to yak. And aside from all of this, if it's for the adult collector, why ar eyou letting the family division have their politically correct way with the MGM shorts? I don't know about Droopy, but T&J, at least. You should be ashamed, Warner Home Video.

However, I'm STILL going to buy LT Golden Collection #5; that series has not disappointed yet.

EDIT: Wow. Just wow. I just got finished watching the previews for the DVD set... and um... half the previews is full of clips from Mouse Cleaning. This has GOT to be embarrasing for you, Warner.
