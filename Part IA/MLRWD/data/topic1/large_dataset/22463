How bad can a Terminator movie with Christian Bale (AND Sam Worthington), a big budget, and access to modern special effects be?

Pretty darn bad.

It plays like a cheesy Mad Max movie - except it wasn't produced in Australia with a then-unknown brand new actor and a low budget in the '70's.

The key "reveal" of the movie is thrown away almost accidentally. No psychological, wonder if, wonder what, build up. No doubt or surprise when a team member switches sides. In short, these days even comic books are much deeper.

Don't get me started about the young actor who plays Kyle Reese, John Connor's future time traveling father. He was completely unsuited to the role! (But played an excellent "Chekhov" in the Star Trek reboot the same year.)

I won't say don't waste your money on it. But don't have much in the way of high expectations.

And stand in awe of James Cameron, who with spit for budget kicked off this series in the first place, with the low budget, but high impact, original Terminator.
