Yes, the movie musical is back in style this week, but what about next week, or next month?  Moulin Rouge, I fear, will not stand the test of time, whereas "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" will live forever in the hearts of indie fans.  
"Hedwig" is a story of a transexual rocker whos botched sex-change operation left her with an "angry inch."  Hedwig's (John Cameron-Mitchell) dilemma is that former lover, Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt), has taken credit for all her songs.  Tommy, in turn becomes a rock superstar. Hedwig and her band, The Angry Inch, shadow Tommy's tour, playing gigs in a scuzzy resturant chain, to try and get noticed and get credit. "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" explores the depths of human love, compassion, and will.  Not only that, but it accomplishes all that while still providing some very intelligent humor, and delightful music. (buy the soundtrack, its worth it!) 
This amazing rock musical is certainly one of my top ten this year, maybe my top ten ever.  It is certainly one of the funniest films I've seen.  "Hedwig" is a very heartwarming tale, though it deals with off-beat subject matter.  I suggest everyone rush out to rent this movie.  And if you have the chance, get the DVD.  It is chalk full of amazing features.  I especially suggest you watch "The Story of Hedwig."  It shows you the off-broadway roots that came to be the masterpiece it is today.
