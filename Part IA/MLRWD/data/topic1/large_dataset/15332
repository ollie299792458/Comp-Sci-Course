It is apropos that I am the first to contribute to this page since Bergman's death. Apropos for reasons too viscerally considered, and perhaps self-serving, to articulate. Still, though audacious enough to consider myself a lifelong student of Bergman's genius, I will keep this brief.

Though it may sound trite to proclaim this or that film to be one's "all-time favorite," Cries and Whispers is just that for me. When, at the film's transcendent conclusion, the great Harriet Anderson recites in voiceover: "...Now, for a few moments, I can experience perfection, and I feel profoundly grateful to my life, which gives me so much..." it is clear to me that Bergman knew he'd NAILED it that time: nailed the finale, nailed the film, realized his vision and, in so doing, created a monumental achievement, not only in the history of cinema but art itself.

Thank you, Mr. Bergman, for making the words "...Come what may, this is happiness; I cannot wish for anything better..." chime true for me--timelessly--time and time again.
