If you're a male of about 14, this film is for you.  THE CRAZIES is a 101-minute plate of slice and dice.  Or burn and explode.  Or punch and kick.  There are a few other choice actions here but I think you get the idea.

The plot, what there is of it, is a bit difficult to extract from all the mayhem.  It appears that, in a small Iowa town, some disastrous chemical/nuclear event has taken place.  Instead of letting the good citizens know what has happened and gently herding them away from the dangerous disaster, serious chemical suits are worn by an army of thugs looking for a good time herding up the good citizens, not telling them what has happened -- and generally beating them up.  I guess no one thought to just go on tne radio and TV and telling the truth.

The acting, minimal, is done by two modestly talented newcomers as the leads (I call them newcomers because I've never heard of Timothy Olyphant or Radha Mitchell).  But they certainly don't embarass themselves and Mr. Olyphant has a fine Greek profile which the director often presents to us.  The director is one Breck Eisner; I'm totally unfamiliar with his work.

I would have given the movie one star instaed of my generous two -- but I think that would be just too mean.  And who knows, the crazies might come after me.
