I ordered the Blu-ray (US release).  I'm seeing scenes that weren't aired on BBCAmerica.  And it's nice not having to fast forward through commercials.  Also I don' know if others have this problem, but BBCAnerica isn't broadcast in HD where I am. So the resolution on my HDTV is CRAP when I watch and rewatch the TV version (via my DVR). With the Blu-ray everything is vivid and crystal clear.  I see details on the Blu-Ray(some gorry) that I hadn't even noticed on the television aired version. It's also great to see everyone at a normal size and not so 'stretched' across the flat screen.
I'm gonna order Seasons2 & 3 on Blu-ray too.
I recommend  getting the Blu-ray if you have the annoyance of lower screen resolution/quality on your flat screen. Especially if you're annoyed by the loss of scenes when BBCAmerica re-runs the episodes.  The eps go from 75mins down to 60mins and it seems that it's always Annie's scenes that get cut when it's re-run on T.V. -I understand it, I just don't like it.  Now I can watch my show, un-cut and uninterrupted (no screwball commercials).
Well worth it. And season 1 is so reasonably priced!
I haven't even begun to delve into the extras of deleted scenes and what-not. Nine chances out of ten I've seen them all on you-tube anyway...
I'm just glad to finally have a copy of my very own. Being Human is currently my must-see obsession.
