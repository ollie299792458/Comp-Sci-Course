Charlton Heston mimic, Tom Tryon, turns in adequate low-key performance in this kitschy, sexually charged and slyly irreverent hodgepodge of amorous space creatures red-smoking their victims into the thankless realm of high-powered chick mongering. No woman, not even mega-super-vixen Phyllis Diller (who does not appear), can crush the life out of a space monster like Gloria Talbot can. Just look at old Tryon struggling with wedding-night monsterface and post-wedding melancholy. The man/alien (delightfully) mopes and grumbles his way through 3/4 of this film until, obviously ad-libbing, he up and whacks the ditsy broad's mutt. But his attempt to squeeze a little joy out of life gets him screeched at and emasculates him to the point where he's hunched over in a permanent wince and speaking without feeling. Welcome to marriage on earth, space man!
The film picks up steam when Tryon's (I never caught any of the characters' names) wife-marriage-commitment bashing buddies get red-smoked and join in on the fun. Talk about rude and crude, these black and white cats make Don Rickles look like Gandhi, always making with the sexist wisecracks and brooding at inopportune moments and, very strangely, acting like they all just snorted an eight ball of saltpeter. I was surprised these boys weren't making passes at each other, but then, who knows what goes on off camera?
Overall this is enjoyable 50's sci-fi hokum, and the cinema's first (and highly effective) use of monsterface superimposition. Don't tell me Hitchcock didn't learn a little something from this one.
