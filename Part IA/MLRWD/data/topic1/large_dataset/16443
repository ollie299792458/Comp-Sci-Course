i usually like dramatic soap operas like this but after watching most of this show seasons,the plots become sticky like gum and kind of ridiculous-every show like this has its success in the first seasons and after reaching the climax of success the writters get out of ideas for good plots and the show becomes ridiculous and sticky with plots that goes on and on...ridiculously. like dynasty reached its climax of success in the mid 80's(1984-1985) around season 4 or 5 and then become bad in the last 7-9 seasons cause writers made bad plots-melrose place becomes bad in its last seasons too-so i suggest to obtain only half the series where the episodes are still good and interesting with good plots...i guess this show is one that symbolize the 90's decade and in the end of this first millenium decade we will recall those lovely years of the 90's that this show and beverly hills reflect and how things changed from the 90's era and how the world look different and youngsters today dress different then how they used to dress in the 90's and in this melrose place series.....MEMORIES...melrose place,beverly hills,dynasty and dallas....soap operas TATOOS of the 90's,80's and 70's.
