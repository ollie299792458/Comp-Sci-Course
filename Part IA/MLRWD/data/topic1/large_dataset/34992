Had the movie starred Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti as its two leads, I'd likely not be writing this. But alas, we have to watch Ryan Gosling (who is stiff as a board and quite honestly a terrible actor) and Evan Rachel Wood (admittedly a decent actress, but her chemistry with Mr. Gosling is cold as ice) spin a web of romantic melodrama essentially boiling down to "Oh no! The girl's going to ruin everything!"

The pacing of this movie is akin to a cheetah with three broken legs, and the entire plot hinges on Evan Rachel Woods. There's no political power plays, no real ideology opposing realism, no spark of an entertaining movie. It's just a movie about double and triple crossing, slander, and silly pseudo-romances that we all already know exists behind the scenes in real world politics. *snooze*. Ryan Gosling is supposed to be this talented wunderkind, yet I really have no idea why. All we see him do is brood, whine, and double cross his double crosser which was completely predictable to anyone following this plotless mess.

Oh yeah, and the ending is completely insulting. The third act finally begins to gain momentum, and then it fades into nothing just like the finale of the Sopranos, leaving you scratching your head and going, "Really!? That's IT?!?"

I'd avoid this one, while the acting from PSH and PG was, as always, brilliant, and George Clooney played a natural politician, the plot was a total bore and exudes the intellectual insight of a jelly donut. Once again, it degrades into a melodrama of forbidden romance, not politics.
