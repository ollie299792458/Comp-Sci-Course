I think this movie was like Moonstruck. In the fact that was released to only 3500 theatre's nation wide, Sony really dropped the ball here, they needed to back it more and put it into more theatre's then that, especially going up against Harry Potter Thanksgiving weekend. It is very well written, well lighted, fun, sexy, and something for everyone. You will fall in love with the Tess and Ali, and Jack. Great music, funny, lots of great one liners. Everyone holds there own in this movie. If it was backed better and released in more theatre's like Moonstruck eventually was, it would have became a hit because people started to pick up that it was a great movie. Burlesque is full on entertaiment. I also left feeling like my money was well spent. In fact I saw it four times and took five people and some of my straight friends that went just loved it. My father also took his girlfreind and they both are how not huge Cher or Christina fans, but loved it. Dad cant wait for it on DVD. It's to bad people didn't pick up on it sooner. Now with it on Blu-Ray DVD you can watch it over and over and then see what I mean about an all around great time. If you want to escape your everyday life for 2 hours this is a movie for you. After all that is movies are all about! Enjoy!!!
