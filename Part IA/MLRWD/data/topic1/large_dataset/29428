The first time I heard about "Rain Man" I just said "Ok,I may watch it!".My mother,however,insisted on me doing it as she had already heard so many good reviews about the film.Thankfully,I listened to her and checked the film out.

  The plot was great-I liked the way how dramatic and funny moments go together in the movie making the audience cry in a moment,then giggle.The story was good enough to make me realize some things at an early age(As far as I remember when I watched the film for the first time I was 11-12 years old).Now,I am 18 and still come back to it very often.

  The cast is out of a question.A very good performance by Tom Cruise(I am not a huge fan of his,but still I admit he can act).When it comes to Dustin Hoffman the only comment I can make is he is one of the best actors of all time.His performance is SUPERB!He is one of my favourite actors and I have seen many of his films.Not all of them,unfortunaltey.

  I have to go now,so I can't write all the things that I want to write,but I am quite sure you got the general idea.Go to the shop and buy the DVD!You won't regret it!Bye!

  Take care,

  Sisi
