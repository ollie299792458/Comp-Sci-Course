There are a lot of negative things being said in many of the reviews about this movie.  They're all wrong!  This movie is far worse than any of them describe it!  It looks like it was written by a retarded 4 year old.  Zero creativity, no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  It was so bad I mailed it to Lions Gate and told them I didn't think I could watch any of their movies again. (Never heard from them) It's like when you bite into a spoiled burger at your favorite burger joint, although you know it was a fluke, you can never bring yourself to eat at that place again.  This movie left such a bad taste for Lions Gate I immediately lose interest in an otherwise interesting movie when I see it's by Lions Gate.  Don't get me wrong, I do like silly stupid humor.  I liked the "Scary Movie" series of movies.  They were all really stupid and yet very creative and entertaining.  This "Disaster Movie" however had no creativity at all.  Nothing about it was entertaining.  This movie is the Reference Standard of poorly done movies. It should have never been released.
