This movie was such a pleasent surprise to me.  For some reason I had never heard of this movie.  I rented it being a fan of the serial killer genre.  Jolie and Hawke do a wonderful acting job in this movie.  Hawke to me has always been a very underated actor and with the exception of Girl Interupted and Gia I have not been that impressed with Jolie, But she is excellent in this movie.

This movie is about a killer who takes on the identity of his victims.  There are some very gruesome killings in this movie.  Another thing I like is  the profiler work done by Jolie.  I always compare actors doing profile work to Edward Norton in Red Dragon because he is was untouchable as the best to me.  She lives up to my standard set by Norton in this movie.  Who the killer is in this movie is fairly obvious, but there is a little twist in the end that was pretty good.

I recommend buying this movie because is very entertaining and everyone I have let borrow it has agreed with me.
