I was sixteen the first time I found myself under the spell of this movie. Evertytime that it is on TV I drop what I am doing and surrender to it and to Rosiland Russell who slips into Mame Dennis Burnside so effortessly that the room around me goes dark leaving her performance as my spotlight of attention.  Fortuntaly, the rest of the cast shines as brightly as she does making the plot move along way to fast, and leaving the viewer to feel as if the magical moment has passed to quickly.
Writing a review of this movie is impossible; the cast, crew and production speaks for itself.  Hollywood could never remake this film without throwing in its obligatory obscenity, uninspired casting and vapid camerawork.  Think about it, who could afford the type of talent needed today to bankroll such a quality supporting cast -- you just can't go out and duplicate Gloria Upson (and her shining moment in the cinema fermement when she asked the second most important line in the history of stage and film: "And whats WRONG with Muriel Puce?") with some bit part when it was done to perfection in this film.  Hollywood knows this - with the exception of the horrific "MAME" (Lucille Ball bludgeoned the role to death with her Camel rasped pleas of "PATRICK!!!") this story has been hands off -- good for us who love it!
