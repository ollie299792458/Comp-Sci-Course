The first time the scheming heart-of-ice blonde Rita Hayworth kisses the Irish in-for-a-penny-in-for-a-pound adventurer Orson Welles in this excellent b&amp;w masterpiece, she chooses an aquarium to do it,watched by  barracudas, sharks and an evil Moray eel.  At this stage of the proceedings  the viewer is pretty well convinced Mr Welles has a better chance among the  fish than among the people. But there's more.  As the lovers kiss,a class  of giggling school girls spots them who are promptly shepherded away by a  vigilant elderly female school teacher. A moment later the schoolteacher's  colleague, another elderly female, takes a peek, screeching as she is  dragged off " I wanta see I WANTA SEE!" These furies pursue Mr  Welles into his trial and provide crucial evidence that he was indeed  kissing the Mrs Everett Sloane. Mr Sloane, a rich and brilliant criminal  lawyer, not only acts as defence for Mr Welles, but also stands as a  witness for the prosecution. He then cross examines himself! . Yes.  You're right, dear viewer, this is an absurd and topsy turvy world we are  observing. Deep focus, wierd angles, shadows, super-close ups,  idiosyncratic dialogue with mad people operating in a corrupt and absurd  universe, make this a vivid and rich cinematic experience. Never in  cinematic history has the word "lover" been spat,as it is  frequently by Mr Everett Sloane, when addressing his wife Ms Hayworth, with  so much poison as it is here, in this film. Nothing is what it seems, with  references to cinema history, including German Expressionism, and this film  is a must see.  Good fun too, especially the mad Glenn Anders.
