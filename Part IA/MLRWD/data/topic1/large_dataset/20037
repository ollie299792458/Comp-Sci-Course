I have unfortunately never seen this particular release, but I own the import. One of my friends had just borrowed it from another person and told me it was the strangest thing he had ever seen. The person he was returning it to wasn't there, so he gave it to me for the night. I had never heard of it, and the cover was in Japanese, so I had NO idea what it was. I had some time to kill, so I popped it in the DVD player and started to watch it. At first, I was thinking "What in the?" but by the end of the first episode, I was in hysterics. From Nabeshin, the white guy with a 'fro who appears randomly and conveniently knows just about everybody; to Hyatt, the constantly dying co-star; to Watanabe, the next-door-neighbor who lives with two other bizarre characters who essentially live to ruin his life; to Ilparatzo, the bored leader of Across who plays video games and electric guitars; to Pedro, the laboring construction worker who dies in a fire trying to save a picture of his son; to Menchi, the emergency supply food; to the Puchus doing their little Puchu dances; to Excel, the over-achiever who manages to never achieve anything... There is not a single dull moment in the entire series. A must-see for any true anime/manga lover of any kind. It spoofs everything from Star Wars to Gundam, from Japanese culture icons to American pop idols. No collection is complete without this nutbrain series filled with twists and turns and never-ending jokes.
