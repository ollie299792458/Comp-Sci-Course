I had low expectations for this film.  I think the title is pathetically uninspired and lifeless.  I thought the Cable Guy would be the overly talkative, obnoxious character like Donkey in Shrek.  And, not being a big expert/fan of cars in general, I thought I might be overall underwhelmed. But, my father wanted to see this, so I took him to see it for Father's Day.  And, I had the best day with him in a long time.  Amazingly captivating--with a few details that are culturally overplayed groaners--and well paced, CARS takes a checkered flag in my book.  I have seen probably more computer animated films than I'd like to see in one year. [I was equally surprised by Over The Hedge.  Ice Age 2 was a bit of a disappointment, though.] But, I was happy after seeing this one.  I have read other reviews that mention a slight disapproval with how the cars handle some activities without the use of humans(ie. answering the phone and working the gas pumps) and have to agree with them.  But, I wouldn't like that to ruin the film for me.  One of the funnier highlights is the use of cars as even the insects of the film.  Oh, and stay through the credits for a satisfying end note.
