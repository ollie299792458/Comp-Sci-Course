Recently, some meathead friend of a friend was perusing my video collection and asked me with a sneer on his face, "What kind of girl  owns The Dirty Dozen?"
Can I help it if this chick has taste?
Of  course I completely understand the assumption that this is a guy's movie.  After all, the only females to feature in the film are whores. While women  played an important role in the WWII victory, they were more in the  factories than on the front lines. I refrain from saying only men enjoy  watching stuff get blown up, but I will venture to say that if my father  had had sons, he might have introduced them to this film genre rather than  his daughters.
But this is a quality film with enough substance for both  genders to enjoy. After all, this is a film about redemption. Lee Marvin  must struggle to make worthy soldiers out of men who would steal, rape, and  murder. The importance of a meaningful death is the motivation behind his  troop's transformation. 
The movie is a little slow, but the script is  good and the action alternates between wildly humorous and intensely  suspenseful. Furthermore, this film is full of amazing moments of character  development. Charles Bronsen's failed attempt at a word-association  exercise. Telly Savalas's portrayal of chilling insanity.  Donald  Sutherland as the idiot "general" inspecting the troops. Jim  Brown, who does not care to fight the white man's war but can not suppress  his own heroic nature. And John Cassavantes as the tricky, irrepressible  Victor Franco, the guy we love to hate. Or is that hate to love?
