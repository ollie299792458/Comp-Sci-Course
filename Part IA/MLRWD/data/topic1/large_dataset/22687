This is a surprising video.  Saw the concert for the first time on TV about a year ago and was blown away.  Caught a few snippets of it here and there on YouTube, and decided to go ahead and buy it.  Boy am I glad I did.  The YouTube and iTunes versions lack the real musical quality that the video and its THX audio exhibit.  I am a big Styx fan, and they are great in this concert.  But the real heroes in this one are the kids in the Contemporary Youth Orchestra and Chorus.  Styx's music lends itself to an orchestral backdrop, and the musicality of the blending of the rockers and the orchestra is exceptional.  Again, what carries the day is seeing the vitality and excitement of the kids in the orchestra and chorus.  Their energy and sheer enjoyment of the moment makes this a music video that you want to play over and over.  It's a concert that I really wish I had been able to attend, because it was one of those one-in-a-million happenings in which everything just came out perfectly.  The "bonus material" on most of these things is usually not worth a look, let alone a second look, but in this video there is a 10+ minute drum solo called the Quake Cam in which the Styx drummer, Todd Sucherman, gets an exclusive camera during a long compilation song.  Holy smokes is this intense.  If I were a drummer I would feel so inadequate after watching this guy work his butt off the way he does.  I would recommend this video to anyone who enjoys Styx, but really to anyone who'd like to enjoy a couple of hours of some of the best music video you've ever seen.  You don't even have to be a big rock fan - it's that good!  You will be impressed.  Like the guy with the suits on TV says, I Guarantee It!
