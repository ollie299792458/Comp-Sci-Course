Where do you define real? Can you create a soul out of electronic circuits? Are virtual people still people? *The Thirteenth Floor* seeks to ask these questions, and provides vague answers.
I'd heard lots of bad  reviews of this movie, but when I finally saw it, I didn't see why.
This  is actually a good, interesting movie. It takes themes from *eXistenZ* (the  fine line between what is real and what is not) and *The Matrix* (what if  you discovered your world wasn't real?), mixes them, adds in a murder  mystery and a love story more convincing than the one in *The Matrix*, and  then tones down the special effects. If you pay attention, you may figure  out much of this movie way ahead of time, as there are clues planted  everywhere, but it's still fun to watch. The 1937 world is entertaining  because of its authenticity.
The trailer paints this movie as being more  suspenseful/action-packed than it really is. It may not be super  suspenseful, but it's entertaining, thought-provoking, and worth your time.
