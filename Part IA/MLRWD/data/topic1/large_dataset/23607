I don't know why so many people don't like this movie.  I went to see this movie with a friend (having read the book a year ago and rather interested) and quite enjoyed it.  In fact, I haven't talked to anyone, face to face, who didn't like it.
This is a story set in a post nuclear apocalyptic America.  It is the tale of what binds people together, of sparse communities desperately trying to hold too the strings of civilization.  It is also the tale of a man who becomes a hero in spite of himself.
Kevin Costner's character is not particularly likeable - but then in this grim world, no one seems to be.  He is a loner who creates a story about being a Postman, just to get a meal.  But he also creates a hope to a shattered populace of something better.
THe Postman is the tale of a man who becomes a hero, it is the tale of a nation beset by troubles, but still against all odds, hoping and praying.  It is an enjoyable cinematic experience.  The sex scenes and too quick ending (the later typical of the book - which is excellent and this movie does not resemble much) take this movie down to four stars.
