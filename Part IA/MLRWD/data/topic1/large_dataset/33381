Before Night Falls, the story of persecuted homosexual Cuban writer Reynaldo Arinas, is a successful personal quest to clarify and elevate human compassion to the level of art by post abstact expressionist painter Julian Schnabel. It's a beautiful story which parallels the rise and fall of individual liberty and personal identity with the hopes and glory of the Cuban revolution. Academy Award nominee lead Javier Bardem carries the film with a performance that will excite tolerance even in a man like George Bush (either one). The photography is lush, oddly interesting, often beautiful, and the film is propelled by a moving sound track, engaging excerpts from Arinas' work, and tightly edited straight ahead story telling. There are one or two awkward shots -- minor distractions really -- in an otherwise totally refreshing and movingly human film in a season of empty banality from "hollywood".  This DVD version has excellent interview footage of Arinas, and documentary materials, including an arresting tour of Schanbel's huge paintings in his NYC studio. One awaits Schnabel's next film with interest.
