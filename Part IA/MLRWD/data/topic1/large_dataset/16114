This story works best when taken as the light comedy that it's intended to be.  Tom Baker is never more witty.  City of Death has everything:

Location (Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Mona Lisa, and even a stereotypically rude French prick sitting in the cafe sketching Romana.)

Cast (Not only do we have the Doctor and Romana, who share a tremendous chemistry together, but we also enjoy Julian Glover as the sinister Scarlioni/Jagaroth. Add to that Duggan, a bumbling English detective who thinks he is Moe from the Three Stooges (I never thought I'd get Doctor Who and Three Stooges in the same breath!) At one point the Doctor snaps at Duggan, "That's your philosophy.  If it moves, hit it".  We won't mention that Duggan's nasty habit of slugging first and asking questions later actually saves the day in the end.  "Duggan, that may have been the most important punch in Earth's history!"  And who can forget the brief but very effective cameo by John Cleese?)

Plot (All the elements of a well-told story, sprinkled with a touch of humor Tom Baker-style.  We have plot twists that keep the viewer from getting bored. How can you have 7 genuine Mona Lisas?  Watch the story and find out.  City of Death concludes with another possible explanation, albeit fiction, of how life on earth originated.)

Fans of Doctor Who rank City of Death as one of the best, if not the best, Who story.  It certainly justifies inclusion in anyone's top 5 Doctor Who programs, up there with Inferno and Pyramids of Mars
