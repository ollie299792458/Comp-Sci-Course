If you read the critiques of this latest Bean movie (his French vacation) by Amazon's "Thorn Hill at the Movies" from Venice, CA and Jenny J.J., the New Yorker in Florida, you will immediately notice two things:

First, both of these critics are very intelligent and really know the art of film making.  They both wrote lengthy reviews explaining why, in detail, Rowan Atkinson and his cast will never be nominated for an Oscar for this movie.

And the second thing that will immediately be obvious to you, if you read the other reviews from the people who laughed so hard they spit their popcorn all over the theater floor, is that they missed the point of the whole movie.

This was not supposed to be a deeply moving life-changing theatrical event to catch the attention of the Academy Awards.  This was the same old crazy, dumber than "Dumb and Dumber" Mr. Bean up to his same old zaney antics and bufoonery!

You either like it or you don't.  You either find him funny or you don't.

Most of the people in the theater I was at found the movie hillarious.  But then, most of them were not Hollywood trained critics.  (And frankly, I can't vouch for their IQ level either!)

One thing is clear, though: This is definitely the best made of all Rowan Atkinson's films.
