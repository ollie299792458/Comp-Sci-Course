If you were a Van Damme buff like me when you were younger, then you swear by and worship films such as Bloodsport, Kickboxer, and Lionheart.  Timeless late 80's early 90's films that were immensely popular at the time and quite enjoyable as action movies during that era.  However, Van Damme's reputation quickly faded because he was type-cast as the brute karate guy who was hell-bent on just kicking you in the face at an 120 degree angle.

Timecop is Van Damme's glory film in his acting career.  A wonderful and entirely believable futuristic story of time travel that with a little better directing and production could have been a darn good action flick.  Van Damme plays a futuristic cop who witnesses his wife's murder and is determined to do something about it.  Coincidentally, he's the top time travel cop for the time travel program that the government currently has implemented for national security reasons.  Of course he's going to use that to his advantage.  What ensues is a mixture of other time travel movies all brought into one but with that Van Damme flair.  While the overlying message is that the past is a terrible thing to alter, Van Damme's life has never been the same since the loss of his wife.  The only way to survive his mundane existence and to save the country in the process is to go back in time, alter it, and kill a few bad guys in the process.  Van Damme is not over the top here, however.  He plays a darker character who displays believable emotion as a result of his surroundings.  If you're a fan of time travel movies ala Back to the Future, The Butterfly Effect, The Time Machine, then Timecop should be right up your alley.

Time travel will always be an interesting topic of conversation or subject of a major motion picture.
