The Pride of the Yankees is perhaps the best movie about sports because it is about so much more than sports:  it's about love and bravery and dedication, on and off the field.  And unlike so many other dying athlete movies, the sentiment is understated--you can cry unashamedly.
Now to the silly idea of colorizing movies.  How's this for a reason not to do it:  the filmmakers who created black and white movies never intended them to be seen in color.  They were designed, lit, and photographed for black and white viewing.  Surely we should have some regard for the purposes and judgments of the artists and craftsmen involved.
So many veteran filmmakers objected to this barbarism, this dumbing down of their work.  John Huston in his final illness and drawing breath from an oxygen tank testified before Congress in hopes that legislation protecting black and white films would be passed.  Orson Welles told a friend that he didn't want Ted Turner to deface Citizen Kane "with his crayons."  (In what would have been the worst outrage of colorization, Turner's company looked into colorizing Kane, only to discover that Welles' contract with RKO forbade any alterations in the final film by anyone other than Welles himself.)
Incidentally, films can and have been restored without colorizing them, of course.  But what is the point of restoring the film only to degrade it by coloring it?  Furthermore, you do not get a true black and white representation of a colorized film by simply turning down the color control:  the application of the color tones degrades the image's grey scale--in other words, the image appears too dark or too light.
Surely not everything must be candy-colored to be enjoyed.  Black and white has a silvery spectral beauty all its own.  Give in to it, without prejudice.
