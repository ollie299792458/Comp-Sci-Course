Probably the most unintended comical picture in Hollywood annals.The audience is shown a gangland killing (and killer) in the first minute of the story. The remaining 88 minutes of this debacle are devoted to tracking him down, 1954 style. Forced interrogations lasting hours,police harassment,police brutality, a certain sense of pleasure in carrying out assignments,all lead one one to wonder why it took until 1966 for the Supreme Court to issue its now famous Miranda ruling.Anyway, there are surprises:I spotted 2 ancient Fords,a '53 Buick, maybe even a DeSoto. Richard Boone plays his police role much better than he was later to play "Paladin".Everybody, everybody smokes. The colorization is comical at best, with blue and brown color contrasts actually distracting the viewer.The story could have been done on television in a regular half hour segment.It's a wonder to this reviewer that the series wasn't canned immediately after this abomination; yet it went on until 1959, then made a comeback in the late 60's. Just for a good,if unintentional laugh, pick up a copy of Hollywood at its 50's worst.
