The resistance which this film is greeted doesn't surprise me.  It isn't the norm in present day America that the Hispanics among us are seen indispensable, especially in light with the immigration conflict.  The presence of Hispanics in this country had always been consider convenient at best and perish the thought if it was more that that.  Another critique against this movie is that it's a pro-leftist and pro-Hispanic fantasy, gearing up to bring down the U.S. economy.  Only one part of that sentence is correct: It is a fantasy.  More than that it's a "What if..." film.  It starts as a satire and then the film goes beyond.  It's that beyond that brings this film, "A Day Without a Mexican" to the level that includes everyone in this nation as indispensable.  The film state that all Americans--and those who aren't---should not be seen in terms of dollars.  Aside from the movie making its case that we Hispanics are indispensable to America, America, in turn, is indispensable to the rest of us.
