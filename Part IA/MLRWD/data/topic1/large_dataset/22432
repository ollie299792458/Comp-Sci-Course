This a review of the DVD, not the movie. There are as many opinions of the movie as there are people to watch it.
The newest DVD is a vast improvement over the first two releases. The image is cleaner with stronger colors, better matched to the theatrical print. It also has few in any visible mpeg artifacts. The sound is essentially a match to the second DVD release, without the DTS track. The big improvement in sound is on the commentary track. In the previous release, the movie's audio wasn't reduced enough in volume and would often overwhelm the commentators, to the point that one couldn't understand a word they were saying. This is corrected in the new version.
The second DVD in the set is largely made up of previously released material. But there are two documentaries added that make it worthwhile. "Twister Revisted" is an interesting anecdotal look back on the production. Also included is a History Channel documentary that gives viewers a look at the reality of tornado research.
For those of you with whom this is a guilty pleasure, it's defintiely worth the investment.
