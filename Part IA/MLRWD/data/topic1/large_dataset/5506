This movie to me is very exciting. It has action,drama, and a little bit of humor.If you really like to watch movies with all this in it I recommend this movie.I am gonna talk about the dvd aspects of the 1 disc special delivery edition.

  IMAGE:

The Transporter gets checked out with a new transfer for this re-release. The 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen RSDL transfer is quite good, with strong colors and sharp detail. Contrast looks good and blacks come across nicely. Some minor print defects can be glimpsed, but they're very rare.

  SOUND:

The Dolby Digital 5.1 mix from the original DVD is carried over to this disc. It is good solid track, with lots of dynamic range and dialogue is audible throughout. However, some might prefer the DTS track,which contains a lot more bass and is a bit more juiced. The dialogue is a little more difficult to hear during action scenes, but it is still audible. The rear-channel activity is impressive on both, with lots of sound separation and directionality. There also are French and Spanish Dolby Stero 2.0 mixes available.
