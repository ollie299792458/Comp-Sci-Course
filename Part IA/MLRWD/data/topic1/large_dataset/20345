Friday the 13th Part VI, Jason Lives, is one of my favorites in the entire series. It's also the third of an unofficial trilogy in the Friday movies, which begins with Part 4, and continues in Part 5. C.J. Graham made a great  Jason-zombie, though he's not quite Kane Hodder. Resurrected in the classic  style Frankentstein, Jason is now after the now-grown boy who killed him in  Part IV, and hacking his way through everyone in sight to acheive his goal.  I did have a problem with the idea of Crystal Lake trying to forget about  Jason by changing its name to Forest Green. This is laughable. No one would  ever forget exactly where The Man Behind the Mask comes from, even if they  changed the name to Kruegerville. This movie also has some great music by  Alice Cooper, including "He's Back (The Man Behind The Mask)".  However, I think they should have had the same actor who played Tommy  Jarvis in part 5 back for this one, but it is still one of my favorites. In  addition to some great gore, there's also great humor! And I'd like to know  more about that Camp Blood card game the two counselors were talking about.  It sounded like fun, but how do you play it?
