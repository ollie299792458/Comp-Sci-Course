If you're a true fan of Monty Python, this is one movie you'll definitely want to own as it has all the trademark qualities of Python silliness and wit. However, if you're only a casual Python fan then this movie may not appeal to you.
The movie opens with a hilarious conversation about coconuts between King Arthur and some guards on a castle rampart. From there, things get even sillier. 
Another thing that makes this film fun to watch is the skillful animation of Terry Gilliam. The cartoon segment where King Arthur and his men encounter God is especially funny as is the scene where Arthur and his men run away from the dreaded black beast.
Essentially, THG is a compilation of funny skits that are loosely held together by a contrived plot. THG is one movie that will definitely keep you in stitches but it will also let you down as the ending is rather weak--to say the least!
Having seen this film several times over the past two decades, it seems to me that THG was more than the Python gang could handle. This film has an aura of impatience about it and it seems that the Python troupe were glad to get it done and over with. In light of this, this film probably deserves 2 1/2 stars due to its lack of continuity. Nevertheless, this film does show the comedic genius of Monty Python and I would have to say it's definitely worth seeing at least once.
