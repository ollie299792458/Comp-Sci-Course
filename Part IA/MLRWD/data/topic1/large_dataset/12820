The klowns have landed... and they are here to stay! I first saw Killer Klowns From Outer Space when I was kid. I was  5 years old, watching a show that I had been waiting 2 months to see. Until my father called me into the other room to show me a movie that he was watvhing on the sci-fi channel. He said it was called Killer Klowns. I sat down and started to watch it. I had completely forgotten about my other show that I had waited so long to see! I was amaized by this movie about a space ship that looked liked a circus tent that lands in a forest, and inside are aliens that look like klowns that have guns that wrap people up into cotton candy cacoons, and popcorn that turns into snakes with clown heads that eat people. The klowns have so many creative ways of captering their victems. One of my favorite ways is when one of the klowns (who I found out is named slim) is at a bus stop full of peopl and startes to do huge shadow puppets on the brick builing behined them. Eventually the klown makes a t-rex shadow  which sworms down and gobbles up the crowd watching. It is up to 4 college kids to save the town from the killer klowns from outer space. This is one of my favorite movies. I have several different types of copies of it. This movie has it all. Near the end of the movie some corny things happen, but at the last few seconds something cool happends to make up fore it. I stongly urge everyone who enjoys a good sci-fi movie with comedy in it to buy this movie. The DVD of it is great! If your not sure about buying it then try and find it at a video store and rent it. Also when I was whatching the DVD I overhered the Chiodo Bros. say that their thinking about making a Killer Klowns sequel which would be one of the most happiest moments in my life! I hope my review has helped eneyone out on wheather they should check this movie out or not.
