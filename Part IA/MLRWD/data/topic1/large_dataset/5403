Ok. I am a fan of Diary of a Mad Black Woman- it is one of my favorite movies. Maybe that's why I am so dissapointed by Family Reunion. It is done very poorly, there is no connectivity between the scenes, jumping from an attempted murder scene *Carlos informs his fiance that if he can't have her no one will and tries to launch her off the apartment patio* to a light-hearted scene. This movie does not flow. Tyler Perry seems to have tried to tackle a movie that includes too many stories that don't really come together.

This movie does make it clear beating a woman isn't right, but by throwing hot grits in the perpertrators face a beating him with a frying pan is ok gives the wrong message, as does Madea beating her foster daughter for lying. It says abuse is ok in certain situations- he should have stuck with one or the other- by doing both he sends a unsettling message.

Also, the acting and dialouge was terrible. Really. The few good lines were butchered because of the added dramatics. I know the message was for black men to own up and be responsible and for black women to treat themselves with more respect- which is fine... but it also could be construed as all young black men and women are lacking in morals by portraying them as gamblers and stripper-esk dancers. I think this scene could have been done in a far more tasteful manner.

The message is good but the acting and script are too over the top for me to even think about taking this movie seriously. Save your time and money and just stick with Diary of a Mad Black Woman.
