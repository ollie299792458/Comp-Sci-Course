Boy, I was totally blown over by the movie version of the Tony Award-Winning production of DREAMGIRLS. This award-winning film featured a cast that pulled out all the stops to out on a great cinematic classic. I saw this film twice and the music just stuck with me for ever and I still have the tunes playing wherever I go. Beyonce Knowles who played Deena Jones was great, especially towards the end of the film where she tires of being controlled by Curtis Taylro, played by Oscar Winner, Jaime Foxx. Eddie Murphy was fantastic as James "Thunder" Early, who reminded me a lot of the late James Brown. Akina Rose electrifies as Lorell Robinson,. But, without a doubt, Jennifer Hudson really shines as Effie White and deserved her Golden Globe/Oscar victories for her role, especially when belting out the show's signature song, "And I Am Telling You, I'm Not Going."  It is remeniscent to Barbra Streisand's performances of "I'm The Greatest Star" from FUNNY GIRL and "How Lucky Can You Get" from FUNNY LADY.

I urge all of you to pick up a copy of DREAMGIRLS to see this gem. It is indeed a show stopping event and one of the best films to come from Broadway to Hollywood. It joins the many movie musical classics such as FUNNY GIRL, MY FAIR LADY, GREASE, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, WEST SIDE STORY, THE WIZ, ANNIE, HELLO DOLLY, EVITA, and many other hits.  This classic is NOT to be missed and I give it a 100!  And remember, all you've got to do is dream.....
