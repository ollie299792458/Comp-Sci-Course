Ahhh, the immortal words of Martin Balsam's character, Bennett Cross, as he watches his taxi shop destroyed by the gang led by Manny Fraker.

Did I just give Death Wish 3 five stars? You better believe it!

See, people tend to get it all wrong. Good movies aren't only the ones that are well-scripted with a great director and talented actors attached to the project, but if a movie keeps the viewer entertained, glued to their seats, and satisfied at the end of the movie to the point where they'd watch it again and again, then that to me is not only a good movie but a great movie.

And that's exactly what Death Wish 3 is: a great movie.  If you're a fan of great cheese, then come and get it, because this is some of the best 80s cheese you'll ever see. This classic opens with Paul Kersey, Mr. Vigilante himself, on a bus heading into Brooklyn, looking forward to seeing his old pal Charley. The opening credits are barely over before Charley is murdered by gang members and Paul is arrested as the prime suspect.

Death Wish 3 is one of those classics that you can watch with a group of friends and just laugh through the entire movie at all the wonderful moments it has to offer.

Below are just a few things you'll learn while watching this superb piece of moviemaking:

1.  If you're a suspected vigilante, cops will give you a license to kill...just as long as you let them make an occasional bust or two so they look good in the news.

2.  Paul Kersey loves stuffed cabbage.

3.  He also doesn't mind interrupting his meal to kill a couple of punks, but don't worry, he'll be right back to finish his food after he's done.

4.  Gang leaders can call a mysterious hotline where they can order more gang members who will show up to help terrorize in no time.

5.  If you get involved in a romantic relationship with Paul Kersey, chances are you'll soon be dead.

I can't say enough about this gem. I could go on for hours. But I'm gotta go and watch Death Wish 3 again!
