This movie is amazing.  A.  Ma.  Zing.  And I mean that in every single conceivable sense of the word.  It is a marvel to behold, a comedy with an outrageous premise, but told with great poignancy and emotion.  I can't even begin to describe the plot, or really say anything about the story for two reasons: (1) its so rediculously twisted that I wouldn't know where to begin, and (2) most of the fun of watching it for the first time is in not knowing exactly what the hell you're watching.  All the actors do an amazing job, but its not really the acting that stands out here, it's the inginous story.  Never have I seen a movie that is more constantly entertaining from beginnning to end (besides the imminent Catch Me If You Can).  The story starts, and you're happy that its so weird and offbeat.  Then comes the next 20 minutes, and what you thought was weird in the beginning is now Forrest Gump in comparison.  This trend continues throughout the film, the story constantly putting twists upon twists until the end.  And when the end is approaching, you're thinking, "This movie is so great, it can't possibly end right," but it does.  And, oh man, does it ever.  What else can I say?  Being John Malkovich is one hell of a ride.
