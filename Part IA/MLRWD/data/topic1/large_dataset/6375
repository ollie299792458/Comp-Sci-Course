I have seen this movie immediatelly after release and this comment even wouldn't be necessary if I haven't read (by chance) so-called "movie-commentary" from so-called Mr "Flick" (or whatever is his real name). Since I AM from former SFR Yugoslavia (not "kingdom", as put Mr "Flick") and was witness of horrible things, I will tell honestly my impressions about this movie. Also I will tell honestly to readers of this comment that this is NOT my real name, and I won't pretend to be as Mr "Flick": BADLY CAMOUFLAGED SERBIAN CHETNIK!

So...No one movie can be a 100% reality, OK? It is true for ANY movie, as well as for this one. What is important in ANY movie is:  A MESSAGE !

Message of this movie is clear and artistically perfectly made, no matter if some CHETNIKS (and their allies - in former Yugoslavia, or in USA) would like to hear or see it (this message or this movie, doesn't matter). Because this movie is about battle against evil of FASCISM, no matter who represent it (in this movie is pictured serbian side of fascism 1992-1995, that commited far more attrocities in former Yugoslavia, but there were also other sides as well...)

Dear readers: do NOT listen to people like Mr "Flick"!

GO AND SEE ONE OF THE BEST WAR MOVIES EVER MADE, that is not about war spectacle, but is grounded on the REAL people in the REAL times. In one sentence: one small story that tells a lot (to those who "listen" with their hearts, not only eyes...)

Artistically, professionally and technically perfect, this is a tough movie for watch, about tough times in one destroyed country, with powerfull message: EVIL cannot pass, no matter how big and powerfull can be at the moment...

Finally: this movie IS NOT INTENDED TO BE WATCHED, and commented also, BY CHETNIKS (and other russofills, or serbian-orthodox chauvinists and nazi-fascists) as well as - if you have bad nerves...
