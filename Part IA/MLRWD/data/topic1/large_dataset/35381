Simone is a very interesting film about an aging director Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino) who is making a film called Sunrise Sunset and his leading lady Nicola (Winona Ryder) drops off of the set. With little time left to find an actress who will play the role, he receives a CD-Rom from a man named Hank who died recently and had an idea of how Taransky could solve his problem. In goes the disk and poof! Simone (a.k.a. Simulation One) is born. Simone (played by the beautiful Rachel Roberts) is the very actress that Taransky needs and is an instant hit with everyone. Simone's popularity leads to dozens of magazine cover shots, her own perfume, record deal, and an Oscar for Best Actress. Taransky  becomes overwhelmed with trying to keep people from believing that something's up and tries to ruin her reputation but everyone still loves her! I won't tell you the end of the movie but in real life nobody could possibly get away with that act for that long. but that is the beauty benind Simone. It drags a little at the beginning and sometimes gets a little dull but is still a good film. The ending is very interesting and leaves the door open for a sequel but judging by the fact that this film didn't do too well at the box office, a sequel will most likely not be coming.
