The Pillow Book represents the culmination of all of Greenaway's work in film, particularly in the field of digital fusion that he explored to great effect in the earlier Prospero's Books.  This, however, is the far more  accessible film, and is also Greenaway's most 'mainstream' effort since The  Cook, The Thief...  Here his unique style is perfectly matched with his  story, following a young girl called Nagiko as she grows up, searching for  a calligrapher to write upon her as her father once did, whilst seeking  revenge against the publisher who prompted his suicide. Accusations of  homophobia here are quite erroneous, since the vilification of the gay  publisher stems from the fact that he blackmailed Nagiko's father into a  sexual relationship, not because he is gay.  The other gay relationship in  the film, between the publisher and Jerome, is shown without any trace of  prejudice.  Greenaway handles his material sensitively, and as anyone who  is familiar with his work would agree, he is far from prejudiced in this  (or any other) respect. Fortunately, given the complex nature of the film,  Greenaway has been blessed with very capable actors.  The performances here  add a human element much needed to juxtapose the beautiful multi-layered  images that he presents us with. Coupled with great camerawork, sets and  locations and a perfectly chosen soundtrack, the film stands as the finest  work of an immensely talented and versatile artist.
