Bananas, Love and Death, Sleeper, Play It Again Sam are all great Woody Allen comedies.  Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors, and Manhattan are all wonderful Woody Allen dramas.  But Melinda and Melinda combines comedy and tragedy in a most clever way.  It has the most depth of all of his films and  is I believe his masterpiece.

  One brilliant line after another, from the light "I've run out of obsequious banter" to the rich and wise response by Ellis Moonsong to Melinda's query "Tears of joy or tears of sorrow?" to which he says "Aren't those the same tears."

  Allen at one point uses Bach's BWV 847 prelude and fugue perfectly to set the stage for the meeting of Ellis and Melinda such that one is already deeply moved.

  Life as comedy or life as tragedy.  In every way Allen shows us that tears of sorrow and tears of joy are indeed the same.  One can see the comic in the tragic and the tragic in the comic.

  It all flows by so smoothly that it is easy to miss the genius here.

  Melinda and Melinda did not get the accolades it deserves.  Here is my small attempt to bring this gem into the light.
