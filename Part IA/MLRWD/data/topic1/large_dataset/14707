Short and simple.... Wrong Turn was better than I expected. Better then the teen slashers (scream, I know what you did last summer, urban legend, etc.) it's actually good. 'Wrong Turn' was a right decision.
This movie has good acting especially the BEAUTIFUL Eliza Dushku. A movie where there are no cheesy lines like "So who's next?" At least this movie has emotions and actually cares for their friends. The plot may not seem so original but it's a little different then you may think. Another thing is that this movie keeps it simple and not confusing.
Since the producer is from "I know what you did last summer" and "Resident Evil" I had low hopes for this movie as the other 2 I mentioned had failed to be good. But I decided to have an open mind and just have fun. I did. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was this one particular scene where the imbreds bring back the dead friend to the cabin and you see her all cut up on the table. A reason this movie got 4 stars.
Overall everything was great. Not a bad movie but personally not great either. Could've been great great but for that one scene that ruined it for me.
