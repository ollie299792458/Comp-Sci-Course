I love a good horror film, but finding one that is truly scary these days is pretty rare, especially if you're looking for more suspense than slasher.  While The Skelton Key is not quite up there with the best thrillers of recent years (The Sixth Sense comes to mind), it is surprisingly well done, with the final twist coming as a complete surprise to me.

This movie is certainly helped a long by its quality cast.  Kate Hudson plays a hospice worker, Caroline, who is hired to help an elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) care for her dying husband (a virtually mute John Hurt), with the very underrated Peter Sarsgaard playing the couples' attorney.  The couple lives in a decrepit mansion on the outskirts of New Orleans (obviously pre-Katrina), and Caroline is not in the house long before she starts notice that things are a bit off.  Most notably, her skeleton key, which supposedly opens all of the doors in the house, will not unlock a mysterious door in the attic, and her charge, Ben, seems terrified of something unknown.  As Caroline begins to explore further, she discovers a connection between the house and Hoodoo, a practice related to Voodoo yet even more secretive and magical.

This movie does have some flaws, but they are the same flaws found in virtual every horror movie--ie, why does the main character insist on returning to the scary scene time and time again instead of just getting out?  But overall, I found this movie to be sufficiently suspenseful and at times quite creepy (you'll see what I mean when you hear the old record playing...).  Combined with a few nice DVD extras such as an interview with Kate Hudson, this movie makes an excellent rental or purchase, and I would definitely recommend it to those looking for a solid modern thriller.
