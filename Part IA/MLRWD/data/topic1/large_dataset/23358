John Cusack plays an air traffic controller named Nick "The Zone" Falzone, who is a bit stressed but has mostly a normal life. He's married to Connie (Cate Blanchett), has two kids; he's also pretty  popular with everyone, especcially since he's doing everything  "better" than the rest. 
Then Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thorton)  comes into town. His zen/cowboy attitude and his coolness intimidates Nick.  Russell is suddenly take his place. He's more popular, doing everything  better. Yet he's so calm it's scary. He never over reacts, not ever really  reacting at all, to ANYTHING. 
So when Nick sees Russell's young wife,  Mary, (Angelina Jolie) who seems to be somewhat of a drunk, he offers to  take her out to dinner. They go, and after about a bottle of wine, they are  in bed together. But everything's fine. Mary wont tell Russell, Nick wont  tell Connie. 
Then, Mary tells Russell. And Russell is totally calm about  it. He tells Nick that "if you ever want to sleep at night, never  marry a young, beautiful woman." Since he did, he assumes it's  understandable. (Wow)
Suddenly, Nick starts thinking of Connie. What if  she and Russell are having an affair? They seem to get along well enough.  And after Russell offers to teach Connie French, well that just makes Nick  more suspicious.
His suspicion leads Connie to be suspicious of him. And  the truth comes out.  Nick is now really stressed. His job is too much.  Russell is too much. Connie leaving him is too much.... 
And, then things  go on a roller coaster ride of ups and downs. Until the credits  roll.
This movie was actually quite good, whether or not I portray it as  one. :o)
