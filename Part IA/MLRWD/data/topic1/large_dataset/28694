I saw this film on a trip to London in the spring of 2002 and have been anxiously awaiting it's release on DVD ever since.  As the other reviewers have pointed out, this is only somewhat about soccer...it's really about following your dreams and trying to appease a traditional family that loves you but just doesn't understand why you want what you want.  The first time you see this, you may very well miss some of the dialog because you'll be laughing so hard and yet, it's beautifully touching...even inspiring in the midst of the gales of laughter.
I was concerned that this film would never make it to the US (although I wouldn't be surprised if the title changes...never mind that Beckham is not exactly a household word in this country...I would never have know what "bend it" means if I hadn't seen this movie).  It is, in some respects, so much about things quintessentially English (combined with things quintessentially Indian), that I wasn't sure that American audiences would get it.  I'm thrilled to find that the studio is at least taking a chance that we will (certainly the reviews below show that I'm not the only American who loved it!).  I can't wait for it to show up on a DVD that I can actually view in this country!
