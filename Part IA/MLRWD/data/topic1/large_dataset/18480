I walked into the the video store to buy some movies, and like I always do, I asked, 'What have you guys heard about the show Millennium?" Of course it was a futile question I'd asked a thousand times to the response of, 'Yeah, man, I liked that show too. Nothing on it though."
This time I heard, 'First season's coming out in July."
I flipped. Whipped out my credit card and pre-ordered one for myself and one for my buddy who was also a huge fan of the show.
FOX PLEASE put all of the season's out. I'm sure you will. No company only puts out the FIRST season. But, when you put out the last season please put in the X-Files/Millennium crossover that was the actual end of Millennium. The sets wouldn't be complete without it!
For anyone who's never seen it, watch it. It was like having Silence of the Lambs and Manhunter calibur story-telling each and every week. It was dark, well-researched and extremely well-written.
This was a show that didn't play down to their audience. Unlike most cookie cutter series' this didn't dumb itself down. It knew that their audience had a brain.
And unlike the lame rip-off by the major network "Profiler" this show was riveting instead of an hour of brain candy.
It's a show that will leave you saying, "Whoa."
