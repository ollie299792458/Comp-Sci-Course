(The following is a review of season eight of the Office, and not of the quality of the DVD release)

Continuity in the characters...gone.

Respect for the characters and their realistic (everyone knows someone like this) quirks....gone.

Department heads for Dunder Miflin/Sabre...apparently gone since to manage the office you only need sit in the managers' chair...

Others have stated the problems with this season, and I simply cannot write better or hone in more precisely on the issues with this season than they already have.

The abilities of the actors are not disputed here...they simply were not able to continue in their already well-developed characters, and I can't blame such a talented cast for having to execute the whims of writing that was often out of character and shameless. Even the brilliance of Catherine Tate could not save the episodes scattered here and there with her presence.

 In a nutshell, this season of the office is sadly just another example of a once smart sitcom that touched upon real-life people and situations we could all relate to,  hit head-on with a massive sledge-hammer of careless writing and juvenile antics, knocking the personality and wit so far out of this season  that it's barely suited for a  circus freak show.

I can only hope that season 9 will find some way to redeem the office and let it leave us with the fondness with which it arrived.
