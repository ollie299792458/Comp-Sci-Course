Besides the wonderful language which forcibly reminds me of the paucity of most modern day speech, the glorious costumes &amp; settings....one of the greatest joys is the music...Georges Delarue's adds another layer to the rich tapestry of this film. The story is based on reality and gives us an  example of conviction and moral  steadfastness.
The moral dilemma of  giving public assent while inwardly the personal conscience disagrees would  have been an easy way for others but not the path for More. More says he  didn't seek martyrdom. Robert Shaw cuts a fine figure as Henry VIII, a man  surrounded by fickle courtiers who laugh on cue at all his jokes, who  seemingly have no strongly held convictions. Any way the wind blows, fair  weather friends they hold limited appeal for the king, who in his heart of  hearts (conscience) knows that what he is doing is wrong.
After all the  Pope had given him the title of Defender of the Faith (The Roman Catholic  Faith) for his robust denial of Martin Luther's 95 Theses..a complex man  who wrote poetry and composed music (Greensleeves?) lesser known loves  alongside his women, his hunting etc; such a man yearned for the friendship  of man who gave good counsel and who lived by &amp; believed in a strong  moral code which could withstand the gusts of current fashions.
The  tragedy is not only More's and that of his family but ultimately the  King's. He cannot pardon his old true friend;if he did his standing amongst  his people would be diminished so More's fate is sealed.
