The Disney version of Mulan is a very precious addition to anyone's Disney collection.  In this masterpiece, a young woman by the name of Mulan feels uncomfortably pressured to be the traditional perfect bride and daughter of her time and culture in China.  But unknown to everyone who knows and sees her, she has much different and untraditional plans for herself.  When the Hun Army invades China, one man from every family is called to serve in the country's defense.  When her previously injured father is called to serve, Mulan seizes the opportunity for adventure and honor and takes his place.  Tagging along with her is ex-guardian Mushu, a tiny scrawny dragon willing to put her life in danger to regain his position of exalted guardianship, her lucky cricket, and her trusted anti-Mushu horse Khan.  Together they embark on a remarkable journey so save China and, perhaps, herself.  Will she succeed?  Will she be discovered by her commanding officer?  And will Mushu ever regain his position?

Mulan is played by the talented and spirited Ming Nga (sp?) and Mushu by the hilarious and gifted Eddie Murphy.  It is a worthwhile addition to any collection.  Songs include "Honor to us all" and the hilarious and inspiring "Be a Man" sequence.

Personally, my favorite character in the movie was the cricket, and I loved the never ending Mushu/Khan feud.
