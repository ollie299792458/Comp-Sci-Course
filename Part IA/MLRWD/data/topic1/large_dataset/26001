I have read many of the other reviews for this particular film, and I have to say that I am impressed with the eloquence of most.  Really, there is not a great deal I can add to the positive revies of this film.
Those of you who are partial to the book will always have your criticisms.  I am personally impressed with the aspects of magical realism that Don Bluth portrays in this animated film. One also has to keep in mind that, in order to keep an animated film at a length that will engage a child's attention and imagination, the story cannot follow the book exactly.  If the story were followed exactly, the film would have been well over four hours long, and that would be for the first film...It would have to be done in a series like "The Lord of the Rings" (which still doesn't follow the books exactly...See my point?)
Yes, some characters were left out, yes, the plot itself changes quite a bit, but the integrity of the message the book conveys is maintained throughout Don Bluth's creation.
Beyond that, the art forms between novels and films are entirely different; that is why there is such a phrase as "poetic license."  Flood your senses with beauty and color in a scope that only Don Bluth can produce, and forget about making desparate comparisons to the book! This film is truly beautiful and touches both children and adults on a level that is difficult for even Disney to achieve.
