1985 was certainly a good year for zombie films!  Both Return of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead by George Romero were released the same year and there hasn't been a GOOD zombie movie made since with the exception of Dead Alive in 1993.  Return of the Living Dead contains the perfect blend of comedy, horror, and gore.  Couple that with a cast of a few pretty decent actors and you have a winner which is exactly what this movie is!  It all starts when an unknown chemical (unknown until part 3 which was really lame) that has the ability to reanimate the dead is released in a medical supply warehouse and, well, reanimates a cadaver as well as some split dogs.  They take the cadaver, by now cut into pieces, to a crematory across the street that is operated by a friend of the owner of the medical supply warehouse and convince him to burn it for them.  The smoke releases the chemical into the air which causes it to rain and soak into the ground of the cemetery bring the dead back to life.  Throw in a group of punk kids (no really they are punks with mohawks and everything) who are hanging out at the cemetery waiting for their friend who works at the medical warehouse where it all started to get off work and you have the makings for some genuine mayhem.  Sound hokey?  Well it's not the film actually works very well and is entertaining throughout.
