One always wonders about books and movies dealing with spies.  I mean, after all the whole schtick is about secrets isn't it...so how does anyone really know what a given spy's life was like?  That said, when a friend of mine mentioned another series I thought immediately of the great A&E series featuring Reilly, Ace of Spies.  And once I'd brought that memory to mind I found I could not get the theme music out of my head.  Haunting stuff.  So I bought the set and watched all 12 episodes over the three days following its arrival.  The documentary included with the DVD set (which I'd not seen before) did a good job of convincing me (though frankly I didn't really care) the series was probably as true to Sigmund Rosenblum's life as it was possible to get within the need to create dramatic impact.  And dramatic impact is a faint phrase to use for these productions.  From Sam Neill through darn near ever player one gets top-notch performances that leave little to be desired.  I can't speak too highly of the collection.

The one "problem" I have with this set is that it messes with anything in the way of a schedule I might want to keep in my life.  Once I've cued up the first episode I simply have to watch them all. And I find I do that quite often.  Aces!
