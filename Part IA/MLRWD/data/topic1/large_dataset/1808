Ok so we all know this film isnt oscar material or anything, but its got a very sexy appeal to it. The movie (made back in 1995) was given horrible reviews and poor Elizabeth Berkely was slaughtered for her portrayal as Nomi, even though in all honesty I really didnt think she was too bad! The movie may as well be classfied as porn, in my video store its under 'erotic thriller', but even so I love this movie! So many classic quotable moments and hilarious scenes, I would classify this as a comedy rather then porn. Despite the negative reviews this movie has a cult status and i consider it a classic. Its got the whole 'Its so bad its good' concept working for it, and i think it works pretty well. The film has a somewhat decent storyline, good acting (i think anyway) and VERY is well cast (Elizabeth Berkly and Gina Gershon have very sexy chemistry), the dialouge is at times laughably bad but it makes for good quoting as its so funny, a golden scene is when Nomi is showing off her new 'Versace' HAH! So all in all this films allright, good for a laugh.
