I read through the reviews here before I watched this dvd and didn't know what to expect.  I am a fan of the series and have enjoyed each of the incarnations for what they are.  I like the variety that now exists in the franchise from classic stuff to very modern and futuristic.  It's difficult for me to say which I like most as each offers up its own brand of entertainment.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I think it's on par with everything the franchise has offered up in the last few years.  It has a good plot, decent twists and turns, excellent action scenes, and some interesting characters.  The casting overall was pretty decent although Kelly Ripa was terrible.  It's obvious why she doesn't act.  Man...it really stands out and illustrates how good the acting has become on these animated features.  I was also a bit taken back by Bane's very strong spainish accent.  It wasn't bad or anything just....different.  Overall a great movie well worth going out of your way to get, especially if you are a fan of any of the animated Batman shows.
