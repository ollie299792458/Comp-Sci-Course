When i first heard of this, I was listening to music choice sounds of the seasons last Halloween and they played Night Suegeon and Zydrate Anatomy from the soundtrack, and I was like these are halloween songs? So I downloaded the songs. Then I found out it was a movie,which of course was horror my favorites so naturally I bought it. I watched with a few of my friends, We of course all enjoyed it. It's exciting, original and unpredictable. I have never seen anything like it. Paris Hilton and Sarah Brightman give great performances as Amber Sweet and Blind Mag. The Graverobber is awesome too. I have been trying to get the 2 disc soundtrack but no luck yet. Sometime soon I hope there will be a sequel to this. Repo Men is NOT a sequel, it simply rips off this movie, most of the fans of this movie know that. I hope Lions Gate sues them for it.  But anyway Repo! The Genetic Opera is not to be missed. If you liked Sweeney Todd you'll love Repo! the Genetic Opera. It's a movie unlike any other!
