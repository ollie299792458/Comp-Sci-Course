Unusual take on vampires.  It was a tough series to make, especially given the depth of the material that it came from.  I have played the games myself, but find that, I think, the fans themselves were too harsh on this series.  It had only just started, and it had to reach to a television audience as well as its "loyal fanboys/girls" -- if they had hit everyone with the full range of clans, it might have been overwhelming.  Should every story contain everything just because it's neat?  Establish yourself without overwhelming the audience (who did not have the fan's background), then add the detail.  Let's get back to storytelling.
Perhaps that's somewhat harsh, but I feel that the fans might have raised their expectations too high, or expected something entirely different to happen.  When it didn't, they backlashed instead.  Yet, this was a landmark series in several ways--it should have gotten more support. 
Part of the achievement of this series is that, in its short time, it did make fans of several friends, and even random strangers.  One started playing, but most didn't--they enjoyed the take on vampires this series used.  They enjoyed the background and political interrelations.  And yes, the love story.  
It took a complex, rich world and started to bring it to screen.  I say "started" here because it was never allowed to finish.  And, with storytelling--don't alienate your audience.  Immerse them as reasonable and as effectively as you can.  Do there really need to be werewolves, mages, all the vampire clans, and faeries...just because there can be, for a story to work?  Or for the story to begin to develop?
Overall, I really have to applaud the work that went into this. It's a good story, and it was good to see something like this make it to television.
