I saw the pilot episode.
It bored the heck out of me.
I found it dull and uninteresting.

this sereis remakes the Crow. it takes the same story and does it all over again. some of the same lines even crop up again. allthough the actor who plays the crow who delivers the same lines as Lee does so in a rather uninteresting way.

the fact is I dont see why they bothered to remake what was a rather good movie. yes part of it is the actors. not just because its not Brandon lee but its not Michael Wincott. Lee was the BEST actor to play the Crow. and frankly having some other actor play the part is a discredit to his memory. the actor who plays Top Doller in this series is not an impressive villen. Wincott who played the same charture stole all his sceans as Top Doller.

with the Movie you had a good actor playing the hero and a good actor playing the villen. you cant get any better then that.

and yet..several 'sequils' have been made off the movie.
and this tv series remakes the movie entirly
and it does it in a rather boring way.

the action, dialoge, actors, and so on all were uinteresting.
half way into the piolt I was bored out of my mind
waiting it to be over.

if you want to watch the Crow see the Brandon lee movie.

dont bother with ANY of the sequils or this series.
