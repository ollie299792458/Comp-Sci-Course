"Different. Good but not great."  That pretty much sums it up.  I am not a film noir expert.  My movie experiences of the past mostly stem from Alfred Hitchcock movies.  And have only seen Casablanca once, a long time ago.  Actually, it doesn't really matter, I think some of the elements of the past were captured pretty well, it was the plot (or maybe the book to movie translation) and script that really didn't work.  The lighting was well done, the shadows, the music to set the tone.  All of that was done pretty well.  There were some good support roles also.  I even kind of like Tobey's appearance.  The things for me that didn't work were the simplistic dialogue, the kind of strange background plot, and there were no real climatic moments.  After a while, you don't really care what happens, you just kind of want stuff to be wrapped up.  And then when it is wrapped up, you still don't care.

And on another note, normally we think of the heroine character as someone we empathize with.  Our heroine seemed a little dirty for me.  She seemed to be popular in the towns that she visited (if you know what I mean), also I couldn't let go the Nazi angle.  These aren't some of the best deeds for the lead characters.

In summary, better than a lot of garbage out there.  But misses on a couple of levels.
