I know that it's a weird reason to recommend a movie-- but I'm a major Sci Fi fan and also a futurist in the real world (not reel) and I think this is one of the most amazing looking films that there is...lots of kewl visions of the future....the movie is overdone and overwrought...supposedly about the end of the world .....Lincoln Six Echo (MCGregor)lives in what he thinks is an Utopian facility protecting him from the outside world...and his goal like the other residents is to be called up to go the island of their dreams....but (SPOILER here) -- turns out he's a clone - and the rest of the folks are too...just waiting and simmering until their real person needs their replacement body....it's 2019 and they are all waiting for their lottery number to go to the island -- but it's not a prize but a punishment in reality...good popcorn thriller-- but I've seen some people who say it is a metaphor for a political system and a way to deal with the biological challenge of cloning humans too...No matter what they are a kewl couple..Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsson are hot -- maybe not so much together in the film...but individually....as I said everythign looks good -- the movie -- the sets etc...okay I didn't necessarily say realistic-- but sets....enjoy it for what it is....a brief escape from reality to reel-ty!
