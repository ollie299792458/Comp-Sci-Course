I ordered this film from Amazon after knowing about it for quite some time. This is a fun movie to watch with enough battles to keep the action junkie entertained. The blood shed is similar to Kill Bill with plenty of blood spraying out of a victim who has just suffered the loss of a limb.The movie has a running time of 85 minutes and moves along at a nice pace without dulling the viewer. The story is narrated by the little boy who accompanies his father on "the road to vengeance". The boy tells it hows it is  without  being naive or childlike. He has a calm and collected voice which demonstrates his understanding of the kill or be killed world he lives in,which sets a nice tone for the film.The dvd picture is of good quality. The dubbing is good, I've read that they used deaf lip readers to aid in the dubbing process.The only voice that seems a bit out of place is that of the shogun who seems to have had a reverb effect added to his voice.If your into films involving sword play and blood splatter that has the colorful richness of 70's slasher flick this is a movie for you.
