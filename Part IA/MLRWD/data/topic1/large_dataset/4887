This movie struck me on a couple of levels.  Literally the story gives a beautiful but wild African setting.  We see a skilled and highly favored engineer off to build a bridge but confronted by nature that he cannot control.  There is another side to the movie though, because it is a reminder that every now and then the predictable become unpredictable and that includes animals as well as humans.  Here, magnificent lions that we are led to believe only strike when hungry or threatened stop following the rules.  So, what happens when the rules no longer apply?  That's why the movie bears watching again.  I already had this in VHS, but it is a movie that I periodically go back to, just to observe the behaviors of those afraid to the point of no return, afraid but willing to complete what was started and too afraid not to confront the source of their fear and the carelessness and complacency we can sometimes achieve, when we're too good at what we do.  Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas served their characters well.
