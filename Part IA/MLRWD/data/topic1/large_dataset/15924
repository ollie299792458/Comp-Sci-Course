As a descendant of Robert Bruce and many other brave Scots I was relieved to see a movie like Braveheart to finally be released.  It was about time someone recognized what an astounding story the Scottish revolt against  England was.  The movie aside, I dont think casually observers fully grasp  what a monumental task it was for the Scots to defeat the English.  At the  time England boasted the greatest army in the world.  The Scots were made  up of modest farmers and working class people unaccustomed to war.  It  would be akin to Mexico defeating the US in war today.  It was that much of  a miracle.  As far as historical innacuracies, give it a rest.  It is a  movie.  It is meant for entertainment.  It is not my favorite film because  of the history lesson (accurate or inaccurate) it provided.  If you want to  read about how the Scottish revolution really took place I highly reccomend  Robert the Bruce: King of Scots.  If you thought Braveheart was an amazing  tale just wait till you read the completely non-fictional version...
