The main characters are originally set up on a blind date by their two best friends, who datingand hoping they will also hit it off, they don't.  He's a jack ass and ruins it right away and she hopes never to speak to him again.  But their besties fall in love, get married, have a baby, pulling them along, ever so cloesly with each other, for the right.  The tolerate each other, barely, and fall in love with their new neice together, and then her parents die, leaving them her sole guardians.  Unhitched, unfriends, barely civil, with only one thing in common, their love for her.

Quickly they change their lives around to adapt so she can stay in her family home, both moving in and adjusting their schedules and trying to work it out for her best interests.  And slowly, they stsrt to fall in love with each other.  It somewhat works for me as a romantic "comedy", and the chemistry is definitly there, and I was pulled in, but it is a forgetable movie (until I sat down to write the review!).  But overall it is cute and engaging and holds you from beginning to end and you root for the couple and the whole family unit.  You want them to work!  Highly recommended!
