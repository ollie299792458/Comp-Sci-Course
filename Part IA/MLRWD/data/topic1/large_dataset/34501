Singin' In The Rain is one of many movies from that era that I really enjoy. It's a comedy with an underlying love story. It's fun not only in the sense of the story line, but also in giving a very brief idea of the difficulties faced in going from silent movies to "Talkies."

Gene Kelly as Don is fantastic, as he is in any role. The dynamic between the characters Don (Gene Kelly), Cosmo (Donald O' Connor), and Kathy (Debbie Reynolds) is fun and creative. Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) is the perfect villain, and does a great job being in a role of someone you love to hate.

It is very cute, old school humor that enchants children as well. I watched this again recently via Amazon.com's online rental program so that my 10 yr old daughter could view it with me. She giggled and laughed her way through it, particularly enjoying the scenes, "Make them laugh" and "Moses supposes."

The only difficulty I encountered in watching this show was that the volume was poor. I had my computer turned to top volume, and had it sitting only 2 feet away from us, and we were straining to hear parts of the conversations. I'm not sure if that's an Amazon issue or just how old the movie is. Usually volume is not an issue when I use the computer to watch a movie, and hasn't been since. However, this is the first instantly watchable movie I've viewed on Amazon, so I can't say if it is a website problem, or the age of the movie, that caused this difficulty.

I highly recommend this show for all ages. It's clean and fun enough for the younger crowd and thoroughly enjoyable in all aspects for the older crowd.
