Whether you're a diehard Jerry Lee fan or just a casual, this soundtrack CD is worth buying on the strength of two songs - the updated versions of title track and "That Lucky Old Sun".

On this re-worked version "Great Balls Of Fire" we get the best of both worlds - Jerry Lee vocals that are relatively close to the orginal, with the added bonus of crystal clear and dynamic instrumentation on both JLL's piano and the lead guitarist.  This track jumps and stands up against anything Lewis put down before or after.

The remake of "that Lucky Old Sun" is a must-have collectable due to it being one of the few times Jerry Lee was officially recorded by himself on the piano - and trust me, he shines!  In this era of "unplugged" recordings, it's truly a pity that no record company exec along the ruff and rocky road of Jerry's career ever thought to do an intimate album with him.  But such has been the story of JLL's career: opportunity missed.
