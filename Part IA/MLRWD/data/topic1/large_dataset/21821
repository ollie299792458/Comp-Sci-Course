A real departure for the Disney studios, and one of their most ingratiating animated features. The villainess, Cruella De'Vil, may frighten younger children, but somehow, her fearsome presence elevates this cleverly designed and animated adventure. A sketchy, edgy visual style and some endearingly offbeat characterizations combine to create a unique, mature, funny, and suspenseful cartoon film. Sad to report that modern features have abandoned (for the time being) this traditional, hand drawn approach: this film is a great example of something whose look perfectly suits its sensibilities.
The special 2-disc edition features a bright, crisp print of the film, in its original 1:33-1 aspect ratio. Some Amazon fans seem to be under the impression the film was shot wider: not so. This edition preserves the intended framing, and contrary to some reports does not censor the smoking scenes (though there is a public service announcement against indulging before the film runs--odd). Games and "making-of" features are plentiful, but many of the participants are gone now, and interviews are archival in some cases.
Avoid the poorly-conceived live action versions, and cherish this original instead. The novel, by Dodie Smith, is also a treat, and is available on Amazon.com. This may not be the most elaborate cartoon feature from the Disney studios, but it's certainly among the most memorable and likable.
