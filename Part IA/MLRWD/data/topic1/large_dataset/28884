This movie takes classic Beatles songs, creates multiple character stories all revolving around Jude and Lucy's love.  All names of characters are named after names of or in Beatles songs.  Most of the songs are sung live by the actors so that it would give a real and not lip synched feel which no one does in the movie business.  There are many Beatles references mixed into the movie that you pick up on if you look. Each time you watch you pick on more.  Also, they have put many of the feeling of the time into the movie along with many parallels to important people of the era that keeps you thinking.  Instead of creating a carbon copy of the Beatles songs (and no one can do it better than the Beatles), they have managed to deconstruct them to simpler versions that are extremely well done and creative.  The songs are almost like in old movies where you envision what happened because they lacked the visual aids to show you.  I like that you add the missing pieces in you mind instead of them given to you on a silver platter.  The way they used the songs to create the story is incredible because you will never think of the songs the same afterwards.  I laughed, cried multiple times, learned and loved along with all of the characters in the movie.  And to all of you that think it is lacking a plot, watch it again and guaranteed you will pick up more of the plot through the lyrics and you will see how well they really did develop the characters.  The problem is that you are so overwhelmed with everything and the characters that you don't get it the first time.  So, please do not complain about the plot until the second time through.  Plus there is only some 20 minutes of dialog in the whole movie, so you really have to listen to the music and the sounds and watch to really grasp it.  The best movie I've seen in years and the best musical movie yet.
