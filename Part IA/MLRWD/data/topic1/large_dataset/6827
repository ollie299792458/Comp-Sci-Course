I don't have to recap the story on this movie, as everyone has seen it a thousand times on broadcast TV.  Next time you see it, look for the small details and prepare to be amazed.  Robert Wise was a master filmmaker.  Watch how carefully and beautifully constructed and lit every shot is.  Look at the sets and location shots, who since Robert Wise in 1965 has done created this kind of aching, beautiful detail??  Drop any tendency to be hip while watching this film and allow yourself to be utterly carried away by one of the last opf the master-crafted films to come out of Hollywood, right on the threshold of Hollywood's decline into self-important, sneering mediocrity.  Julie Andrews is often castigated for her perennial goody-goody image, but watch carefully one the most stunningly lovely and frighteningly talented performers of the 20th century.  This is a historically fine performance caught on film that people in the 22nd century will still marvel at.  Eleanor Parker is no slouch either.  
Little known trivia - this movie literally saved 20th Century Fox Studiod from bankruptcy after the diastrous 21-million dollar flop Cleopatra(that's 1965 dollars).
