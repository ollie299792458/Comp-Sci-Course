If you are fascinated with the idea of going into space, and you are interested in reality, this is an excellent long look at the creation of the international space station. Could it have been done better? Sure. But it's live footage with no professional acting, and I got everything I wanted in terms of the feeling of the station set up and the launches. It was great to see the school with the kids asking questions. Our news media so completely ignores good news that I really didn't know about the education outreach programs. I have never been to see a launch up close and here I got to see not only a basic 3D view from Florida, but also a nice glimpse of detail from the Russian facility. A lot of these early 3D blu-rays are more about the novelty of 3D than about ultimate production values. If you are interested in our space program you will enjoy this. I also thought something was wrong when the opening sequences came up 2D but it's easy to figure it out and wait for the 3D to start.
