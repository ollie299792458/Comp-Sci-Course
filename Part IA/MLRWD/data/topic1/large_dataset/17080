Would have give 2 1/2 stars if offered.  The story started off with a coup from the Remans, the race that has only been ever so briefly mentioned of in the Star Trek universe.  I found it a very unlikley plot to have a human of any type...even Picards clone to take over the Romulan Empire. The Romulan Star Empire was never written in Star Trek to be this weak.  They had a wonderful underground story established in the TNG series with Spock helping out that a civil war would have made more sense. Spock woulldn't had to even be in this series. Perhaps just some references of his work.
I was also very dissapointed at how little a on screen time that Beverly Crusher, Riker, and Worf and Troi had.  First Contact clearly proved that quality time could be allocated if a good
producer/director were running thinngs.
The film was riddled with inconsistencies.  How B4 come about is weak at very best.  Wesley's appearance in a Starfleet unform is ridiculous if you knew under the terms he left (he nearly started a war with the cardassians and left with the traveler and basically told Picard to stuff it). Picard did have hair in his youth. There are several more but I have said enough.  Add it to your collection to complete your set, but a good rental will cover it.
