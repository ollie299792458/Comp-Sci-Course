The title for this review was spoken by the eeeeeevil Nazi doctor, the expert on Vampires, and it sums the movie up -- quiche, silly, and fun that does not take itself too seriously, and neither should you!

I read the existing reviews, and none gave this film above three stars.  The other reviewers looked at this movie from their perspectives, and I respect that, but I had a different take.

If you're seriously considering either renting or buying this DVD then you are **NOT** buying it for its unique, great insight into the inner turmoil of man's soul.

(If you **ARE** then STOP reading NOW!  Move along.  Move along, there is nothing to see here!)

Instead, you, the most discerning of B-grade fans, you want to see some awesome over-the-top fight scenes.  You are looking for some improbable lusty scenes.  You want to see vampire Nazis -- Boo! Hiss!  (If you cannot hate Vampire Nazis then you are not human!)

If you are still reading at this point then you will likely enjoy this film.

Like Corman, Uwe Boll is the master of his craft.  He understands his fans, and Uwe Boll delivers.

Yes, the acting is over-the-top, chewing-on-the-scenery schlock -- intentionally!  That is the key.  Uwe Boll and his acting ensemble know that this is a B-movie for B-movie fans.

There is no complicated plot.

Vampires are bad.  Nazis are bad.  Combine the two, and they are super bad (er, ..., but not Super Bad(tm) the Movie).

Super bad things must be destroyed.  Enter ... dum, dum, dum ... Rayne, the Damphyr.

She cuts.  She stabs.  She loves like a Houri.

Like most of Uwe Boll's movies, the DVD extras are just as much fun as the movie.  The interviews and looks behind the camera are pure fun.

Clearly the production and acting crews understood the movie and its intended audience.  While there were no doubt long hours for some of the takes, and the weather was probably unpleasant at times, you could tell from the interviews that the crew genuinely enjoyed making the movie.

I genuinely enjoyed watching it.

One caveat, make sure you understand why the film is rated "R."  There are some relatively graphic love making scenes in addition to the over-the-top, red gushing violence.  While you would be likely to guess the latter, the former came as a bit of a surprise to me -- I expected some flashes of skin, but Uwe Boll went the extra mile (inches?) in the lust scenes this time.

Overall, a fun romp for the B-movie fan!

In service,
