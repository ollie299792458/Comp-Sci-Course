Let me start right off to comment that this movie was destroyed from the inside. When the movie was released in theaters in my area ( Chicago & surrounding suburbs) there were only 4 times the movie was being shown a day the first week of release, by the 2nd week it was down to 3 times a day. The 3rd week it simply disappeared from existance. I look at the movie "Garfield" which was a real "DUD" yet it had better distribution. The Thunderbirds movie was a good movie ( certainly no blockbuster) but it was never really given a chance. What if say "Star Wars" were given the same kind of distribution when it was initially released, would it have been a great success???? Probably, but my point is it was given a chance to succeed.

  I am a HUGE FAN of the "THUNDERBIRDS" series, my wife, children & myself have the complete series on DVD & watch them an awful lot. If you ask me SUPERMARIONATION is awesome. It is hard to compare the T.V. series to the movie.

  That being said I hope THUNDERBIRDS does well on DVD. I recommend this highly to anyone fan or not. This was a movie that had so much negative pre -release information that it was a disaster before it hit the theaters. Spend the 2 to 3 bucks & rent it with an open mind. I think you'll be most pleasently surprised.
