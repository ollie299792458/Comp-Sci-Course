For the first 2 HOURS OF THIS MOVIE I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.  Now the most helpful critical reviewer hearkened the director to having " David Lynch-like aspirations " and if this director wants to be the next Lynch, TRUST ME HE ISN'T WILL NEVER BE, NOT EVEN CLOSE.  At first, AND I DO MEAN AT FIRST, the post-apocalyptic, socio-nihilism and utter ridiculousness of this movie made me think of the 80's counter-culture classic " They Live ", starring yet another former professional wrestler ( why is it that pro wrestlers always make these movies make sense?  Probably because of the bizarre social conundrum of their profession, I guess ), in that case being " Rowdy " Roddy Piper.  But where " They Live " succeeded in totally lampooning and lambasting the Conservative establishment of the 1980's, " Southland Tales succeeds only in poking fun at the basest, most controversial and transperent aspects of the Conservative movement ( neo-fascism, totalitarianism, greed, the blase attitudes of the top families, etc.) and doesn't really offer ANYTHING substantial as an alternative.  So the Republicans are greedy, fascist pigs who send healthy, young and bright American kids to the wars in ( by this time, pretty much all of this Middle East and North Korea ) and so what has that brought about, a NEO-MARXIST REVOLUTION LED BY PORN STARS, ANGRY FEMINISTS AND BIZARRE SURFER DUDES FROM MALIBU???  KARL MARX AND FREIDRICH ENGELS MUST NOT ONLY BE TURNING IN THEIR GRAVES, THEY MUST BE HAVING A BLAST SMOKING A DOUBLE-WHAMMY OF " Liquid Kharma " laced with " Chronic " marijuana!  It's obvious that this director is just trying to be DIFFERENT, and doesn't know A SINGLE THING ABOUT ANY SORT OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, BE IT THE LEFT, THE RIGHT, OR ANYTHING IN BETWEEN.  This movie is a stinking mess, just like the moraas the world finds itself today.  NO ONE KNOWS WHICH WAY IS UP AND WHICH WAY IS DOWN, AND IF THESE ARE THE KIND OF DIRECTORS WHO MAKE " cutting-edge " movies today, I'm glad I haven't seen a NEW MOVIE in over 8 years!
