This movie is stunning in every way.

First, there are the clothes and the hairstyles which are the epitome of the high water mark of 70's bad taste.

Then there are Marjoe's "behind the scenes" tips where he coaches the documentary crew as to what to watch for.

And the services!  The music is awesome, Marjoe's preaching is awesome, and the audiences are swooning, twitching, babbling, and coughing up cash like nothing you've ever seen.

Marjoe's sermon in the Gospel Church in LA (Can God Deliver...My God Shall Supply) is my favorite overall performance.  His delivery, his cadence, his antics and gestures are just unbelievable and give Jimmy Page and Robert Plant a real (tax free) run for their money.

And Marjoe's sermon on the humanity/divinity of Christ (Do You Know Who Jesus Really Is?...Because He was human...Because he was divine) is the finest sermon I've ever heard on the Dual Nature of Christ, bar none.  (Personally, I don't believe that Jesus was either a real person or a god.  See Earl Doherty's excellent book, "Jesus:  Neither Human Nor Divine - the Case for a Mythical Jesus" for an exposition of this viewpoint.)

Marjoe's expose of the "business" aspect of religious hucksterism is incredible.  Preachers have to have a gimmick, or as they call it a "ministry" in order to collect big offerings.  How these preachers keep receiving contributions from their gullible flocks baffles reason.

Finally, you can see in this film that Marjoe does have true healing ability.  His energy, his enthusiasm, his charisma are able to put crowds into a state of ecstatic frenzy and the people he touches genuinely feel better.  As Marjoe says, "if only I could do this without all the 'hell' stuff and the 'sin' downer I would love to have remained a preacher."
