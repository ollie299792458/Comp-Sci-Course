Calamity Jane is the story of a tomboy in the Dakota territory during the 19th century.  She can ride and shoot better than any man, except Wild Bill Hickock.  In fact, she's often confused for a man due to the fact that she's always wearing buckskins and a dirty army hat.  Calamity is spunky and full of energy; the only problem is that she can't get Danny, the Lieutenant of her dreams, to realize that she's in love with him and return the feeling.  Then one day, Katie Brown comes to town.  She and Calamity hit it off right away until Katie and Danny begin to fall in love.  Sparks and bullets fly when Calamity finds out, and Katie must choose between her friend and her love.

Calamity Jane is such a fun musical and Doris Day does an amazing job of playing the gun-slinging, whip-cracking, tall-telling tomboy.  Most of the songs are upbeat with great lyrics.  My little boy and I love "I can do without you", and we sing it to each other all of the time.  My husband will even watch this musical with me because it's not too girlie.  The only problem with it is that it does have some racism.  The way they speak about Native Americans was a little shocking to me when I first saw this movie as an adult.  I had to sit down and have a talk with my little boy and explain things to him and tell him that we never talk that way about Native Americans and explain to him the history of the "wild west".  That being said, the main story surrounds Calamity Jane and Katie Brown and their love lives, and it is a lot of fun to see how things develop.  As a plus, Howard Keel is great as Wild Bill, and he is very handsome in this movie.  Overall, Calamity Jane is fun for the whole family, and I really enjoy it.
