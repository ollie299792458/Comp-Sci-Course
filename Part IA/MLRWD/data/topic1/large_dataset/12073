This is an awful remake of a magnificent film.  Most of the elements that made the original a classic are missing.  However, many other elements were added in order to "update" the story, including a female character (perhaps to provide potential romantic interest, although no romantic interest actually ever develops), a rock music soundtrack (which detracts from rather than adds to the story), a meaningless bandit cavalry charge to provide suspense (it doesn't), a character who philosophizes against the evils of religion, and the inevitable (in today's Hollywood) big bad corporate bigwig throwing his weight around against the poor victims of the big bad corporate financial interests that supposedly decided not to bother looking for their lost plane.

Additionally, the casting isn't very good, nor is the acting.  None of the great acting and character development of the original are present here.  The original had at least a half-dozen superb, memorable performances; this version has none.  The main character should have been an over-the-hill retread like the plane he was flying, as in the original.  Instead, a "romantic leading man" had to be cast as the pilot because there was now a woman cast opposite him, and the result is a character who develops no chemistry with either the female lead or the plot.

But possibly -- no, definitely -- the film's worst problem is the inept direction, which relies on technical gimmicks (camera motion, quick cuts, voice inaudibility during moments of action, etc.) in a failed attempt to replace the emotion that should have been provided by the story and the acting.  This and the previously mentioned problems make it nearly impossible for the movie to gel in any way that could produce a meaningful emotional response in the audience.  In all, this a miserable attempt at reviving a classic film -- one that never really gets off the ground.
