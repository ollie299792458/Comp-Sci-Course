This was a very good movie.  I've been reading the comic book for about twenty years now, and I appreciated the handling of both the characters and the themes.  Of course, as a long-time reader, there were a few things I might have done differently, but to each his own creative vision.  Several people who have not read the comic also enjoyed it, which led me to believe that this succeeds in just the right way, reaching beyond those of us who were already fans and engaging the general public.  Handling comic books in the movies is always tricky, trying to stay true to the material, and not seem foolish at the same time.  The right balance was struck with this movie, and I feel I can safely recommend this to anyone who enjoys action movies.
My only hesitation about the DVD is the extra ten minutes of footage.  My guess is that there is better extra footage on the floor of the cutting room, and this doesn't add much to the movie.  The real problem is the way the footage is spliced into the movie.  Luckily, you can turn that option off and watch the movie as it was presented in the theatre, leaving the extra stuff for another time.
There are also two wonderful Easter Eggs hidden on the disc (most notably Hugh Jackman's screen test) that are certainly worth finding.
