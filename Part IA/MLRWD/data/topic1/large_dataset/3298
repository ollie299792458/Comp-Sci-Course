Don't expect the classy style of such films like Suicide Club or Another Heaven.  This is more Asian Anno-Noir (if that can be a description) that is meant to entertain with lots of (lots of) black-light hot glow red blood and cartoon style antics (which you gotta have with the idea of these mutations, so it works okay). And while I enjoyed the film, I wish I'd have rented first as I don't think I will re-visit it enough to justify the purchase and shipping.  I'm always leery of films that people put all these "OMG it's the next best thing to...whatever" and all in  caps and !! like they get paid by the keystroke..........so in this case as in any review...........beware.  (I think they own stock or work for the supplier, otherwise they just breed and type lots). The film is shock-shlock and meant to be, so if you like that you should enjoy this---but---if you are pinching pennies at the moment, give it a rent before you buy to see if this is just quite one you'll watch again very often.
