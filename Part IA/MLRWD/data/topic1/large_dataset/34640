Admittedly, I am a wild fan of Jim Carrey, the man is quite the comedic genius...yeah, he can assume the form of "slapsticky", but this film was highly under-regarded as far as the subtle "poke in the  face" at our TV Land American society which now lives and dies for the  flickering of cheap entertainment (unfortunately, a vast number of  so-called films are included under this category--excluding the Cable  Guy!)...its truly a tragedy that parents use the "tube" as a  babysitter...
My roommate and I loved The Cable Guy so much, I took her  to Medieval Times as a surprise for her Birthday-I blindfolded her and  replayed the MT scene between Carrey and Broderick (via an audio recording)  as a "hah hah"...I'm not usually one to do something as prompted  by Hollywood (I do not need to, my life's a dramedy of its own accord)--but  this one was worth it...
And for the record, so far, Man on the Moon is  one of Jim Carrey's finest films....you ROCK Jim!
Slan agat.
