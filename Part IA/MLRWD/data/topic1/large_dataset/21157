As someone with an open mind toward people who have a different sexual preference than my own I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Ben Silverstone plays Steven Carter, a 16 year old boy stuck between a rock and a hard  place.  He attends a typical English high school where being gay is about  the last thing that he'd want to reveal.  But Steven feels a void in his  life that is there perhaps due to the fact that only one person knows his  secret.  His best friend and neighbor, Linda (Charlotte Brittain) keeps his  secret while supporting his choice to not tell his parents.  She worries  about his safety however, because the only place Steven can meet other men  like him is in the woods at a mens restroom.  One day while in the bathroom  Steven is passed a note through a small hole in the stall.  He and the  author of the note agree to meet outside.  Boy is Steven shocked when his  new friend turns out to be the high school track star and most beautiful  boy, John (Brad Gorton).  John and Steven begin an awkward romance, John  not quite sure if he is straight or gay and Steven wanting the world to  know how happy he is with John.  John seems to have real feelings for  Steven but is unsure if it is "Okay" to feel this way.  Steven  has a hard time being shunned by John in public and then adored in private.  The end of the movie adds a surprising twist that left me wanting to know  what happened to these characters.  I highly recommend Get Real to those  who are open to the subject matter.  The actors did a brilliant job,  especially Ben Silverstone.
