Thank goodness I didn't read any reviews on this movie before I had the chance to see it. If I had, I would have missed out on a really interesting, gory yet entertaining movie. If it were a book, I would say I couldn't put it down. I guess I could say I couldn't turn away or couldn't turn it off. I tried, because it was on pretty late the night I saw it, but the second I hit the record button on my DVR so that I could turn the TV off, it got really good.

Yes, this is a dark, violent, disturbing movie. I worried about the kids in the movie being exposed to such horrible things. But even with that, I still liked the movie. I had to see what would happen to everyone and how it would all end and I was so happy that I did. The surprise revelation at the end made sitting through the blood and guns all worth it.

And if I'm being completly honest, Paul Walker was another reason to sit through the movie. He's incredibly gorgeous, but he's surprisingly good at the action movie thing. I thought he did a great job conveying the desperation of a man whose life is on the line and he's only got a few hours to fix the big mess he's created. And again, the ending was awesome. I also got an incredible amount of satisfaction from the scene with Joey's wife and the weird perverted couple.
