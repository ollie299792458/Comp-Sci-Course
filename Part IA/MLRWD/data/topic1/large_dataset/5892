I have to admit that I liked this film. I was skeptical because Tyler's chitlin circuit plays and over the top comedy that he usually does is really not my thing.  After watching why did I get married, I figured I would give this a try as well and I was not dissapointed. My favorite parts of the movie is watching the interactions between the two great actresses Alfrie Woodard and Kathy Bates. All of Kathy's scenes were stellar.

The love triangle piece of the film was often times unrealistic in how dumb and niave the husband of Sanai Lathan's character was. After the wedding I never witnessed any emotional or physical interaction between the Sanai Lathan Character and  her husband. A woman walking into the house barely acknowleging that the husband is there w/ each interaction- not even a hello.

It's not oscar material but definately a good solid film to watch that holds your attention until the end. This film had alot of life lessons intertwined in the story which also helped to make it more enjoyable.
