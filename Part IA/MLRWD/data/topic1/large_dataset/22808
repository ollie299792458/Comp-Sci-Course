I still remember the first time I saw this. It made my six-year-old self actually sit still for an hour and a half.
I think the first reason was the characters. The title character, played by Mike Myers, is funny and although he is not a nice person at the beginning (being a stereotypical ogre), everyone likes him. A scene in the middle of the movie makes us feel sorry for him, in fact. "People take one look at me and go 'Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre.' They judge me before they even know me."
Later, the line about judging is echoed back to Shrek by the film's female lead, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). Although she begins as a typical fairytale princess, she proves independent, fearless and skilled. She turns out to be the perfect match for Shrek.
The villain, the dwarf Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is also very funny. He's snobby, superficial, and overall just cruel.
But I think the credit should really go to Eddie Murphy, who plays the role of Shrek's sidekick, Donkey. He was probably the first person to befriend Shrek, who at first finds him annoying, but becomes quite friendly with him. Nearly every joke makes me laugh every time, especially when Donkey freaks out because Shrek got shot by an arrow. "Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt?! Oh no, Shrek's gonna die!"
The jokes, as I said, are hilarious, and the storyline is perfect. It's a parody of a fairytale, and works extremely well. Out of the four Shrek movies, this is probably the second best, close behind the second movie. I strongly advise you to buy it.
