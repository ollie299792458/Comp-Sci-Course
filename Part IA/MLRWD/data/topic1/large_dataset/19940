This new 'hottest movie around' tells a poignant story full of taboo, passion, and hidden lives brimming at the surfaces of these women as they fall deeper into each others worlds.  You're carried along watching Simone's more mature "self" struggle to resist the younger, beautiful, and obviously very enlightened, student.  Rebellious Annabelle is young and doesn't demonstrate any real concept of consequence, and is focused on acting on her feelings and thoughts.  This story is tender, real, controversial and compelling.  The film quality is excellent, even if the acting isn't exactly top notch.  Stil, the women and settings are beautiful!  YES, there is seduction, obviously, and man is it wonderful!  The women are just lovely, both actresses are completely sexy and intriguing.  I didn't like the ending, but it absolutely dismantles the "double standard" question and says that it isn't OK to seduce students! (but you can also click the 'alternate ending' option in the bonus section to get a happier ending) I loved the way Simone's past was revealed bit by bit along the way; her struggle with heartache and vulnerability - but while possessing intellect and strength at the same time - was so intriguing.  The evolving and maturing Annabelle was refreshing, but so was her youthful tenacity in holding on to her own set of values.  The way they ultimately let the barrier between them melt away, and find themselves relating as women, unfolds in the "beach house" scene.  Very touching.  I take away 1 star for not developing this as much as it could have been, therefore, ending it in one hour. The love scene between the women is smokin' hot!
