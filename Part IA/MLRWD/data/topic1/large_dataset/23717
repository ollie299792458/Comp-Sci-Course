I would have given this movie at least -5 stars if the scale was available. After paying the typical rental fee from my local video store, I feel the money would have been better spent renting something else. After reading that Vin Diesel and the original director left after seeing the script, my respect for them both went up tremendously. Everyone has principals and after seeing this Left Wing Hit piece I can almost forgive Vin Diesel for his role in the Pacifier.

  The movie started out with some serious promise, but QUICKLY goes down hill. From the Al Gore Clone as President to the Left Wing Stick Man of a disgruntled General of Southern descent who attempts a Coup De'Tat because his budget is being cut, bases closed, and troop levels lowered. All in the name of feeding the poor, leveling the Social playing field, making nice with our enemies, trying to reach out to those who would see us dead. The movie has RACIST overtones scattered through out it's entirety. From the typical portrayal of the Sergeant backing the Bad General who carries a lighter with BAMA on it. This Movie is just the Fantasy wishes of the Left Wing Girlie Boys who know nothing of Honor, Duty or Country.

  I totally recommend that you avoid this movie, unless you are the typical disgruntled Democrat voter from the 04 Presidential election cycle and need a trip to EXTREME FANTASY to lift your FAILED Ideological spirits. This movie is a waste of good film.
