It IS a superb film; I would like only add to what the other reviewers have written here, by saying that, while I surely felt sympathy for the German women's misery, most them in this film, including Anonyma, seemed cold and arrogant to me, and I couldn't help but feel (though I'm not proud of it) a certain sense of indifference to their particular situation. People in Berlin were no strangers to the cruelty of the Nazi party, and some of these men and women clearly admired Nazi ideals. I didn't get the impression that they felt any sense of shared humanity for the Russian soldiers, but only suppressed scorn.  This is no doubt normal with enemy soldiers and rapists who are occupying your city and house, but I felt these people would never admit the possibility of any German savagery; that was something reserved for the subhuman races. However, I admire that element in the film - it doesn't attempt to make any aspect of the situation palatable; and the filmmaker, to my mind at least, showed all these characters as believable people from that horrible period.
