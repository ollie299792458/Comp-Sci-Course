If I were to review disc 1, I would give it 5 stars!  The stuff unveiled for us on this 20 video disc is just fantastic.  The audio and video for items 20 to 30 some years old is just terrific.  I had forgotten just how good this band was with Bon as the front man.  Songs like "Riff Raff", "Whole Lot of Rosie", well the list goes on and on.  Buy this for disc 1 alone, it is worth the price.  I give this only 4 stars because of the Brian Johnson years.  Let's face it, "Back in Black" is their most successful release but the videos from there were obviously shot on a soundstage over the length of a day.  I hope not much longer.  The sameness of each video from it's respectable release just has the sameness to it that the performances aren't memorable unlike the separate video shoots from the early days.  And the songs just aren't as good on disc 2.  This collection reminds us how much we miss Bon Scott and just how great would this band be if they were still fronted by him.  Still an Essential purchase for the AC/DC fan.  A load of videos for a cheap price!
