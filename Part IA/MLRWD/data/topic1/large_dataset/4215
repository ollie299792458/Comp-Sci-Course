The Eagle has Landed is in my estimation one of the greatest war films ever made. A dishonored German Colonel (Michael Caine) and his command are given an assignment by an Intelligence officer (Robert Duvall) to kidnap English Prime Minister Winston Churchill. With the help of an Irish Republican Army soldier turned spy for the Germans (Donald Sutherland)they must infiltrate a small English town that will be visited by Churchill. The Germans posing as Polish soldiers on manuevers in the town easily occupy the key points of the village, but are found out when one soldier saves a little girl's life when his Polish uniform is torn open revealing that of the German army underneath. It is then up to an American Ranger unit nearby to save the town and warn Churchill, Unfortunately the Ranger unit is commanded by an inept, glory seeker (Larry Hagman) who has no combat experience and walks into a deadly German trap. Finally outgunned by the Americans now under a more seasoned officer (Treat Williams) the Germans are slowly, but surely cut down. All except Michael Caine and Donald Sutherland. The ending will not be divulged here for those who haven't seen the film, but the ending is worth the movie. This movie is based on a book by the same name and suffice it to say there was a second book meaning Michael Caine survives, but does Churchill?
