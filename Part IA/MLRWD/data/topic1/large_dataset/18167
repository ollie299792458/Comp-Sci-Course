On the shelf where I keep my dvds this one's up front, right in the middle so everyone (especially me) can see it, when looking at it. This wandering, curious look, seeking the treasure of familiarity is always joined at once with a soft feeling of proud, when my eyes finally meet the back of the dvd's keep case. I am proud to own this movie and I respect it as the movie does respect Vietnam, with all its horrors and cruelties. Watching this movie is like reading "Why We Are in Vietnam" by Stephen King, a novel by Tim O'Brian or the final chapters of Alex Garland's "The Beach", where his main character is confronted with savage war memories. And that's what this film is - a savage memory, a silent monument where the stone faces of the soldiers suddenly are alive with pain and terror, with sadness and anger.
"Platoon" is a very sinister view of the true heart of darkness soldiers had to confront in Vietnam. This movie gives no answers, which is good, but all the questions, which is even better. "Why we were in Vietnam" is a question you can see written across the faces of Charlie Sheen and Willem Dafoe, who desperately try to savor a certain amount of humanity in a terrible reflection of hell where humanity has been lost and death is moral, while moral is death as well, cruelity is virtue and virtue is cruelity.
And the first casualty of war is innocence.
