Sixty more shorts from the vaults at Termite Terrace.  Disc 1 focuses on Daffy Duck and my personal favorite, Bugs Bunny.  My twins enjoyed Disc 2, fractured versions of Fairy Tales.  Disc 3, featuring director Bob Clampett's work and Disc 4 with early Warner Bros. cartoons round out this fine addition to the Golden Collections.

There is really a wealth of material here: twenty shorts with commentaries, several Looney Tunes TV specials, multiple special features and featurettes.  If you enjoyed any of the previous collections, you will enjoy Volume Five as well.  As someone who grew up with the Looney Tunes, and who has been known to say, a la Bugs Bunny, "of course you know this means war!" on multiple occasions, I loved this set.

The only complaint I have about the Golden Collections is that I would have liked it better if they had collected all of the Warner Bros. cartoon shorts in chronological order, like the recent Three Stooges sets (an example: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SSQ7JW">The Three Stooges Collection, Vol. 1: 1934-1936</a>).  Perhaps that wasn't possible given the wide range and long duration of the Termite Terrace gang, but it would have been interesting to see the evolution of their art.
