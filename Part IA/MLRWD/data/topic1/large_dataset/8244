All Muriel Heslop really wants is to break free of her old life and "become someone".  And why not?  After all, her so-called friends treat her as if she has the plague, and her father, the self-serving politician, tells her repeatedly how useless she is.  So, to ease her suffering, she obsesses on getting married, because in her mind, marriage would  make her someone special and then everyone would love her.  She leaves her home town, Porpois Spit, and takes off to Sydney in search of her dreams with her new best friend, Rhonda.  An extremely funny film, "Muriel's Wedding" is also rich with its own kind of poignancy, which makes this a very human story.  I believe we can all relate to Muriel's dilemma: we all want to be loved.  But at what cost?  What I find most rewarding about the film (and let me tell you, the whole film is rewarding) is that we get to witness Muriel's wonderful transformation at the end, where she realizes that what she needs to be happy is to be who she is, not who she imagined she'd be.  The soundtrack features many great hits of ABBA.  All in all, "Muriel's Wedding" is delicious to the core.  The DVD, which features an ABBA video as its one special feature, displays a high quality, crisp, clear picture and great sound.  Though not stuffed with extras, the DVD is definitely worth owning for the film alone.  Enjoy!
