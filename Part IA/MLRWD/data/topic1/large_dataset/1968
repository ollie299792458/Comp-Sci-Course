This is considered by many to be the first film in the "revenge trilogy" of Park Chan-wook, comprised of Sympathy for Mr.Vengeance, Oldboy, and (Sympathy for) Lady Vengeance. I watched the three films in the reverse order that they were released unintentionally. By doing so I found that the message conveyed in this movie to be more simple than in the other two films. I was also less... shocking, than the other films and therefore my expectations were not met in the same manor. This film is no doubt a very strong film and a good way to start the revenge trilogy, but not a good way to end it. Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance deals with the consequences of one's actions, Oldboy with breaking down the human soul and seeing what people find important in the totally raw hole that is created by doing so, and Lady Vengeance with forgivness and keeping balance. If watched in the order they were released this is definately going to give a lot more to the viewer than if viewed last. Good movie, but compared to the other two not great. Still worth buying by anyone interested in the topic of revenge, just not mind blowing the same way the other two films were.
