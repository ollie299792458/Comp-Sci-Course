I think this is a great movie, for the simple fact that Spike Lee is the best producer that I've seen that cares to take a real life situation and put it into play. By doing this, he is bringing non-African Americans into our life and he is allowing them to see things the way we see them. His productions are inciteful and inspirational. His other movies that I am a fan of are "School Daze" and "Jungle Fever". "School Daze" is about the ongoing feud between light-skinned blacks and dark-skinned blacks at a college during the 1980's. "Jungle Fever" is about interracial dating and interracial couples in the workplace in New York. "Do the right thing" is about the feuding between Italian-Americans and African-Americans in an urban neighborhood in Bedstuy, New York. This movie taught me a lot about ignorance and what it means exactly to be racist. I've had a better understanding of the subject growing up after I saw this movie. Spike Lee and John Singleton are two producers that tell things just the way they are in normal life. And they should be praised for that.
