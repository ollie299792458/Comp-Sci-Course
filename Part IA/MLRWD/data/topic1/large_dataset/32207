Over the years I have seen these movies as they were released. In preparation for watching the latest 49 UP installment I decided to buy the box set and watch the movies together.

Firstly, I would like to thank the "uppers" for their honesty and effort in sharing the ups and downs of their lives with us all.

The documentary tracks the lives of 14 people, from a broad cross section of English society, every seven years. All of the participants seem honest and decent and for the most part are likeable. It is a little disconcerting to see the subjects aging - I mean it happens to us all but when watching the movies close together it is actually a little depressing.

The Documentary shows the subjects lives and I am sure that anyone watching can find some parallel with their own life. All in all it is excellent and just like real life takes you through a range of emotions as peoples lives are updated.

Over the years a couple of the "uppers" have dropped out which is very disappointing - I believe this documentary will still be looked upon hundreds of years from today and those in it are providing something of huge importance for future generations. To me at least this outweighs the loss the privacy of the subjects. This is especially true in the case of Charles who is a guy who actually makes his living from making documentaries! Still I suppose it is easy for me to criticise as I am not the person having a camera stuck in front of me every seven years.
