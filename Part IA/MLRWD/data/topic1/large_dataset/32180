Now, I don't mean to blow the whistle here (actually I do), but most people familiar with this series package know it comes in a handsome case evocative of an old book that opens to reveal a Dungeon and Dragons handbook, an episode guide, and a handsome slip case housing six dvds. Yes, I should have inspected the pictures provided closer and I also didn't pay attention to the number of disc, but only because I was baited. The packaging looks exactly like what you'd get with the old set and the pictures deceive you further by not revealing that this is a thinner case with no handbook or episode guide in it! Now I ordered several 80's cartoon sets with this and all were in handsome packaging with descent extras. This is just standard with not even a liner art page inside. If it hadn't been for the dirt cheap price I paid for this...I would have returned it. As it is, the S/H I would pay is half of what I paid, which doing the math, this is worth more to keep, but hardly worth it in the first place.
