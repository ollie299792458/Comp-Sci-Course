Let me start by saying this film is not for everyone.  It's a gritty, violent, and 'ungracious' movie.  It also happens to be fairly complex, and - for me - very moving. On its surface, this is a fairly commonplace "caper-gone-wrong" script, albeit with VERY unusual characters.  But there's a lot more going on than that. First, there is the 'wrapper' involving immortality, and the wish to guide loved ones after death, which seems peripheral - until the ending. Second, there is the love story between Jimmy (Andy Garcia) and Dagney (Gabrial Anwar), two extraordinarilly beautiful people who contrast effectively with the films generally seedy ambiance, and populace. But perhaps the best part is the "folk-lore" dispensed by Jack Warden's character.  I have no way of knowing if there is any authenticity to any of it, but if not, so much the better.  I believed it, and was fascinated. I found the performances to be top-drawer, and appropriate.  Walkin's and Williams' scenery-chewing are engaging - as is the underplaying of Garcia and Anwar.  And - as always - Christopher Lloyd manages to concoct a serio-comic stew. Yes, many will be repulsed by a lot of this film, but the film depicts a repulsive 'world', and - in the end - a kind of redemption. It's not for everyone, and will polarize people.  But, if you like it at all, you'll love it.
