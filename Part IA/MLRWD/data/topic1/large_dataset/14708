Antonio Banderas fans will love this movie. It is subtitled but still easy to follow along and most of the action, and movie sequences can be gathered without even focusing heavily on the sub-script. With that being said this movie was "HIT" and "MISS" for me. One moment you are saying "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT" and the next you have to scratch your head as to where exactly was this movie driving to.

Is it worth the rent?

Yes, if you are not having to fork out more than say 4 bucks for it. There are interesting concepts subtly woven within the fabric of the movie. Such as love, and the loss of a loved one, and to what extremes one will go to, to re-capture what is lost.

This movie definitely has a part where you are saying to yourself "NO WAY, HE DID NOT JUST DO THAT"? Yet, once you get past the initial thrill of that film sequence, the viewer is sorta left in limbo as to how it should tidy up it's loose ends, and bring the film to a nice tidy conclusion. On shock value alone this film is worth the rent, but the conclusion at the end of the film will leave many viewers scratching their head asking "is that it"?

As for me, I would recommend it for your enjoyment, just do not expect it to knock your socks off. At best it will leave you a lasting impression into what can be done, and is done in the world of plastic surgery and the quest for love on a slightly obsessed and creepy level.
