This is the first set of the British series Foyle's War. All the episodes are excellent--some of the plots are so involved that more than one viewing is helpful to sort it all out. The White Feather is especially good. If you haven't already discovered Michael Kitchen's acting style, you're in for a treat. He himself says that he and the creator/writer of the series, Anthony Horowitz, try to see how few words of Foyle's dialog they can manage and still tell the story. Kitchen can and often does tell the story with no words at all. A raised eyebrow, a twitch of the lips, a narrowing of the eyes--that just about does it. Kitchen's face is certainly his fortune.

The sets, and what they call "the rolling stock," meaning WWII vintage autos, busses, and planes, will astonish. Honeysuckle Weeks, playing Sam Stewart, Foyle's driver, get to wear hairstyles that make you want to go out and find a rat to buy so you could roll your hair like hers. The uniforms aren't too shabby either.

Foyle is a widower, and you can wait out all the series without finding out what happened to his wife. I'm going to watch the whole 6 years' worth of shows again for 2 reasons: to see if I missed a scene in which Foyle says what his wife died of, and to look again at all the scenes set in Foyle's home where he displays many pictures presumably painted by his wife, all good. In fact, all the sets feature excellent artwork on the walls. Even more fun, though of a different kind, than watching all the planes they blow up in some of the later episodes.

You'll get hooked on Foyle's War. No doubt about that.
