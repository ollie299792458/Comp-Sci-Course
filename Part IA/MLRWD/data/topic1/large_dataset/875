I have to start by saying that I am a John LeCarre fanatic. I have read every book he has written, books about the books he has written and have seen every movie based on his works many times over. I was really, really looking forward to seeing this film. Unfortunately it did not, in my opinion, reflect the book, mainly due to the liberties taken (Hungary? Prideaux shot in a city not the forest? No...that is NOT what the Circus looked like, Turkey? Tufty didn't die...) well you get the idea. It is also so different than the BBC series and none of the characters in this film "looked" or acted or behaved like how I envisioned the characters, including Oldman as Smiley. But of course Alec Guiness is the embodiment of Smiley...Even George Mason as Smiley, in "A Deadly Affair (1966)" based on "Call For the Dead (1961)" (even though in the film he was called Charles Dobbs) was more true to the written character of Smiley. If I knew nothing about the story it would have been just a slow moving, disjointed "trying to be an espionage film" that made no sense. I wish I could have seen this film without any preconceived notions and expectations but of course that is not possible. I suppose that it would not have been possible for me to initially like this film, but I will watch it again and again to see if I can find the diamond in this lump of coal and it will remain in my library as an example of a different perspective and interpretation of the extraordinary novel it is based on. It is a well crafted film and from an academic perspective, there is much to see here but from an entertainmant perspective it didn't work for me, and in retrospect, it really couldn't.
