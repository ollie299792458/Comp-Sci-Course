Although it is inevitably overshadowed today by Peter Jackson's films, Ralph Bakshi's animated version of "The Lord of the Rings" is actually quite good.  For one thing, the screenplay is a superb adaptation of roughly the first half of the tale (part II never materialized, thanks to financial difficulties) - it is intelligent and literate, simplifying the plot where necessary but not diluting it too much.  The voice work is outstanding (notably John Hurt as Aragorn and William Squires as Gandalf), and Leonard Rosenman's score ranks among the finest of its era.  I'm sure that Bakshi's decision to capture a fair amount of the action via "rotoscoping" (tracing over live-action images) was motivated, at least in part, by financial considerations, but in all honesty I can't see how he could have done some of the big battle scenes otherwise (not much computer animation happening in 1978). In any case, if you view the film with an open mind, you'll find that the technique distracts far less than the hard-liners would have you believe.  For me, anyway, it cannot materially diminish the quality of such a fine adaptation of Tolkien's unforgettable novels.  Of course, Peter Jackson's films are in an entirely different league, but I still regret the fact that Bakshi never got to finish his version of the story.  I think his vision was and is a compelling one, and I'm sorry he never got to see it through to its conclusion.
