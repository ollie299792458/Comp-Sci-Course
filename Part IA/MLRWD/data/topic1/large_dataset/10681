I am a recent Albert Brooks fan, and have been watching his movies from the past and currently as well, and enjoy very much watching as his movies depict his life, always with his unexpected takes on everything, The last one I watched was MOTHER that was GREAT.

In it he finally comes to terms with Mother and therefore is now able to allow a woman to be with him who is supporting and caring, not critical and demeaning.

And now we see the result in "Muslim", a loving relationship between him and his child and wife, I love the way he portrayes them.

I think this movie is really about his being a COMEDIAN and his own ego etc more than anything else, but as he pokes fun at himself and others too, it seems very genuine, I always remember that whatever he has his characters saying he is really saying ....when Penny Marshall is scoffing "Why did you choose HIM? Why did they remake the INLAWS, ours at least BEGS for it!" and then the casting director mentions that he's a good actor, it's all him saying these things.

He obviously KNOWS what's wrong with his comedy routine and the ending of "Lost in America" because he WROTE it in the script , along with his characters stubborness to see it.

I love the character of Maya, although it will be noted that he has her have a crush on him etc......

Of course along the way he pokes fun at the also challenges stereotypes, from the ineptitude of the government, to outsourcing of jobs, the idea of the comedy "That Darn Jew" is TOO funny.....and pokes fun at his own reason for doing all of this, in order to get that MEDAL "That's the NICE one", and inevitably he accidentally almost causes a war.....

It is also about understsanding comedy....Liked how he taught Maya about "Sarcasm".....you can't GET a joke unless you understand basic things about it......"It's called the "Freeway"...but if you don't know what a freeway is or that we have them in California, it won't make any sense.
