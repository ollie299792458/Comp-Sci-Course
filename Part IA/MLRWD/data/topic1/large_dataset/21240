Me, being a Phantom fan, I just had to track this one down. It wasn't easy, but I found an Asian copy of it on e-bay (you should go there if you'd rather not trace it down, like I did) I've never seen it before, but I watched it with an open mind. After all, this is The Phantom of the Opera. What's not to love?

The sets and basic feel of the movie seemed more like a Soap Opera, to me.. And all in all, it was one big Soap Opera. Erik got depressed easily, upset, and angered. But Erik is supposed to be that way, and this is the only film that really brought out that side of them.

This movie is actually based on a Maury Yeston musical. The musical-part has been dropped though, but the story is the same. I didn't really agree with that, but I was open minded enough to over look it. Erik's father was the manager? who shot his own son? And Erik's mother happened to be Christine's 'twin'? Now, I think it is a big over dramatized, but it has many good aspects, don't worry.

The scenes between Erik and Christine are to die for. You knew that he loved her, and didn't want to hurt her, and that was obvious enough. I am a Webber fan, and adore the musical to pieces, but this is almost as good, in my opinion.

There's love, there's romance, and heartbreak. It's another Phantom of the Opera, that you'll be sure to love
