I wasn't a big fan of Eternal Sunshine, but after having read descriptions of The Science of Sleep and knowing that Gael Garcia Bernal would be in it, I waited for a while for it to come out. The wait was worth it - the most creative piece of work I've seen in a while. I've read reviews comment on Gondry's self-indulgence in the making of this film. Who cares? Unlike some films and filmmakers where the self-indulgence leaves the audience out of the loop, The Science of Sleep invites you into Gondry's imagination and leaves you never wanting to awake from it. Beautiful, painful, fantastical, and realistic all at once; how many others have pulled that off?

Gael Garcia has never been better, or dreamier. He played the character flawlessly, and it may be his best performance to date, though he has so many from which to choose. Watch him across his acting career thus far, from Amores Perros to Y Tu Mama Tambien to Motorcycle Diaries to Bad Education (stellar and vastly different performances), and then see him in The Science of Sleep, and you'll realize the depth and brilliance of his acting.

The Science of Sleep is a movie that can tear you apart - superficially cute and quirky but with underlying layers of bittersweet darkness. You aren't sure whether to cheer or cry for Bernal's character Stephane. The visuals are seemingly simple and spectacular. Science of Sleep has made it to my list of "must own" films and continues to affirm my admiration for Gael Garcia Bernal.
