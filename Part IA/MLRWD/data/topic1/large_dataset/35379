i've read a lot of customer reviews saying that they didn't like the movie, it was overrated, and the ending was lame.  I disagree disagree disagree!  i read a review saying something like "why was it even called chinatown, it wasn't about chinatown?"  
this is simple.  the story is about jake gittes.  jake gittes saw some horrible things while working in chinatown; what he saw and participated in while working in chinatown contributes heavily to what he does in the film, and also his reactions to what happens around him.  this is a guy who was forced to sit back and allow things to happen before, and he'll be damned if he lets that happen now.  the ending is not horrible.  the ending is perfect.  look at the symmetry to it...this horrible bloody end occurs IN CHINATOWN, of all places.  
as for "overrated"...that's a horrible word.  how can something be "overrated"?  whether you like a movie or not should be based on what you bring to it.  if you don't like it, you don't like it.  you're not going to see why other people do like it.  chinatown is a fine film, and the dvd transfer isn't too bad.  i'd like to see it on a better transfer; it's not even a cut above the vhs transfer, but such is life.
