This is the best season for the Angel series. It's very interesting and well-written. There's lots of suspense and it's ending cliffhanger is a classic in TV-land. (Think Cary Grant and Debra Kerr trying to get to the top of the Empire State Building to tell each other how much they love each other in "An Affair to Remember; unfortunately, there's that darned taxicab...)

Up to this point, all of the main characters have been introduced with the exception of Angel's son. How Angel gets a son, what Angel has to do to protect him, and where Angel, his son and Corelia end up are all part of this marvelous season's questions and sometimes answers. You have to watch all of Seasons 1 & 2 though to understand this season so don't skip to this one before watching them.

One other note: Lilah from Wolfram & Hart (the ever-evil lawfirm) starts showing up more and more. The actress is great in this role and adds just the right touch of callousness and sensuousness. I love to watch her in the part - she's excellent!
