The Cottage (2008) This comedic horror flick has a couple of Brit brothers named David (Andy Serkis-Gollum himself!) and Peter (Reece Shearsmith-Shaun of the Dead) who have the bright idea of kidnapping a local London gangster's daughter named Tracey (Jennifer Ellison-Phantom of the Opera '04). Things quickly go awry when they take her to a tiny cottage out in the boonies, mostly due to Peter, a spectacularly inept kidnapper. Eventually Tracey escapes with Peter as her prisoner, leaving David and another accomplice to pursue them into the countryside. Unfortunately they end up on a farm owned by a psychotic disfigured local serial killer and they all really start having a lousy evening. Throw in some slapstick, a couple of Asian hitmen, a few off kilter villagers, some sharp implements and some very graphic violence and you end up with this movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Mixing humor and horror can be tricky, but this movie manages it deftly, keeping the situations serious but letting the characters be funny. The whole cast is solid, but Serkis is really good, keeping his exasperation on a solid boil at all the really dim people around him. The makeup effects are top notch and the whole shebang is well orchestrated by director Paul Andrew Williams (London to Brighton). Check this one out, and look fast for a cameo from Doug Bradley (Pinhead himself!)
