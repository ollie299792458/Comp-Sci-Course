This film is much better and more entertaining than the original.It"s an instant classic in my book,mainly because this is Jason"s debut as the killer.He"s a lot more deadly,evil and more frightening than the  killer from the first film. The special FX are pretty darn cool,such as  when Jason"s unmasked and the kid gets his throat slit.Amy Steel is an  excellent scream queen and is the best F13th heroine to date.Shame she  didn"t return to do the other sequels.I also love the soundtrack and  "Chh,chh,chh,Ha,ha,ha" stalking sound,which blends in perfectly  with the atmosphere.I just love this film.I would"ve given it five  stars had it been longer,gorier,scarier and had Jason gotten his hockey  mask ( he looks pretty silly with a pillow case.) Overall,this is a great  film that"s fairly scary,despite that it lacks a bit in the gore  department.It also boasts some good humor ( Stu Charno is a very funny  actor that steals the show at times.) I highly recommend it to big horror  fans who want a great teen scream flik and want to see a cute heroine.Rated  R-contains "gory" violence,some strong sexuality and mild  profanity.
