I am so excited finally the Dynasty series will continue on dvd- I think season 2 was the best of all the 9 seasons -I remember watching Dynasty every Wednesday nite in its hey day and never could get enough- I miss seeing the show and am thrilled I can now finally watch it when ever I want- lets hope all 9 seasons and the reunion movie will make its way to dvd real soon and we wont have to wait years for the entire series to be released. Lets all support this project and buy the dvds and show Paramount we want DYNASTY ! By the way Pamela Sue Martin was the BEST FALLON - I just love her character and bitchness - and Al Corley should have stayed with the show - he was the better Steven - ( sorry Jack).............. Also I loved season 1 - it introduced us to the Carringtons and Krystles struggles from being a simple everyday girl to living up to the rich and their ways-I LOVED WATCHING HER learn the ways of the rich and still beliving in her own values-  ok- I am ready for the dvds now.............bring it on..............thanks
