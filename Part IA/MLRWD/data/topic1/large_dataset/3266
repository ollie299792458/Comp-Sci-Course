Sean Durkin has created a powerful, albeit subtle, film about what happens after you leave a cult environment.  I watched this film first and then watched the short film "Mary Last Seen" on the dvd extras.  I say the word "film" as the difference between a "movie" and a "film".  A movie is what Adam Sandler just put out there with "Thats My Boy" .. the same drible comedy but not a film.  Martha Marcy Mae Marlene is a "film" in the truest sense as it makes you think about the powerful story it conveys... when you watch it I guarantee you your thought processes will still be thinking about why Martha never conveys her story to her sister or what powerful hold Patrick has over her mind or whether she will ever be able to escape and heal from her experience.  And once you watch "Mary Last Seen" (extra on DVD) you will be looking for her in this movie as Watts recruited her with finesse and expertise and he still tries to coax Martha out of the diner at the beginning when she has "escaped"... I say this lightly as she has escaped physically but not mentally... a powerful film that makes you think long after it is done
