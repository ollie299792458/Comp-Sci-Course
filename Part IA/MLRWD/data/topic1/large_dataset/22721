I REMEMBER WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS THREE YEARS AGO I WANTED TO BUY THIS ON DVD BUT IT WAS OUT OF PRINT. SO I REMEBER I WANTED THIS SO BAD I BOUGHT THIS ON VHS FOR FIFTY DOLLARS! I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT IT JUST SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME. BUT I RECEIVED IT VERY QUICKLY AND WHEN I WATCHED IT THE FIRST TIME I HATED IT, I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY BORING. BUT WHEN I WATCHED IT AGAIN RECENTLY I THOUGHT IT WASN'T A BAD MOVIE. I MEAN IT'S NO PIRANHA(1978) BUT STILL NOT BAD. THE MOVIE IS SET IN CHICAGO EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT. THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY WELL ACTED AND DIRECTED BY LEWIS TEAGUE WHO WOULD LATER DIRECT (THE SUPERIOR SUSPENCE THRILLER)CUJO. THE ALLIGATOR LOOKS OK FOR A LOW BUDGET MOVIE. SO NOW THAT IT'S COMING ON DVD AGAIN WITH SOME SPECIAL FEATURES THAT WILL BE A MOVIE I WILL PROBABLY GET ON SEPTEMBER 18. I'VE NEVER SEEN THE SECOND ONE AND I PROBABLY NEVER WILL. IF YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE YOU WILL PROBABLY LIKE PIRANHA(1978)AND HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP(1980)WHICH ARE MORE ENJOYABLE.SO I RECOMMEND IF YOU LIKE OLDER LOW BUDGET MONSTER MOVIES YOU WILL LIKE THIS ONE.
