This is my personal favorite season of "House" yet. Unlike the previous season, the writing team seemed a lot more focused on season-long themes and arcs while still managing to step outside the box. Season Six might best be characterized as "the concept episode season" as its highlights include the double-length season premiere chronicling House's time in an institution; a pair of "a day in the life of" episodes that both work well; and "Lockdown" (separating and isolating our characters during a hospital lockdown, giving them a chance to interact in ways outside their normal situations).

Crohn's Bonus: One of the patients is diagnosed with "extra intestinal" Crohn's disease!

The House/Wilson relationship is in full bromance form throughout this season, and the chemistry between Hugh Laurie and Robert Sean Leonard is one of the most compelling elements of the series. Bonus: someone had the inspiration to cast Andre Braugher as House's therapist, and that was a stroke of genius. Braugher is one of the few with the gravitas to hold the screen against Laurie, without taking you out of the episode.

Regarding the DVD release, there are four commentary tracks (including one on the aforementioned double-length opener) and a handful of brief, but at least interesting, featurettes. I haven't played any of the commentaries yet, but I felt more rewarded by the featurettes here than I did by those on the Season Five box. Also, and it's a little thing, but I really dig the teal layout of the package design. It really pops on the shelf next to the other seasons.
