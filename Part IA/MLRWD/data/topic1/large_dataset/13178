As I began watching this, listening to the narration, I thought it was a modern remake of The Curious Doctor Humpp. It isn't.
Then, a few minutes into it, I began laughing out loud and said, "Good God, this is the worst sex scene in history!" Then she began banging the guy's head on the floor and all the funny went away. It came back, though. And I was in for a shock when I saw a vintage Violet Ray device. I'd never seen one before, but it was instantly recognizable. For those who don't know what I am talking about, it's the glass sex toy thing. It's actually a turn-of-the-20th century electric healing device, used today for (mainly) stimulating hair growth and BDSM. Back to the film.
This is a bad film. The acting is stupid, the plot is stupid, everything is stupid. But it is funny stupid. I have to say the rap can get annoying, but all in all, I am glad I saw this film. I am 49 as I write this, and saw it alone. I think it would have been a lot more fun if I'd seen it 20 years ago sitting in a barracks dayroom surrounded by my military buddies, or in a college dorm. This is a movie best seen with a bunch of friends and a supply of beverage-of-choice. I have to decide now if it is better or worse than Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter.
I say give it a viewing. Lots of fun.
