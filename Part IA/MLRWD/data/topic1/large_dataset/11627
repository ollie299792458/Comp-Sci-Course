I have yet to get this film, but I will write something for it any way.  Every time I see this film I find myself enjoying it, as it has to do with one the periods in history that is a favorite: the second world war.  I like the movies from the era, and the music, and it is nice to see a film that goes into what life was like for a certain family in Brooklyn and how they handle their many problems and still continue to care and love another.  Besides the nostalgic aspects of the film, another thing that I like about it (and I know that others will likely hate me for this) Allen is no where to be found!  He is only the narrator, and I have no problem with that, considering that his acting is stupid and awful.  It is a good family film, and should be shared in this setting, because it exhibits what we were and what we may become again.  Then I see that Seth Rogan is the kid in this, and realize that he should have never been offered the role in Green Hornet (which was a radio show back in the thirties and forties, which is the era that this film is based in) and that that movie was a Hollywood turd, but I digress..
