Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) is the head analyst for a top secret intelligence organization known as CONTROL.  Smart, however valued he is as an analyst, desperately wants to become a field agent. He gets his lucky break when CONTROL headquarters is ambushed by rival terrorist organization KAOS and all the agents identities are exposed.  This, in turn, forces the unlikely partnership between Smart and the much more competent Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to thwart the plans of KAOS.
