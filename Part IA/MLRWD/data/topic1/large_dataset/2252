I have never seen Mr. Show, but I have read that the Ronnie Dobbs character originated from there. I will admit that now I am interested in checking out Mr. Show.
I was actually turned on to this show after seeing the trailer on another New Line film. I recognized David Cross from his appearance on the Drew Carey show.
The opening sequence for the DVD was cute and goofy enough, and I would like to see it appear again on other New Line titles.
The film really takes no prisoners in the things that it spoofs on. From the COPS copycat "FUZZ" to the raunchy R&B video spoof Three Times One Minus One, the film left me laughing ... .
Another aspect of the film that I really enjoyed was the cast's ability to deliver realistic southern accents and southern redneck dialogue. I live in Georgia, and I am familiar with the city of Doraville.  I find a lot of forced southern accents to be obnoxious, but Cross and crew sounded real and not just ignorant.
Another great thing to see was all of the cameos that were done in this movie. Gary Shandling, John and Rebecca Stamos and Jeff Goldblum. 
Two of the cameos deserve a highlight; Mandy Patikin offers a nude scene as 'Ronnie Dobbs' in Ronnie: The Musical, and Jack Black shows his singing chops in the psuedo-deleted scene from a film that looks a lot like Mary Poppins.
I was not expecting a lot from the film when I first picked it up, but I was surprised at the amount of laughing I did both times that I watched it.
