I watched this movie on a late night after my little brother had rented it. I had nothing better to do and thought I would content myself with vacuous young stars and their pointless starring vehicle. I was pleasantly  surprised. 
Apart from more than a few scenes which inspired more groans  than anything else, some token ridiculous and bit characters, and some  harsh cliches the movie is not altogether terrible. The idea of it being  based on "The Taming of the Shrew," though, is a complete  fallacy. It is as much an adaptation of that piece of Shakespeare as  "U-571" was an adaptation of "Das Boot" (and at least  both of those had submarines!). But amid the rapping of Shakespeare and  ridiculous attempts at physical comedy (not to mention the blatant blending  of two distinctly separate cities; Stadium High School is NOT in the middle  of Queen Anne, Seattle)there is the occasional surprising scene. For  instance, the initial jabs at teenage social structures are moderately  intelligent as are some of the views espoused by the angry teacher. But  some of the funniest gems from the piece lie in the almost perfect satire  of American high school students and their social structures. 
For the  most part, however, the movie does not deviate from the standard teen fare.  For virtually every good bit of the movie there is a corresponding bad  piece. The acting falls somewhere between "She's All That" and  "American Pie" as does the story line. The characters cannot seem  to actually stay characters but this is a failing on the part of the  screenwriters. 
My recommendation is this: watch this if you've got a few  spare and otherwise boring hours and a free rental somewhere.
