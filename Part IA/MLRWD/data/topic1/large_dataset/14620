Like some other reviewers here, this is one of those few movies that makes it's way into my DVD player just about every year. It's got just that perfect balance of comedy, drama, action and even a bit of romance that makes a movie great. The actors are all very good in their respective roles, including some great performances by Sheen, Berenger and a young Snipes. Special mention for Bob Ucker as well for his hilarious take on being the Indians announcer.

This Blu-ray edition is a good transfer as well. The picture is crisp and shows no visual artifacts or defects at 1080p viewing. One thing that I really enjoyed on this disc was the alt. ending scenes and what the original storyline was for the owner of the Indians and how they envisioned her arc in to end up completely differently. For those who haven't seen it, the movie would have been the same up almost till the end where they revealed that she really did love the Indians, there in Cleveland and it was her plan all along to get those personal (whom she could afford) and that manager and get them to pull it together for a playoff run.

While I don't necessarily think they should have gone with the alt. ending, I think that could have been equally as satisfying as what we got. In any case, it's a classic I'd recommend it highly.
