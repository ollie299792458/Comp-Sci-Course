So much has been reviewed about this movie so I will just put my two cents in about the performances I loved. Marlon Brando....skillfully underplayed role. When I first saw the movie as a kid, I wasn't sure if he would be a sympathetic character or not. He's wonderful. Ricardo Montalban...one of the most under-rated actors ever. I remember reading a long time ago that when he danced on the Kabuki stage, the audience was not aware that it was Mr. Montalban performing ontage. Although one does wonder why a Japanese actor (like James Shigeta) was not given the role, I loved him in this. Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki...this is where the 5 hankies come in. I'm not sure if Japanese people thought her character was a stereotype or not...I will only say that I enjoyed her portrayal. She was so obviously in love with her 'Joe'. And Red Buttons...steadfast, unmovable in his decision to love this woman. What a sin that racism still rears its ugly head in 2008. Let us hope that thoughtful movies like this one will continue to be made.
