In Cinema there are techniques that make the film - guide the story; the most useful of these are subtle and unobtrusive, usually the efforts of the Director. It is the case with this film that the story appears clear and whole near the conclusion, to which we have been led without spectacular or unnecessary pathos. In this case emotions triumph character so skillfully we must reflect on the movie to find the several beautiful connections. A point can be made the story might have ended ten minutes earlier with good effect. But, in reflection (which a good film fosters), the message of human triumphs and frailties outlasts any minor desires a viewer may wish for the characters. I give it four stars because it is NOT a tale of brothers, even though they contrast in accomplishment. And because there is no message (though there is no rule there should be) but that mankind is an often fragile being, strong one moment and broken the next.
All the acting is superb - and the children are precious.
The CD I received has several choices for subtitles - and the key to seeing English subs is to highlight "off" in the menu.
