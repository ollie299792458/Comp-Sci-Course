I always thought the end of FY was unfair. How could Watase-sama do that to Tasuki & Chichiri? ;__;. This DVD leaves a few loose ends... (like, did they keep the forms from their past lives when it was over? Reishun's parents: "Honny, Reishun came home & she's an 18 year old ...boy...!" & what the heck happened to the book world??) but it definately leaves the series on a happier note. ^___^. That's why I'm giving it 5 stars. Now you can actually realistically picture the seishi growing up happy. -^__^- & all the reincarnations are so cool! They aren't cheesey or anything, so don't worry. ;P Chiriko is hilarious XD & Nuriko is just so adorable! Even Mits is the cutest thing ever. (with kitten Tama-neko!) A few aspects are a little creepy.. like the computer animation.. &lt;__&lt;. & The new Miko, Mayo (she's named after a condoment X) hah!) I triiiieed to like her, I really did. She's insaaaaaaane though... But in the end she did prove herself as Miko. *grumbles* All in all, this is a pretty.. interesting (& cool n___n.) conclusion to a really great series. Buy it, maybe if they sell enough they'll get the idea & get on with animating the seishi's novels!!
