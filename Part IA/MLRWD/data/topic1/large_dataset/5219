Beware, the extended cut of the movie primarily adds minor content changes; there is one new scene, which is detailed below.

The Extended Cut is slightly over one minute longer than the theatrical cut, most new scenes add just CGI blood, most of the time the blood being barely noticeable.

1)  When Zizi's armed thugs attack Toretto's hideout, one of the thugs has his gun turned on himself by Toretto with CGI blood added in.

2)  When Hobbs attacks three of Zizi's thugs in the favela shootout, there is re-inserted CGI blood when Hobbs shoots one and knifes the other.  The neck breaking of the last thug seems a little more brutal.

3)  Hobbs' men fire on Zizi's thugs for a few seconds longer.

4)  Slightly extended scene where Tej asks for a duplicate safe.

5)  New scene: Discussion by Toretto's crew regarding breaking into the safe and transporting it.  They discuss the existence of the bathroom having a ventilation shaft which leads to the garage.  This scene then segues to Leo and Santos.

6)  Toretto/Hobbs fight scene slightly longer and more brutal.

7)  Chato receives a few bloody bullet rounds in the favela ambush scene.

8)  Zizi's thugs are gunned down more graphically by Toretto's crew in the favela ambush scene.
