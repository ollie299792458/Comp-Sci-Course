There were men dancing ... dancing! But let me explain a bit further ... or try to. You see, they weren't simply dancing, they were prancing and frolicing around ... you know, like little boys and girls eating cookies and candycanes in a field of flowers. That's what I saw! I swear it! But that's not all. They all wore costumes, or little outfits, too, as if it were Halloween. These are grownup men and women, I remind you, wearing the strange costumes and doing the dancing and prancing ... grownups! I do realize that this silliness has its reasons, that the film has a message, and so on, but -- sweet Lord! -- filmakers, can't you find another form of expression than this! Perhaps by painting a picture, writing a book, a poem -- can't you illuminate your message another way? Why have you chosen to make fools out of so many men?  And women, too -- I'm not a sexist! You made both the sexes look like fools!
I gave this joke of a movie one star, not because I had to, but because I felt it should get one, just one, for its positive message.
