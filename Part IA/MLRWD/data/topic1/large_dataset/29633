If you like WW 2 films made during WW 2, "They Were Expendable" is for you. It stars John Wayne, Robert Montgomery, and Donna Reed, was directed by John Ford, and tells the story of a PT boat squadron in the Philippines in 1941-2. The film is based on a 1942 book by war correspondent William White. It was made while the war was still going on, but released in December 1945.

John Wayne (1907-1979) plays a PT boat skipper. He was a major box office star at the time, having made his breakout with "Stagecoach" (1939) and then a series of war films in 1942 including "Flying Tigers", "Pittsburgh", and "Reap the Wild Wind." He followed them with "The Fighting Seabees" (1944) and "Back to Bataan" (1945) - all of which did well at the box office. He was nominated for Best Actor for "Sands of Iwo Jima" (1949) and eventually won for "True Grit" (1969).

Robert Montgomery (1904-81) plays the CO. He was a well known actor and was twice nominated for an Oscar  - "Night Must Fall" (1937) and "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" (1941). He was also a film director and worked on several films ("Your Witness" in 1950, "The Gallant Hours" in 1960) and also wore the hat of a producer and for several years worked on TV with his series "Robert Montgomery Presents" during the golden era of TV. His daughter, Elizabeth, is best known as the witch Samantha from "Bewitched". Montgomery had served as a Lieutenant Commander in WW 2, won a Bronze Star, and actually worked on PT boats and was well respected by director John Ford who gave Montgomery top billing over Wayne, who did not serve in the war.

FWIW - This was the first post war film for Montgomery and for Ford.

All American Donna Reed (1921-86) offers the mandatory love interest as a nurse involved with Wayne.  Reed won an Oscar for her role in "From Here to Eternity" (1952) and a Golden Globe for her TV performances in "The Donna Reed Show". I remember her best as Jimmy Stewart's wife in "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946).

FWIW - The real life nurse upon whom Reed's character was based sued and MGM settled out of court for a nominal sum.

A good supporting cast includes Wayne/Ford regulars Ward Bond and Jack Pennick as well as Cameron Mitchell and Jack Holt.

Ward Bond (1903-60) was a football player at USC with his life time friend, John Wayne, and together they appeared in nearly a dozen films including "They Were Expendable" (1945), "Fort Apache" (1948), "The Searchers" (1956), "Wings of Eagles" (1957), and "Rio Bravo" (1959). Without Wayne, Bond was also a staple in Ford's stock company and appeared in "Young Mr. Lincoln" (1939), "Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)", "My Darling Clementine" (1946), and "The Grapes of Wrath (1940) among the 25 films they made together. He's probably best remembered for his role as Major Seth Adams on the TV series "Wagon Train" (1957 - 1961), based on the 1950 film "Wagon Master" in which he appeared. Bond was in more Top 100 AFI films (7) than any other actor, and appeared in 11 films that were nominated as Best Picture.

Jack Pennick (1895-1964) made more films with John Ford than any other actor (41), mostly as an extra. Among his credited roles he played Amos in "Drums Along the Mohawk" (1939), Sgt Schattuck in "Fort Apache" (1948), and the barman in "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" (1962).

Director John Ford (1894-1973) and Wayne worked together on 21 films, one of the most prodigious collaborations in film history. This was Ford's 107th film (including 61 silent films). He had already won 3 Oscars - "How Green was My Valley" (1941), "The Grapes of Wrath" (1940), and "The Informer" (1935) - and made such memorable films as "Stagecoach" (1939) and "Young Mr. Lincoln"- both Oscar nominated (but not winners).

Ford's relationship with Wayne was complex. He would use him in a film and then go for years without using him again, often because Wayne had a successful film with another director. They last worked together in 1940 ("The Long Voyage Home").

FWIW - Ford was injured during production and Montgomery took over for him, helping launch Montgomery on his career as a director. Wayne resented this as he expected Ford to ask him to take over.

Ford's good friend, Frank Wead (Comdr. USN Ret.) worked on the script. Wead (1895-1947) fought in WW 1 as an Ensign and got promoted to Lt. JG. After the war he worked at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola where he became an aviator, and he served in WW 2. In his spare time, Wead wrote screenplays, mostly military, and eventually saw 8 films made including "Test Pilot" (1938) and "The Citadel" (1938). John Wayne played him in "Wings of Eagles" (1957), directed by Ford.

The great Herbert Stothart (1885-1949) was the composer. Stothart won the Oscar for "The Wizard of Oz" (1939) and was nominated 9 more times. He was often used in period pieces, and his films include "Treasure Island" (1934), Viva Villa" (1934), "David Copperfield" (1935), Anna Karenina" (1935), "Tale of Two Cities" (1935), and "Romeo and Juliette" (1936).

Arnold Gillepsie (1899-1978) was nominated for an Oscar for special effects. Gillepsie received 12 Oscar nominations and won 3 times ("Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo", "Green Dolphin Street" and "Ben Hur")

Douglas Shearer (1899-1971) was nominated for Sound. He was the brother of film star Norma Shearer who was the wife of MGM big wig Irving Thalberg, so one-time unemployed Shearer soon found himself as head of the Sound department. Over 20+ years he supervised sound production on nearly 1,000 films, earning 22 Oscar nominations and 10 wins, including "The Big House" (1930), "San Francisco" (1936), and "The Great Caruso" (1951).

War films were plentiful in 1945, but the top grossing films were "Mon and Dad", "The Bells of St. Mary's", "Leave Her to Heaven", "Spellbound", "The Dolly Sisters", "Weekend at the Waldorf", etc. The only war film to show up in the top 15 was "A Bell for Adano". The big Oscar winner was "The Lost Weekend" (Director, Picture, Actor).

Notable war films released that year included Jimmy Cagney's "Blood on the Sun",  Errol Flynn's "Objective Burma", John Garfield's "Pride of the Marines", Burgess Meredith's "The Story of GI Joe", Dana Andrew's "A Walk in the Sun", and John Wayne's "Back to Bataan".

Bataan was a popular film subject and in addition to this film we have "Bataan" (1943), "So Proudly we Hail" (1943), "Cry Havoc" (1943) and "Back to Bataan" (1945).

The film was nominated for two Oscars (Visual Effects and Sound). The NY Times' Bosley Crowther called it "a stirring picture of a small but vital aspect of the war" and "a moving remembrance of things past." He praised the "thrilling and electrifying" action scenes, called Montgomery "a fine and laconic officer", said "Wayne is magnificently robust as his tenacious executive" and "Donna Reed is extraordinarily touching."

Films that came out during the war did very well at the box office, but this film came out in December, and it seems people were no longer interested in war films, despite the quality of this one. In 1946 there was not a single war film released, and they began to appear again in 1947 ("13 Rue Madeline") and 1948 ("Arch of Triumph", "Command Decision", "Fighter Squadron)
