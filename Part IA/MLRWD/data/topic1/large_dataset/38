I'm familiar with the digital copy that comes with many blu-ray and dvds for a higher cost, and really enjoy them. I mistakenly thought that the ultraviolet digital copy was the same as a digital copy, and they were just using new terms for it.
Anyway the ultraviolet is a copy that can be retrieved in about 5 steps which include going to the flixster website, typing in a code, signing up for two accounts(flixster and ultraviolet which become linked) and then choosing whether to stream the movie (free for three years only) or download to the computer. I chose to download the movie to my computer because I wanted to move it to my itunes account, since that is my preferred method of watching movies on my laptop. Digital copies use to take about 30 seconds to a full minute to download onto my computer, but Crazy Stupid Love has been downloading for hours, not to mention it recently changed from "downloading" or "preparing to download" as the status. I'm already annoyed and frustrated with this slow process, and just prefer the regular digital copy. I would not have paid the $24.99 for this copy, and would've spent $17.99 instead on just the dvd, had I know the trouble it would cause. Amazon needs to put clear information indicating what an ultraviolet copy is and how it differs from the digital copy to other customers are not as caught off gaurd and aggrivated as I am. Wish I could return this for the cheaper plain old dvd version, but I've already opened it thinking I could easily and quickly download the digital copy onto my computer and subsequently itunes. Blah
