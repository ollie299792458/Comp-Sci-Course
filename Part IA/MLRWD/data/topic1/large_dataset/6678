I almost didn't buy this DVD because of the negative reviews. Let's set some stuff straight:

1) The cutting and restructuring of this film, as well as the unbelievably inane happy ending, were all done by RKO in 1942 while Orson Welles was off blowing the studio's money in South America. Amazon and the current rights holders (Warner Bros) had nothing to do with this. This is the way the movie has existed since its release in 1942.

2) The cast list on Amazon's description that starts with Georgia Backus is just a fluke on Amazon's part. The packaging actually lists the major players. No reason to give it a one-star review because of this error.

3) The DVD, as of this point in time (July 2012), has about 10 chapter markers. Someone earlier complained that there were none. If that was so, it's no longer true.

4) The print is beautiful. There are no extras. Oh well.

If you're interested in Welles, film history, RKO, or life in the 1900s, you want this DVD. And even if none of these things appeal to you, this is still a great movie - beautiful cinematography and a compelling story. True, the original Welles cut may have been better, but we will probably never see that cut - no one else except for a few RKO employees in the forties has ever seen it. In the meantime, this DVD is great.

Don't listen to the naysayers.
