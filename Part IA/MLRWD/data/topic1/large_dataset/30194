Latest roundup of Technicolor features from MGM's heyday of musicals...most on DVD for the first time.  PIRATE has Judy Garland and Gene Kelly in a fun romp set to Cole Porter tunes, directed by visual master Minnelli, who was Garland's husband at the time.  WORDS AND MUSIC is a mostly-fictional biography of master tunesmiths Richard Rodgers (Tom Drake) and Lorenz "Larry" Hart (Mickey Rooney).  Worth a look for the great songs (better served, though, in Columbia's version of Pal Joey from about 10 years later).  KISS and ORLEANS feature singing stars Mario Lanza and Kathryn Grayson on one double-feature disc.  Includes the 2005 BBC documentary Mario Lanza: Singing to the Gods - a reminder that the man who was the greatest American operatic tenor of the mid-20th century (his records outsold Sinatra's) really didn't have an opera career at all (and died at age 38).  Another double feature is WEDDING and BELLE, both with Fred Astaire.  The first features Fred's famous dancing-on-the-ceiling number (still impressive), which helps you forget that Jane Powell, 30 years his junior, is playing his sister; and BELLE is a pretty hokey effort (almost worth sitting through the first hour for Vera-Ellen's Extreme Makeover from Salvation-Army-type good girl to vamp in a black evening gown even Beyonce might find too much).  DANCING is another clips-compilation followup to the THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! hits of the mid-70s, concentrating on dance numbers from the silent era through Michael Jackson videos.  There's even a section on ballet hosted by Mikhail Baryshnikov.  Don't look for MGM's most famous dance clips, though ("Singin' in the Rain," etc.) - they were already used in That's Entertainment.  Still, very enjoyable.
