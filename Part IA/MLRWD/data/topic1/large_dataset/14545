This movie has a lot of good points.  The story, while silly at times, is overall pretty good.  Personally, I always love stories with several different parties/factions all converging on the same goal or what-have-you, and that's the basic idea of how "Smokin' Aces" goes down.  Many critics have noted (unfavorably) that the movie often shifts between comic and serious tones quite suddenly, but I didn't much mind that. The characters are diverse and interesting, and the actors portraying them do very well.  Vets like Ray Liotta and Andy Garcia are solid, of course, and there are surprising performances from Ryan Reynolds and Alicia Keys, plus a hilarious bit part played by Jason Bateman.  The score is also atmospheric and memorable.

But the ending is really pretty weak.  Forgivable, but just sort of... meh.  It's kind of a big twist, but it twists in a disappointing manner, ultimately feeling a bit tacked-on, despite the fact that it's built up through the entire film.  Weird.  My big gripe, though, is specifically about this DVD.  The extras and commentaries are solid, but the actual movie is in fake widescreen -- cropped.  Considering how heavily the film was advertised when it was released, I assumed the DVD would be of higher quality.  The menus are also kind of obnoxious, but whatever.  And the actual, physical disc looks very shabby -- no graphics, just the title and such in an ordinary font.  A minor issue, yes, but it adds a lot to the overall impression that there wasn't much effort put into the DVD.
