I saw this last summer. I could care less about famous actors or actresses. What has to grab me is the story and the performers ability to illustrate that story.
  This movie seemed to be an almost drawn out "snuff" film. The over-feeding and forced feeding of a person till they die, while filming it and taking odds on bets, is disturbing. (But I didn't like any of the Kill Bill movies or Pulp Fiction either) I don't see these types of movies as entertaining. Senseless killing of another human, even if it is fictional cinema just does not have a redeeming quality for me.
  It was "different" in a sick, warped, twisted way, but I would not want to see it again. If you are some kind of movie buff and are interested in off-beat genera for off beat sake, then you gotta see this film.
  If you're a normal person raised on Frankenstien, Dracula and the Wolfman, and that type of horror is good enough for you, I don't think you'd like this movie.
  Oh, the cop chasing the bad guy is just so unrealistic it's laughable. (Just shoot the bastard, jeez)
  Also, as I watched this movie I thought to myself, "Any obese person watching this would sure find this movie incentive enough to go on a crash diet"
