Can you imagine what is must have been like to sit in a theater in 1953, and see Marilyn Monroe sitting with her back to the audience in a long pink satin gown, turn around to face us with a fan in her hand, and a pout on her lips, and begin a performance that we still cannot forget?  Did the audience know that they were seeing that "something" that will only come along once?  By now, everyone knows that the Marilyn Monroe on that screen 57 years ago, was not that girl at all.  We all know that she was Norma Jean Baker, a very troubled, but very smart, sensitive, talented woman.  She was a huge movie star as Marilyn Monroe, but died alone at 36 in a small, house in Brentwood CA.  In the film Gentleman Prefer Blondes,  you will not see much of the true woman or developing actress.  Bus Stop, The Misfits, The Prince and the Showgirl, all show her growth and depth as an artist.  But, Gentleman Prefer Blondes is the best showcase for that wonderful creation Marilyn Monroe.  She just glows in this film.  Each scene captures the innocence, exaggerated sexiness and child-woman persona that has been much-copied, but never equaled.  "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" is classic Marilyn, and a truly delightful highlight of this enjoyable movie.  It is often shown in highlight reels among Hollywood's greatest all-time musical moments on film.  Marilyn Monroe's legend is bigger than any one of her films, but in Gentleman Prefer Blondes, you do get see how the legend began, and really do understand why we still won't let her go.
