I just came back an hour ago after having seen the second installment of "Kill Bill", and wow, what a great film! Uma Thurman continues her quest to get her revenge.
We finally find out Black Mamba's name and we're mesmerized by the confrontrations between Black Mamba and those remaining on her Death List. This film of course has everything the first volume had...suspense, comedy, action, gross-out moments, surprises...and satisfaction. This movie is very satisfying! It won't disappoint! I was wondering if the secomd volume would be shorter than the first, but to my surprise, the second volume itself is two hours long, and sitting through it really paid off. Quentin Tarantino delivers this masterpiece...and the actors couldn't have dun a better job. I have newly found respect for the talents of Quentin Tarantino, Uma Thurman, and Darryl Hannah.
You really need to check out Kill Bill volumes 1 & 2. I'm very sure these'll be on your top-favorite movie list by the time you finish watching them.
