Notice how the publicity for this set says "from new hi-definition digital transfers?"  Many DVDs are coming out now with the same slogan.  You know why?  Because just about everything is being transfered to high definition video now, since hi-def DVD (and/or Blu-Ray) will be introduced to market later this year.  You know what that means?  ALL OF THESE TITLES ARE READY TO BE RELEASED IN HI-DEF.  Within a few years, it is guaranteed - not maybe, but GUARANTEED - that titles like this are going to come out in hi-def and you'll be faced with the decision of buying them all over again.  This literally means Twilight Zone will have FOUR TIMES the clarity of this current DVD set.  Image and the rest of the studios are ABSOLUTELY trying to squeeze every last drop out of you they can, because they have released this 'definitive set' knowing full well the hi-def version is around the corner.  Yes, this set looks great and has awesome extras, so buy it if you have to have it now... just be aware that in a few years at the most it will be out again.  The good news is that the hi-def set is pretty much it.  After that, there is no place left to go!
