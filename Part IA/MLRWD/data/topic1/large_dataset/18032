I think of Erik the viking as a rare film. It shouldn't be, but that's what it is. The cast includes Tim Robbins, John Cleese, and Mickey Rooney. Needless to say, it's a great cast. But it goes unnoticed. It's an interesting story about a viking named Erik who is living in Norway. After an unsuccesful raping, in which Erik gets a thoughtful opinion or two from his rapee, Helga, whom he accidentally kills in an attempt to save her life, he begins to wonder whether or not all this pillaging and raping is all it's seriously meant to be. He goes on a journey with several other vikings to find the sun and bring it to Norway, which is, at the moment, covered by a grey, cloudy sky. Sadly, it seems that none of the actors who played the vikings have gone on to develop their careers, though several have had some cameos in some darned good movies (Watch for Tim McInnerny in "Fairy Tale" as John Ferret, a very obnoxious journalist). So, give poor Terry Jones the credit he deserves and watch this. Being a Harry Potter fan as well as a Python fan, I will give the director the great honor of saying that he is certainly no muggle.
