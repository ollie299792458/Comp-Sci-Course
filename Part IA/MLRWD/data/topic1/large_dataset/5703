This movie is too good for words.  I saw Rear Window for the first time as a kid, and it captivated me.  It sparked my interest in Hitchcock, classic cinema, black-and-white movies, and something I thought I would always despise, silent films.
While this film is not fast-paced or shocking, it is fun to watch.  It is warm and rich with color, humor, and romance.  It is truly one of the only movies to really focus on the element of mystery and get the audience involved in the suspense.  It is impossible for me to critique it:  like most Hitchcock pictures, there is so much going on behind the scenes.  Even the in-depth studies on the DVD barely touch the surface on all the wonderful elements which comprise this entertaining film.
A cinematic marvel, Rear Window is primarily a game with a camera.  Hitchcock pans from one window to the next and leads us wherever he wants us to go.  Although a technical achievement, to me, this movie is simply fun to watch.  Critics and audiences will continue to discuss and debate all aspects of this film.  Steven Spielberg recently remarked that this movie contains the most suspenseful scene in movie history, and one which will never be outdone.  Who am I to disagree?  Many directors have tried to copy Hitchcock and without success, but luckily they have all learned from him.
