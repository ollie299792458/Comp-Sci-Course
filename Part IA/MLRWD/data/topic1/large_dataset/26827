When I saw the high reviews of this film I was tempted to buy it, but decided to just rent it on my netflix acct. instead. Man, am I glad I did! This movie was soooo stupid!!!

The movie was done in 1996, but looked like an early 80's "B" movie!

The central character was annoying - unlikeable - robotic - unattractive - unappealing - moronic - and lacked common sense; and it didn't help her hair looked like a bad hairdo from the 70's; it reminded me of that Krug guy on the "Last House on the Left" original version.

On top of this things developed, and unfolded that were so cliche, predictable, and even comical.

The most shocking thing about this film isn't the content, but how poorly executed it was; and then the ending was laughable.

For the sake of spoilers I won't go into detail - just know that most horror fans will be pretty disappointed; just like the security officer in the opening sequence said to the crowd, "There's nothing to see here!" are my exact words to curious movie goers considering watching this.
