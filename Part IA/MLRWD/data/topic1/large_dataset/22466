This DVD isn't out until October, but based on the trailer and the webisodes called 'Pixie Previews', there is plenty to base an opinion on to help people in their decision to purchase this DVD.

First, the Movie trailer and `Pixie Previews' are available to watch on youtube and Disney.com and they give a good introduction as to what to expect from this DVD. While not Pixar quality, the CGI featured shows a quality not unlike what we've seen in Chicken Little.

Second, an internet search helped reveal some of the DVD bonus features. Separated into two categories they are:

PIXIE HOLLOW - explores the world of the Fairies:
-Magical Guide to Pixie Hollow
-Tinker Trainer DVD ROM
-Ever Wonder Featurette

THE MAINLAND - explores the making of the movie:
-Creating Pixie Hollow
-Deleted Scenes

Third, I'm assuming that the trailer and the series of 6 `Pixie Preview' webisodes will also be included. Each webisode is about 2 minutes long and are creatively done to help introduce people to TinkerBell and the other Pixies (Not to mention the CGI world they will inhabit). These are:

Tink and the Bell
Tink and the Pepper Shaker
Fawn and the Log
Fawn and the Butterfly
Silvermist and the Fish
Iridessa and the Light Bugs
Rosetta and the Flower (There are apparently two versions of this one making the actual total to 7 webisodes.)

This Direct-to-DVD feature is also the first of 4 releases and the DVD will no-doubt boast at lease one trailer for these next releases:

Tinker Bell: North of Neverland (2009)
Tinker Bell: A Midsummer Storm (summer 2010)
Tinker Bell: A Winter Story (summer 2011)

And last but not least, this Direct-to-DVD feature will be a first for Disney. TinkerBell will talk! Mae Whitman will give Tinker Bell her first true voice. That is definitely something to look forward to!

In closing I give this 4 stars with the 5th in reserve for the actual film.
