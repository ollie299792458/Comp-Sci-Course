These Saturday morning cartoons bring back memories of sitting in front of the TV in my pajamas waiting for my Mother to fix breakfast.  Those were happy days - and carefree days.  These cartoons help bring back a lot of those memories.  From Porky Pig to Quick Draw McGraw to Aussie Doggie (a favorite of mine), these cartoons have some of the cartoons that made Saturday morning Classic!  I got my volume at my local Best Buy

This first volume is one of three different Saturday Morning Cartoon volumes there is also a second volume, so if you don't see your favorite cartoon on these disc, make sure you buy 1960s Volume 2.  There is also the 1970s and the 1980s. The 1970s has 2 volumes also, but I haven't seen 1980s Volume 2.  Maybe I've just missed it.

But 19960s Volume 1 is, by far, my favorite volume.  In addition to the ones I mentioned above, I also like Atom Ant and Secret Squirrel.  Secret Squirrel came back in the 1990s as an interim feature on 2 Stupid Dogs - a classic in its own right.

I'm surprised that they were able to bring together all these cartoons from different studios at such a reasonable price (although Hanna-Barbera is represented the most).  I'm also surprised that they state on the product page that this volume is for adult collectors, not suitable for children.  Have our standards for Saturday morning cartoons changed so much as to make these cartoons politically incorrect?  I don't have kids, I bought this volume purely for nostalgia sake, so I really can't say if these are inappropriate for kids.  It just surprises me that that is stated on the product page.

This is a great volume - I'm certainly glad it is around in my DVD library.
