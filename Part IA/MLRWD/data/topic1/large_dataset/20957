Not many films like "The Chumscrubber" come along any more. This satirical dark comedy will leave you reeling and give you plenty to think about. I don't think I have to give you a summery since you can get that anywhere, but the basic point of the film is parents don't pay enough attention to their children - a problem in every American suburb that gets worse everyday. Things may seem exaggerated at times (such as Rita Wilson's character not noticing her child is missing for three days because she's too obsessed with her upcoming wedding), but exaggeration is a commonly used device in any satire and simply helps to illustrate the point of the film.

At times, however, the adults start to be a little over-the-top. Enter Ralph Fiennes as Mayor Michael Ebbs. He's the only adult (in fact, the only person!) in the entire film that seems truly happy, albeit, truly strange as well. Fiennes provides just enough comic relief to keep the rest of the film from getting old while still being thought provoking and intense.

I feel it should be mandatory that all parents and teenagers watch "The Chumscrubber". It lets kids see that we're anything but alone; everyone feels the same way at some point. It's an important film for parents because it gives them the opportunity to see themselves through the eyes of their teen.
