Weak forced dialogue, silly overly thought plot, unsympathetic characters, and unfunny and you have Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. I saw a clip of Robert Downey accidentally audition for a part from this movie and thought it was going to be a funny movie about a mix up, where a crook gets to be come an actor solving a murder mystery.

Instead, I got a bunch of unwatchable nonsense with a unbelievable plot, uninteresting characters, forced unnatural over the top dialogue, an annoying Robert Downey, and a supposed love story subplot with zero chemistry. The movie is hard to follow which is why they have narration in the beginning, since this doesn't even resemble any film noir flick I have ever seen.

At the end I found myself feeling like I wasted 1 Â½ hours for characters I didn't care about and a plot I wasn't interested in, and the worst part is I didn't even laugh one single time. Robert Downey sums it up in narration at the end, "it's a dumb movie." He is right, and I don't understand anyone who thought this was actually a good movie.
