I like traditional horror. I like HP Lovecraft. I like Neil Gaiman, I like Clark Ashton Smith, William Hope Hodgson and many others. I like John Carpenter's "The Thing" and I like the new version of the film. I own and enjoy "Dagon," "At the Mouth of Madness," "Event Horizon," "The New Daughter" and tons of other things. This film is not art like the above works. This is a film which is conceptually so depraved that it really is pornography. It is about torture, the eating of feces and humiliation of people. I don't see ANY redeeming qualities in it and I agree with Sho that this type of garbage is what is bringing down our civilization. I am no puritan and I am not a religious fundamentalist, nor a political neo-con, nor a politically correct fascist. This film has NO purpose for being. Some of you see nothing sick about it? It is about deviant sexuality...there is a site on fb about "People Who VIOLENTLY Masturbate to Human Centipede." Ok...it's not hurting anyone? Will we still say that when some copycat thinks it would be cool to try this. I've done some things in my life that I'm not proud of, but I know right from wrong and this movie and especially it's sequel are just plain wrong. I know that the sick stuff is implied...that doesn't make any difference...the second flick goes a lot further, including slurping and gurgling noises as the people ingest excrement. Come on...they're sick movies made by a sick mind. What I don't understand is that the actors are well schooled and not just some nut jobs or bimbos...being in these films are career killers, unless one aspires for nothing more than grade z film status.
