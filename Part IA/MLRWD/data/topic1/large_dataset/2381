Okay first let me say that if you're looking for this tape to excel the original or for lot's of possesion scenes this will be a let down. Personally I thought this movie wasn't as bad as many say. It's nice to see an older Reagan and how she moves on with her life. This movie is more about the demon Pazuzu himself. It answers a few questions I had about the first which was nice. A big thing was the music . I thought that the finale (Regan's theme) was beautiful. I don't think Linda Blair gives such a bad preformance either. Okay time for the downside. The movie does drag on a lot and can come to be quite confusing. However if you watch it a few times it will come clear to you in time. What bugs me the most is Blatty stated in his novel and in the movie Regan was choosen to be possesed to show that all humans are evil and ugly. What it was saying was that if that demon could posses an innocent child and turn her into something twisted ...what does that seem to say? Well what bugged me is that in this movie they suggest Regan was choosen for a diffrent purpose. Because she was an angel or a healer. Something like that. Also the first one mentions that she doesn't remember. So she couldn't possibly know she had a demon inside her as they suggest in the sequal. Somethings don't match up but overall this movie ain't bad. Give it try and watch with an open mind.
