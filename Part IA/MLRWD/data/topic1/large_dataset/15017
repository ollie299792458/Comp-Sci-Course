A really good show for the fans of SF and fantasy. Nice team of characters, an interesting central idea, even some good acting (that point unfortunately does not apply to the blond daughter persona). Amanda Tapping is simply amazing. I have never seen her before and was much impressed. She is also an extremely good choice for an "immortal" - she has a face of a beautiful young woman but her eyes are truly ageless.

There are some fascinating twists of well known historical figures like Tesla or Jack the Ripper. Episode plots are generally well put together, without (or nearly without) too much of a deux ex machina effects. The whole also fortunately lacks sentimentality and pathos, the heroes take their situation and themselves with a bit of a grin (sometimes werewolfish).

Strangely for some reason Sanctuary reminded me of the Firefly - perhaps as it too has a bit of a "frontiere" feeling to it. Or because it too is a very well balanced mix of different genres and ideas.
