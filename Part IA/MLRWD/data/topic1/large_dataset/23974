About 40,000 years ago, give or take a day, there was a 'great leap forward' when paliolithic cromag man began to think abstractly and symbolically.  They no longer simply survived in the world but they began to interpret it and reproduce it in sculptural art and drawings. They began to hone skills that were beyond those needed for basic survival.  Neanderthal man however never had this mysterious ability.  Perhaps that had something to do with their demise.  I also read that if the neanderthal birthrate was 2% higher or deathrate 2% lower they may've survived. Maybe it was simple math, or maybe it was the inability to think abstractly, or maybe both. It's a mystery...the stunning art in this cave was drawn for over 5,000 years from 33 to 28 thousand years ago.  Many of the drawings were in conjunction with each other like a mind-bogglingly long ongoing art project.  the cave was sealed shut by a rock slide about 20,ooo years ago which I guess helped preserve the drawings.  I wonder why there were no drawings during the 8,000 years before the rock slide because apparently the cave would've still been functional then....so many mysteries so little time.  If anyone knows, please inform.  thanks
