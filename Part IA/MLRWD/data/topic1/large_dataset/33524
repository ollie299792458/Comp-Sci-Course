In my youth, in the '60s, I used to dash about the house, tossing my hair back off my face as Emma Peel did! Ah, to have been she--a dashing, beautiful super-spy who could more than hold her own with the gallant Steed! And she was better than he at the spying game--as women in non-traditional roles in the 1960's HAD to be, in order to be respected in the same (masculine) field. I am so grateful to have had Emma Peel as a role model, even as I struggled to rise beyond the diapers and dinner-making that my gender had channeled me into without really internalizing any other options. But Emma Peel taught me that I really could do anything, and eventually, I did! Two children, two husbands, two graduate degrees, and 20+ years of college teaching later, I am blessed in my retirement to again be able to dash about the house with the hero of my youth, tossing my hair off my aging face with a grin. And you young women who find Mrs. Peel's sly demure to Steed disgustingly subservient, look at the original broadcast dates again.
