The new "Space Jam" 2-Disc DVD is a fun addition to any Looney Tunes or family DVD collection.  
Disc One features the film, which can be enjoyed with commentary from the director, as well as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.  Most DVD commentaries are a bore to sit through--and this one does have its over technical moments (especially if you have young children who "believe in" Bugs or Daffy), but the comments from the characters are very witty--including a jab that Bugs throws at Michael Jordan early in the presentation (concerning his brief baseball career).
Rounding out the first disc is the theatrical trailer of the film (this is almost a MUST with me for any DVD).
The Second Disc is a nice bonus and could have easily been packaged as a stand-alone item.  It features a "Making of Space Jam" and several Looney Tunes shorts (from the 1980's and 1990's), as well as the 1988 television special, "Bugs vs. Daffy:  Battle of the Music Video Stars".  Speaking of music videos, the second disc also features "Fly Like an Eagle" and "Monstars Anthem".
This is a great gift for any Looney Tunes fan.  Folks who liked it as children in 1996 (when the film was released) should still like it as teens.  Children who have never seen it will also enjoy it. In short, it's a keeper.
