This movie will appeal to those who enjoy Jane Austen productions like Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensability.  It is set mostly in England of the late 1800's/early 1900's among the aristocracy, tracing the plight  of four "noveau riche" American girls.  The movie opens in  America where the girls are scorned by the old money for being new money,  so they head off to England for a "London Season".  The hope is  that after spending a few months in the esteemed society of the English  nobility, the New York aristocracy would have no choice but to accept the  girls and their families into NY high society.  In England however, things  do not go as planned.
Unlike Jane Austen's movies, where the girls always  make good marriages in the end, and the bad marriages are always portrayed  in a comical way, The Buccaneers portrays events in a much darker, more  realistic way.  The aristocracy (which at this point in history is  suffering, financially) is preying on the young women for their money, and  the young women, some of them, as stalking the men for their titles.  Most  marriages are not made for love, and even in those that are, there is a  price to be paid to maintain respectability.  With main characters also  including a governess, a high-priced mistress, and an un-married  matchmkater, this movie also explores the alternatives for women who didn't  wish to marry, and the very stiff consequences facing a woman who wished to  be free.
This is a beautiful, provocative movie.
