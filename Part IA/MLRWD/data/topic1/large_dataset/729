The Fabulous Mr. Fox is a brilliant film done in a fanciful, uncommon style.  I took my kids and their friends, age range 9 to 13, and all loved it.  Some adults I have talked to just hated it, or didn't get it, or saw it as a propoganda film.  I am an adult, and I just loved it.

*** Spoiler alert! ****

This story sets a nice foundation and builds upon itself through its characters.  It is presented using (now-rare) stop animation.  The style is colorized with an orange/brown scheme (sunrise, sunset) and is nearly perfectly voiced.  It is recognizable as a Roald Dahl book, and also as a Wes Anderson film.  It is appropriate as a kids' movie, but it is also a nonreligious, nondramatic parable regarding the human behavior to regress to your instincts.  "Wild animals" need to be kept in check, but tend toward activities not well received by the [in this case, woman] who would otherwise 'keep' us back in civilization (as regarded).  Mr. Fox has a trademark whistle and a guilty, 'silly-me' grin -- he knows what he is and how he is received.  But, then again,(!) the future wife was also front and center in the original schemes as well....and yet demands we regress into what is proper.  She is here more risk averse, not as daring, and probably not nearly as 'stupid.'  She is more civilized.  Ponder the situation, and it hints about why we allow ourselves to be captive and to conform.

Also note some parallels to Roald Dahl himself: has was a writer, very athletically capable, captain of several teams (very tall too), was a pilot in Africa in WWII and reputedly engaged in espionage.  Read 'Going Solo,' his autobiography, if you want to learn more (it's also very good.)

I'm going to watch this one over again.  Fun, fun stuff!
