This film gave me an appreciation for the cars of the 1970s...  I was just a kid when I first saw Used Cars, and I'll never forget the first time I saw the film because I had never seen cars like these before!  For some reason, most of the '70s cars were long gone by the mid 1990s when I first saw this.  
Although most of the cars in the film are junkers, they are still cool!  You will see an amazing lime green 1973 Lincoln Continental in one scene, and an awesome '74 Mercury Montego that jumps a ramp over a moving train and still runs with big chrome '70s bumper intact!  Then you we see a remarkable car chase that involves about 300 classic cars, ranging from old Lincolns and Chryslers, etc.  
Beyond the cars, this is also an extremely funny movie!  I have seen Used Cars at least 10 times and every time it gets better!  There is a nice love story and great acting, especially by Kurt Russell and Deborah Harmon (I think this was her only film, but she is memorable).  If you appreciate '70s cruisers, Pintos, Edsels, and everything else you'll love this!  Back when the used car lots actually had cool cars..
