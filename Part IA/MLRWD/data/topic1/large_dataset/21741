This series is brilliant.  The concept of the series is hillarious in itself.  Dave Lister (Craig Charles), the last human being alive, stranded 3 million years into deep space, accompanied only by a computer generated hologram simulation of his dead bunk mate, Arnold J Rimmer (Chris Barrie) who he hates with a passion, a creature who evolved from his cat (Danny John-Jules), on a mining ship piloted by a computer with senile dementia, Holly (Norman Lovett).

Apparently, the writers wanted experienced actors for the series.  After many auditions, what they ended up with was a poet (Craig Charles), an impressionist (Chris Barrie), a dancer (Danny John-Jules) and a stand up comic (Norman Lovett), who had little, if any, experience in acting.

It may look dated and drab set wise, but the humour is genious and still has me howling with laughter today.  There are some classic scenes in this series.  The "Everybody's dead Dave" scene when Lister is allowed out of suspended animation, which he has been in for three million years as a punishment for bringing a cat on board, is wonderful.  My personal favourite is Hollys April fool on Lister when he tells him that Norweb Electricity are coming after him because he "left a light on in the bathroom".
