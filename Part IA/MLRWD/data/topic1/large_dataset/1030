This DVD was exactly what I expected from the advertising.  I think the strongest part of this DVD is that it neither heroized nor demonized Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.  It shed some light on the both the flaws and strengths of these two brilliant innovators.  I first heard of this DVD by watching the Podcasts of Harvard University's introductory computer science course, where it was mentioned as a source for background information.  I found it encouraging because it demonstrates that even the most successful of us in life do make some mistakes and still life goes on.  After watching the DVD, I visited Bill Gates personal webpage and located some public lectures he has given in which he recounts the same events as are covered in the DVD.  In comparing his lectures with the DVD, I saw only minor factual discrepancies.  I think it is a good case study of the motivations of sucessful leaders.  By the way, if you are looking for a DVD filled with techno-jargon...This is not the movie for you.  This movie did a great job of avoiding excessive geekspeak where it wasn't relevant to the story.
