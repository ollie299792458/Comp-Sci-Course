I saw this movie awhile ago and loved it so when I saw it on blu-ray in the Disney movie rewards program I used all the points I had and got it...as soon as it arrived in the mail I stuck it in the player and no joke have watched it 6 times since then, and I just got it in the mail two days ago...I absolutely love this movie and it is one of the few to make me cry every single time.  My fiance always asks me what I like about a movie and so of course he asked me what I like about this one...and all I can say is it's magical and you are watching the way people live every day...Jess isn't rich and he doesn't live in a giant perfect house, his family is just like your normal family complete with siblings fighting over little things all the time, his father has a real job where he works hard for very little and Jess has no friends. He is very talented at art but his parents really could care less..and then he meets Leslie who is the complete opposite...and they form this bond that you know would last forever.  They create this mystical world where only the two of them can go.  And when tragedy strikes a young man must learn to cope in this world that seems so against him. A truly wonderful movie that will tug at your heart whether you want to admit it or not.
