Passion Play involves a character by name Nate Pool (Mickey Rourke), portrayed as a jazz man whose life is a mess and who stumbles across a carnival in the middle of the desert. He comes to the rescue of the carnival's main attraction, the freak show's "Lily" (portrayed by lovely Megan Fox) a woman gifted with beautiful wings and is faced with the choice to love and defend this beautiful angel and start a new life, or to use Lily to settle scores with a long-time rival (Bill Murray) in order to clean up his old life.

Despite beautiful Megan IMHO who plays her role amicably well and with two legendary and cult-worthy actors like Mickey and Bill the overall presentation of the film is somewhat freaky and dark and lacks depth and motivation. The director probably intended it to be sort of poetic but the combination of items somewhat did not fall in the right places.

This film cannot be a must have as it lacks luster, But for people who love dark freaky films especially with lovely Megan Fox and classic actors like Bill Murray all in one package it is worth a buy for them but for others my advice would be rent it to watch once or may be twice.
