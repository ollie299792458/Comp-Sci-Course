Many reviewers are giving this wonderful DVD a bad rap without having even SEEN it, which is ridiculous.

The facts- Yes, Kermit's BRIEF scenes have been cut. Yes, this is a shame, but there's nothing to be done about it. The plain fact of the matter is that the Kermit scenes were short, and have absolutely nothing to do with the actual story. Their absence doesn't affect the plot or flow of the special one bit.

To not buy this DVD based on Kermit's absence is to miss out on some truly wonderful special features. Included here are all the deleted scenes fans were missing, photo galleries, and an absolutely great hour-long documentary.

Also, no Muppet fan will want to miss the hilarious sequence of bloopers which show off the great wit of Frank Oz.

HIT has shown with both this and the Fraggle Rock Complete First Season that they truly care about the work of Jim Henson. Both are tremendous DVD's which have had a lot of love and effort put into them to make them special. It's a lot more than can be said for Disney, whose Complete First Season of The Muppet Show was very lacking in the way of special features.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the Disney Co. would not allow the use of Kermit on this release. It's definitely too bad, but it does NOT ruin this DVD. Don't let Disney's mistakes make you miss out on this.
