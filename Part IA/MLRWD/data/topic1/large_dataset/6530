This movie is derivative. As are most classic films noirs for that matter. But this is one of the great movies of all time. 
It will be playing on late night video for centuries. Along with Casablanca, Double Indemnity, Body Heat.
If this film were only rated for the music soundtrack - derived from multiple classics (old and new) but innovatively orchestrated, scored and tracked - it would merit 5 stars.
If it were judged only on Rebecca's tour-de-force performance covering perhaps 6 distinct characters, accent and all, it would earn a max rating. She captures the best of the best of the classic film noir actresses right up through the 80's. You want Ingrid? Bette? Kathleen? She's got em in her pocket. With a ton of steamy heat. In France no less.
Antonio hangs in with the best of the male leads of the last century. The supporting cast is top drawer. Even the extras hold up under close scrutiny.
If your thing  is editing; or cinematography; or set design; or costume; or sound; or writing; or direction - again you are treated to a masterpiece. You want to talk about plot? Talk about 5 plots then. Talk about twists as clever as 'the snake and the cat'.
The first time you see this movie, you have seen maybe half of it. To really get it, take another look. If for no other reason than to figure out why so much didn't make sense - and of course to wallow in the pure pleasure of this sparkling cinematic jewel.
