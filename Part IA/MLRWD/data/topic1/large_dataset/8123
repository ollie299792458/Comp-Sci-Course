I don't understand why Richard Matheson was so unhappy with this first film version of his novella I AM LEGEND.  I just read the book for the first time, then re-watched the movie, and I must say, this is as faithful a cinematic treatment of a novel as I have ever seen.  Sure, some things are changed, but that's always necessary when adapting a literary work to the screen, and one would think Matheson would know that.

Placing the flashbacks to the protagonist's earlier life all together as a "second act"--rather than scattering them throughout the story as the book does--works very well.  Okay, the Price character is not a scientist in the book, but so what?  Everything else from the book is there, except for the hero's research into the medical cause of vampirism; that made the book quite interesting, but would have been deathly dull in a film.  The movie does insert a new bit about the hero making a vaccine from his blood (something that was carried over into THE OMEGA MAN), but it only makes the ending all the more bleak, because with his death the vaccine can never be made.  Yes, the movie does hype up the action in the final scene, probably because the film needed a bigger payoff than the quiet suicide scene in the book.  But it works very well.

In short--Matheson wrote a downer of a book, and it was translated faithfully into a downer of a film.  I think Price did a great job, and I rate this film very highly.  The photography and atmosphere are superb.  Don't miss it!
