Steven Spielberg produced another wonderful film in this telling of the early days of Sherlock Holmes.  Based on an original idea, and not directly on any of the books, this movie tells the story of a Sherlock Holmes who is still attending school.
Narrated by none other than Watson himself, it begins as Watson is beginning his stay at a new school.  It is almost inevitable that he meets the young Sherlock Holmes, and immediately befriends him and is taken on a daring journey to solve a mystery.
The suspense in this film certainly delivers, and the mystery never fails to tug at your brain.  You'll find yourself guessing who the perpetrator might be very early in the film, and you'll hold onto your breath until the moment he's brought to justice (or is he...).
While intense, dramatic, and speckled with violence, this is a movie that can be enjoyed by older children and adults alike.
If for no other reason, it's worth a viewing simply to see the first use of computer graphics in a film, earlier works of one Industrial Light and Magic; The same people responsible for classics such as Jurassic Park and Star Wars.
Skip the rental...Buy this movie.  You'll enjoy it again and again.
