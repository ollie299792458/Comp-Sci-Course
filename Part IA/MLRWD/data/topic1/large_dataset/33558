Those familiar with the Authurian Myths will either hate or love this movie.  Those that are obsessed and see it as heretical to change the story in anyway will hate it.  Those that understand that Myths and Legends are stories that are very much open to reimagining and interpretation will love this movie.  I belong to the latter.  This reimagining of the precious legend will give you a fresh look at the struggles of our heroes at the same time explore their many weaknesses, humanizing them, including our venerable wizard; even making us appreciate the driving force behind the villains.  Exploring the transition from the "Old" and "New" ways is mirrored in many major cultural, religious and historical changes.  This is great love story, a great fantasy movie and great study into human nature.  I've always loved the legend, but this movie gave me a connection to the character and the story that went farther than the what, where, who and why of it all.  Sure it wanders quite far from the "accepted" story.  But it made it much easier to like the people and believe the plot.
