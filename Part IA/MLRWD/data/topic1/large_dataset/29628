For fans of the original series, please don't bother with this unfunny contrived piece of trash.  There was more comic relief in one episode of the original show than all the "comedy" in this simply awful "remake," which is S&H in name only.

This is only for fans of Stiller and Wilson (both terrible and vastly overpaid actors), who obviously never saw one episode of the 70s' series before making this movie; a series which was gritty for its day, and which actually had to tone down the violence after a public outcry (and is very tame compared to the stuff on TV now --- even the reality "COPs" series on Fox).

By the way, I owned a 75 Gran Torino.  That thing would be destroyed after even the smallest jump in the movie, or easily disabled if it hit a curb on an angle as mine did once (and as the original car did in one episode).  In fact, Glaser reportedly hated the car and tried crash it into stuff at every opportunity.  I think the movie makers remembered the Dukes of Hazzard or Knight Rider when they thought up the stupid jump scenes...  There were no car jumps in the original TV show, although it had its share of car chases.

All in all, a waste of celluloid unless you laugh at anything Stiller or Wilson do.
