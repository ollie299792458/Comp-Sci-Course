Presumed Innocent directed by Alan J. Pakula is an interesting mystery with a surprising twist.  As always, Harrison Ford shows his great ability of acting.  He is obsessed with an ex-lover that is found brutally rapped and murdered.  Being in charge of this case leads him to information he never knew.  Strangely through the movie, the evidence is pointing to Ford, but is it all set up?  Was Ford framed, or did he commit this upsetting crime.  Would a lawyer who knows what can happen to someone who kills someone leave evidence like what was found behind?  Ford is removed from the prosecutor's chair to becoming the defendant
The murder was committed obviously by someone who was upset, right?  Why would someone kill a beautiful lady, and what did she do to make someone so hurt?  Well, it's hard to figure out who it could be when she had so many ex-lovers she could have upset.  How far would a person go to get what they want?  What would someone do for love?  
If you like mystery and being your own detective, you would like Presumed Innocent.  Is justice always fair or are there still cases that are never figured out?
