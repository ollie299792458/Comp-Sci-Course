RHCP has been my favorite band for quite some time now.  I recently was able to attend one of their live concerts and loved every minute of it. It is amazing to not only hear but also watch them perform their songs to perfection. After attending the concert, I found myself wanting to see them perform live again and again.

  One of my friends suggested that I get one of their concert DVDs and I immediately went to Amazon.com to purchase one. I must say that the Live At Slane Castle DVD is one of the best purchases I have every made. It contains over 100 minutes of RHCP doing what they do best. The DVD not only focuses on the band as a whole, but gives direct attention to each of the members as he is doing his thing. They perform so many of my favorite songs. Now, instead of playing the CDs, I just turn up the surround sound on my television and watch it over and over again. Unless you have the money and the means to follow these guys around the world, this is a definite purchase. You won't be disappointed.
