This movie is about the 4 American soldiers who crossed over the DMZ to North Korea and stayed there since the 60's.  This film shows their lives, but focuses on one main character, Dresnok.  This film shows how they ended up in North Korea and what their daily life was like, including becoming movie actors, getting married and having children.  It's hard not to have sympathy for their misery there but I don't feel sorry for them.  It's a strange tale about Americans living in a country that hates the US and not even talking to Westerners for decades.  You get a taste of how they live and were indoctrinated into a cult like society while being totally isolated from the modern world.  I consider this to be a fascinating story.  The film does a good job trying to show all of the facts and controversy with good historical background.  For another view on their story read "The Reluctant Communist" by Jenkins who is featured briefly in the film.  If you are at all interested in North Korea this film is a must!
