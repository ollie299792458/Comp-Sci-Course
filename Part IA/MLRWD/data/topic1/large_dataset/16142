This is one of my favorite horror films of all time.  In my opinion, it's more disturbing than most of the gory flicks that are made today.  It shows little in the way of monsters, ghouls, etc., and that is what makes it so effective.  It's unsettling to sit waiting in anticipation for the face of the creature to be revealed, only to be left largely in the dark.

There are some other things about the film that perplex me.  It strikes me as having a very Gothic tone, although I can't place my finger on the reason.  There also seems to be commentary on the state of religious belief at the time, but it's difficult for me to place the theme within a specific framework, which is frustrating.

Anyway, I would like to state that I recommend this movie to every fan of classic film.  I would also recommend it to all horror film fans, except for the fact that I know they might find it slow and tedious, and, of course, not scary enough, bloody enough, etc.  However, if you like suspenseful, thought-provoking filmmaking with a decidedly disturbing bent, I would definitely recommend Rosemary's Baby.
