I truly believe that Seane's DVD is amazing and suitable for all levels.  Vinyasa flow is the practice of incorporating movement and breath into one.  It may seem that this DVD is not physically challenging or that it is geared for beginners but that is not so.  Try following the breathing portion and see how difficult it really is!!!
  Most people are unaware that they do not breathe properly during their practice. What a great way to really learn how to incorporate proper breathing techniques and bring your practice to the next level.  The better you breathe the more oxygen your muscles have and the healthier and more energized you'll be in your practice and in your life.
  For those of you who say this is not challenging, I challenge you to try breathing the right way.  It's not as easy as one would think.
I give Seane 5 stars!!!  Buy a copy today!
She takes the practice and art of yoga to a whole new level.  Her voice is not harsh at all, rather it is full of knowledge and quite soothing if you are open and listen intently.  Bravo for you Seane, keep up the good work.
