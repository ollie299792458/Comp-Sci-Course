Now, Mr. and Mrs. Smith isn't supposed to be taken seriously. It's a full throttle action ride, with a superb mix of comedy, action, domestic disputes, and of course, loud explosions. This is not a movie that will change your life. However, you're gonna have a hell of alot of fun for an amazing, utterly orgasmic two hours, reason being the incredible chemistry generated between the two leads, who are the HOTTEST on-screen couple in recent memory. The plot is basically what you would expect from your regular action/adventure film, but the script is sharp, and the dialogue between Pitt and Jolie is often hilarious and quite memorable. Doug Liman, in the tradition of Bourne Identity, has really crafted the assassin/marksman genre to almost utter perfection; despite the usual suspension of disbelief required for an action movie of this type, Pitt and Jolie are believeable in their roles, and they look like their having a blast, so it's no wonder anyone who wathces the movie will feel the same way. A must see, and one of the best action movies this generation.
