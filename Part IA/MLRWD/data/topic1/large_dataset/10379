Quite simply - because no other musical so beautifully exemplifies the French "joie de vivre."  I have never watched this film without ending with a smile on my face.  That is why it is so special.  Sure - musicals like "West Side Story", or "Fiddler on the Roof", or "South Pacific"  have something to say about history or prejudice. This one is just "S'Wonderful" ... and that is all it tries to be.

What's the point of deconstructing the plot?  Or the acting?  There is not much plot in "Band Wagon" - but so many enjoy that film for such dance numbers as "Shine on your Shoes" (or) "Dancing in the Dark."  Even "Singin' in the Rain" - another great musical - has a rather obvious plot. Enjoy Gene Kelly or Leslie Caron for what they are - charismatic personalities on screen.

For example,  "Love is Here to Stay" is one of the most romantic songs in the musical genre.  And the way in which Gene Kelly performs "I Got Rhythm" speaks to "his" style of relaxed, joyful dancing. That song and dance number also shows Gene Kelly's marvelous chemistry with children. (Fred Astaire is known for his great solo foot work or romantic moves with Ginger Rogers...but not screen chemistry with children)  I think the extended ballet sequence at the end of the film matches anything put on the screen for sheer color beauty; it also manages to be quite erotic without any of the dancers removing their clothes!

Another factor which makes the film special to me is how well Vincente Minelli recreates the glamour of Paris - down to the look of the delicious brioches on the table, the torn posters on the wall, the stone steps down to the Seine river, the careful arrangements by the flower vendors, the look of the Left Bank Jazz Club. Yes, I remember Paris that way.

Last, but not least, is the timeless music of George Gershwin.  So, when you are in the mood for a happy ending,  you can do no better than watch this delight.
