The original play is sort of the "Finnegans Wake" of the Shakespeare canon: an avalanche of dated puns and contemporary satirical references that is going to be just about impenetrable to a modern audience. It was probably written for a very specific audience which would get all the jokes, but we, without footnotes at least as copious as the text, are simply lost. A "straight" production must rely heavily on that old technique of "if we laugh hard enough, the audience will have to join in", which can quickly grow mighty tedious. So chopping the text and story down to their bare bones, and going for slick entertainment value (as per original intent, no doubt), is probably as good a solution as any. If the effect is merely cute, that hardly represents a betrayal of the Bard, in the case of this play. One hopes, though, that Brannagh will get back to some more substantial Shakespeare at some point. The "Henry V" and "Hamlet" films are really interesting, agree with them wholly or not.
