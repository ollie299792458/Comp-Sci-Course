THis movie although loosely reflected in the movie THE HOURS, i think is a bad attempt at a horror film.  The movie creates suspense up until the point where John Cusack appears in the court room as the murderer.  Once you find out that the whole thing is about fake people that this one guy makes up, all the suspense is lost.  It has a good ending, which is where it parallels to the ending of THE HOURS, is abrupt to the plot and yet acceptable to the audience.  The child shows the audience the nature of the killer, the fact that he would kill anyone even his own mother.  This also shows the relavance if his poem.  When first heard, you can tell that it is a childish poem and it acts as a kind of clue as to who the murderer is.  This was very thoughtful of the writers and intuitive the fact that audiences dont look for things like that and that they like it when everything makes seince in the end, which is what is accomplished in the van.  It is not the most desirable ending but effective none the less.  Over all it is not bad but could be edited for a more effective approach at horror.  If that is in gfact what they were hoping to accomplish.
