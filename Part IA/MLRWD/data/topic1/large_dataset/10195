I'm a fan of Lerner and Loewe musicals so it's no surprise that I love this movie.  I saw it first several decades ago when I was quite young, and I remember it as being filled with heartbreaking longing.  Sometime after that I was traveling and saw a sign pointing to a town called Brigadoon and I felt the longing again.  Now that I'm old, rewatching it did not inspire the same intense feelings, but it is a perfect, beautiful musical.  It's a story about a magical town that last for a day; the residents cannot leave without destroying the town, and anyone who decides to move there cannot leave either.  So a man hunting in the area with a friend, a man who admits he is uncertain about going through with an impending marriage, meets and falls in love with a woman there, a woman who is four years older than her sister who is getting married that singular day, a woman who has been waiting a very long time to find her true love.  He leaves her and returns to New York but is terribly unhappy so returns to Brigadoon and the romantic love of his life.  The friend Jeff is sarcastically witty, a bit of a drinker, and is pursued by another young woman while he is there.  He is not attracted to her.  To me every detail of this movie is put together perfectly.  They don't make 'em like this anymore.
