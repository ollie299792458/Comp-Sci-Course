Although this was supposedly a remake of the French film "Nathalie," the ending was a lot different. This ending was based on Freud's published case history, *The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman:*

Most professional critics don't like the ending of "Chloe" because they think it's a stereotypical appeasement of the American audience's prudish desire to see sexual promiscuity punished.

Do not be deceived. One day I was reading a criticism by la de dah film critic Frank LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle.  He liked the movie, but he too objected to the ending on the same grounds, so I showed him the above website to see what he thought, but he didn't buy it.  However, the similarities were compelling enough to where he forwarded my e-mail to the script writer, Erin Cressida-Wilson, who informed him that she never heard of Freud, although the similarities were "VERY interesting."  So, I had to admit I was wrong.  However, I decided to make sure by showing the similarities to Atom Egoyan who e-mailed me back with this:  "Although I am familiar with Freud's famous case history, I did not discuss it with Erin Cressida-Wilson."

I figured that was it, until one day Egoyan made a public announcement that it was he who wrote the ending.  The original ending had Liam Neeson coming home and killing Chloe, and Egoyan didn't like it. So he changed it.

I laughed and laughed.  Apparently Cressida-Wilson contacted Egoyan after LaSalle spilled the beans on him and gave him holy hell and demanded he admit to the world the ending was his idea.  Women in California tend to hate Freud. LOL!
