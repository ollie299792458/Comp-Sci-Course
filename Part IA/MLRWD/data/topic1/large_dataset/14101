This is an excellent movie, but my review is more about comparing the two versions since I'm sure you'd all like to know. I do have both copies.

The first thing I check was the display timer at the introduction of the last scene. The timers were at nearly the exact same time.

The second thing was the examine the BJ scene, which I understand is the most telling distinction in an "uncut" version. There was a difference in that scene. In one shot of that scene, a few extra seconds were added. In the next shot, about 1 second was added.

For lack of going into detail, nothing that was added to that scene should have (IMO) affected the rating enough to drop it from NC-17 to R. Maybe it's the amount of onscreen seconds, who knows.

Both versions read 1hr 43min on the back. I'm sure that's true. You'd only see the distinction if it were down to the second. I dont know if Amazon will allow the external link, but here's a direct comparison site stating that 24 seconds were cut: [...].

Seems like maybe 4 seconds tops were cut to me. I think they're being overly generous.
