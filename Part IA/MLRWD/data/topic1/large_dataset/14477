I'm not really sure what people were expecting. This 1080i release (as opposed to 1080p) is the best print of The Killer, as far I'm concerned. It looks nice on both my 32" HD and my 20" HD that I have in my room. The picture is far better than the previous Red Sun edition (which was probably bootleg, but didn't look terrible on DVD) that I had.

Look, if the Criterion DVD or any other copy of the film "looks" better to you and you don't own either version, more power to you. Basically, if you have an extra 100 bucks or so, go for it. But, for those on a budget that want an upgrade over an older DVD they have, the Bluray is an excellent choice.

The Killer is John Woo's best film, as far as I'm concerned. I loved both Better Tomorrow films, and Hard Boiled is just a great display for both Woo and Chow's talents. But, The Killer has a much better story, I felt. It's a feast of action film making, but also has a great emotional element as well.

The special features are nothing to write home about here. Just enjoy a classic action film and keep praying that Woo returns to Hollywood and gets it right with another classic action film.

Overall, I give it 4/5 stars. It's a great film, and this transfer is an upgrade picture wise as far as I'm concerned. Now, let some fans of the film argue it out and overpay for DVDs. It's also worth noting that there are a lot of bootleg copies out there. If you want to pay extra, do your research first and don't get yourself ripped off. It happened to me, but luckily I only paid $18.

You can save yourself a lot of headaches and time and get a genuine article for a fraction of the "better" DVD transfers. Recommended.
