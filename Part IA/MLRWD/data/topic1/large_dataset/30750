Please note, this movie has note yet come out on HD DVD. I do not know what the PQ, AQ, or Extras will be like on the HD DVD itself. My review is entirely done with the movie/story in mind.

Knocked Up is a HILARIOUS movie. In short if you liked SuperBad, 40 Year Old Virgin, Accepted or even Wedding Crashers you will more than likely love this movie. It is by far the best comedy of the summer, and probably even the year. The story follows around the life of two people who were just out for a fling when their lives are inextricably thrown back together by an unexpected pregnancy. I'll spare you the rest of the synopsis, as you can read that almost anywhere. However, I will say that there are few movies that provide these kinds of laughs so many times during the film.

Also worth noting is that this movie is NOT FOR CHILDREN. It has a lot of drug usage within the movie, as well as many sexual jokes. Please don't think this is a good children's comedy. Thanks for reading my review.
