Once again, like STAR WARS, ALIEN, INDIANA JONES, and BOND 50, fantastic restoration efforts are undermined by cheap penny pinching cardboard crap.  Once again I have to watch the same movies twice because brand new discs come pre-scratched and have to be sent back in order to try to win the 'good disc' lottery.  Dracula was glued to the page and glue stuck to one side of the disc.  Scratches on The Mummy made horriffic audio squeals.  Studios have no qualms about letting films go out of print; shouldn't they at least TRY to give us discs that stand a chance of lasting more than a year?  These sets are not cheap and for the money and support I give the LEAST they could do is pachage them safely.  But I guess it saves a rich corporation pennies while consumers send back set after set.  I'm FAR from the only one who feels this way.  Too bad...the picture and sound are the best ever.  The Creature from the Black Lagoon is widescreen and comes in both 2D & 3D.  My excitement is halved every time one of these cardboard disc destroyers is dropped at my door.  I'm not spending a dime on $H!##& flavor of the month streaming, Hollywood, so stop wrecking our discs.  ENOUGH!
