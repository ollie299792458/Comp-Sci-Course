After watching this movie, I thought to myself, "This is the modern day Casablanca!"  I thought this because the story was very tight with no space.  Every element in the movie advances the story the whole way  through, I was so amazed.  I have not seen a movie so well done in such a  long time, and this movie is animated!  It's also very comic, full of  parodies and classic cinematic shots and even a bit of drama.  During one  part of the movie, this song comes on.  I leaned over to my friend in  disagreement and said, "Did Disney put this in?"  By the last  shot, my friend and I were holding back tears, "Holy cow, dude!  Man,  that's horrible."  But besides great cinema and effective  storytelling, the animation was just as good as the first "Toy  Story" which, to say the least, is exceptional!  I really loved this  movie for it's almost classic hollywood style mixed with modern ideas and  techniques.  This is definitely a movie worth watching.
