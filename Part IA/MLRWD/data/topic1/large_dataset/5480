An American in Paris is a classic that may not actually live up to its hype but is still quite good.  It is probably one of Gene Kelly's better movies. He gives his usual performance as a playa type with a mix of arrogance and charm.  After performing Pal Joey on Broadway, he seems to have permanently adopted that stage persona for every character he plays and, for the most part, it works, particularly as softened down a little for this movie.  The Gerswhin music is wonderful and the supporting cast is of the highest quality, particulary Oscar Levant and Nina Foch, in a rather thankless role she manages to humanize.  Alan Jay Lerner's script is effective and efficient.  The only true problem with the film is the same thing that makes it famous and a classic.  The seventeen minute fantasy ballet is over-praised and does not stand up to repeated viewing in the same way the rest of the film does.  Gene Kelly was always a much better dancer than choreographer and it shows painfully in this sequence.  The movie is still a great deal of fun and the romance between Kelly and Leslie Caron is not without its charm.  A good movie that, perhaps, glows in the memory a little stronger than it does on the screen.
