First off, I loved this movie as a kid. I never saw it at the theater because I was 7 at the time, but I did see it on late night viewings on Cinemax and channels like that. I later watched it on VHS and DVD. Though I really liked the movie, it seemed kind of a cheat since it was pretty gore-light for a movie with Bloody right there in the title. Well, I bought The Special Edition DVD when it came out, and was pleasantly surprised. I don't mind double-dipping when it's worth it. Since I got my Blu Player, I've been upgrading all my discs and I was very impressed with this one. I don't have a 60-inch Plasma or anything like that. I watch movies on a 37-inch LCD HDTV with HDMI. There is surprisingly very little grain or dirty spots on the print. And that's saying something for a low-budget flick that's 28 years old. Even better, there are two ways to watch the restored gore footage that was originally cut out to obtain an R-rating. You can watch the Theatrical Version with the added gore as a Special Feature, or you can watch the Extended Cut with the gore footage put back into the movie. Now, you have to be careful when you use the word restored. The footage has not been visually restored, color-corrected, cleaned up or any of those other things that happens to old footage when it's converted to hi-def. The gore footage was sitting in a vault somewhere for 28 years and it's like they just spliced it back into place. So, when you watch the Extended movie, the newly-added gore footage doesn't match up at all. It's faded, scratchy and kind of jumpy, but it's nice to see the movie as it was originally intended. I did notice that the picture jumps a little at about an hour and seven minutes into it for about a minute. I don't remember this on the DVD. Not a major thing, but you notice it. The sound is great, there's a nice documentary featuring several of the original actors, and a trailer. I recommend you buy this movie!
