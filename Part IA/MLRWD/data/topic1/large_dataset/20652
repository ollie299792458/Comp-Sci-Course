This is a must-have for any hetero male who can't wait for it to come around again on cable TV. Forget all the bad reviews; all that matters is that Jennifer Love Hewitt is painfully hot in this movie.  Actually it's a half-decent film that rises above the level of sex comedies aimed at the 18-35 knuckle-dragging audience. But that doesnt' matter. Yeah, it's light fare but you won't care. The cast is full of A-listers (Gene Hackman, Sigourney Weaver, Ray Liotta, Jason Lee, Anne Bancroft, Nora Dunn, Sarah Silverman, Carrie Fisher) who turn in professional performances, but you might not even notice. Hackman is so adept as a hacking, liver-spotted geriatric that you might be grossed out, but you'll get over it. All that really matters is the amazing Hewitt bouncing around in an endless series of slinky micro dresses. I have a friend in the film/video industry who tells me that all the studio execs wish JLH was their girlfriend, and after seeing *Heartbreakers* I'm not surprised.

A definite desert-island pick.
