Evil Dead 2 is one of the best sequels I've ever seen.  First of all, how many sequels are made just to make fun of the first one? Okay, Scream 2 and 3, I'll give you those, but the whole Scream series owes much to the Evil Dead Trilogy.  My personal favorite scenes are, first and foremost, the scene where Ash's evil hand breaking the dishes over Ash's head, and then dragging his body toward the butcher knife.  When I first saw that, I could not stop laughing.  And then when he traps the hand in the trash can, stacking heavy books on top, and the top book is "A Farewell to Arms".  My other favorite scene is when the deer head and various pieces of furniture and appliances start laughing at Ash.  But Ash shows his dry cool wit with such one-liners as "Groovy"  "Here's your new home" and my personal favorite, "Swallow this." And the featurette "The Gore the Merrier" had lots of funny moments.  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that while it may be good, Army of Darkness is the best of the Trilogy.  Thank you.
