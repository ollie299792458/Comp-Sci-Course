This is an excelent, intrigueing movie,its only weakness being the length (which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5).It captivates you, &amp; holds your interest from the jail riot in the begining to the ( what did you expect ) shoot-out climax.It has a twist of an ending, linking several characters you wouldn't expect.Some may have to watch it more than once to get the whole picture.A word of advice: Start the film no later than 9:00pm, it is along film ( much like waiting for a long time in a line for the new ride, that after you have ridden it you know the wait was worth it ).Some people complain about the violence &amp; profanity which is minimal &amp; should be over-looked because it is such a wonderful film. The violence &amp; profanity is minimal compared to, Casino (another must-see film,under-rated at the Oscars), for instance( think the "field beeting" scene,the "hand-breaking" scene).If your kids ( the inevitable hazard for an adult to enjoy a movie ) hav never seen "The Sopranoes" ( or any other HBO program for that matter ), or late night tv, you may think twice about letting children under 12 see this film.( I chose not to bring up plot points, they're already in the other reviews )( by the way,Guy Pearce should have won best  actor )This is a fantasticly enjoyable film, anyone who is a film fan should see this one ASAP
