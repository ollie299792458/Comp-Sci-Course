I arrived opening night to our local theater expecting the regular crowd for a Friday night and instead am greeted by an overflowing parking lot and a line all the way out the door and down the sidewalk.  I am sure I must have missed that some big Oscar contender or blockbuster is opening that night as well but every single person in the line (standing in blowing snow and rain by the way) was there to see Wild Hogs.  The movie is sold out.  We try again the following afternoon and again are greeted with a long line.  We wait and wait and are one of the last ones to get a ticket to a yet again sold out show.  My wait and stress over possibly getting shut out again are well worth what I saw.  I laughed and I laughed and I giggled and I cried (from laughing so hard) Anymore it seems that all of the so called big comedies show you hilarious clips on the commercials for them and those end up being the ONLY laughs in the movie. This one was hilarious from start to finish.  Could not wait to call friends to tell them they had to see this movie, which they all did and wholeheartedly agreed that it is just one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  It's immature humor, sure, it's bathroom humor, but dang it, bathroom humor makes me laugh! I will gladly wait in line again and again to see this movie and will be first in line when it comes out on DVD.  If laughter is the best medicine, then this movie ought to cure what ails you.
