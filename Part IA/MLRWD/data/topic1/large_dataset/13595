My impressions are deep and almost reverential to this Grand piece of literary Movement. Most of the visuals and camera work is a departure from Kurosawa, but it is the spirit and incredible delicacy of this film that took me. It showed how the Maestros intricate notes were firmly interpreted. You follow the story line like that of a play, sitting front and center, yet feeling you are part of this unfolding beauty as the observer. I love a film that will draw me in. This film not only drew me in, it wrapped me with its parabolic interludes. I could not stay just as the observer but felt and interactive dynamic with the characters. The message to me was clear that the great director left us with...He was a feminist in the most human sense. And man must look at himself through the female...thus the title...The Sea is Watching. This was like a large mirror from Kurosawa's cinematic mind transposed to screen reflecting that feminine flavor. I was simply amazed. Watch and allow your eyes to feast.
