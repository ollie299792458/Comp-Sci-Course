BEDAZZLED is an enjoyable movie experience, thanks to the smart writing and the terrific performances of Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley. The story is not new but this film has smart, funny dialogue (even poignant near the end). Hurley clearly relishes in her black-comedic role as "The Devil", while Fraser plays 7 different characters, and is very funny in all of them.
Brendan Fraser plays a nebbish named Elliot who annoys everyone he works with as he lacks any real social skill and always tries too hard to be everyone's friend (which makes me wonder how he ever got through both high school and college, but never mind such questions while you're watching this). He has a major crush on this girl Alison, who barely evens notices him.  When he proclaims "I'd give my soul for her!", of course good ol' Beelzebub appears to him in the form of--Elizabeth Hurley. At first Elliot doesn't believe that this gorgeous woman in the red dress is the devil (which leads to a funny scene where she hands him her card which just simply says "The Devil"--which is an obvious tip of the hat to the 1977 George Burns-John Denver film "Oh, God!", where Burns hands Denver a card on which is simply printed "God").
When Hurley finally does convince Elliot, and Elliot reluctantly agrees to the Faustian bargain (on the premise that Alison will be all his), that's when the fun really begins. I won't give away any more of the film other than the fact that BEDAZZLED illustrates the old Chinese saying, "Be careful what you wish for--you might just get it" really well! This film is a lot of fun for kids 12 & up, as well as for adults.
