This is not a review about the story (many reviews abound about this classic story) -my review is about the 3D version.

I wanted to purchase it, but hesitated after seeing the many very negative reviews about the quality of the 3D version, One way I figured to not get confused by these reviews - see the item purchased: those writing about more recent single disc 3D BRD seem to like it. So I bought that latest version. Do note that this Blu Ray disc DOES NOT come with any viewing glasses etc - those purchasing that edition appear to dislike it.

You will need both your BRD player and projector/TV to be 3D capable. It is FANTASTIC in 3D. The movie just comes alive, and the 3D effects are simply excellent. The effects are so real and in the moment, that the kids were trying to reach out and grab every snowflake.

I suspect that those reviewers who did not like it are referring to a previous 3D version released in 2004 (I have not seen that one), or perhaps there was some problem with their equipment.  It worked beautifully for us, and the kids simply loved it.

Bottom line: if you have true 3D equipment do not hesitate to get THIS 3D version of this classic movie. Happy Holidays!
