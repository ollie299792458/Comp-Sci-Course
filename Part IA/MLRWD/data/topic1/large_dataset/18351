To be honest, I was not expecting much from this 1945 film.

While I like Errol Flynn, I thought this might be a mismatch of his typical persona with the theme of this film.  He's just too slick for a war drama I thought.  This is for more of a John Wayne type it seemed.

But Flynn pulls it off with aplomb, and his usual suavity couples nicely with his role as mission leader Captain Nelson.  But it is clear near the film of the film even his confident character is having self doubts.

Despite lack of any special effects and being entirely in black and white, the film is able to maintain a remarkable ongoing level of suspense.  Like the solidiers you just don't know who or what is going to pop out of the jungle or go bump in the night.

The characters under his command group are also surprisingly well developed and the viewer develops empathy for their suffering.  You will almost feel the jungle heat and humidity.

It's not a slam-dunk that his mission will be victorious despite a great start and you will be kept guessing up to the end.

Highly recommended for World War II or Errol Flynn fans.
