What a great movie! I watched this at my friend's house and we loved it, then I watched it again with my 18 year old and husband. And I plan on watching it again with my 14 year old when he returns from camp.

Wonderfully acted, comical, touching, well scripted. The kid who played Kyle was amazing and I will certainly watch anything he is in again.

The story is about a lawyer, Mike Flaherty, who is struggling to make ends meet to support his wife and two daughters. He is appointed by the court to represent an elderly man, Leo, suffering from dementia, who has no one to look after him. He takes on the job of his guardian, for $1500 a month, and promptly parks him in a nursing/retirement home. When he returns to check on the house, he finds the old man's 16 year old grandson (Kyle), who Leo has never met before, on the doorstep. Kyle has left his home in Ohio because his mom (Leo's daughter, who hasn't seen him Leo in 20 years) is in rehab and her boyfriend Craig beats him up. Mike takes him in while they try to contact his mother, Kyle joins the high school wrestling team ... And the movie goes from there. There are so many witty lines and funny moments, not funny like a lot of the crap you see today but genuinely funny.

Paul Giamatti is fabulous and I plan on renting other movies he has been in. Jeffrey Tambor is excellent as always. And Bobby Cannavale is hilarious as Mike's best friend and over-eager 'assistant coach'. Amy Ryan plays Mike's wife Jackie quite well. We also loved Burt Young as the old man Leo. Melanie Lynskey from Two and a Half Men plays Kyle's mom Cindy. But to me, the star of the show is Alex Shaffer as Kyle.

A definite must!!!
