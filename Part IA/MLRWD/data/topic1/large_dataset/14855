James Bond is too pampered and spoiled.  Take away his ridiculous gadgets and fancy car, and he would be lost.

Not Jason Bourne.  Bourne relies more on his wit and resourcefulness to make the most with what he has.  Whereas Bond needs a tricked-out Aston Martin with rocket launchers and oil slick dispensers to make it through a car chase, Bourne only needs a beat-up old Cooper Mini.  Whereas Bond sticks out like a sore thumb wherever he goes, Bourne is like your real-life covert operative who does his best to look ordinary, blend in and not attract attention--  You'd never spot him walking through a crowd at a train station.

With the much more intelligent approach that gives up nothing on action, the Bourne trilogy is a refreshing take on the spy genre.

Like Moby says in the Extreme Ways theme for the Bourne trilogy, I would stand in line for this.

The blu-ray discs in this trilogy look absolutely fabulous on my setup (Sony Playstation 3 / Sony Bravia KDL-52W300 52-inch 1080p LCD HDTV).  I had rented the standard-definition DVDs from Netflix before I bought the Blu-Ray Bourne Trilogy, and there is absolutely NO comparison--  On a proper setup, blu-ray totally blows away the standard-def DVDs.  The difference in clarity is like night and day.
