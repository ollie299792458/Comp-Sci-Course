This musical version of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol will move you to tears, have you singing along with the memorable songs, and charm you with its exquisite Dickensian sets. Albert Finney's portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge is perfect to a T. From the opening scene in his counting house, Scrooge's poor treatment of his clerk, Bob Cratchit, convinces us that he has not an ounce of good will or love in his miserable old heart. The scene that follows Scrooge home is priceless, beginning with the song "I Hate People", and continuing as Scrooge visits each person who owes him money, and they beg him for more time to pay. When Scrooge gets home, he is visited by his deceased business associate, Joseph Marley, and the special effects are quite good, especially considering this movie was made in 1970. 
 Of the three ghosts that visit Scrooge that night (The Ghost of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, and Christmas Future), the Ghost of Christmas Present is the most fun. You'll find yourself singing along with "I Like Life" and laughing as Scrooge gets into the parlor game The Minister's Cat. One scene I found particularly funny was when Scrooge sits in invisibly on his nephew's Christmas party (unbeknownst to the guests), and someone asks the nephew why he always toasts the health of his Uncle Ebenezer. Scrooge nearly explodes when his nephew calls him a "loathsome old carcass", but relaxes when he wraps it up with "besides, I like the old fellow." 
 The scene in hell is one of the funniest in the film, especially the surprise awaiting Scrooge in his personal chamber. I won't spoil it for you by saying any more. One note: the TV versions of this movie always cut out this entire hell scene, a big loss. Get the video! 
 This is one of my favorite Christmas movies, and I try to catch it every year.
