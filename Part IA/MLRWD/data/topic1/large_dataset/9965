I'm a big fan of the Cybermen. They're easily my favorite monsters, terrifying the screen in '60s "Who" episodes such as "Tomb of the Cybermen" and "The Moonbase". Their return afer seven years in "Revenge of the Cybermen" disappointed a lot of fans, but for some reason, their release from another seven-year hiatus in "Earthshock" was very well-received. Personally, I don't understand it.
"Earthshock" is, first and foremost, an action movie. Few scenes go by without a gun fight, or an attack, or the expendble soldiers being shot down by the enemy. It's very formulaic, and worse still, a formulaic homage: some dialogue exchanges are very reminiscent of past Cybermen stories, like "The Moonbase" or "The Wheel in Space", and the 'hatching' and subsequent march in episode two are a combined copy of "Tomb" and "The Invasion". If you think that's disappointing, it's even sadder to realise that Eric Saward later copied those same cliches and attempts at homage in two more stories, "Resurrection of the Daleks" and "Attack of the Cybermen". 
This is not to say there aren't great elements or classic scenes that are also original. Peter Davison is completely on form, and the redesign of the Cybermen is very, very cool. The scene where they are first revealed was undoubtedly quite surprising to the original, uninformed audience, and the climax and final credits still bring a feeling of sadness. But these only make "Earthshock" an okay story, a decently good one - not a classic.
