When I first heard they were remaking this movie, I had no interest in it due to the fact that I thought the original was just fine.  But, being a fan of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, I decided to give it a try.

I was not disappointed, and neither were my children.  As a matter of fact, my family and I have seen it three times already.

Just yesterday, ten of us went together to see it, our ages ranging from 4-54.  Everyone had a great time and I for one can say that this movie is not "too dark" for children, nor "boring" for adults.  It fit "just right" for us all, and I imagine it will continue to do so for most who watch it.

My just turned four year old is of the belief that it is the best movie he's ever seen, I quote him here when the credits rolled: "I loved that movie" and then while getting into the car: "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory rocked!".

My mother, at the age of 54, says she very much enjoyed the movie, more so then the original, and "will be buying it to add it to her DVD collection when it is available."

Johnny Depp is simply fabulous as Willy Wonka and the rest of the cast do not disappoint.  I actually found this version to be more like the book, and that is always a good thing in my opinion!  While it is true that the ending is different then both the book and the original film, the message that we're given at the end is timeless, and one that we often need to be reminded of in this day and age.  Family, and the love we have for each other is what matters the most in life, and worth more then all the chocolate in the world!
