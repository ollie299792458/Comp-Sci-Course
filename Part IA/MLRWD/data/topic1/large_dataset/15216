I recently added the Toshiba XA-2 player to my setup and I won't regret this for a second after I started listening to Heart, Alive in Seattle.

The impeccable performance in a HD format with the TrueHD DD soundtrack shows the potential of what HD sound and vision can be.

For those who already love the music of Heart, this disc probably already got your interest. For those looking for a great concert in HD DVD format and to hear the difference between DD+ and TrueHD DD, this is one to check. The clarity and broadening of the soundstage with TrueHD DD selected is incredible.

Apart from soundquality the goosepumps stay almost throughout the concert with unique performances of many of their great songs. Especially Mistral Wind and Battle of Evermore, to mention some of my favorites.

Many HD DVD's are released with only DD+. I wonder why, as I thought the main difference is how much compression was used of the original master soundtrack? With the space available in the HD format, why not always add a TrueHD track?

In short: Super Performance, great picture quality and superb sound!!! Well done ladies!
