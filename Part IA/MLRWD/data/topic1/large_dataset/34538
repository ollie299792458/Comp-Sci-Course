I first saw this film with my father when it first arrived in theaters.  My father loved sports and expected me to do the same, however, I ended up loving the cinema.  We always looked for ways to spend time together and with this film we were able to meet somewhere in the middle.  He got to see a movie supposedly about "sports" and I got to see a movie period.  I was 12 years old.
  I really enjoyed the film, although it wasn't until about a year ago that I fully understood and appreciated it's true impact.  I am now 27 years old and married.  I lost my father in March of 2003.  I watched this film recently with my wife and was stunned...moved to tears.
  I don't think (in my personal opinion) there is a more appropriate and heartfelt take on the father and son dynamic.  The acting is dead on and the musical score sould be placed in a museum of American art.
  I hold a new place in my heart for this film and all that were involved with bringing this little slice of Americana to life.  What I wouldn't give to be able to play one last game of catch with my father.
