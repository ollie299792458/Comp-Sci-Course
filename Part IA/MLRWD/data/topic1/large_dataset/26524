When this film first came out, I did not know that Bruce Lee was dead.  I was born in 1972(July 22)and I of course assumed he was alive.  I assumed that Alexander Fu Sheng was alive also.  I always wondered why I did not see him anymore...

People like to put this film down.  Of course it would have been better to work with Lee's origianl plan, but if they had not put this out, no one would have known about it and we would not have seen Lee's illest fights and the cool yellow suit.

They put together a decent film and mangaed to find excuses not to show the stand-in's face.  Now people claim thatr the stand-in sucked, but I have to say that the stand in was nice.  You can't deny the locker room fight.  The stand-in had nice kicks and he was also in "Game of Death II."  That was an ill movie also.  Dare I say iller than this.  They did good with what they had.

Now I would like to see someone put out all fulllength footage of Lee's interviews and making of films.  As well as All footage of "The Game of Death."  Then we could see the outside scenes and Lee in a funny brown 70's suit.  If only he could have lived to make just two more films...

They should also take the original film and give it to Hollywood to reedit them, re-dub them and add redo the sound as new for DVD or something.  THe man is not coming back so they should give the HK films the Hollywood treatment.  Make it happen.
