I liked the show during its first season and then it started to go downhill.  My best friend bought the DVD set and I rewatched them with her.  I continued to watch the show in its second season.  The ratings dropped drastically and I can understand why.  The show had absolutely no substance in its second season.  It is such a shame because it had so many possibilities but the producers ruined the program.  I also do not care for Amber Tamblyn and Mary Steenburgen.  The DVD is high quality and with respect to those who liked the show, I'm sorry for you that it has been cancelled.  If it had been picked up, I wouldn't have continued watching it because I had already stopped watching it halfway through the second season.  The show had become too silly and I have to agree with the viewers who said that it was nothing more than a teenage soap opera.  Perhaps another network will pick it up.  Warner Bros. network (7th Heaven, Reba) thrives on this kind of "teenage" show.  Unfortunately, the reason CBS gave it the axe was because of low ratings in addition to it not reaching enough younger viewers ..."the demographic curse".  It isn't fair but the show really was overhyped, in my opinion of course.  Enjoy the DVD.  The quality is great!
