This may not be the most profound movie about aliens and prospective human enslavement/extermination, but it's sure the most fun!  The computer generated special effects, like those of Jurassic Park, were examples of the most impressive technological developments in cinematography in years.  With the exception of a few Matrix-like camera tricks (and Sky Captain-like 100%-animation schemes), little technology has visibly improved to the average moviegoer since the days of ID4.  Audio is breathtaking.  Characters are fairly well-developed and likeable for a testosterone-based shoot-em-up.  It has enough love story elements to keep the soft-core audeience intrigued.  Intellectually stimulating enough not to be ludicrous.  What is there to complain about?  The most impressive part of the flick is that the whole thing could really happen...if you believe in that sort of thing....  Kind of makes you think about your place in the universe, but not so hard that you can't sleep at night.  Great movie!
