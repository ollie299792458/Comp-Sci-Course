I was a HUGE fan of the novel as a child, and was very excited when I discovered that they made a movie version of it.  I quickly ordered the DVD and even had it rushed to me.  I watched it as soon as I got the DVD, but I was a bit disappointed.  Perhaps if I had not read the book, I would have thought the movie was better than it was, but that was not the case.  It was tragic to see what they had done to Mrs. Who, my favorite character of the novel.  In the novel she was constantly quoting people, and in various languages, but in the movie was an afterthought and just seemed odd.  The Happy Medium seemed like a characture of a homosexual male and not the ambiguous being that it was in the novel.  I felt that they could have done a great deal more with the over 2 hours they had in the movie.  I could list a million more things that they should have done better, but that would be pointless.  If you have not read the books and simply want a safe for families adventure story, then this is a good choice.  However, if you adored the book like I did, tread lightly as you will most surely be disappointed with what they did.
