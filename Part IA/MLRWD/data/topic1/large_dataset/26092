I bought this movie on a whim because I really like Jason Segel (all the way back to his character "Mike" in SLC Punk). He is underrated talent; an intelligent producer/writer with a knack for stories that are fun and funny without appearing to try to hard or being overly sophomoric.

I LOVE YOU MAN is fun and funny and you really get to like the characters.  Peter for being a wussified doofus, Sydney for his funny, honest and laid back nature and the rest as well. There are some great awkward moments guaranteed to get a laugh. It is a bit "chick flickish" but more than enough guy stuff to make up for it; a great balance for both sexes.

Not saying this movie will change your life, it is enjoyable; so much that I have watched over and over. This is my "done with the world, need some kick back time, rainy day" movie.  Unfortunately they overplayed it by printing inane quotes like "THE FUNNIEST MOVIE OF THE DECADE".  Of the decade??!?! No but still one of my top picks.
