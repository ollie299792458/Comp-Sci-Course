I absolutely loved HENRY FOOL, but I wish this film had never been made.

HENRY FOOL, taken on its own, tells the story of a lying, unscrupulous, but literate vagabond (Henry) who challenges the boundaries of friendship, loyalty, love, and redemption.

In its final scene, we see Henry desperately running toward the camera, but we are left not knowing whether he is fleeing responsibility or running back to his family to face his uncertain fate. A beautiful story, amazingly told.

However, FAY GRIM turns that story on its head.

We learn that Henry was not just a lying vagabond, but some kind of secret agent involved in countless international intrigues. Having fled to Europe, he is being sought by the CIA, the French secret service, and God knows who else because his collection of "Confessions" contains a secret code that reveals American military secrets or something.

The problem with this plot is that it does not align with HENRY FOOL.

Here's why: In HENRY FOOL, Henry is profoundly confident in his work of "Confessions" as profound literature.

He asks Simon to judge the work as literature, and is completely crushed when Simon deems the work unworthy of publication.

So instead of being a self-proclaimed genius who is actually a failure, FAY GRIM asks us to believe that Henry is an ACTUAL genius who consistently out-smarts the CIA a la James Bond or something.

But in HENRY FOOL, Henry breaks down and reveals that he wrote his "Confessions" while serving time for statutory rape. (Not exactly a James Bond-style adventure.)

So which Henry Fool is real? The charming, salacious liar or the devious secret agent from FAY GRIM?

What a mess.
