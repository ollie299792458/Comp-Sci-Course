I think "Silence of the Lambs" may very well be the best movie I've ever seen.  It is marked the best in my mind for universally excellent acting (particularly Foster, Hopkins, and Ted Levine), a racing, suspenseful plot, thrilling elements of character you will have never seen coming, and an on-the-edge-of your seat feeling from the moment you first meet Dr. Hannibal Lecter to the moment the credits begin to roll.  I love being drawn into movies in such a way that real life seems far far away.  This is one of those movies.

Clarice Starling is a young, strong-willed FBI student assigned to interview the intriguing and frightening Hannibal Lecter.  Starling finds herself involved in hunting down Buffalo Bill (a killer nicknamed as such for the way he "skins his humps") with Lecter's help.  The mind games and conversations that go on between Starling and Lecter are absolutely my favorite parts of this movie.  So many times I thought I'd had a grip on the plot only to find myself totally thrown again and again.

"Silence of the Lambs" is not only a truly wonderful movie in general, but in the subcategory of horror/suspense/thriller movies, it is perfect.  Suspense, a slight bit of gore to keep your heart pounding, remarkable and admirable characters, and just the right amount of disturbing chills placed tastefully throughout the whole thing combine to become my recipe for the ideal horror movie.  Even if horror movies are not to your taste, give "Silence of the Lambs" a fair try - you will be impressed.
