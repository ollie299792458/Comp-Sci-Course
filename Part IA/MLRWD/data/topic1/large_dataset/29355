Space 1999 reminds me of an ugly puppy that is so ugly its adorable. This series was sooo bad its great. If you love the old Sci-Fi B Movies you will love this. On a decent TV with good speakers you will be satisfied with the pic and sound quality.I am not interested in Blue Ray. This is good enough for me. I know the first season was seen as "intellectually" superior but phooey. Watch season two for the monsters (I am a huge Godzilla fan). Actually one Monster with different feet, hands and an occasional tail thrown on) Corny , badly acted ;all true but so was Star Trek. Oh don't hate. You know its true. I especially love that as a kid I never saw the bad special effects. Now I can't get enough of the little plastic figures and vehicles zooming across the moon's surface.  The 70's mod decor and polyester fashion brings me back. If you are a Lost fan you may recognize one of the characters on Space 1999 as Farmer Ray. I didn't, someone told me. I have a pretty good collection of my favorite TV shows from my childhood and love the fact that this series was not forgotten. Take this series for what it is and don't over analyze. I wish it had lasted a few seasons more. I let myself get into the moment and corny suspense and its FUN. Maya was a great hero for girls.
