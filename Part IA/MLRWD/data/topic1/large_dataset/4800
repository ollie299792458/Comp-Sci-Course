following my graduation from an all-girls public school in baltimore, i had a summer to kill, so to speak. worked a bit part-time, and got on my mom's nerves to the point where she gave me a few bucks to take the  streetcar downtown and see a movie. i went alone to see 'the collector'. he  (stamp) was brilliant, sick and irresistible; she (eggar) was stunning,  irresistible and smart enough - one hoped - to ultimately evade his sick  and relentless capture...not. when i left the theater and waited for the  transit bus to take me safely home, i shuddered every time an unmarked  telephone company van passed by. ironically, just watched a 'discovery'  channel documentary about teenie-bopper mallrats who were engaged, seduced  and ultimately murdered by a "talent agent". perhaps ' the  collector', one of the penultimate, yet subtle, stalker movies of all  times, should be required viewing for today's psuedo-sophisticated teens.  though i subliminally rooted for stamp's tragic character, he was  unmistakably ill and - to my mind - more frightening than any obvious cad  i've seen since. maybe it's just me...sd
