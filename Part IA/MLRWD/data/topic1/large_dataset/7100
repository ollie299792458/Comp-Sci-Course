I really enjoyed this movie.  I have it in my dvd collection.  Both Diane Lane and Richard Gere render remarkable performances in their turns as husband and wife.  In fact it was this movie that made me a fan of Richard Gere.  This movie is full of lust, sex, raw passion and, of course, betrayal.  Pampered housewife meets sexy French book dealer.  Their affairs leads to tragedy.

Diane Lane is absolutely gorgeous.  I have always thought so.  She is killer in this role and I was glad when she received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the lusting housewife.  Her character engages in a torrid affair with a book dealer whom she literally runs into one day.  At first she throws herself into the affair but eventually guilt pays her a visit.  Unfortunately guilt comes too late.

The husband, suspecting his wife is being unfaithful, has his wife followed.  He then confronts his wife's lover.  At first the meeting is calm, although the viewer can sense there is a sick morbidity underlying it.  The first time I watched this movie I was unprepared for the scene with the snow globe.  It was so unexpected and sickened me so much that I literally fainted.  It is after this scene that the movie turns to slow decay (not of quality of film but of lives unraveling).  The heaviness of death at first lingers and then becomes pervasive as husband and wife slowly confront the reality of their situation and begin to accept the consequences of their actions.

It is a sad, tragic movie in the end.  Some reviewers have compared it to Fatal Attraction although I don't see the comparison at all.  At the end of this movie, everyone involved loses.  There is a strong moral to this story.  The film is in no way preachy.  Rather it leaves you with a pang in your heart as you grieve for a family torn apart by adultery.

Unfaithful is an excellent drama and I highly recommend it.
