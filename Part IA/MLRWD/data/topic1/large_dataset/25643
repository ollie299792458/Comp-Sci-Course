This is not a scary movie, unless everyday evil being easy to miss is scary to you.

What this movie does have is depth.  Polanski moved it along at a great pace, unfolding the tale bit by bit, but the thing is, there is much more than one story here.  I suspect a lot of people will GET the surface but miss what lies at the depth.

There's a lot of thought in this story, and it draws from a rich occult background.  If you've a background in Crowley, Hermeticism, OTO or such, you will get much more out of this movie than the person that is not familiar with these things.  Careful detail was taken to weave hermetic occultism into the storyline, and if you are familiar with the AE WAITE tarot deck, you will recognize a lot of the symbols on the 'plates' of the book.

If you are looking for monsters, spells, things that go BOO and make you jump, blood, gore...this movie isn't for you.  If you are very well read, and like intellectual horror, you just might find you want to own this one.
