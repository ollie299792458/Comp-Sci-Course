I bought this on VHS and while the film transfer, visually, is very good, the dialogue is so poor that I had to turn my TV all the way up (thereby getting a lot of "noise") in order to hear it. That being said, though, this is a movie that puts a lot of current action films to shame. As many before have noted here, the dialogue is razor-sharp, full of quips and cynical gems. But the movie never descends into slapstick or cornball territory. It's exciting, funny, extremely well-photographed and acted to perfection, especially by Lee Marvin and Burt Lancaster. This would make an interesting "book-end" movie to watch after a "serious" mercenary film, such as The Dogs of War.
I'd rank The Professionals alongside such classic westerns as The Outlaw Josey Wales, The Magnificent Seven, and The Sons of Katie Elder (which is severely under-rated, IMO). I just wish the sound was re-mastered better. I wish I had a DVD player so I could have tried that instead! Oh well.
