Being an Earth Wind,& Fire fan and a Chicago fan from the late 70's, I would have brought this DVD site unseen, that's how much I'm in to these two bands.  Upon seeing it, it is by far worth every penny spent. Placing these two bands on the same stage is speechless along with magic in the making.  From start to finish the energy is non-stop.  From the standpoint of a musician, to watch the two bands execute the chord progressions and tight horn licks with such ease as we mere musicians sit and spend hours trying to figure them is a music lesson you can't put a price tag on.  In the category of pure entertainment, how's this, my 10 & 16 year old daughters (both drummers) along with some of their friends have watched this DVD more times than I, it's that good.

For those of you who say Philip Bailey has lost his touch, Lord knows I can't wait to see the show where he regains it, his voice range in this concert is out of this world.  I don't want to say Chicago vs E,W,& F because the two bands have their own style.  Chicago may have been a little stiff but again the harmony and the solos were like vintage wine.  When they come together for 25-6-4, two powerful horn sections, two bass players, two drummers, top this mix with three guitar players going at it, you figure it out.

 This one gets 5 stars from me.
