The Rocketeer is one of the most enjoyable action-adventure movies ever made.  Everything about this film is wonderful.  Director Joe Johnson perfectly captures the look and feel of Hollywood (or what Hollywood should look and feel like) during the 1930s.  Great casting with Bill Campbell right on target at Cliff Secord, Jennifer Connelly as his best girl, Jenny Blake, Alan Arkin as Cliff's mentor and mechanic/inventor friend, and Timothy Dalton as the evil Nazi spy-movie star Neville Sinclair.  Like Raiders of the Lost Ark, it is a homage to the film serials of the period, but with a lot more spit and polish.  The special effects are great, the set decoration, costumes, makeup, all evoke the time and place perfectly.  A wonderful script adapted from the graphic novel of the same name sets this movie apart from others in this genre.  The dialogue is funny, fast and at sometimes furious.  Campbell plays the All-American boy with a real gee whiz, almost Jimmy Stewart kind of charm.  The plot about a secret plan by the Nazis to build rocket packs for an army of "Rocketeers" to take over the world is added and abetted by Dalton as the Errol Flynn-like movie star.  When a prototype rocket pack accidentally ends up in the hands of Campbell and Arkin, the action, and their troubles, really start.  This film is filled with dozens of wonderful characterizations.  Some of the best are Paul Sorvino as gangster Eddie Valentine, Terry O'Quinn as Howard Hughes, and Tiny Ron as Lothar.  The musical score by James Horner is outstanding.  It's heroic, quiet and inspiring.  Why this film didn't turn out to be the big blockbuster it should have been is beyond me.  I love Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this film matches it in almost every category.  One of my favorite modern films, I never tire of watching it.  Perfect entertainment and perfect for all ages.  The Rocketeer is a real winner.
