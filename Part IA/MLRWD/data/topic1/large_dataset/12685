I had gotten this movie at Best Buy, and I have to say that it's a good movie. I didn't see it in the theaters, as I just managed to catch it on tv one afternoon. It caught my attention and I just had to get it. Let's face it, all inventors are misunderstood and teased at  greatly when they were young. Although Flint's inventions just kept backfiring, he just kept on trying and kept at it. Amazingly his invention worked, and he just needed more power to make it go. Wow, I must say how amazing this invention of his works, it could end world hunger. And even with a movie like this of turning water into food, you never know as someday, somebody just might take it one step ahead, and make it into a reality. And they can say that they got inspired by the movie. I think that the sequel to this story is when Flint invents a machine to make it rain pickles. Yeah the whole town of chew and swallow covered in pickles, what fun is that, everyone eating nothing but pickles?! You figure with all the giant food, since it was made of water, then Flint could've changed it back into water. And just call this giant food frenzy a historical food event. Personally, my all time favorite scene is Flint's giant Jell-0 mold, as Flint and his new friend are bouncing and jumping all around inside the wiggle giggly treat.
