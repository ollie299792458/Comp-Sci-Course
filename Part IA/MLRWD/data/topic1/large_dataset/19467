Like many of my friends, I had written this movie off as just another testosterone-ridden-special-fx-flick for the comic-loving masses.(Ok, I admit, I love comics too). But I was surprised that after 20 minutes into the movie I was actually having a good time! It doesn't try to do anything too ambitious, but what it does do is entertain as a summer movie should. There's lots of special fx and nice battle scenes, and the pacing is spot-on. The subject matter is admittedly over-the-top (with the Norse mythological ties), but the movie doesn't take it too far. It keeps things in the "awesome-looking" category rather than the "campy" category more often than not. Portman does a good job as the over-enthusiastic scientist and Hemsworth does a surprisingly great Thor performance. Their interaction is just another thing that works well for the movie. If you plan to watch the up coming Avengers movie, you can consider this as required viewing - as it appears one of the key antagonists of the Avenger movie is the same one here. Action is fun, not bloody and overly violent - so I wouldn't have a problem taking a 8-12 year-old to watch this. There are no steamy love scenes either. My one gripe is I wish it were longer. The events that transpire in the movie seem like they were rather rushed.
