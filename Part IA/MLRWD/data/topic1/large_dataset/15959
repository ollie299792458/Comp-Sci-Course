Summer Stock had been on my list to buy for quiet sometime, and recently I was able to get it because I found a reason for my father to buy it (though, technically, I had to repay him the money). First off, the movie is in beautiful condition. Not grainy or anything, audio is perfection.

In Summer Stock, Garland plays Jane Falbury (in her final MGM picture), a farm owner more than a bit riled when her aspiring-actress (Gloria De Haven) shows up with a theatrical troupe that wants to stage a musical in the family barn. Though she doesn't want to do it, she agrees to it after a while on the condition that they must help her with the farm chores. Soon afterwards, the sister leaves, and Jane has to fill in her spot. And throughout the making of the musical, Jane and Joe D. Ross (Gene Kelly) fall in love. There are some beautiful moments throughout the movie (besides Gene's dance with the board and newspaper, and Judy's number with "Get Happy), you've got Gene and Judy's first duet, Phil Silvers comic bits, and the destruction of Jane's tractor (which in my opninon is hilarious)

You'll love the movie, and in today's economy, if you do buy this you can have the satisfaction that you're not wasting your money. And if you have kids, it's something that they, too, would enjoy.
