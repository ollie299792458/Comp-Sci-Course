as someone who can't stand comic books or cartoons, i admit i'd never heard of elektra, daredevil, or most of these other comic book superheroes before they became movies...

that said, i really enjoyed this movie :)  sure, the plot could use a little beefing up, but the characters, being the single most important part in any story, really shine in this film :)  jennifer garner is fabulous... i don't think anyone else could have played the role and make the character seem real instead of a cheesy cardboard cutout... but she did it!  :)  kirsten prout switches from very tongue-in-cheek funny to warrior to sad on-the-run girl at the drop of a hat and does it very well every time :)  the character is fun and i must say she steals much of the show :)  colin cunningham is also fun (i'd seen him in both stargate Sg1 and the 6th day before this), though i admit to being surprised to find him quite funny :D  another stage-stealer... too bad they kill him off so early...

the "bad guys" are of course all cliches, but they're fun... and since you know they're all gonna die anyway it doesn't matter that they're not much more than fun :D

as for the plot, despite needing a beefing up as i said before, it really does do pretty well... the good vs evil doesn't come across as too cliched, though it is a bit overstated at times... and the side-plot of elektra's mother's death is interesting, if not a bit strange... still, the journey of her character is well done and fun to watch along the way :)

all in all, i saw this movie in the theatre 3 times, and i plan to buy it on dvd, so i'd certainly say this movie was quite enjoyable :)
