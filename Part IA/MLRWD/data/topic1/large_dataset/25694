Amira's Bellydance 101 is a great instructional dvd for beginners to bellydance.

Amira gives clear explanations and visual demonstrations step by step to help you understand the basic moves that are the foundation of bellydance. She teaches many foundation movements from hip drops to basic shimmies, pays special attention to proper dance posture, and includes a warm-up/cool-down.
The overall production of the DVD is very professional, good lighting and sound. There are no annoying, abrupt camera angles or zoom effects. Amira's outfits are tasteful and appropriate, and do not distract from, or hide her movements.

Though I enjoyed the "combinations" section, a short repetitive drill of the moves learned, I have to say I was disappointed that it did not show how to layer the moves together to create a simple dance routine.

Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is a beginner to bellydance. It is a good "starter" instructional DVD for the person who does not have access to a bellydance class and great for "at home practice" for those that do. Another great beginner bellydance DVD to try is Bellydance Basics and Beyond with Jenna. Both of these DVDs will cover most of the basic moves that would be taught in a beginner level bellydance class.
