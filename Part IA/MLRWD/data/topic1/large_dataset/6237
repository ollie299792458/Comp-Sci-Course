In 1926 young director Alfred Hitchcock made the silent thriller "The Lodger" for Gainsborough Pictures UK. "The Lodger" is silent, but is a very atmospheric and entertaining movie, even now 73 years  after its release in Britain. The story deals with, not surprisingly, a  lodger who rents a room in an 1888 London boarding house... but the  landlady suspects he is Jack the Ripper, the man who has been slaughtering  young blondes on the streets in London. Unlike the films remakes (made in  1932, 1944 and 1953) this lodger turns out not to be the Ripper, but this  is discovered only after an angry mob chase him around the dark London  streets in a murderous rage. Apparently, Hitchcock didn't want Ivor Novello  (the actor who played the lodger) to be the Ripper: he said he didn't want  the public to believe that Novello was a real villain - that shows the  power of 20s movies on the public, I guess. You never do find out who the  REAL Ripper is... An excellent early Hitchcock, featuring the director's  first cameo appearance in one of his films. Silent movie magic!
