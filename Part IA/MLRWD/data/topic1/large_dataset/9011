I just finished watching this show for the first time, and I really liked it.  I was VERY doubtful at first, due to all the negative things I've heard about it, but I was really, really pleasantly surprised.  The introduction was breathtaking - better than I'd imagined when I read the book.  Nearly every character (especially Doon, Lina, and Looper) were perfect.  The actors were picked perfectly - I was able to say, "Oh, there's so-and-so" before the character had even been introduced.

The movie was very faithful to the book, with many many extra "thrills" thrown in to make it more exciting.  But because of all the extra "thrills", I believe that character development didn't have enough time.  The story went very quickly, not giving the audience much time to get to know anyone but Doon and Lina.  If I hadn't read the book, I would most likely have been very confused. :)

My takeaway: it's an exciting, fun, fast-paced movie with loveable characters, but in order to enjoy the movie to the fullest, read the book first.  (The book is REALLY good!) :)
