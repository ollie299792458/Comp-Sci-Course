This is absolutely the best music DVD I've ever seen.  Picture quality is great, and (obviously) more importantly, the sound is incredible.  I've played this on my laptop, and in my DVD player at home with 5.1 surround, and it sounds great in both places.  MTV did a fantastic job putting this together.  Not only do you get the MTV broadcast, but you also get the entire show, without editing, from song to song, and it's really cool to see how Kurt was interacting with the crowd, Krist and Dave, and the guest musicians he had on the show.

The MTV News "Bare Witness" segment was really neat too.  You see people involved with the concert, whether it be fans or the MTV producers behind the scenes, and they lend some really valuable insight into that very special evening in NYC.

I think even if you are not a Nirvana fan or a Kurt Cobain fan (how can you not be a fan, though?), this DVD is a great purchase.  For $12, you cannot find a better value for what you get in terms of quality.  Also, this was the most historic concert of the 90's, as just a few months later, Cobain's life was ended.  This intimate look into that special night that so few shared with the band is really worthwhile.
