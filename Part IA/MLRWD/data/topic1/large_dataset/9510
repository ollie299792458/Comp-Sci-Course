Scream 3 is the final film of the Scream Trilogy. In Scream 3, Sidney Prescott (played by Neve Campbell) realizes that another killer is stalking her when cast members of "Stab 3: Return to Woodsborro" start to get  killed. She decides to keep hidden in her well protected home in the  mountains, until the killer finds out her hiding place. She then goes to  Hollywood, where all the murders are happening, to face the killer. Gale  Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) and Dwight "Dewey" Riley (David Arquette)  have their usual love fling, and they both investigate the murders and the  photos that the killer leaves behind after each murder to try to find out  who the killer is.  So far, the Scream series has been a "slash-`em-up"  series with lots of scares and gore. Scream 3 is much different than the  other two. Scream 3 is more of a thriller with a "whodunit" plot. Scream 3  definitely doesn't have as many intense murder scenes, and a lot less blood  than the other two. The movie ends in a twist that you probably never would  have thought of.  Scream 3 is rated "R" because of profanity, gore, and  violence that may be inappropriate or offensive to young audiences and  people who get offended by such matter.  Scream 3 is mainly based on  events that were in the first Scream, so I advise you watch the first two  movies of the trilogy before you go see the third one, otherwise you would  be lost. If you saw the first two movies of the trilogy, I suggest you go  see Scream 3. It links the events of the other two movies together and  makes the whole trilogy make some kind of sense. This movie pretty much  answers the question of whether or not their will be a Scream 4. Watch it  to find out!
