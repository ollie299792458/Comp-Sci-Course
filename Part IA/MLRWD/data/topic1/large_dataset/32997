Look, I'm not going to write about the film "Ray." It's impossible to argue against the brilliant performance of Jamie Foxx and the only real problem is, as someone else pointed out, the end which has no real resolution and feels like the project was simply ended with little thought. My real complaint / warning involves the "limited edition" package.

I haven't posted reviews here because I have so little free time, but I'm tired of double disk sets that don't meet the expectations they tease. It seems like the studios have realized that we will spend an extra $10 to get more features and are exploiting this fact. Look at this edition of "Ray." Of all the supplemental features, only one is substantial. The long documentary, "Ray:An American Journey" is really the only bonus feature worth watching. "Walking in His Shoes," "The Women of Ray," and "Ray Remembered" each lasts at best 10 minutes and are simply new combinations of interviews and facts already contained in the longer doc. Basically, they are padding, recycled material used to justify a $30+ price tag. There is absolutely no reason that the studio couldn't have done a single disk edition that contained all the features, but by splitting them up, using portions over and over, they con us into spending extra cash. Personally, I would rather have a single, comprehensive doc than a series of repetitive mini features. What a shame. Ray, I'm sorry man. Even your ghost is being exploited.
