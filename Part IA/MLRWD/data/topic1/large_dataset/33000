I am 26 years old, apple-shaped, and 5'3 with big calfs and arms, so I got this workout in an attempt to have that dancer's body. It's about 45min straight of fast-paced dance performance cardio. No wonder pop stars are so toned and skinny. It's hard to do that for 45 min straight. The only thing is they must have really good dance instructors helping them get the moves... This video is like trying to learn every move Britney does in her high-impact dance moves just by watching. It will take quite a while, but I guess it's doable.

I'm giving this 2 stars, because she doesn't cue you at all during the dances. During the section that she teaches you each dance slowly, you never actually do it to music two times in a row to get the feel of the transition. Also, when you do difficult transitions in slow motion, it looks and feels completely different than the actual real-time dance moves.

Great workout if you can learn it. I think I'll keep trying begrudgingly bc I want a dancers body. Let me know if you know a cardio workout that would give me lean calves and arms...

Her mat workout is awesome, though.
