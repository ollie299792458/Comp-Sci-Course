If you are a Three Stooges fan and didn't buy the various collections as they were released you'd have to be a knucklehead not to buy this "Ultimate" set.  A mere $50 bought me all 190 Stooges short films, including two in anaglyph 3-D (glasses provided), two Stooges feature films making their DVD debuts, and a couple of dozen short films showcasing Shemp, Joe Besser, and Joe DeRita.  Where else are you going to get all this in one package?  The picture quality is excellent, though the 3-D shorts don't work as well as they could.  This set does not include their many TV appearances, TV commercials, home movies, failed TV pilots, some miscellaneous movie roles in other people's film, or color wraparounds for their cartoon series, but most of that material is easily found and obtained on inexpensive public domain releases.  This "Ultimate" set provides the Stooges fans with the stuff they really want -- their classic Columbia Pictures output.  The only thing that could make it any better would be if it also included the rest of their feature films for that studio.  But that's no complaint because this collection is about as good as it gets!
