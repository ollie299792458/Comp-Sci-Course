When this film was made in 1914 and released in 1915, America was a different place, it was a time when whites and blacks were at major odds. This was before the civil rights movement and the harlem renaissance, race riots in southern towns were occuring and horrible hangings. So it is understandable how the racist overtones was happening. The blacks were still seen as igonrent, blind and greedy, as was the abolitionists, who were seen as corrupt. And to the south even as late as the 60s, the KKK were considered heros of the white way. I am not a racist, I hate the KKK, however, when watching what was being depicted on screen, was that I was rooting for the "Hero" played Henry B. Walthall. And the KKK, sicking as it may sound that is what made millions of moviegoers call it the greatest movie of all time. It had an exciting edge, to it. It is still the most controversal movie of all time. No other movie in history since has made a movie that showed the blacks in a bad light. And the worst part of it is that it was white actors in black face. I however, got past the sicking racism and was just in awe of what was happening. I am 18 years old. I have seen and loved Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but when I watch this film, just like any other silent film, I put my shoes in to a movie goer from that time period. I did just that with Birth Of A Nation, I pictured my self in a major theater in 1915, seeing only short two reel bit shorts, and sitting there watching the first epic in American history. The second disk is a gem. Particulary the four short D.W Griffth shorts, and a rare interview with the man himself Griffth and Walter Huston in an sound 1938 interview. It was an odd interview.  With Griffth remarking " Boy you ask a lot of questions" duh!! But hey give ol D.W his props, he gave our movie grammer. This is the first epic, the first special effects marval, and a true American classic
