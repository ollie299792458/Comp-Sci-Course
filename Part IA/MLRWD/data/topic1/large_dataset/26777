"Andromeda Strain" is one of my favorite movies because it stands the test of time.  Although made in the early 1970's, the technology shown,
including the computers still looks  up-to-date, with the main difference being that today, the graphical displays of the data would be much more colorful.  However, the techniques used to analyze the "Andromeda" organism would be the same ones used today.  Of course, much of the suspense of the movie is created by a stuck sliver of paper, and that would not occur today, but 99% of what is shown (including the threat to mankind for terrestrial biological warfare or extra-terrestrial organisms) is still very relevant.  In fact, the society in which the film takes place is more "future-oriented" than our current one because reference is made to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston which processed the samples returned from the Moon by the Apollo astronauts, and which has since been idled by the loss of the spirit of exploration in our current society, so the makers of the film were able to do more futuristic thinking and make a story and laboratory that looks contemporary even decades later.  Finally, the actors, led by Arthur Hill (one of my favorites) are all "cool, intellectual" types, and although there are differences of opinion between them, they all submerge their egos to get their vital work done.  It is sad that films of this type are not made any more.  Get it and see what I mean!
