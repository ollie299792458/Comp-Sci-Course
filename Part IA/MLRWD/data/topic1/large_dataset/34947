What a nice surprise.  My family of two young boys stayed away from the film in the theaters as most remakes of Dr. Suess' classic have been very disappointing.  When my son started asking for it and amazon had such a great price, I picked it up.  It's now in constant rotation and I must say, it's very good.

The Horton story is not very long and the filler used to stretch the film out works well.  The additional characters that were "beefed up" to add to the story are great.  The voice actors are some of our favorite (Seth Rogen)and Jim Carrey in no way takes away from Horton with his usual "Carrey-ness".

As a Home Theater show off Blu-ray disc, without spoiling any of the story, there is a scene with many pink flowers blowing in the wind.  It's pure 1080p eye candy!!!

This is not at the level of PIXAR, but right up there with the Dreamworks films (Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar) and worth a viewing.
