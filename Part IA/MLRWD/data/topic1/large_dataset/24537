I really enjoyed purchasing this set. Great packaging, and very good movies.

The Mummy: Great transfer, looks and sounds great.
The Mummy Returns: Same as The Mummy, although the movie wasn't as great.
The Scorpion King: Looks and sounds the best, although the movie wasn't so good.

HOWEVER, Universal studios made a big mistake by changing the box to this set. Back when this was released in 2005, Universal released this and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BCE918">Jurassic Park Adventure Pack</a>. Both sets were included in a really nice box that folded open and had the discs kept in a tri-fold case. Unfortunately, in 2007/2008 Universal changed the looks of these boxsets. The JP pack had the tri-fold case in a slipcover, with the bland discs that can be found in the individual releases. The Mummy set is now in a normal DVD case, but considerably thicker to house the contents of the set. Luckily, for me, I purchased mine at the mall, where I could actually SEE what box it had. This is why I HIGHLY suggest to go to a store and purchase this. Anyway, a great buy for the money.
