Sam Peckinpah definitely became the standard for American westerns after John Ford and Howard Hawks. He kind of is still. Each of the four films in this set are beautful and very different.

-Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, a story that's much of betrayal . Pat Garret betrays his old friend but you still feel bad for him because you know it wasn't a decision that was easy to make. The all around tone of the film was right. Sam Peckinpah even makes a cameo appearance, and it's a sad scene as well.

-The Ballad Of Cable Hogue, a story of simple man . Not a greedy. It's  about love and the ways of life. It kind of shows the start of a decline of once was the west. It's my favorite film of the set.

-The Wild Bunch, Definitely the standard for all American westerns. It's a brutal and heart breaking western film. Has to do alot with betrayal and decisions made in life. Standing by those decisions and even loyality.
My second favorite film in the set.

-Ride The High Country, alot of Sam Peckinpah's work has a sense of loss and the feeling of nothing lasting forever. But also things being so wonderful. I think this film has alot of that.
