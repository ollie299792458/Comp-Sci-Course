I missed the opening night of TCOR (and a free ticket enclosed in my Father's Day Pitch Black DVD gift) because my wife refused to see it with me. For the next couple of weeks I was  bombarded with  typical reviewer comments of SCI-FI movies... "A computerized mess", "sophmoric action", etc. When I finally got to see it over the 4th of July holiday I was pleasantly surprised...and totally entertained (at 51 years old). This is not ALIEN, Contact, DTESS, or 2001, but I like Sci-Fi action that totally takes you away from reality. This one definitely fits that bill and was well worth the 2 hours I spent glued to the screen watching it.
Movie-Reviewers please don't take this negatively, but have a SCI-FI aficionado review a Sci-Fi movie first... get his reaction and then go and watch the movie. You can't watch Citizen Kane and then go review this movie. Sci-Fi has been getting a bad knock for a while now. Some of its well deserved, but SCI-FI is a genre unto itself and should be reviewed by SCI-FI specialist. No Oscar nomination for Diesel, but honorable mention as one of this years best Sci-Fi action heroes.
