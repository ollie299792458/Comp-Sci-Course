i wonder--does anyone review movies they actually stayed AWAKE during?? firstly, minnie driver's character is NOT named "mary." her name is rosina. in order to find employment with a "gentile" family, she posed as "mary blackchurch" (she told her brother the name sounded biblical). also, rosina was NOT about to be "sent off to marry a man that she did not love" before her father died. (i wonder if that was another movie entirely?) rosina was never being married off by her parents or anyone else. it was her father's death which PROMPTED talk of possibly marrying, due to her father leaving his family "destitute" UPON his death. rosina mentioned to her younger sister that she had hit it off with a man (at a jewish dance after temple) whom she supposedly kissed and might be interested in. after her father's death, rosina opted to go off in search for employment to help support her family rather than remain and marry ANYONE for stability (either her preferred young man or any other--including an older and less desirable man who was introduced to her by her mother and aunt.)
