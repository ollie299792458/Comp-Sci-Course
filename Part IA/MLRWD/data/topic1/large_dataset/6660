This is a great little film, with fine acting all around. Has enough of the sci-fi element to pull in folks like me, but mostly a toungue-in-cheek adventure movie that's just serious enough to not be ridiculous. The pulsing Moorwen was great, and while the movie was disjointed in the final act, I believe that was the result of poor editing and decisions by the production company, rather than the fault of the director, as everything flowed quite nicely at first. I've been a fan of Caviezel since Frequency, and his portrayal (which everyone seems to have forgotten!) of Edmond Dantes in "The Count of Monte Cristo" captured that character perfectly (Guy Pearce was perfect as well). Ron Perlman is always amazing, and it is upsetting to me that with a little more effort, this could have been a great film. Perlman was about the only saving grace in that Nicholas Cage crapfest "Season of the Witch", but it went into wide release. Why not Outlander, which is a far superior film? Just glad to see Caviezel's career turning back around with "Person of Interest".
