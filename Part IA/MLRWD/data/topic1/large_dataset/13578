Contempt is Jean-Luc Godard's masterpiece, and quite possibly the best film of the 60s. The film has so many layers and meanings, one viewing is not enough. Similar in style to Antonioni's film trilogy of the 60s that started with L'Avventura (1960), Contempt beautifully tells the story of a marriage lost, and a journey fullfilled. The film takes place over a short period of time, and half of it is contained in the couple's apartment, yet the film has an epic feel as large as The Odyssey. Raoul Coutard's cinematography is nothing short of magnificant, Georges Delerue's score is one of the most haunting and exquisite in cinema, and the acting, especially by Bardot in a sublte performance, is top notch. Godard may not have embraced the CinemaScope look, but this film is evidence he knew how to use it. Contempt works on three levels: First as a breakdown of a marriage, second as a modern day re-telling of The Odyssey, and third as a stand in for the makers of the film; but either way you look at it Contempt is a beautiful, somewhat surreal masterpiece that stands with the best of cinema.
