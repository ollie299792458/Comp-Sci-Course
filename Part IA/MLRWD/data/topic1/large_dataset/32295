Bullitt is a rare and complex film; a strange mixture of European style "cinema verite" and glossy Hollywood stylisation. Sure, it has a car-chase, but its a shame that that monumental sequence tends to overwhelm everything else that's good in it.
The opening title sequence which flips from color to monochrome accompanied by a loud jazzy score, indicates nothing but a brash late 1960s stylish thriller. But what we get is a thoughtful sensitive character study of a laconic, yet complex man; Frank Bullitt, his arty sensitive English girlfriend, and the pressures his job in the San Fransico Homicide division impose.
Englishman Peter Yates started his career directing advertisments and short films; his aptitude for the perfectly crafted scene is never better than here. Most scenes are shot from a distance giving a deliberately cold amoral feel. Several, such as the meal in the jazz club (no dialogue), Bullitt's trip to the grocery store (two words of dialogue), and the muder discovery in the motel near San Mateo are about as perfect as cinema gets.
There's also a little remarked but very subtle mood change that occurs; at the beginning of the film we feel excited, almost exhilerated, by the end (the best closing shot you'll ever see?) the mood is sombre and serious.
If you have the attention span of a goldfish, like lots of action and plenty of dead bodies and explosions, then this film is not for you. 
If instead you like to care about the people you watch, and want to appreciate virtuoso film making (has any thriller ever been better to look at?) then buy this DVD. You'll watch it many times, and find plenty to enjoy and ponder each time.
Highly recommended.
