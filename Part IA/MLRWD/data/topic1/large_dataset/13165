Max (Pierce Brosnan) has stolen the supposedly famous Napoleon diamond right from under FBI agent Stan's nose (Woody Harrelson). Now, he's retired to the Bahamas with his voluptuous accomplice/fianc&eacute;e Lola (Salma Hayek). Stan trails them to the Bahamas, convinced Max is going to steal the third and last Napoleon diamond from a cruise ship which is passing through. Also hounding the "retired" Max is the local crime boss (Don Cheadle), who wants Max to steal the diamond for him.

Although entertaining, this film has none of the wit or ingenuity of The Thomas Crown Affair. What it does have is Salma Hayek's breasts, which are so prominently displayed they are practically another character. What really stretches credulity is the sudden fast friendship that develops between Brosnan and Harrelson's characters. How many FBI agents go fishing, rub suntan oil on, or sleep in the same bed with their prime suspect?

If you want to see Salma Hayek in an endless succession of skimpy ensembles, or Pierce Brosnan shirtless, this is the film for you.
