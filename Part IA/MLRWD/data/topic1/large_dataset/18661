REVIEW FROM KIDS' FLIX (DAD'S PICKS) BY TOM LAMARR, [...]

What does comedian Denis Leary have in common with a visit from Uncle Rick?  At least when bringing saber-toothed Diego to life in any of his three Ice Age movies, Leary manages to be likable, funny, and caustic, without once swearing in front of the kids.  Not a single "WTF?" or any of the other phrases familiar to fans of Leary--and Uncle Rick.  It's an impressive feat by any measure, one seriously deserving of its own WTF.

The rest of the recurring cast--headed by Ray Romanof, John Leguizamo, and starting with the sophomore Meltdown, Queen Latifah--also turn out to be welcome houseguests for both parents and children.  Yet with so many comedians on the bill, it is Scratte, the beleaguered prehistoric squirrel-rat, who gets the biggest laughs from grownups and kids alike, and this entirely through physical humor.  Even as animated characters go, Scratte is very animated.

Meeting the definition of true family entertainment, Ice Age has something for everyone.  With the third installment due soon on DVD, it might be worth seeing winter's first snowy weekend as an excuse to hold an Ice Age film fest.  But don't forget to invite Uncle Rick.  He's a big Leary fan, and he'll want to be there when your twelve year old proclaims, "Now, that was [expletive deleted] great."
