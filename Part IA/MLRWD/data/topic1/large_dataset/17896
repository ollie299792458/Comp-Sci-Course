This tries to be Cinema Verite, but It's not believable.  So many of the emotional reactions are implausible and melodramatic: Rachel's hysterical reaction to Kym's dinner toast, Dad's nearly operatic reaction to seeing Ethan's plate, Rachel storming out of the beauty salon, Kym demanding to be maid of honor, etc.  These are drama queens on steroids.  It's annoying - not entertaining.

As for the wedding, it has a constant aura of putting on airs.  Look how untraditional, creative and supportive we are.  Could we have at least one of the characters acknowledge how different this wedding is, rather than everyone acting like it's the most normal thing in the world?  The film doesn't need to apologize for it, but it shouldn't pretend either.  In trying too hard not to appear self-consciously eccentric, it comes off as false.  And did it occur to anyone to ask how such a neurotic family could produce such a utopian wedding?

I will say that Debra Winger is perfect in her small role.
