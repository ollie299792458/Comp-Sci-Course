This is really excellent on every level, and it's a no nonsense nitty gritty look at life behind bars! Others have gone into the story line(s), and there are many, so I'll just add that this entire series should be mandatory viewing in our high schools. If this doesn't scare you away from a life of crime, NOTHING will! There's nothing glamorous about life in Prison, in this case Oz. In fact it's your very worst nightmare! Your days and nights are spent wondering how you can, or if you can, survive until the next day. It's the very act of survival that can turn a criminal into an even "better" one, or take a basically decent person whose committed a tragic mistake, and turn him into an animal.
There's a lot of very graphic violence and the full on nudity helps to show how the inmates are figuratively and literally stripped of their dignity! This is a very addictive series, and is so well acted and produced, that at times you almost feel like you're watching a documentary.
Great in every department!
