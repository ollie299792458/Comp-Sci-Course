For me, Heart was a four-album band (Dreamboat Annie/Little Queen/Magazine/Dog &amp; Butterfly).  After that, they evolved to a hair band singing power ballads.  I accept the fact that acts must evolve to remain on top, but I lost interest.  This performance captures my interest, again.  It is a solid offering where the music is the focus.  The fact that there is some new material is a plus.  Most bands that have been around as long as Heart (aka the Wilson sisters, I realize the rest of the band has changed over time) can't do that and some that try to write new material shouldn't.  This is not a nostalgia act, although they don't deny fans the chance to hear something familiar.  They also still have their chops -- the musicianship is there, the playing is solid and Ann still has her voice.  A must-have for Heart fans and a worthy addition for fans of straight-ahead rock-and-roll.  Between this and the new Led Zepplin DVD I have to give serious consideration to a surround sound TV.  Who knows, I might have given this a 5-star, if I had watched it on a better system.
