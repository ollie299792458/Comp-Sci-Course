As a resident of Ft. Collins, CO, the city where Matthew Shepard died, I feel a level of sadness and outrage over his death because it is so close to home and his death was so sickening.  The movie does a wonderful job showing both sides of the story. At one point, one of the interviewers breaks down for letting someone say something very blatantly and hurtfully anti-gay, but I admire her courage and that of her coworkers for traveling down from NYC to Laramie, Wyoming and to interview some extremely homophobic people.  The Reverend Phelps makes an appearance that is absolutely sickening in the movie as well.  How people can honestly thank God for AIDS because it kills homosexuals is disguisting to me, and there was a very touching scene revolving around Phelp's attendance and the pain a friend of Shepard feels and what she does about it.  I was first introduced to this story at my school's GSA, but I still remember the vigils held for him in Ft. Collins and around the country.  This is an extremely important story regarding the homophobic nature of much of our country.  It should be watched by anyone and everyone.  This is why there should be laws regarding hate crimes.
