The first time I watched this film I had to pick my jaw up from the floor several times before it dropped once more. "Girl With A Pearl Earring" is based on the movel by Tracy Chevalier. Once my library has a copy of the book to read, I am picking it up.

Simply, this is one of the most stunning and gorgeous movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Each and every shot is framed perfectly compositionally-wise, and the lighting as well as cinematography of Eduardo Serra is simply wonderful. Nearly each and every frame looks as if it was from an actual painting of Vermeer himself, which truly added to how seducing the film was, especially as an art student.

The acting is surberb by Scarlett Johansson who plays Griet, and her resemblence to the actual maid in the painting is eerie. Colin Firth as Vermeer and the chemistry he had on set with Johansson was perfect for the film, which only added to how stunning this movie really is. It was robbed of many Oscar nominations, and I would highly, highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in art and in art history. This movie is truly a pleasure for the eyes, and should be recognize much more than it is now.
