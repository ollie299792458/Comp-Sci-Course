This is not a glossy xerox of  New Jack City. In the world of 90s black gangsta films Fresh takes a grueling look at a 12 year old drug runner well played by Sean Nelson. Much maybe too much foul language can make the movie  seem cheap and futile at times. This may be the darkest film of it's kind  as you witness a young girl murdred in a basketball game in a crossfire by  a disgrunted player. While it is obvious (Boaz) is going for some shock  value he cunningly casts Samuel L. Jackson in a limited role as Fresh's  estranged father and maybe more importantly Giancarlo Esposito as drug  pusher and boyfriend to Fresh's older sister. Giancarlo steals this movie  as a guy you love to hate and a very familiar street type. Sean Nelson as  Fresh is amazing in his ability to make you see his tolerance for the pain  of his dysfunctional childhood. He uses his gifted intelligence to escape  what could be a very catostrophic situation. Just a note that although the  bad language is neccesary it's use seems like an alternative to good  script. Lines seem to be ad libed by the young actors. This movie however  dark and disturbing does what it intends to do. It tells it's streetlife  story without glamourizing it! Welldone for the most part!
