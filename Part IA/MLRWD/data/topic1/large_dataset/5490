Looking back in time modern science fiction had one of its main scientists, writers, philosophers and visionaires in one name: Carl Sagan, the author of the novel in which is based the movie.

The making of the movie gives a very near and sub-realistic intent in the searching of "green littles", all right that maybe means "live in Mars", "Aliens" or just "ET's" but in a very intelligent secuence. Jodie Foster who interprets the scientist Eleanor Arroway and in along the movie is the principal character (since the beggining when she was a child), gives a very strong image to those scientists who believes in science and in themselves.

Another very strong mates in the movie are Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Josh, the religious adviser from the White House and the Arroway's semi-sentimental partner, but more impresive is how all the trama develops in a very realistic secuence and the world's looking for this kind of contact.

But seriously Carl Sagan let think us about a vision who can happen maybe in the future, all the elements are teorically logical and his arguments are facts that could impact forever in the human kingdom history. Too seriuos is the history that Robert Zemekis and crew recluted a lot of existent talents with their own live characters as like in first place the same President of the United States Bill Clinton, Larry King, Jay Leno, Geraldo Rivera, Geraldine Ferraro, Kathleen Kennedy and others who plays their role as the same real life.

But the rest of actors as Tom Skerritt, David Morse, James Woods, Rob Lowe, Angela Bassett (how you remembers me a lot to Mrs. Condoleeza Rice girl!) and John Hurt (impactant character for S.R. Hadden) gives more credibility to this genius and intrigant sci-fi state-of-art movie.

Highly recomended to see this movie again and again, you'll never be bored, you'll be contacted.
