This is a really intense workout! You are guaranteed to sweat A LOT and your muscles will burn if you give 100%. Just be careful if you are moderately out of shape, and/or are not very flexible like I am. Some of the kicks and movements may require that you hold back from doing a full extension and at the pace shown. For example, the roundhouse kicks are fast-paced for newbies like me and may require less exaggerated movement to prevent pulling a muscle. Sometimes just substituting knee raises or 1/2 kick in the harder portions (or some reps in-between) still keeps the heart pumping and will allow you to keep pace a little better. I'm on my third week and I still have difficulty in some parts of this video. But this is exactly what I wanted--a workout that would truly challenge me and not go stale. The second part of the video uses weights. You may find that you will need to add heavier dumbbells for certain exercises, and in some cases like shoulders, no weights are even necessary. The shoulder portion is really tough! I use various sets of dumbbells (2 lbs, 5 lbs and 10 lbs) so I alternate between weights a bit. I saw results like tightening of my midsection right away. It's early on but I can see this is working. To add variety I sometimes incorporate my own music in the background and just following along visually. I highly recommend this video if you want a serious workout or to supplement your established routine.
