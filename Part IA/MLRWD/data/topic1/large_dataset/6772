I have seen this movie several times.  In my opinion, it is Steiger's greatest triumph.  But, since everything is now being re-made; here is my "dream cast":

SOL NAZERMAN: Mark Wahlberg.  (By dint of skillful make-up and aging; just like with Rod, remember?)

Like many of my generation, I came away from his rapper phase with the notion that "rapper" Marky-Mark was nothing more than a fourth-rate Narcissistic closet homosexual who was blessed with a marvelous physique and an elfin face, and who took delight in flaunting his charms for a repining and sadly gullible Gay (and Straight) clientele.

But, he has grown up!! Indeed, he has.  Now his face is more lined with pain. In the transition to acting he has taken on roles that are more vulnerable, piteous and soul-searching.  That is why I believe he could and SHOULD do Sol Nazerman.

Have you seen "Max Payne?"  I have, and it is a tour-de-force by a top-flight actor, which is what he is now. So, now with some tissue paper in the cheeks,(like Brando in "The Godfather"), a little crepe hair, etc., and, voila!, we have Sol Nazerman.

But, of course, it is the actor who ennobles the part.  The make up is only the beginning.  Wahlberg has shown that he intends to hone his acting and infuse it with conviction; less and less "Marky-Mark" and more the mature, hard-working artist.

What do you think?
