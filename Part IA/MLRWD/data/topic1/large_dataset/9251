First of all, I'd like to thank Amazon for putting this product on for deal of the day for $79.99!!!  I was so excited when I saw the deal, and I ordered the item in a heartbeat!  Also, the shipping time is amazingly short.  I love how I am always pleasantly surprised to get my shipment from Amazon so early!  Thank you, Amazon.

As for the product itself...
I love Ally Mcbeal!  It used to be my favorite show to watch on TV every Monday.  I looked forward to the release of the series for so long.  It was very nice to see that finally all the seasons and episodes are in the same package all together.  It was also a nice bonus to see the collection of songs in the final disk.

However, I have to say, for a long awaited series dvd like Ally Mcbeal, I would've expected more from the packaging of the dvds and also the DVD menu.  Everything seems very basic.  The menu interface seems like it is something that is bootlegged.  Also, I would've expected more special features as well, (i.e. deleted scenes, gag reels, etc).  I like the collection of songs a lot, but the CD would've been even better if it had included the songs sung by Robert Downey Jr. as well.

Overall, I am satisfied with the product because of the show itself.
