As a relative neophyte to anime, I had assume the art form was limited to Pokemon and similar low-production value animation with similarly low-budget storylines. I was wrong. Oh, how I was wrong.

_Princess Mononoke_ is one of several "anime" films written and drawn by Hayao Miyazaki, who is a master of the art form. The characters are a long, long way away from the ridiculous "cartoons" I associated with anime - his are on a whole other level of detail and form. The storyline, as well, was much deeper and complex than I had given the genre credit for. The protagonists are not entirely "good", and the antagonists are not entirely "evil" - an honest representation of human nature, I thought - well beyond what I was expecting. The story's complexity furthered by the myriad themes: the costs of human greed, the price of environmental degridation, and the conflict of doing what is right for the individual versus what is for the greater good.

What was most surprizing, however, were the shinto overtones to the story in both character and in animation: the interplay of light and dark on characters, the relationship between "spirit guardian" and mankind, and the casting of a Buddhist monk as an antagonist.

I enjoyed the film tremendously, as did my 7 year-old daughter (for whom much of the subtleties were lost on, but who remained riveted by the masterful storytelling.) While _Princess Mononke_ is not my favorite Miyazaki film, it warrants 5 stars nonetheless.
