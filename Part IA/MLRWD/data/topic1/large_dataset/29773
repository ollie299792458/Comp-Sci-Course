As of this date (6/14/10) there has been one "bad" Amazon review for this set by someone who derides Thriller for reminding him of Outer Limits and therefore not being original. That's funny because Thriller predated OL by three years... He also slams Karloff. Karloff is fantastic but, even if you don't like him (wha???) he's only in a handful of episodes as a player (he does serve as host for the entire run... and he's wonderful).

If anyone hasn't seen this show before and decides to pick it up on spec (at $100 a pop that seems unlikely), you should know that the first several episodes are subpar crime/suspense melodramas; don't give up after seeing these! The show eventually changed some behind-the-scenes key players, found its footing, and proceeded to produce some of the greatest horror televison ever aired (absolutely rivaling Twilight Zone and Outer Limits in production values and chills). When it was 'on' (which was most of the time), Thriller was unmatched and the episodes stand up today... truly some scary stuff.

The only reason I give it four, rather than five, stars is that there are several 'crime' shows interspersed with the 'horror' episodes. Some of these are very good (up there with the finer Hitchcock episodes) but some aren't. Thriller could never decide if it wanted to be a straight ahead horror show or a crime series, and so they produced both. That's why, despite the high production values and quality of the episodes, it only lasted two seasons. Horror fans would tune in and be presented with a "whodunnit" while crime fans found the fantastic creep fests too incredible and not their cup of tea.

Still, it's an excellent series and, with all the extras provided on this DVD, a real grand slam release.
