I fell completely in love with this brilliant artistic film from the first moment that I laid eyes on it.  I got to say I'm pretty surprised I have not heard of it until now, in my English class. There is more action and emotion in the first 30 minutes of this movie than in BraveHeart, Matrix, and any Schwartzenegger film put together.  It is a film rich with color, sound, creativity, and non-stop exhilaration! 
The plot is this girl named Lola has 20 minutes to get to her boyfriend and get him $100,000 before he is killed for screwing up a job. There is no time wasted on subplot, the subplot develops as the story moves on. The cool thing about this movie is that we not only see what happens as Lola scrambles to get the money, but we see it happen three times. Each time Lola's 20 minutes are up, we start fresh with a few things learned and try all over again.  What is admirable about Lola is her strong determination to succeed and conquer the obstacles.  She fights for what she believes, for what she trusts, and for what she loves.  
To me, the movie Run Lola Run is also a story of the little intricacies that you, me, and every other person in the world take for granted as we pass each other on the street and pass each other by and how those little meaningless nuances can change our entire lives. The difference between a person running into you and running by you is the difference between you being a baby-stealer and being a lottery winner.  The plot may have been simple but the acting was solid, charismatic and charming.  The film is so captivating in every aspect; it almost made me forget that this is a German film with English subtitles.
