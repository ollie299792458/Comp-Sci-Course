"...I get older, they stay the same age!"
- David Wooderson (Matt McConaughey), May 1976

I was born in 1986, so not only did I not get to experience the '70s, I had to survive crap like Chingy and Nelly and "sooped-upp rhyz birnurz" being the dominant pop culture, as opposed to Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd and Chevelles and GTO's. Which is why I love this movie. Next to hearing stories from my parents/uncle, this is as close to the '70s as I'm unfortunately gonna get (unless I'm drivin' a '70s car). It's quite a movie; drugs, booze, rock & roll, and the spirit of '76 rolled up (no pun intended) in one classic comedy!

The movie focuses on the last day of school; May 28, 1976 (one decade and one day before I was born). As one I Love The '90s commentator said, it deals with the high of the last day of school, and the high from smoking all the [narcotics] you can. It follows Randall "Pink" Floyd, an okay football player, Slater, the druggie we all knew in high school, O'Bannion, the jerk we all knew in high school, and of course, good old Wooderson, the older guy who hangs out with high school kids (and yes, every high school has guys like these). Wooderson's my favorite character; his lines are the best (see the one above). Not to mention he has the movie's COOLEST car, the 375-hp '70 Chevelle SS, "Melba Toast". Yeahhhhh.

Another great aspect of this movie: THE MUSIC! Foghat, Aerosmith, Edgar Winter, Steve Miller, ZZ Top... great '70s rock! They don't make 'em like that anymore.

One day they might make a movie about teenagers in 2004, and I cringe at the thought of it... everybody reminiscing about Lil Jon and little rice burners with huge, tacky spoilers and designs. * shudders * But who cares? As Wooderson says, "Keep On Livin'". Although the DVD extras leave much to be desired (but they're releasing a new version soon so be patient), the movie itself kicks. Check it on out.

"I love them redheads!"
