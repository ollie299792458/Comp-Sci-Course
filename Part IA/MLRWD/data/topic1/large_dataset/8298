Mixing the talents of three all time greats in a movie should produce solid results; failures do occur, but here we see the peak of success. Sidney Lumet directs Paul Newman and James Mason in a powerhouse film  which, though generally downbeat, never loses your attention and indeed  grips in its storyline and through these performances. Newman plays a  laywer who's seen the good times, (way back), but is now in a shambling and  hopeless state. His friend, played by the ever reliable Jack Warden, though  near the end of his tether at Newman's pathetic drunken state, gives him a  possible lifeline in a malpractice case. To Warden's relief he takes it,  but more important takes it seriously, and despite an ever spiralling  course of events which seem certain to bring about his final, total demise,  Newman finally triumphs. The finale is absorbing and superb! Alas, and not  terribly surprisingly based on the farce which is so often the Oscar  Ceremony, the film, Newman, and Mason all failed to win the oscars they so  richly deserved. A crime that Newman should lose for this, then be given  one of those pathetic Honorary Awards (remember when they gave one to the  previously un-Oscared Kirk Douglas for his performance having a stroke? No  doubt they thought it would be their last chance before he died, pleasingly  Mr. Douglas has proved them wrong), and then a genuine one for Newman the  next year in "The Color Of Money" because the first was seen  through for what it was: a too late apology. As for Mr. Mason, this sadly  would be his third and final failure at garnering an Oscar, (as he did pass  away two years later), beaten by Louis Gosset Jr. for a non-stop-yelling  performance which totally lacked the sublety which made Mason's so much  MORE menacing. Enough griping, watch this film and you'll see why these two  actors are probably the finest their respective countries have ever  produced. Deep, harrowing at times, but nonetheless a real treat!
