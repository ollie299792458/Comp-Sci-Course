This Review is for the Blu Ray Single Disc Version of ALIEN.

I wasnt going to buy this release, for fear that my DVD Special Edition version was just as good. When I saw this on sale for $9.99 I took a chance and bought it anyways. I am so glad I did. The studio has remastered the film just for blu-ray. The results are amazing. ITs like watching a totally new movie. I also have the sequel ALIENS and the results there are just as good! I think both ALIEN and ALIENS are must own BLU-RAYS! It really shows what can happen when old movies are remastered correctly for HD Blu-Ray.

There are really not any special features on the blu-ray, as far as special features you are better off keeping disc 2 of the ALIEN Special Edition DVD.

What you do get on the BLU-RAY is perfect picture and sound for the 1979 and 2003 releases...!

If you are on the fence about whether this is an upgrade to the DVD release, don't hesitate, go out and get this and the sequel ALIENS..You will not be disappointed! You will notice things in this movie that have never really noticed in the DVD Version.
