And people said Fight Club was a vicious movie!  This is a dreaful film adaptation of an even more dreadful book. It's all frightfully frightfully English and Jacqueline du Pre appears like an English version of "Baby  Jane Hudson, the early years."  There's no intellectual content at all  in this film, no evidence of Jacqueline's du Pre's talent as a musician,  and still less, no evidence of her own highly unique personality; All she's  made to look like is an unwashed dysfunctional running about the set in  faux 60's style clothes. I can't believe she was such an unsympathetic  character as she appears in this movie. 
Another aspect of the film that  everyone famous, from Daniel Barenboim to Margot Fonteyn, are played as the  shallowest of man and womankind who dropped du Pre when she was of no  further use to them. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The great  movie going public who will see this film are not going to reach for du  Pre's wonderful recording of the Elgar Cello Concerto and hear the real  "Jackie" after seeing this abysmally fearful farrago.  
Jacqueline du Pre's brother and sister, Piers and Hilary, should be  thoroughly ashamed of themselves for producing the book in the first place.  And, I suppose, they sobbed all the way to the bank! There is one  consolation; they are both absolutely persona non grata now and forever in  the music world.
