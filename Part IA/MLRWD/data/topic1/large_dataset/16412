I didn't expect much from CAT IN THE BRAIN. Surprisingly, its an extremely fun film that works as a great final film from Lucio Fulci. He seems to be having a lot of fun putting this great showcase of murder and mayhem together. Its great to see Fulci act in his own film for the entire duration and enter his own honorific cinematic world.

The storyline isn't the best, but the energy is where most of the film's enjoyment stems from. It's best to enjoy this crazy flick on day when you want to see the old master work his magic tricks one final heroic time. It's a nostalgic piece and recalls the past glory days of the maestro's cinematic masterpieces.

Lucio Fulci is without question, one the finest horror directors to ever work in the medium, with utter masterpieces as THE BEYOND, ZOMBI, and THE PSYCHIC. Although this film is not as strong as those defining adventures, its a brilliant companion to Fulci's fantastic career.

The GRINDHOUSE release is without question going to be the definitive edition on the FILM, housing an amazing set of extras that promises to fascinate any self-respecting film fan.
