ALTHOUGH A BIT APPREHENSIVE AT FIRST . . . I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WHEN I FOUND THE MOVIE TO BE QUITE ENTERTAINING, AND EQUALLY SURPRISED TO DISCOVER BECOMING QUITE NOSTALGIC ABOUT ALL OF IT. 'LES CAVES DE LA MADELAINE', 'ACADAMIE DU VIN' - AND MY PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FRENCH PART BEGINNING WITH BUYING A LARGE BOTTLE OF COCA-COLA AT 'LES CAVES' ON MY SECOND DAY IN PARIS. THE MOST PLEASANT OF MEMORIES AND THE BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE.

ALAN RICKMAN PLAYED HIS THE CHARACTER PERFECTLY HAD THE PART DOWN PAT - ALTHOUGH STEVEN WAS A BIT YOUNGER AT THE TIME.  AN UPPER CLASS ENGLISHMAN IN A THREE-PIECE SUIT HELPLESSLY DRIVING A BEAT UP GREMLIN IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER IN CALIFORNIA.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY HYSTERICAL.  'WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE' WOULD HAVE BEEN AN APPROPRIATE SUBTITLE - BUT IT WAS USED ALREADY.  :-)

STEVEN SPURRIER WAS WAY AHEAD OF HIS TIME AND CREDIT SHOULD BE GIVEN WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.  I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BEEN ON THE SET, ESPECIALLY WITH BRADLEY WHITFORD, FROM MY WEST WING DAYS.

A GREAT MOVIE. MERCI BIEN.
