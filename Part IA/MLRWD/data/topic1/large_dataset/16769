This was an excellent tape and a great sampling of ECW's non-hardcore side as it displayed some classic wrestling matches. If you want to see some blood bath's and lots of hardcore action don't check this one out, but get the DVD which has the great stairway to hell match on it. Here are my reviews for the matches:
Four way dance for the ECW television title: 2 Cold Scorpio vs. Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull #2 vs. Chris Jericho This was an amazing match that went 40 min.!! Everyone involved tried their best and pulled off one hell of a match. ****1/4
Television title match: Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Rob Van Damn This was a fast paced match with many great spots from Van Damn. At one point he does a sommersault plancha from the top rope onto Bam Bam in the crowd. Amazing! Van Damn wins it after an assist from Sabu. ***1/2
Dean Malenko vs Eddy Guererro in a 2/3 falls match This match was damn good though they had much better ones in ECW. The big deal with this one is it was their last match in ECW and it was very emotional. It was a draw when both men's shoulders were pinned. Both offered words to the fans after the match which was very emotional. Great moment in ECW! ****
Rey Misterio Jr. vs Psycosis This match was absolutley amazing for the time (1995) but isn't as good today. It is still a great match just not a 5 star classic. Both men show many of their high flying moves. Time hasn't been great to this match because rey has done matches way better than this. Still a ***1/4 match.
This tape is definitley highly reccomended with the lowest star rating being 3 1/4!
