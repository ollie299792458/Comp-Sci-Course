This film was shot at Aquarena Springs resort in San Marcos, Texas, home of Texas State University, the school from which president LBJ graduated. The park was once the oldest and most popular west of the Mississippi until more thrilling theme parks were born with roller coasters, etc. The resort used to have mermaids and scuba divers put on shows along with a swimming pig. Some couples were even married at the park in underwater ceremonies housed in the submarine theatre, the "aqua arena" that gave the resort its name.

The gondola rides are gone now but glass-bottom boat rides are still there. The university bought the park in 1994 to use as a preserve and study water and environmental resource issues by founding the Texas Rivers Institute. The area in which it was filmed (on the San Marcos River) is the most consistently inhabited region in all of North America, with archeological records showing a continuous presence for more than 12,000 years straight. Piranha is not the only film shot in San Marcos, a cozy college town in-between Austin and San Antonio, as the films The Getaway and The Ringer serve as other examples.

Viewers will get nostalgic to see the old Aquarena Springs and a time when San Marcos was small and even more laid back and uncorrupted by corporate chains. If you like silly, tongue in cheek flicks on a shoe string budget, you'll like Piranha. Joe Dante got his start directing films like this before he went on to make it big with Gremlins....
