I am usually not a horror movie watcher, but I chose to make an exception when I heard that B & B soap star Jacqueline MacInnes Wood was going to be in this movie.  It sure was worth it, too, as I am a hardcore fan of hers. Jacqueline truly wrung out every scene she had, right down to her screams.  Normally, on B & B, she doesn't do that sort of thing so it was really nice to see Jacqueline out of her element.  My favorite part was after being stuck in the surgical chair, she kept screaming, "Heeelp me -- HEEELP ME!!!" right before she fell out the multi-story eye doctor's window and crashed to her doom.  I loved, loved, LOVED the bridge part of the movie too.  Again, Jacqueline was superior when she screamed falling into the water and a car smashed her to death.

To be fair, the other actors were terrific as well.  I don't think I will get acupuncture anytime soon after witnessing the poor guy Isaac being set on fire!  :(  All joking aside, I jumped out of my seat watching how everyone else got killed in the end.  I'm going to watch the other 4 Final Destination movies too!!!  The people who created the sound/graphic effects are pure geniuses.  I really hope that they create a 6th sequel, I would love to see how it turns out!!!
