I was intriuged by this movie, since it reminded me other films about adolesence girls like Thirteen and Heavenly Creatures. When I watched it, it reminded me of Kids and Dusk to Dawn! Not quite what I was expecting, but the director wants to challenge the viewer. Settling in to this movie, expecting somewhat of a dark comedy with some curry, I was immeaditly moved by the two main characters of the sisters, with the Italian male college student as a character I first found charming then quite disgusting. The parents, while seeming to have an interesting back story, are quite literally in the background since this film is interested in the girls' world. The cinematography is beautiful and has a way of elevating everyday boring life into a thing of beauty, not unlike the Virgin Suicides. The dialouge between the sisters and the older sister and the male college student are so realistic and moving and typical, that it somehow transcends it's predictability. I agree with everyone else that the ending is quite a shocker, but I don't think it is meant to be a dream or fantasy but cruel, sudden horror. The director foreshadows this with the seemingly endless highway footage of the mother passing trucks and then being boxed in by them-being a nervous driver myself, it did succeed in freaking me out. This is where Kids and Dusk to Dawn come in. I remember loving the everyday psuedosophisticated dialouges, then BAM! Vampires! BAM! Drunk Rape! Like this movie, BAM! [...] In one way I think the endings make it two movies-one what quite beautiful and lyrical and the endings of all cheapen the experience one feels throughout the beginning of the film.
