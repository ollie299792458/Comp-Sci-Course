Well, I'd really like to joint the chorus of accolades for this version but sadly I can't, not until the folks at Warner Home Video feel inclined to include  two missing scenes.

The scenes in question are not that big a deal story wise but why have them in the VHS version, but not in the DVD. I mean that's the reason we all wait for DVD versions of our favorite movies.. right!?

The scenes are as follows, when Oddball's tank and crew members show up at the bridge they need to cross in order to help Kelly and his men, they look out on it feeling happy that it's still there,but the very next second an Allied plane flys by and bombs it out of commission. The next scene missing is where Oddball contacts Len Lesser's character and his bridging group to help repair the aforementioned bridge.A classic line includes Lesser's line "That job will take at least a hundred guys to get it done, where am i going to find a hundred guys just sitting around doing nothin'?."

It's a shame that these two small scenes, are missing especially when part of the Lesser scene is included in the final credits!.

Anyway,if these two missing parts are un-important to to you, then by all means pick the DVD up, if they ARE important to you as they are to me, then join me in a loud chorus of BOOOs instead!.

Sorry about the "negative waves"
