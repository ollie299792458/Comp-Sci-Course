I saw this nearly forty years ago (when I was a mere adolescent) and still remember how awful it seemed at the time. Granted, I grew up in Leatherstocking country and have written professional articles on The Last of the Mohicans since, so my standards are a tad picky, but I can't imagine any American not laughing himself or herself silly at this British pastiche of cowboys and Indians.  Madoc was cringeworthy as Magua; he had a potbelly, but more importantly he captured none of the dignity and ambiguity of this Satanic hero (Cooper compares him to Milton's Satan), making Magua just droolingly evil rather than a somewhat misguided avenger of wrongs done to his people. Hawkeye (who had some British countrified dialect--connoting something to the Brits, no doubt)had absolutely no resemblance in tone, background, or language with the original (it always does help to use dialogue from the original, even if you don't respect it, which these writers obviously did not). The women were largely cardboard versions of "Cooper females," a stereotype Cooper doesn't deserve because Cora is more intelligent, courageous, and self-sacrificing than most of the warriors. Not to waste your time further, except with a pun: a hack job.
