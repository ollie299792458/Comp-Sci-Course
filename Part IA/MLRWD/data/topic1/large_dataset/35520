I, like many people, went to see this movie hoping it would be about horses, with a little human intervention.  However, with Robert Redford and Kriston Thomas, you gotta expect a steamy love story!  This movie delivers  BOTH, some for the horse lover, and some for the romantic.  Montana is  MAGNIFICENT in every way and so the setup is successful from the start.  The story is of a young girl,Grace, who is involved in a tragic accident  with her horse and her best girl friend.  Grace's mother, Annie(Thomas),  tries to find healing for her daughter and the horse, seeking out the help  of Tom Booker(Redford) in Montana.  I loved the performance of the young  girl, Scarlett Johansen, and would like to see more of her.  The horse  scenes are thrilling for anyone who loves horses and the erotic tension  between the married character of Thomas and the sexy cowboy-with-a-heart  Redford left me wanting MORE!  Also,the actual age difference between  Thomas and Redford was more believable than I originally thought. I read  the book so the ending was different in a very GOOD way.  All in all a very  beautiful movie!
