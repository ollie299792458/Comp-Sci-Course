Excellent adventure film based on a fantasic short story.Great direction, great visuals and four great actors(Caine, Connery, Jeffery and Plummer).

As has been pointed out, The Man Who Would Be King, is indeed in some ways a parable about imperialism. What it is not,thankfully, is a politically correct apologist piece that glorifies native populations and villifies Westerners. Indeed,  The Man Who Would Be King does a great job at illustrating the brutality and backwardness of pre-modern men and tribal society, while at the same time showing the more calculated violence and technology of western civilization. It also shows the positives and negatives of imperial expansion into regions untouched by modernity. From the introduction of Martini-Henry rifles and western military organization, to the beginnings of infrastructure building and liberal governance, John Houston's The Man Who Would Be King gives us far more complex and human look into the characters of Peachy Carnehan and Daniel Dravot than Kipling's story. Indeed, one cannot help but like Peachey and Daniel; even though they may be vagabond "detriments" in the increasingly 'civilized' Colonial India, they are larger than life supermen when compared to some of the simple, wretched creatures that inhabit their short-lived empire in Kafiristan. All in all, TMWBK is a rousing and entertaining large scale epic that is inspiring and tragic all at once.
