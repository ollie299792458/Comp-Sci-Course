I have never doubted the acting ability of Penelope Cruz. In fact, I have been a fan for quite some time.  This, however, must be her best performance to date. She takes you on an emotional ride that is pleasant and exhausting all at the same time and the kick is you don't want the ride to end. It won't matter if you are a male or female...you will fall in love with this portrait and with Penelope Cruz.

Es que la mujer es una maravilla, la cual no hemos vistos en mucho tiempo! Ole! Y Brava!

The entire cast brings a believable life to their characters and you feel them through every scene and miss them when they are not present.  Carmen Maura is sheer bliss to watch on the screen.

Almodovar is his usual genius self.  Every frame of the film is a painting.  He cannot help himself because he is a true artist.  I love this story and all of its odd turns.  There is something wonderfully sexy about the juxtoposition of food, sexuality and violence that when put together brings a sensation of pleasure you don't often get to experience in American cinema. As a Spaniard by birth, I am proud of this film...as an American I am grateful that these films are making it more into the mainstream.

Here is to an Oscar for Penelope!
