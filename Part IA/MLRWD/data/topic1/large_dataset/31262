I am a member of the Franciscan Third Order and fell in love with this movie back when I was only 13. (I'm now 34) This movie is definitely a product of the 60's - but the message is timeless. I feel badly that the review by Amazon was so discouraging.  I would not want anyone to read that and make a judgement. 
The movie represents, in my opinion, the true beauty of the Franciscan charism.  The joy, simplicity and love that our Saint Francis embodied. I felt that Mr. Faulkner was an EXCELLENT choice for the lead role - he couldn't have been any closer to what I imagine Francis being. The director, Franco Zeffirelli, has done notable films ("Endless Love" NOT among his best).  If you are a fan of the famous "Jesus of Nazareth", then I would suggest viewing this. In any case, this is a wonderful little film to get you acquainted with this timeless saint.
One bit of trivia - Sir Alec Guinness wanted to play the part of the Pope - as he had just converted to Catholicism not long before the making of this film. :-)
Hope this rudimentary review helped!
