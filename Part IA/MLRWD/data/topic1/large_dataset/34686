There are not too many people who have not seen or at least heard of this classic movie. Taking place in chic early 1960's NYC, Holly Golightly, played by the magnificent and lovely Audrey Hepburn, is a beautiful yet confusing young sophisticate looking for her way through life via chic parties and dating rich men. When she meets her new neighbor, Paul Varjak, a writer and kept man, played wonderfully by George Peppard, her world takes an unexpected turn but ever so slowly and with plenty of resistence by her own drive to marry any one of the world's richest men, whoever that will be.

Patricia Neal, a stylish gal herself, is writer Paul Varjak's lady friend and
'financiere' and Buddy Ebsen plays a long past husband of Holly who tries to take her back home. The cast is further blessed with terrific and amusing performances by Martin Balsam (as Holly's agent), John McGiver (as the staid Tiffany salesman) and Mickey Rooney, in a tongue-in-cheek impersonation of a Japanese photographer who is constantly pestered by neighbor Holly's life style and antics. Even 'Cat' has a key role in this classic.

The movie shows us NYC life in the early 60's and that alone is a treasure. Add to this the superb acting and terrific story line provided to us through Truman Capote's novella and you have a can't miss classic. The song classic 'Moon River' is born here as well, in a sweet scene between Holly and Paul.

Audrey is superbly gorgeous and stylish and Mr Peppard fits her perfectly.
The movie is a perfect blend of comedy, romance with some light hearted tension here and there. The final 5 minutes pull it all together in the way most of us want it to be, cat included!

You will love this classic!
