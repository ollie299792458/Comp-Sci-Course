I saw a longer version of this film years ago (~110 min) and had heard that the usual, "cut" (~88 min) version had been done by a guy who disapproved of the extended pagan sequences, with the excised pieces buried and lost forever during construction of the ring road around London.  That story just adds to the appeal of this longer version.
I had heard nothing of the ending when I first saw The Wicker Man and refuse to reveal it here, but the film is, in fact, a horror film in that the ending is "horrible" and, for me, unexpected.  (So I was bothered that the recent releases of the film on tape spoiled the ending with a revealing cover photo.)
The Wicker Man is not a perfect film, on one level, the production values being typical of the period, but it does force one to examine assumed values and beliefs like few other films of any period.  This starts with the unexpected appearance of palm trees on the remote Scots isle where it was filmed and ends with the final sunset.
Cult films take on a life of their own.  It is good to see that The Wicker Man lives on, whole once again.
