definately the first! Practical magic is a beautifully thoughtout film. The acting is great, and Sandra (once again!) shines throughout, and had an extreme moment that even had me holding back the tears. It is also in association with Fortis films, Sandra's own production company!. I like Nicole Kidman in this and I wasn't expending to! The Owens house is enchanting, I'd love to live there if it was real. There is one set back to this brilliant movie though. It had darker elements which for me were some of the best bits, that only showed at the end of the film. For me it should've been 30 minutes longer and then would've have time to delve in deeper to the darker side of magic that it only skimmed apon. Other than that, this is a lovely film, and the extra features are sweet (note Sandra Bullock, very charming..."its one of those things, those 'magical things'!). I loved this movie. If your a Sandra fan and/or want to see something with fun, sadness and alittle enchantment, then watch this movie!!!!
