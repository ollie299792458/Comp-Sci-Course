I took a look at this film on cable TV, had heard of it for a long time and my curiosity got the better of me, it is violent, disturbing, hypnotic and one of late Stanley Kubrik's finest. It is set in England where a gang of 3 thugs headed by Alex played by Malcolm McDowell. They engage in assorted delinquent behavior, the more violent and dangerous the better, such as driving at high speeds to cause vehicles to run off the road and be overturned, burglary, rape, brutality on bums in the street and a murder resulting from a botched burglary, after which he is betrayed by his partners in crime who knock him senseless and leave him hung out to dry facing the police. Alex after his arrest and an opportunistic action on his part while in prison, is submitted to an experiment that deprograms his barbaric criminal instincts, now becomes physically ill when shown scenes of violence which he is forced to watch and listening to Beethoven  now make him physically ill. And goes through hard tests to prove he is reformed, test that before would have triggered him to rape or go medieval on someone, sometimes these tests seem questionable. Eventually he has to be released to a world changed largely due to having to face people he did evil unto once on the outside, it is what happens upon this that leads to a great conclusion, after Alex having to reap what he sowed and then comming to a great redeming conclusion for Alex that is totally unexpected. The cinematography is great and the performances particularly of Malcolm McDowell as an obistinate,ruthless, violent thug who faces a tough road to redemption, I didn't expect to like this movie due to it's disturbing theme, but it's well acted and the cinematography and set design transcend this, if you like creepy movies like Oliver Stone's Talk Radio, you will at least have fun keeping up with this one.
