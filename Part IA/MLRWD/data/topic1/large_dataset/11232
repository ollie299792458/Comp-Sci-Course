This is Dune the way it was meant to be.  The first mini-series was strong but not as well executed as Children of Dune.  Both the casting and acting of Leto II, his sister, and Alia could not have been any better, they were all perfect in their roles.  The worms were improved beyond expectations when compared to the first series.  The tigers in the second part, just flat out [stunk], but the CGI of the hover crafts and the city of Arakeen etc.. were fantastic.  The story was divulged fabulously, kudos to the writer and director, they did a truely wonderful job adpating this into a remarkable piece of film.  I didn't like Dune Messiah when i read it, but as the first part of this 3 part television series it, dare i say, was done better than Herbet himself did on it, it was enjoyable.  The second book seemed to have a loss of ideas compared to the first, contrary to this tv series.  I hope that they'll figure out a way, some how, to adapt the next 3 books, although they will be much more difficult to do than these were.
