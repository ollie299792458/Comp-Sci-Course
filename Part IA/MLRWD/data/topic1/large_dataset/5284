I have to say that this set is one of the best investments I have ever made.
The original saga of Planet of the Apes is definitely a cult for the fans, so precisely for those fans there is absolutely NOTHING better you can get, and believe me, every penny is worth it, not to mention that the price is really low for its value taking in consideration that we are talking about 5 movies here and the most complete collection of extra features publised up to date, including the Documentary "Behind The Planet Of The Apes'. The only improvement opportunity is that this documentary should have offered subtitles as it did in the DVD release.
Now, if you will judge the produtc by image/sound quality, take in consideration that the original films are between 39 and 44 years old, so the restoration jobs done here are a great achievement by themselves.  This is being offered to the public in the highest definition and quality in image and sound available to the open market today, so I can say with no fear that this is the best anyone can get these days for these wonderful pieces of the seventh art.
I am not even going to talk about the production and performances of the movies because that is already settled and mentioned before: PIECES OF ART!!!.
Last but not least, the package is awesome and it includes the easiest to follow timeline ever published on this wonderful story plus photographic material that takes anyone's breath.
