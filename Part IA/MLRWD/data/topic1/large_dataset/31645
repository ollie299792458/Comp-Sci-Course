I have been anxiously awaiting this dvd since seeing this show almost a year and a half ago. I had seen three shows on this Liars tour and I personally thought that the strongest show I had seen was at the turning Stone Casino in Verona, NY. There was a real energy at that show that just seemed to be missing at the Show that this dvd presents. (The egg show, presented on this dvd was the last night of about a 2-month leg of this tour. Just prior to the band going to Japan) The night of the performance I thought to myself there's no way Todd's going to put this show out on DVD. There had been a bit of tension that seemed to emanate from the stage, starting with the first song "Truth". After singing the first couple of lines Todd walked backstage to get the monitor engineer to straighten out a thing or two. As soon as He walked back through the stage props a cameraman appeared and stands in place shooting in the direction of Kasim. When Todd tried to re-enter the stage he nearly plowed the cameraman down. Todd looked pissed! Well, some quick cut editing has pretty much removed that instance.

 Todd mixed the sound and edited the video on this production and the job he did is unbelievable! This sounds so good!!!!!!!! WOW!

It was well worth the wait to get this out finally. The inclusion of the Japan video scrapbook is pretty cool. I enjoyed seeing the Japanese fanclubs party segment for the band. Todd had brought his family along for the ride and this segment gives you a slightly candid look at Mr. Rundgren.

Buy this DVD and crank up the sound, you'll be glad you did.
