I have watched this movie at least 20 times 18 years ago when my children were young. Now I am 53 years old. I recently, caught a short piece of the movie on cable one day at lunch. I realized this was only partially a children's movie. This continuation of the venerable Peter Pan story is all about the male mid-life experience (45-60 years old or so). When I watched it with this concept in mind, I found myself in tears within the first 15 minutes of the movie. It is such a profound mythic description of modern day man in mid-life. My children are now grown. Yet, I find myself just like Peter, drawn to return to the days of childhood to find what has been lost there and needing to pick up certain things for the next portion of life. All the characters of the self can be found in this story from the shadow to the male anima. Perhaps we all have to learn again how to fight, fly and crow. The challenges of mid-life are so wonderfully presented you could teach a course from this one movie alone. Yes, it is a great kid's movie, and 18 years ago my son had a Hook birthday party in which he begged me to put up a zip line for him to slide out of a window in our house. It has all the elements a young boy loves. But, there are all the elements that a 50 something man needs to hear again and work through. It's a classic for our time and perhaps for the ages.
