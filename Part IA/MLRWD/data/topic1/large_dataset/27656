"Tokyo Story" (1953) by Yasujiro Ozu is about the serene acceptance of the transience of life through a contemplative, compassionate love of the now. Perhaps inspired by the 1937 American film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XUL6SA">Make Way for Tomorrow (Criterion Collection)</a>, Ozu crafts a film that utilizes Japanese aesthetic sensibilities which resonate at the same time with universal themes beginning concretely with family life among 3 generations in early 1950s Japan that then open out and blossom forth to encompass the transcendent mystery in the most immanent of things. One is reminded of William Blake's lines from the "Auguries of Innocence": "To see a world in a grain of sand, And a heaven in a wild flower; Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, And an eternity in an hour." Ozu is widely seen by critics worldwide as one of the great Japanese directors along with Kurosawa and Mizoguchi, and this film as his greatest among the 54 films that he made from 1927 to his 1962 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BEK8CE">An Autumn Afternoon - Criterion Collection</a>. Two other Ozu classics are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EOTWIS">Late Spring - Criterion Collection</a> and the 1959 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001GH5RY">Stories of Floating Weeds (A Story of Floating Weeds (1934) / Floating Weeds (1959)) - Criterion Collection</a>;the latter has Roger Ebert speaking his cogent, insightful audio commentary--Wow!  Donald Richie, who was a pioneer in bringing Ozu and Kurosawa to the attention of the West, has written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520032772">Ozu: His Life and Films</a> as well as translated the screenplay of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1880656809">Tokyo Story: The Ozu/Noda Screenplay</a>. David Desser has edited a wonderful collection of essays about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521484359">Ozu's Tokyo Story (Cambridge Film Handbooks)</a>, and Paul Schrader's 1972 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0306803356">Transcendental Style In Film (Da Capo Paperback)</a> about Ozu, Robert Bresson, and Carl Dreyer continues to show us the value of a contemplative "transcendental style" of filmmaking that is all too rarely seen in films of today.

"Tokyo Story" is my 2nd favorite film after Kurosawa's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLMU">Ikiru - Criterion Collection</a>. We are indeed most fortunate that since 2003 the Criterion Collection not only has restored all of the films mentioned in this review onto DVD, but also has included insightful written essays, audio commentaries, and bonus films with the DVDs. I for one feel most grateful for Criterion's dedication in bringing to us these treasures of world cinema so that they will not be forgotten, but may be experienced by all now.
