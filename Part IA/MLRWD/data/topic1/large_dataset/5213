First off I would like to state that despite any flaws this movie contains it is still a joy to watch. John Travolta is excellent in his role, and the rest of the cast plays their parts well enough so that the story doesn't suffer from that aspect. The movie is filmed brilliantly with just the right amount of darkness on the scenes to add that feeling that something is being hidden from you. And it is.
This films main problem lies in the fact that you are lead into a dazzling investigation about the deaths of several soldiers on a training mission. You hear sides, you form ideas, and then you realize that none of that even matters. It is that element alone that takes away heavily from this movie. As you travel through this deep and dark military atmosphere in your mind you go through so many twists that you are anticipating this great slam bang ending. It is as that point when you recieve a soft curb in the road that gradually tells you that nothing you've learned on this trip has any bearing on the outcome of the film, and you come face to face with something you saw coming the whole time. 
I am not saying that this movie completely destroys itself in it's final moments. It doesn't exactly leave you with a bad taste in your mouth, just a feeling that your candy has lost some of it's flavor. All in all this is a very enjoyable film, that fails to deliver that final knockout punch you were waiting for...
