I am not sure that a 1,000 words is enough for me to make my feelings felt about this movie. Until this movie, none of the stars of this movie were  household names here, but now they feel like part of the family.
Brian  Singer has constructed a masterpiece, in which the punchline resides where  it should, in the last shot! This movie keeps you guessing, and I am  finding it very hard to review without letting some of the better shocks  slip! 
Baldwin, Spacey and Byrne play career roles in this movie, for  which they will all be remembered. The filming locations are very good, the  musical score superb and the story, although slow burn, moves along at a  perfect pace. The use of flashback, which is a very hard tool to work with,  is used to perfection, with the viewer becoming so engulfed in each scene,  it is a genuine surprise when you are back with the key characters.
I  implore anyone reading this review who hasn't seen this movie, to beg,  borrow or buy copy of this from Amazon, and please please please, do not  listen to anyone who would spoil the ending. One thing is sure, when you  watch this movie, you will go to bed asking "Who is Keyser Soze?"  To which the answer is.......
