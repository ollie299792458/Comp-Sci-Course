take an idea, namely a story about the depth of time, the extent of love between one soul and another, and the uncomfortable thoughts of one's own mortality, and you have a story thats timeless in its portrayal of life, death and the journey that carries us from one side to the next.

this is what Aronofsky was trying to achieve with the Fountain. Having finally watched this, my first reaction is one of profound awe, not only for the beautiful portrayal of space and haunting nebulas, the amazing soundtrack filled with sad violins (Clint Mansell) but also of the extent of the story itself.

the concept of the Tree of Life or everlasting life is very intriguing, and Aronofsky does an excellent job showing the Spanish search for this treasure, but he also expertly ties the storyline to a single character and his own search for life, life for his wife Izabella who is dying of cancer.

Although this film is laden with symbolism, and 'heavy' concepts such as life, death and eternity, it doesnt feel overwhelming, nor outlandish. Its simply beautiful both visually and contextually. Its very hard to rate and even review this film because of its original and unique nature. All I can say is watch it and interpret it for yourself. The acting is phenomenal, and the story itself encompasses more than words can say.
