You know i really read my post after looking it over and i have to admit that i was being as racist as the people in this movie.It's hard for me as a person to watch this movie and not begin to have racist feelings to white people. But you know what i can't condem all white people as being this way because that's rediculoues. Yesterday or today i was watching the Movie "Tears of the Sun" Staring bruce willous and i don't know the whole story but my main focus was on these soilders that were white and there was a black dude in there also that were fighting some kind of war and i wish i knew what it was about but what i was looking at mostly in my mind and what i saw in the movie was these white soilders fighting to save these Libyan black people from these disgusting black libyan soilders that were killing the civilans for some reason. And i asked my self while i was watching this would i do the same thing for people that were white and it was a quick answer and they answer was yes. It kinda shocked me because it was no longer about white and black it was about right and wrong. The answer is i would without hesitating. If it was white people that were slaves in america under black people i would kill black slave owners and fight in a civil war to free white people in this country or any other. And this is what white people felt like when they fought in the civil war against the south. I now know that racism like homophobia is a bunch of bull. It's stupid . It really is stupid and i now don't even understand  why someone would want to hate someone because they are different than you. Also watching the Movie " American History X" Changed my to think this way also so see that movie. I now have the same thinking as gay people. I believe we  should celebrate diversity
