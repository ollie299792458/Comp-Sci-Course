I would have given this show 5 stars, and that is exactly what the content is worth!!! Robin is Hilarious!!! Anybody who has ever seen him, knows the boundless energy this guy has...his Mork and Mindy, His Movies, they all show what a great comedian and actor Robin is...  this DVD/performance has an edge though... usually I do not 'link' Robin to the F-word...but he sure knows how to use it!

So how do I discribe this: Top Notch, First Rate, hilarious comedy for people who do not mind 'things being discribed as they are'... Not suited for 'uptight' people (but hey, that's their problem!)

Why do I only give it 4 stars then? Simple:  I live in Belgium, why do we have to try to find and buy a region code 1 DVD-player? In other words: Why does Robin not bring this DVD in "no"-region code, so that every moderatly intelligent person with a halfway decent grasp of the English language can enjoy this? Isn't the right to have a  -in this case- barrel full of laughs Universal?
