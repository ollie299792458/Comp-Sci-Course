My favorite movie of 2006!  I saw it missing at the video store and had no idea what it was about.  Finally a copy was in and I rented it- I bought it the next day.

I remember the 80's dancers and when coke was the popular drug, and bowl movements ARE topics of conversations in my life.  I took the campy, offensive jokes as campy jokes.  It could offend sensative people.  I liked the story.

I shared it with my friends and we laughed and laughed talking about the over the top scenes- she actually had some guy crap in the corner of her house after doing too much something!  She in turn shared it with more friends who did not like it.  They are a gay couple and didn't find it funny.

Be sensative to stereotypes because this movie isn't.  It IS well writen, well danced, and I enjoyed every minute (especially Courtney Love's song "Love Love Love" and montage that went with it).  I really did laugh out loud at one scene (the dance off) and tear up at the next (street argument).  "I'm 30... of course I'm damaged goods.  But I'm goods none the less!"
