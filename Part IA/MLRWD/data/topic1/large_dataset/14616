I, personally, Thought the movie was excellent.
Then again, that's probably because the main reason I was first interested in watching it was because it starred a foreign actor that I'm greatly familiar with. That would be Benno F&uuml;rmann, a German actor who played the delightful role of the Sineater. He gave an outstanding performance in his first English film, and for that I was very satisfied.
The movie mainly follows around the plot of an underground, evil religious order taking place under the Catholic church. That immediately drew me in, because I love plots that deal with elements that are supposed to be pure and full of good intention, (in this case, the church) but make them malignant and spiteful. It's a simple twist of irony that makes it so delightfully evil, something you don't see everyday.
And besides that, the movie DID involve thinking and paying attention in order to understand it to the fullest. I didn't mind that a bit; And sure, there were the typical elements of romance, sacrafice and the good old fight between good and evil, but the setting was new as well as the plot, making it an interesting progression the whole way through.
These are, of course, based on my own opinions and personal expiriences; so I only ask that when you do see this movie for a first or second time, (or maybe more, perhaps) please do so with an open mind. It's a great movie with a great performance; and given your chance, it will pull you in.
