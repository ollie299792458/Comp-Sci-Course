Sam Raimi returns to his horror roots in "The Gift," his first horror film since 1993's "Army of Darkness." Raimi has come a long way since his "Evil Dead" days, but his obscure camera angles and tension building scenes still remain.
 The film reunites Raimi with Billy Bob Thornton, as they had worked together on the acclaimed "A Simple Plan." Thornton's screenplay is excellent (as would be expected) and a welcome change of pace in the modern horror genre.
 Although the directing and writing is good, the acting is what makes the film. The film's star, Cate Blanchett, plays a leading lady suprisingly well, but the supporting cast of Katie Holms, Greg Kennier, Hillary Swank, Giovanni Ribisi, and Keanu Reeves is amazing. Reeves and Ribisi are in top form, with over-the-top preformances as a wife-beating redneck and a slow-witted, ill-tempered mechanic.
 The film is low on gore, and high on tension, which makes it appealing to anyone looking for a good scare. If you liked "What Lies Beneath" this movie should "knock your socks off!"
