I have read many reviews from people saying that they enjoy reliving the magic of watching Night Gallery in the 70's.  I give this set two stars for the opposite reason.  I feel the stories have not aged well, not nearly as well as many "older" episodes of The Twilight Zone".  These NG programs are not scary and not nearly as interesting as I had remembered.

The DVD quality is excellent, a much better picture and sound quality than I ever saw on broadcast TV in 1970.  Contrary to some of the earliest reviews of this set, it does contain the entire first season.

I guess to a teenager in 1970 it was a great thrill to watch a true genius like Rod Serling.  However, after more than 35 years the magic is gone.  After watching a few episodes on DVD, I only felt boredom and disappointment.  Few of the stories seem as thoughtful and profound as they did long ago.

I think if you rent a few of these episodes it will quench your thirst.  You may realize that what we felt was scary in 1970 is not so in the 21st century and you will save your money for a different collection.

Sometimes it's better to leave memories undisturbed.
