It's possible to like how a movie begins and how it ends but not the middle development? The story is a clear homage to Back to the Future, so clear that even the main character, Brad, named more than once the movie and Michael J. Fox. Brad is a forty years old repressed gay guy; he was gay also in high school, but he has never had the courage to really come out. Brad likes men, and with men he means that he likes men who behave like men, and that obviously don't like men themself. In high school he had a crush on the basketball hero jock, the dream of all the cheerleaders. At 40 years old, Brad still continues to like the jock type that doesn't like him. The problem is not that Brad is gay, the problem is not that people don't accept him, the problem is that Brad doesn't accept himself. He sees being gay as being not normal, and he wants to be normal.

Due to a car accident, Brad is brough back to high school, only that now the world is upside down, every one else is gay and Brad can finally fall in love and being loving back by his dream date, Roland. But since, as said before, the problem was not Brad being gay, but Brad that was not accepting himself, when every one else is "not normal", Brad obviously is now normal, means that, instead of falling in love for the jock, he falls in love for the cheerleader. It's not the world that has to accept Brad, it's Brad that has to accept himself.

Lucky for the gay romance movie fans, the movie has a better ending than expected.
