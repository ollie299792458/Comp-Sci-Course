Clive Barker's "Hellraiser" is a beautifully crafted film. Fine cinematography, lighting, acting, and special effects, and a very good, intriguing story with excellent music to drive it all. A horror film masterpiece on every level.

The Blu-ray presentation is immaculate; perfect; flawless.

Grain haters beware! for it is replicated accurately on this transfer. In regards to detail, grain structure, and lighting, this is one of the most fantastic and film-like Blu-ray Discs I own. Good on Anchor Bay! I hope they do more HD transfers of this caliber in the future. Their "Halloween" transfer is good although it does not retain the DP-intended blue hue, their "Evil Dead II" transfer is decent, being marred by the muddled Divimax master (this movie seriously needs a new master and Blu-ray release), but this blows those past disappointments out of the water, and rivals--even surpasses--the excellent Blu-ray work done by Blue Underground.

Highly, highly recommended Blu-ray for HD enthusiasts and fans of the film.
