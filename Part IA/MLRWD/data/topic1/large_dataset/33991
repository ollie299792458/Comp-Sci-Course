Gus Van Sant is a great director. Movies like ¨My own private Idaho¨ and ¨Finding Forrester¨ are a proof of that. Elephant is an interesting movie that shows an apparent normal day in a public school. The camera moves slowly from one character to another, making connections in the corridor and classrooms of the school. We are just witnesses of what is going to happen from different perspectives. Strories are connected in some way and have their own meaning and criticism.

Photography and music are outstanding points in the film. The football game scene has been shoted with a standing camera so we can see only a part of what is happening. In this point is when you realize about the concept of the movie: we can see traces of the reality, fragemented pieces, because life is so big to be captured in a movie. Maybe you haven't heard the elephant story so I'm going to tell you, it's something like this: ¨There were a bunch of people with their eyes badaged. They were asked to touch and feel the object they have in front, and then tell what they think the object was. Each person ended making a different veredict¨ Why? Beacuse they only have a tiny piece of information, not the whole.

What was an apparent normal day became tragedy. Since the start of the movie we feel that something is going wrong: The initial sequence with the drunken dad; the guy who is a really talented piano player and who like to get involved with cruel videogames; the girls that vomit their food in order to be skinny; and so on. Ending sequence show us the result of all this violence incubated. The final scene, with the still camera shoting the grey sky, is emotional and moving.

Some people think it's a slow movie, I disagree, it has its own rythm and his own meaning, like our lives. You have to accept it as it is.
