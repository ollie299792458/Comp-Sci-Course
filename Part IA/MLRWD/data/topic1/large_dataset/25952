I love this film. OK, the plot is pretty simple and doesn't rise above the level of a soap and its technical and historical accuracy is more than a little shaky at points. Errol Flynn seems to be slightly miscast though Fred MacMurray fits the bill perfectly as a stalwart Navy pilot.

That said it is a creation of its time and one has to remember the circumstances in which the film was made - the era immediately prior to war when aviation was at its most glamourous, when right and wrong involved clear cut alternatives and the American people wanted to be reassured of the nobility of those who served.

But when it comes to colour film of pre-war US Navy aircraft and aircraft carriers it can't be beat. The real stars are the aeroplanes - yellow wing Devastators, Vindicators and Helldivers - and I can't think of any other motion picture that captures these sort of images. The shots of aircraft being launched off the USS Enterprise (I think) are particularly memorable.

So for those of us who love aviation this film is very definitely one for Saturday night with a good glass of wine and a decent cigar. As an added bonus there is the occasional interlude with Alexis Smith looking rather fetching.
