As a huge fan of Joan Allen, I am shocked to see the low ratings on this movie....but they are primarily (if not all) by men.  This movie is deeper than male politics (to the disappointment, obviously of the male reviewers)......this movie is about a woman in the depths of a slimy, backstabbing, good ol boys political dog-fight. I LOVE this movie and watch it every couple years. I urge all women to see it......you will get it. The review entitled "insults my intelligence" by Simon Lee....well, HE insults MY intelligence.  Just because it focuses on a woman, he discredits the entire theme of the movie....it's about a woman, her feelings, her life, her decisions and how she reacts under pressure.  The reviewer just doesn't get it.  As an educated female, it's one of my all time favorite movies.  It focuses on Joan Allen as a lovely lady of honesty and integrity chosen as a possible candidate to step into the vice presidential seat after his death. A scandal is created (by men of course) of her past and her subtle, eloquent handling of the situation with grace and dignity is absolutely BRILLIANT. In an attempt for the slime balls to crush her, she stands tall and firm on her conviction: that one's personal life, is personal.  It changed a part of me forever....the script is brilliant and Joan Allen pulls it off to perfection. I immediately fell in love with this movie and all it stands for.  I implore all woman to see this movie about courage, truth and vindication.  Jeff Bridges makes a great President and the supporting cast is superb. Love the ending and the overall message is well conveyed.
