A fellow reviewer notes that this is the worst film he has seen for some time; I would go further. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. The script takes a mediocre novel and makes it worse by extracting either the most clunkingly awful dialogue or the most pretentious gobbledygook in the book. (If you know anything about philosophy you will want to put your fingers in your ears as author, director and screen writer present half-baked rubbish  as deeply insightful "Oxford speak".)  Good actors are made to look very bad, and some mediocre actors are simply terrible. I do not know what happened in the editing room to produce such a disjointed, virtually incoherent, mess of a film. By the end of a very long ninety minutes even the actors look embarrassed as they realise what their agents signed them up for. As another reviewer notes, the surprisingly favourable reviews here on Amazon raise plenty of questions in themselves, so I suggest you check Rotten Tomatoes or The Numbers to see the actual critical and box office verdict on this train wreck of a movie. And, no, it is not bad enough to be funny.
