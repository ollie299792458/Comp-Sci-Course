Michael Douglas plays a largely smug President (think "Bill Clinton") and Annette Benning plays his wiley, intellectually-equal sparing mate (think "Hilary Clinton") in life and love as a journalist assigned to the White House Press Corps in THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT (forget all about Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, and the other women).
Ugh.
Politics.
I suppose I would rate the film higher if either of their performances in such a contrived romance were marginally believable, but, sadly, I've always thought this film was one large Hollywood misfire aimed at showing how evil Republicans are and how righteous Democrats are, which Rob Reiner basically confirmed in the press tour.  If the story had, instead, focused on the budding love of the principals and then given them true credibility (Benning gives in WAY too fast as a journalist and professional, and Douglas struts around making decisions that impact millions of people both positively and negatively as if he had spoken to the burning bush instead of Moses), I probably would've enjoyed the picture more.
Outside of Douglas's grandstanding speech at the end (which is given excessive and unnecessary dead weight by a seemingly Earth-shaken Richard Dreyfuss as a 'mean and nasty' Republican senator), there are very few memorable moments here.  The love affair happens too fast and involves too little consequence (other than humorous ones), and it's all neat, tidy, and acceptable as far as the pollsters would have the American people think.
The secondary players here end up doing a far better job than the principals as they're not suckered into the obvious politicking of the film.  Had Rob Reiner not been so much in love with Bill Clinton or had he decided on using a better role model as President, again it may've all ended up getting a second term (think "sequel").
