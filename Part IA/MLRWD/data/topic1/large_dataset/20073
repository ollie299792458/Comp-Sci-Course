If you don't like black comedy, why do you watch black comedies?  With all of the unbelievable trash out there, how do you rate this little gem a 1 star movie?  In the spirit of the great all time classic noir comedies, this is not as good as Grosse Pointe Blank, Raising Arizona, or After Hours; but then, nothing else is either.  John Cusack once again deadpans his way through his "man oppressed by living" role with his usual excellent dour "all is lost, and then it will get worse" humour.  Billy Bob Thornton plays the not too bright, too slick for his own good criminal with the perfect amount of angst, and Oliver Platt shines as the out of control loser drunk counter-point to the affair.  Platt as the loser who wins (sort of), Thornton as the winner who loses, Cusack as the overseer of the inevitable doom...what could be more delicious.  Then we have the classic noir femme fatale, the off-center Randy Quaid boss, and the final scenes with the family man bartender who is assisted by Cusack's ultimate compassionate gesture...he can't help it, he's human too...Got to love the way the story settles in to its story of humorous conflicted pain.  A bizarre tale told with true to life style.  Maybe if you haven't lived you don't get it.  At 21 it may be meaningless, but at 50, it's a tale well told.  Compared to the above mentioned 3 movies, it's a 4, but compared to most comedies, its a 5.
