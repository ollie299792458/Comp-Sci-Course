As horribly repulsive as the first movie, this truly takes the cake and eats it too.  Luckily Ice Cube and J-Lo were not in this feature, but to my dismay the new characters were even more annoying. Especially that wimpy whiny black man who doubles as the comic relief guy.  Of course the actors cover the rainbow of human ethnicity, and each one has a different accent. This makes you hate them all.

Once again the human characters are more menacing than the anacondas. Even spiders play a bigger role in thier demise.  There is always the one character who wants nothing else than the reason they came to the jungle in the first place, and will do anything it takes to reach his goal. Including murdering his comrades.  The snakes are only a secondary threat.

The plot is essentialy the same as the first movie, but alot worse.  The thing I really hate about this movie is when some chick makes the snake bite a gas can.  The snakes mouth is covered in gas, and another guy shoots a flare into it's mouth. This causes the snake to start on fire and fall into the pit where there are about 5 more snakes mating.  Once the snake hits the bottom, it blows up.  That was the most degenerizing part of any movie I have ever seen.

I recommend this movie to anyone who is my mortal enemy.
