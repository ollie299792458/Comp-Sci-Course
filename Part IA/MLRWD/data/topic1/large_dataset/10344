John Fogerty has some fine musicians with him on this new DVD as you will clearly hear.I highly recommend it and the price was right.

I saw John Fogerty in 1986 at Riverbend Music Center where he did not sing any CCR tunes.Even so that was one of the best concerts I have been to.
 I saw him again in late 90`s where he preformed solo and CCR tunes.That was another great show.

I prefer the studio version of Born On The Bayou and most CCR tunes to any of the live recordings.I will say Fogerty`s voice was strong on Fortunate Son and the other CCR tunes covered on this live DVD.I have Fogerty`s other live videos and I was glad to hear some different CCR songs in this concert.

John Fogerty is not an oldies act he is still comes up with some great songs,just listen to this DVD version of *Somebody Help Me.

I have to add as far as Rock-A-Billy or Country Fogerty does it his way.

Someone mentioned the documentary is not included on this DVD for some reason and that`s true.This may be for the best.Because every documentary I have ever seen on John Fogerty and CCR seemed to dwell on the problems the band had in the latter years.
