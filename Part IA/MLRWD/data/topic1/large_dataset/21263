Jackie Chan is an agile Hong Kong cop working with Interpol (who knew they did anything besides make the warning messages about copying or rebroadcasting DVD's) to bust one of the most wanted men in the world.  Unfortunately, he is teamed up with Arthur Watson, one of the most bumbling fools on the force (played by usually funny British comic Lee Evans).  
The bad guy named Snakehead (played by Julian Sands) has his eye on a medallion and a kid.  When the two parts of the medallion are combined, the recipient will gain super-human strength and immortality.  But the kid is as important as the medallion because only he can bring both parts together.  
Jackie Chan's love interest in the movie is Claire Forlani, who does a reasonable job as the jilted love that never was called after that weekend of passion.  As is my understanding of the way the world works.
The plot wasn't anything special, but the superpowers thing was done once before (and done better) in the movie "The Tuxedo."  The writing is spotty at best (the worst being the 5 minute insinuation that Chan and Lee Evans were homosexuals).  
The action sequences went like this:
Running, running, running, dodging pullets, running, jumping through fire, running, running, drowning, running, running, running, etc.  There was so much running in this movie that I was tired just looking at it.
Overall, not as painful as a root canal, but I still stumbled to my car after the movie with the same overall feeling of badness in my head.
