In a nutshell: Sky Captain is entertaining, PG rated family movie that's fun for parents and kids.  There's not even a hint of sexual material, but there are a few cuss words that could have been left out and one scene when an old scientist gets scorched down to a charred skeleton.  It's a bit long, but it held the interest of my two kids under the age of seven.

Sky Captain is a fun and romantic throw-back to the dark and seedy film-noir styles so popular in the 50's.  It's filmed in an almost black-and-white style, set sometime just before WWII, yet tosses in so much science fiction that it's more futuristic then historic.  I would say that 95% of what you see is CGI generated, and the total effect is down-right entertaining.

It's a larger then life, completely fictional tail of hero and heroin on an impossible mission to save the world.  Get ready to suspend your disbelief on many occasions, as the entire story line is so creatively impossible it's almost absurd.  But once you accept that this is what the director Kerry Conran intended, then you'll be able to enjoy it for what it is: a film-noir science fiction fantasy.

Is it worth adding to your collection?  Ummm... I plan to, but maybe you should rent it first and decide for yourself.
