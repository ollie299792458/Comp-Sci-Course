This movie just confirmed for me Michael's genius and a performer that will never be eclipsed. It also shows he was the kindest and sweetest of men. He treated everyone with great respect. Even though he was clearly running the show, he treated it as a collaboration rather than acting like he was better than everyone else. He was a consummate professional and he knew his craft inside and out. I could tell he cared deeply about this project. He was involved in every aspect of it down to the smallest detail and it was fascinating to see this genius at work. There is just no way he we was contemplating ending his life. He seemed so committed to this project and I don't think he would have done that to his children.

Michael still had "it". I thought he sounded absolutely amazing and he danced alongside people half his age with such finesse. A highlight for me was when he and Judith Hill sang a cappella at the end of "I Just Can't Stop Loving You". Michael was definitely cut down in his prime and the world was robbed of a beautiful human being. He cared so much about people and the planet. Though we left the theater feeling sad and contemplative for what might have been, Michael's music and talent couldn't help but be uplifting. I have seen this several times and enjoyed it more each time, if that's possible. Michael's fans will not be disappointed in this movie and their movie library should not be without it.

There is over an hour of special features included and all are fascinating. More detail is given to costume and stage design, a more in depth look at the auditions for the dancers and additional details on the production and thoughts given by all involved. Unfortunately, the featurettes on the singers, band and aerialists are not included on this edition, but can be found on the Special Edition version.
