I to read the book (twice) before seeing the movie. However the ending was EXTREMELY hard for me to take. In short, I lost my cookies and cried like a baby that my sister had to get me water coz I was hyperventilating. WHY?
A) My sister has a friend who's dog is a whit elab named, Sonny and he looks JUST like Marly did, I call him my "God Son" and I dread the day if or when his time should come to go to that big puppy palace in heaven) and
b) I had to put a pet of mine down three summers ago and it still hurts to this day. Granted, my dog wasn't a lab (she was a grey & white schnoodle)but it hurt like hell even tho she was up there in years, the pain is still there.
BUT Jennfer Aniston & Owen Wilson work great together and they were absolutely adorable with the dog. You could just see how relaxed they were and that hey are animal lovers too.
All I can suggest to anyone who is like me, if you see this movie..towards the end? Find something to do or turn it off coz I may
end up doing the same thing coz I don't think I could watch it again.
