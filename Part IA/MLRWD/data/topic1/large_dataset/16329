This film is a semi-classic that emerged from the late 70s period of horror that dealt primarily with religious/ecclesiastical themes (such as Rosemary's Baby, The Omen, the Exorcist, etc), and while the Sentinel has failed to rise to the same prominence as some of its contemporaries, it's a very well made supernatural chiller that packs a punch in the creepiness/freakiness department.

The plot concerns a young model with a troubled past (played by the attractive but slightly wooden Cristina Raines) who moves into an ominous New York city apartment inhabited by an assortment of eccentric and oddly unsettling characters, including an effete old man (played impeccable by the great Burgess Meredith), a very demonstrative lesbian couple, and a blind priest who always sits vacantly in front of his window. As the film progresses, the young woman's encounters with her neighbors progress from merely strange to truly horrifying, until she eventually learns the apartment's dark secret, which holds within it her own terrible fate. The movie's climax is one of the most memorable in film history, and borrows from Tod Browning classic "Freaks".

The Overall atmosphere of the movie is one of building dread, which flows seamlessly from the fine performances of the cast as well as a number of flashbacks and dream sequences that are very eerie. In fact, it's difficult to articulate exactly what it is about the sentinel that leaves the viewer so unsettled, but the film manages to achieve a kind of dreamy horror that's truly disturbing.

The Sentinel also features some of the earliest performances of now famous actors such as Jeff Goldblum, Chris Sarandon, and Beverly D'Angelo.

While it suffers slightly from a jarring soundtrack and at times looks and sound a little dated, The Sentinel remains a wonderfully unsettling chiller that deserves to be discovered by a new generation.
