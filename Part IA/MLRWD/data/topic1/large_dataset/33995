I hate to rate this movie as three stars being that it's one of the greatest war movies ever made, but I have a real issue with Fox. First off, they are the most expensive BD's of all the studios and secondly, they omit all of the special features enjoyed on previous DVD versions. Instead of maxing out a BD50 disc with the MPEG2 codec, it would be great to use what other studios employ, namely VC-1 and utilising the extra space for special features. Fox charge at least $10 more for their titles in part probably due to the extra security measures they insist on using. The movie itself is not best conversion to Blu-ray I have seen and can seem a little too soft focused for the most part, but the the actual film is first class with one of the largest star lists I have ever seen including Sean Connery, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins and just too many to mention. If only Fox could just get their act together and treat movies like this, The Battle Of Britain, Master & Commander, Kingdom Of Heaven and others with the respect they deserve.
