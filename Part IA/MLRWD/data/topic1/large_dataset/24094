I saw this movie when it first came out in 1972. Going in, I knew very little about the story and was unsure what to expect. I left the theater thoroughly shaken.

Adapted from the novel by the late James Dickey, this harrowing film pulls no punches. It was (and still is) difficult to watch. But its gritty realism left quite an impression on me, and I found myself thinking about the movie and its characters long afterward.

I was very happy to discover that Deliverance had been released on DVD. Although there are few extras -- info on cast and crew, some brief behind-the-scenes text, a 10-minute featurette, and theatrical trailer --  the movie still carries considerable punch. The DVD is double-sided, offering both wide-screen and full-screen formats.

Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds (in the best performance of his career), Ronnie Cox and Ned Beatty are first-rate in their portrayals of Ed, Lewis, Drew and Bobby. Incredibly, they do most of their own stunts, and the risk involved in making this film actually precluded obtaining insurance. It couldn't have been an easy shoot, and my hat goes off to the four actors as well as to James Dickey, cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, and producer/director John Boorman and company.

Many other reviewers have described the plot and mentioned notable scenes, so I won't rehash them here. Suffice it to say that this film is subtle at times and slow-moving in spots (which I don't consider to be negatives), multi-layered, and doesn't smack you in the face with special effects. Questions remain unanswered at the end of the film, leaving the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions. Rather than spoon-feeding you every detail and wrapping everything in a tidy box at the end, this film invites you to *think*.

As far as I'm concerned, they just don't make movies like Deliverance anymore. To me, it's a classic. I highly recommend both the film and the DVD.
