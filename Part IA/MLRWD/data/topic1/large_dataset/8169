I pre-ordered this DVD (having the first one already of course) and I must say that every episode was great.  There is no doubt in my mind that the second season is better than the first with the characters much more developed and the lines funnier than ever before.  The stories were more solid and watchable with more quality episodes than the first season.  Because this is one of my favorite shows, I hate to not give it 5 stars, but there is a compelling reason for not doing so.  This time, I believe that Buena Vista took a step backward.  You cannot skip scenes or go back to a scene, or skip the intro to each episode.  If you try, it will take you to the next one, or the very beginning of the episode.  I enjoyed being able to do that in the previous season and am baffled as to why they chose to  leave that option out this time.  Also, the trivia challenge does not always work right and would have been best left out.  Behind-the-scene footage would have been better I think, or an interview or two from the cast members.  I expected alot more from a DVD than what I got this time around.  The episodes, however, are great and I would highly recommend it to anyone on that note alone if you can overcome the technical issue.
