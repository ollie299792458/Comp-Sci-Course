"Don't listen to the last reviewer, It's quit obvious that some people don't know what films are about sometimes--sometimes they amount to more than just simple plain entertainment. Just like Martin Scorcees's "Taxie Driver" the film mirrors the nilihism, cynicism of soecity, here being-- of the late 1960's.  Reflecting Fisher's parinoia take and look on society. This time The Baron is not the anti-hero, he is the monster, who is simply alienated in a soceity that refuses the ethics of science. He has tried many time, countless experiments, countless failures, he has become sick and embittered with soceity, and downright misanthorpic. There's alot that this film offers, but if you merely decide to dissmiss the film as just another Frankestein film, or if your one of those people who prefer the Universal Frankenstein series---then ur lost. At least Hammer came up with something new everytime, it kept the whole Frankenstein myth fresh, and if anything Hammer's Frankenstein series is vastly superior to there often Overrated Dracula films (excluding "Horror", Prince of Darkness" and "Taste")  And like the movie "Taxie Driver"-which was Scorsess's masterpiece, Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed" is Terence Fisher's Masterpiece.
