Everyone seems to give Sera Gamble crap for the show's perceived "decline" once she took over as showrunner.  Gamble has been with 'Supernatural' from the beginning, and is responsible for writing some of the series' strongest episodes.  I agree that 'Supernatural' could have ended with the conclusion of its fifth season, but it didn't.  When shows age, they show signs of wear and tear.  As years go on, some seasons are weaker than others.  Look at 'Desperate Housewives,' 'Grey's Anatomy,' or any 'CSI' or 'Law and Order' show for the proof.  Blaming Sera Gamble is weak, and if Eric Kripke were still in charge people would be blaming him.  The show isn't as fresh because there's nothing fresh about it.  The actors and crew have been together for so long they're all family now.  Everyone is so overwhelmingly familiar with one another that the sense of newness and adventure seems to be gone.  I will say the show has lost the edge it once had but I still enjoy coming back week after week.

I will say I was slightly disappointed with the season finale.  Am I the only one who thought it anti-climatic?  Also, I hope that Bobby is gone.  I love the character and the actor, but I hope the show does not fall prey to bringing him back just because he's a beloved recurring character.  Let him go.  His death and his ghost finally moving on should give the boys a renewed edge.  Bobby was one of my all-time favorite characters on this series, but nothing about the finale or the burning of the flask gave any poignancy to his death.  The show is usually better at handling the deaths of beloved recurring characters ... i.e. John Winchester, Ellen and Jo ...
