Over the years Bruce Willis has been in several types of movies but is undeniably at his best in hard core full throttle action movies such as this  Even at 50 years old, he doesnt look like he's hardly aged at all  Willis plays a former big city cop who is trying to move on with his life after an entire family is killed by a gunman on his watch  He moves from Los Angeles to a smaller town in California where he becomes the sheriff  A group of young men take an entire family hostage and Willis is called in to rescue the hostages  Then after he turns the scene over to the FBI his family is taken hostage by a group of faceless thugs who want an object (I won't say what) out of the house the young men have taken control of  Willis must race against time and odds to get his family out alive  Thats pretty much the jist of the story  Willis delivers a knockout punch in his role and flat-out MAKES this movie work  An excellent addition to any action/thriller fan's DVD collection, this is a must have  I'm just sorry I missed seeing it in theatres
