Sequels are iffy; sometimes good, mostly disappointing. Frankly, this didn't disappoint.

It won't enrich your life, or enlighten you, or lead you to a vision of heaven.

On the other hand, it's a perfectly good story, and the special effects give it a nice texture; it's a popcorn-worthy adventure movie.

The plot is simple, with one subplot; a bad fairy (who looks like a vampire) wants control of an army of unstoppable robot-thingies. He kills his father to get control of that army, but then has to find the map to the army, and the missing pieces of the control device (a crown) to further his dark ambitions. Oh, yeah; his twin sister is the love interest for the fish-guy in the movie who is Hellboy's sidekick.

There are a lot of fights, monsters, including cute tiny monsters like the tooth fairies, all leading up to the big finale fight where Hellboy fights bad fairy guy.

There's an emotionally satisfying end for the movie when bad guy's sister finishes him off at the ultimate cost to herself. Fish guy morns, and we get a mostly happy ending.
