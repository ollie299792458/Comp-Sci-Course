In my opinion the star of this adaptation of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations was Gillian Anderson in the role of Miss Havesham.  All the versions of this movie that I've seen portray the character as being very elderly and bent over.  Like another reviewer remarked, it would be understandable for her to be in her 40s when she first meets Pip.  I just liked the almost ethereal way she looked--the white makeup, white, disheveled hair, and the wedding dress that becomes shabbier and dirtier each time she makes an appearance and her seemingly innocent, "deer in the headlights" look mixed with absolute bitterness and hatred of all things masculine.  The other actor that played his role with all the gusto of a "bad guy" was Drummle, the lecherous, abusive man who becomes Estella's husband.  I'm not sure about Pip's character.  I liked the younger version better than the adult version.  Douglas Booth just seemed a little too pretty for that role and didn't really give it much depth. I liked the portrayal of Estella--she was naturally pretty, cold, and aloof.  Again the BBC does a good job recreating the background of the Victorian landscape complete with modest houses, bleak and harsh conditions both in the country and in London.
