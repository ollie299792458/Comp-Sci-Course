Jackson, Farrell, and the others make this a watchable movie.. They add depth to a shallow story-Now a shallow story in an action film is not in and of itself a bad thing. SWAT had tremendous potential. Jackson is commanding and eminently watchable, Farrell has enough charisma that you could watch him talk on the phone for an hour and a half (wait-I have watched him on the phone for an hour and a half)...The rest of the cast is pretty good for mostly flat characters in a typical action movie. 
What goes wrong here is very screwy direction, a painfully long and dull "training" session, and an idiotic fist fight in the dark which you cant see and dont care about, and already know the outcome. Farrell's "badboy" character is never developed and never does anything bad, his ex(?) girlfriend is introduced and one of many subplots is left dangling (not that you care). This is a messed up movie...for a B-action flick, and to watch Farrell charm the world, and Jackson as a cardboard hero-it is fun-but both actors deserve so much more then they have been given here or in other movies they have done of late.
