First, forget science.  Period.  Don't even attempted to make sense of the baloney they talk about.  None of it is even theoretically possible.  It isn't even believeable.  I watched this with friends and anytime the characters started talking science we laughed and/or groaned.

Second, the plot is a joke.  Nothing to be said about it.

Third, the climax is ... is ... *sigh*  There really isn't one.  There could have been one if they had to explode their vehicle for the last over-the-top mega nuke thus making this a tragedy, but that would mean the writers could write.  They didn't and went for the sappy unbelieveable fizzing-out ending.

Don't buy this movie.  Don't rent it.  If you must see it, borrow it for free from your public library.  I did and I am so very glad I did.  If I had paid a penny to see it, I would have demanded my money back.

Having said all that, why do I give this movie a "2" instead of a "1"?  Simply because it is a bad sci fi movie that will make a party laugh watching it.  Oh, and they won't be laughing at any jokes in the movie, but simply at the movie.
