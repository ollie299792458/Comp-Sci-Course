Superman: The Movie encapsulated every aspect of the character of Superman and his universe from the 40 years that he had existed at that time. The basic origin of Superman, his heritage and his battle of strength and wit against his arch-foe Lex Luthor are all explored here as well as his relationships with his supporting cast. Superman: The Movie gives the viewer an unadulterated, pure and romantic look at what has become one of America's greatest fictional characters and what is now the most recognizable character next to Mickey Mouse. Superman: The Movie is a masterpiece and should be owned by everyone.
