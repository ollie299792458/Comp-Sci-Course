Don't believe the negative reviews-they were written by shallow consumer-minded individuals.
If the movie is slow, its intentional. What kind of life does a soccer Mom have anyway-a scheduled and rigid drudge. The fact that this woman can multitask on that level, keep her head on straight and think far into the future is the amazing facet of this film. Sure, she should be responsible and call the cops but that would "out" her talented son, perhaps ruin his relationship with his military father and have their family the talk of Tahoe.
Its a film about people on a higher level who occasionally come down and get "dirty" with marginal elements of society.
Its also about how the equilibrium of morality. A soccer Mom hides evidence and calmly disposes of a dead body. A musically talented, IVy league bound teenager has a gross realtionship with a predatory bar owner. A "low-life" collector rises up when confronted with the woman's dilemma and the power of the family. They go down, he rises up. They all meet on the morality plane somewhere near each other in the end.
This is more of an ethics dilemma than a film noir, which is why it;s the eyeopener it is. Look for Tilda Swinton's imploding emotions to finally get the best of her.
