Ok, heres the problem I have with people criticizing this movie, they didnt vary that much. All the people who trolled the review sites with the first one trying to be creative with the dialogue to their empty insults no longer have a leg to stand on because they knew what to expect. It wasnt a sequel where you could say they ruined the first one, like Scream, it was a literal elaboration of the first movie. This one had just as much to offer as the first one, they just divided it up into different portions. The casual scenes were funnier and contained dialogue actually worth listening to which served as a misdirection to further dramatize the effectiveness of the scary scenes. They put more shock value on the individual scenes, then slowed the pace of the movie which ultimately led to a higher anxious anticipation of what was to come. Each explosive scene in the second completely outdid that of the first. And while in the back of your head you kinda knew how it was gonna end, it was just so messed up that you refused to believe it until you actually seen it. The ONLY reason the first had a chance at being scarier is because you werent familiar with the story yet. They put way more of an explanation to the story and somehow managed to do it without being cheesy. If you didnt like the first, then avoid this. But if you like the documentary horror genre then you should definitely check it out.
