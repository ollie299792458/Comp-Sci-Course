I have seen most of the  films of Jane Eyre. It used to be that my favorite was the 1944 Orson Wells version. It doesn't follow the book exactly, but Orson was the perfect Mr Rochester in appearance and Joan Fontaine, while may be too pretty, came off with the innocence  and ethereal quality of Jane, plus the gothic moodiness of the film was captured perfectly.
Now having seen the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version, this has become my new favorite. To me out of all the many versions. this follows the story the closest. Many may say  Timothy Dalton was too good looking to play Mr Rochester, but I say his acting out shines any of the many actors who have played Rochester. He is simply brilliant. Timothy understands who Rochester is. He proceses it, takes his time with the part and  thus all shines through.....his sensitivity and feeling has captured Mr Rochesters personalty of an angry, tortured, yet tender and loving and mischevious side to a tee.
The other actors are just as wonderful. Zelah Clarke has true heart and feeling, totally understands who Jane is and in essence is her in the movie. She and Timothy have a wonderful chemistry together, you can really feel the sexual tension between them, the jelousy, the pain and the  true love they feel for each other.
 The mini series really takes you in.  One is captured and you never want to let go.
 I highly recommend it  A+
