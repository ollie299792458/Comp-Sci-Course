To be honest, I as expecting something far worse and was actually delighted with the 80's charm and Brady charisma.  The fact of the matter is, individually, perhaps some did not have the talent to pull off a variety show - but as a "Bunch", it was endearing !  I was a Brady Bunch fan during their tenure when it first aired and -- kinda like Bobby (Mike Lookinland), remember nothing about this show and pretty sure I never watched it when it originally aired.  I also preferred the Partridge Family to the Brady's, but generally enjoyed them both and am enjoying my retrospective of those years. 

Yes - I know, TV Guide says this show was one of the 50 Worst ever... But they are dead wrong and I can prove it:  Bosom Buddies is not in the 50 Worst List ! 

So, get thinking 80's here Folks:  Remember too:  The Carpenters had a number of Variety Shows  - and no one disputes Karen and Richard were one of the most talented duos of the last decade:  But even their variety show was of the same ilk --- and not much better ! (sans Karen's Gorgeous and Rich voice register that could melt me like butter...). 

I think this also proves that while Robert Reed had his demons, he genuine loved this brood and stayed with them until the end...
