Finally...a real horror film, a GREAT horror film, but strangely enough, more than just a horror film: it is a fantastic work of cinema judged to the standards of any genre. It is a strange film, for it transforms part way through, changing from a groovy combo of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original, need it say..) and Last House of the Left, into a psychodelic horror version of Natural Born Killers.

This movie is a huge artistic leap forward for Rob. I literally had chills running up and down my spine during the arthouse opening and closing of the film. His combination of image and rock and roll music is the best I've seen (and heard) since David Lynch (Lost Highway), Oliver Stone (Killers), Anderson (Boogie Nights/ Magnolia), and the documentaries of Michael Moore.

Rejects is filled with fantastic character actors, and the charismatic william Forsythe gets the Tarantino treatement from Rob, and he really gets to cut loose and shine unlike he has since his portrayal of a Whigger Maoist revolutionary in Patty Hearst.

Rob is truly schooled in the horror genre and it shows in the film. If you love horror films, road films, white trash films, exploitation films, 70s psychodelic films, then this is going to be a realy treat for you. I am very excited about what further works he will produce in the future, regardless of genre. Rob is a filmmaker to watch.

Rejects is smart, nasty, and oddly touching. A rare mix...too rare.
