This mini series did what the first one could not. It was very entertaining the entire time. The first one was predictable and slow, where this was filled with plot twists and action. I ecspecially like the twist with Julie played by Faye Grant. She was by far the bright spot in the series, as she portrayed the pressure of command with great realism. The miniseries is longer that the first set, but never becomes dull like the original was at times. I finished this series in one sitting at 1 am, because I could not hit the stop button. It reminds me alot of Red Dawn in the way that the resistance attacks the visitors. It starts out small and grows throughout the series. I do wish they would have included the distress signal from the original, but I guess they threw that plot line away. The special effects are not as good as the original, I guess that NBC didn't put as much money into this one. It doesn't hurt the series, but is noticably worse than the first. All the twists lead to a great ending that does conclude many of the plotlines. I don't know what the plotline is exactly for the regular series, but not much is left in the air at the end. V- The Final Battle is a great science fiction saga that should be given a chance by fans of the genre.
