This film is actually pretty good. If you label it as science fiction, you are missing the point- it's not. It is a comic book-style adventure film with some violence thrown in. Don't be scared off by the violence, it is no where near as violent as some of the movies out today! Some nice stunts with some cool cars and a bit of plot thrown in. But it all works! Parts tend to drag near the end, but only for a few minutes, and its right back to the action. It is basically a revenge story, but its quirks really make it work. It is just different from other movies of the same ilk. I particularly like the characters' comic book style looks and action, and the screen wipes help make the movie seem more like an old fashioned style serial. Worth watching if you like Mel, cars, or action. I didn't hear a whole lot of difference between the American dubbed version and the Australian version, except for a few minor dialogue changes. (I too agree with the reviewer that the chatter over Goose's radio was more interesting on the American version. "C'mon Goose! Where are you?")
