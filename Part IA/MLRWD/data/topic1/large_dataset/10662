according to page when this was released, they were having an off night  i wonder what a excellent night for them would have been.  this was one of their best concert ever.  though when it comes to dvds, bootlegs like earl's court, knebworth, or their reunion fair a lot better.

especially the one from knebworth, which was one of bonham's last performance, he plays as if his life depended on it.  it was kind of ironic that he played that night with all his might, and that would be the last official video released.  even though they are a lot older now, their knebworth far out weighed song remains the same.  it is too bad that they full knebworth and earl's court performance was never released in full officially.  regardless the video footages are a testimony that these four lads from england, wales, and scotland did not go down like a led ballooon, but flew as high as anyone could, and crashed landed in 1980.  along with the beatles, they are still revered as the greatest  rock band ever that walked the earth among the giants.
