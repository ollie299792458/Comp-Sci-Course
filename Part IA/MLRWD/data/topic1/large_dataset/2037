Funny, only one other reviewer here noticed, or had the guts, to state the obvious: the girl in this movie is OBVIOUSLY delusional and in need of psychotherapy. But I digress...

Alright, here's the truth about this movie. The always-great Macy plays a middle-aged college professor who offers help to one of his failing students, in this case a young woman with CLEAR psychological problems. The student in question blows a simple misunderstanding into a full blown sexual harassment charge aimed at destroying the professor, which in turn would mean losing his hard-earned tenure. Any NORMAL woman would CLEARLY have seen the misunderstanding for what it was: A MISUNDERSTANDING, and consequently drop the matter entirely. Not so the student-from-hell in this film. She not only misconstrues the professors intentions, she goes on a personal vendetta with the single-minded purpose of a shark hunting a baby seal (only the shark is more intelligent), whereas the girl comes accross as a moron with schizo-affective disorder. She tries to completely and utterly destroy the man.

Just when you think it couldn't possibly get any better, things go from bad to worse. What happens next could only take place in the mind of someone in desperate need of thorazine: She accuses the professor of RAPING her.

Can you say 'nut case' boys and girls?

I enjoyed this movie only because of Macy, who in my opinion is one of the most underrated actors of our times. However the movie is a bit unrealistic in that most men would have either walked away from this girl completely, told one of their peers about it soon enough to make others aware of the situation, OR - and this is what most men would have done if it came to the same point as it did in the movie. Hire a lawyer!
