I must clarify what this movie is about, Wilmington, NC's review is completely misleading.
A shocking tale set in Japan.  The government has labeled the next generation (students) the reason to degredation in society.  They have greated a BR (Battle Royale) program that places one school class on a deserted island.
Class 3B was chosen (9th graders, highschoolers).  Awaking on the island they find metal colars on their necks and their teacher explains that they have been chosen for this year's Battle Royale...
The Rules:  They are given weapons and are forced to kill each other.  Only the last one surviving will be able to go home.
Why comply to these rules?  If there isnt a winner in 3 days, the colars on the students necks will explode, and no one goes home.
Some students form alliances, others will allow nothing to keep them from the win...
The producer meant the movie to be for kids the age of those used in the film (highschool) and older, however to his dissapointment the movie was rated R...
