This is not by any means a bad film in fact it is better then most movies i have seen in recent years. Do not pay the 3D price for the movie because the 3D does nothing special to enhence the movie.See it in 3D only if you are a die hard fan of 3D films. The movie opens up with sam worthington and the boy who plays his son the film picks up real quick and the action does not stop. My only real com
plant about the movie was i was kind of hoping for a longer battle scene bewteen the mahkai army and the human army. There is a battle scene they do show it happening but if you want a battle scene like lord of the rings return of the king or the two towers then you will be somewhat disappointed.All in all this film is worth watching and buying when it comes out on dvd. You do not have to watch the first movie as it does not follow the first movie that close there are things mentioned in this movie that happened in the clash of the titans but it still does not follow the first movie that close
