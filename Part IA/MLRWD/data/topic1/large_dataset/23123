With the exception of the retaliation at the end, I lived through almost every instance displayed in the movie.  For me, it was not fiction.

I saw "IF" in former British colony, India in the late 60's while I as an orphaned boarder in Calcutta Boys' School.  I was about 10 then and worshiped Malcolm's character in that movie. His courage gave me the strength to endure the physical abuse I had to endure at the hands of the sadistic principal, his cruel teachers and 'monitors' all of whom were given the power to abuse children - as they saw fit.

I am buying the DVD to add to my collection now that it is out, so that I never forget.  This movie, as far as I am concerned is truly based on the British boarding school system that often times physically abuse children in their care - while hiding behind the guise of discipline.  Rent if, if you don't buy it.  But watch it nonetheless.  Child abuse is still present today in former British colonies.

Protect your children in the hands of people like those, including so-called nannies.  I know some are perhaps good, but others are cold hearted and view beating children (even their own) as acceptable.
