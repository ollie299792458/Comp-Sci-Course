I like a good destruction film now and then.  I'm easy to please - I liked Dante's Peak.  So when I rented this film, my expectations were low.  I was just looking to be mindlessly entertained.  It had all the makings of a good disaster film: good actors, interesting sub-plots, and lots of special effects (or CG).  But I found this film to be rather disappointing.  According to the ratings, more people hated it than loved it.  In trying to figure out why it was such a disappointment to me and maybe others, I could say the makers of this film insulted our intelligence over and over again in order to supposedly create suspense.  There are too many examples to cite, but primarily the special effects were so over the top and unbelievable that I couldn't buy into it.  In order to entertain, the makers of a film have to make you believe that what you are seeing could actually happen, even for a second.  It wasn't the CG on the destruction that I didn't believe; that was pretty good.  It was how the main characters of the film just barely escaped demise every turn of the way.  Too unbelievable to be fully entertaining.  Bottom line: this film is watchable and mildly entertaining, but suffers from sappy sub-plots and over the top special effects that insult your intelligence.
