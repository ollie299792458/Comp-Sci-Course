Let me start by saying anyone who would've seen this movie already has by the time I write this review. Anyway, here it comes.  I actually avoided this movie for two years because I'd had a few negative notions about it: 1....it's a musical Tarzan so it's dumb, 2.....it's probably too PC as I saw no knife on this Tarzan's hip, 3....I assumed it was mostly for women and young children.  I WAS WRONG!  THIS Tarzan representation is as rip snortin great as the best live actor Tarzans.  He DOES have a major fight sequence with an animal. This jungle is presented as the most awsome jungle I'd ever seen, magnificent and spectacular!  NO natives but the movie hardly suffers for it.  Enough action to satisfy any adventure fan.  Any of the few songs are mostly as background so this is NOT a musical in the classic sense.  After Weissmuller, Scott, Henry and other screen Tarzans are forgotten ( assuming that is'nt already the case), THIS Tarzan and his movie will live on as a truelly great film, deserving to be called a MASTERPIECE.  DON'T consider it the Disney kids TV series version ever! I hav'nt seen a lot of those but they're likely mediocre by comparison.  Anyone who likes Tarzan in any form must see this movie.
