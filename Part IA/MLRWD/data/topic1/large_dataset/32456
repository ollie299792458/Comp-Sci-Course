I'm not going to make this review incredibly long or detailed, simply because I only have a couple of very important things to say about this movie.  Of course, I would easily rate this as a classic and one of the best comedies of all time, and if you want a really great balance of humor, drama, and action, then this is the flick for you.  But what I really want to stress -- and this is very timely due to the climate we are living in now -- is that what makes this movie great, in my opinion, is that the conflicts that you see within the plot don't have anything at all to do with race or the black vs. white issue.  Rather, everything you see that takes place has to do with the managerial and philosophical differences between the Beverly Hills and Detroit police departments.  Sergeant Taggart punches Axel (Eddie Murphy) in the stomach after he gets provoked, but does this cause an uproar or any kind of major controversy?  No -- it was cop vs. cop, and nothing more.  Suffice it to say, I can watch this movie again and again, and admittedly, since I already know all the punch lines, I don't exactly burst out in laughter anymore, but I still appreciate its immense depth, interesting story, and great acting and characters.
