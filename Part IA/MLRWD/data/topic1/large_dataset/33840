I loved the first Rush Hour, and found the second to be amusing enough to purchase.  This one however, just fell flat.  The action scenes were not of the caliber, quality or ingenuity of the previous films, or of a standard Jackie Chan film.  And as for the comedy, it really wasn't that funny.  The movie felt as if large parts of the dialogue were unscripted in the hopes that Chris Tucker would "Say something funny" which never happened.  Sure there were a few lines that made me smile, but nothing made me actually laugh.  The plot would have been okay if it hadn't been used already in a previous Rush Hour (spoiler: bad guy is posing as a friend who sent you to get bad guy in first place) then you add in the tired old "It's his brother/sister/dad" part of the plot, which I hope was not supposed to be a twist, because I figured it out as soon as they introduced him.

The biggest problem with this movie is that it is a rehash of Rush Hour 1 without everything that made Rush Hour 1 so charming, which was watching the two of them get to know eachother.  Chan takes the back seat in this picture to Tucker who, for some reason seems to be wandering blindly through the movie.  The only good addition to the film was the French Cab Driver.  Other than that, we just have a bunch of Tucker and Chan getting threatened, running away, getting caught, bursting into song, being attacked, chasing bad guys and bursting into song again.  Which seems like the formula for most good action flicks (other than the bursting into song part) only this one just doesn't fit together as well and doesn't have the heart that the others did.

Is the movie overall terrible?  No, it's okay for a Saturday afternoon on TV.  I am just dissapointed by the overwhelming mediocreness of the whole film.

3 of 5 stars - It's Okay
