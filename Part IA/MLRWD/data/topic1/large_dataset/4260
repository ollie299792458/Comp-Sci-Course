A very different take on the 'buried alive' theme in horror that goes back centuries, "After.life" stars Cristina Ricci as a young schoolteacher who 'dies' in a freak automobile accident only to wake up alive and well in the town morgue.  Where she promptly meets the mortician/funeral parlor director (played by Liam Neeson), a haunted, weary man who explains to her that she is indeed deceased, the latest of a long line of deceased he's encountered who don't know they're dead, and because of his unique ability to see and interact with the dead, it's his job to prepare her for her imminent journey to the afterlife.

  What's real?  Is this scenario the truth, with Neeson a conductor of souls, or is he nuts or worse and Ricci is still alive, captive?  It sounds like this kind of scenario should fall apart in anything longer than a 20-minute segment of an anthology film but, surprisingly, it doesn't.  With great skill and suspense, it genuinely keeps the viewer guessing even as it keeps Ricci's character guessing.  She's initially convinced that the funeral home director is insane and she's very much alive, but begins to doubt.  The movie will throw a clue that indicates one conclusion, then minutes later throw a different hint that leads you back in the other direction.  All this while, Ricci's boyfriend (played by Justin Long), haunted by suspicions after one of her grade school students insists he's seen her alive, begins to search out whether something strange is going on, and wonders whether all his doubts are just the byproduct of grief and the guilt he's feeling over the fight they had the night of her death.

  This was probably difficult material to make convincing, but the filmmakers and cast did an excellent job with it.  Great for horror and mystery fans; four-and-a-half stars.
