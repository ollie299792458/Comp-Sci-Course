I was lucky enough to see the 1936 version on TV in the 1970's before I ever laid eyes on the MGM 1951 version, so I came to the latter with expectations that were not quite met. I don't write it off to the extent that some of your other critics do, because viewed purely as a musical rather than as a play it works fairly well. Howard Keel certainly scores over Alan Jones as Ravenal, Marge and Gower Champion get more scope for their featured numbers, and Katherine Grayson works aesthetically and vocally, if not theatrically. Otherwise the 1936 version wins hands down; truer to the novel, the play and the stage original. Unfortunately for its chances of revival on DVD, its' weakness as well as its' strength is the presence of Paul Robeson. Even 30 years after his death and half a century after being rendered a non-person by the character assassination carried out by a combination of Senator McCarthy, AFL-CIO, and the NAACP, elements of the blacklist remain. It is still nearly impossible to find his better movies on VHS, let alone DVD. The spirit of the late junior senator from Wisconsin walks the land in the era of Dubya, much as it did in the age of Ike, albeit more obliquely.
