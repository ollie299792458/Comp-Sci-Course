THE SHOW:
Season 2 is not jam-packed with great episodes, but there are a few good ones. It's amusing that Kelly is pretty smart in the early going of the series. She's much funnier an airhead of course, can't wait 'til that happens. Bud is getting funnier and funnier. And Al & Peg already have their characters down pretty early in the series which is great!
PICTURE QUALITY:
Discs 1 and 2 for some moronic reason are loaded with NINE episodes each, and the 3rd with only FOUR. Stupid enough for any of you? Yes, these filthy rich companies can't even add for some reason. Does no one check the product before it is released?
Many episodes, especially on the 2nd disk, are plagued with LINES  ON THE SCREEN. A single, translucent vertical line just hangs on the screen in the same place for a few seconds at a time, disappearing then returning, in several episodes (and no, it's not my dvd player or my tv to blame). This is VERY annoying. The 3rd disc, SURPRISE SURPRISE, suffers NO such defects, and the picture is brilliant. I can only attribute these flaws to OVER-COMPRESSION.
DVD PRODUCER'S THOUGHTS: Hmmm. Let's see. 22 episodes on 3 discs. I know! Let's overload the first 2 discs with 9 eps each and leave the third one virtually empty with only 4! It makes perfect sense!
Couldn't they just have done 8+7+7 instead of 9+9+4? DUH???
THE EXTRAS:
Terrible. The "extras" are pathetic easter eggs hidden in menu screens you have to search for like a moron. And these so-called extras are nothing but very short CLIPS from the MWC Reunion Special that aired on Fox not too long ago. What the hell?
Why no commentaries? Not even for one episode? I'd love to hear from the creators of the show, or at least the actors for at least ONE episode. Why not?
OVERALL:
An O.K. season of the Bundys on a pretty lousy DVD set. Why couldn't they do this one up right?
