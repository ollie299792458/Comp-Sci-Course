This rating is based on my preference for character relationships above special effects, so please take with a grain of salt, because this movie is great looking, and has some very cool ideas.

When Guillermo Del Toro both writes AND directs, it tends to produce his best movies, I think. I love The Devil's Backbone, and Pan's Labyrinth. But Cronos just didn't affect me the same way. The relationship between the granddaughter and grandfather felt un-fleshed out, and the movie became just a showcase for Del Toro's (admittedly great) special effects. And if that's what you're looking for, please do pick this movie up. It is a very original idea of vampirism, and the special effects are really fun. But if you are looking for another movie that is scary and devastatingly sad, like the director's other films mentioned above, you might be disappointed. The only character who really feels interesting and fleshed out is Ron Perlman's. And I think we may have Ron Perlman to thank for that.

The criterion collection comes with a strange and funny short horror film from del Toro's film school years. It's not particularly good, but it's fun to watch, and fun to hear him talk about it in the video interview.
