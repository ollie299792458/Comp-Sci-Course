Directed by David Durston (Stigma). A band of Satanist hippies lead by Horace Bones (Bhaskar) roll into a town and begin terrorizing the local folk, raping a local girl who's grandpa goes after them. He fails and is given LSD. This bothers his grandson and he gets back at the hippies by feeding them meat pies infected with blood from a rabid dog. They turn into crazed lunatics and begin killing and/or infecting everything in their path. I DRINK YOUR BLOOD is also know as PHOBIA. The movie is like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD meets Charlie Manson in this gore-drenched 1971 drive-in classic. After consuming rabies infected meat pies, an LSD-addicted hippie cult goes on a vicious murdering rampage!
