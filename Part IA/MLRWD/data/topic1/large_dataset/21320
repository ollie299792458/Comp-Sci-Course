My VCR is on the fritz, so, after watching this so very watchable, popcorn movie on tv the other day, I decided it was time to get myself a DVD version. If you are from Chicago, like me, you know that firemen are practically worshipped there (for better or worse). This movie has great scenes of Chicago, with the bungalow that Kurt and Rebecca live. Speaking of De Mornay, it must be written into all of her movie contracts that she has at least one scene where she takes off her clothes. We also see the great Chicago skyline and the brick structures, including the burning ones, that make up the majority of buildings in the town. We also get to see why William Baldwin doesn't get more acting jobs. What a whiner! Jennifer Jason Leigh looks awful in either a bad hair dye job or a really awful wig. J.T. Walsh is Alderman Swayszak and right away, because he is in the movie, you know he is a bad guy. That's also his name because, in Chicago, at least a few of the 40-some alderman are going to be Polish. The ending is, of course, big. The real ending.
The other reviewers are correct in saying that the central character is the fire. Get the enhanced version to find out how Howard carried off the firefighting scenes; they are pretty incredible. This was before most enhanced computer effects were around. That was mostly the real stuff, folks.
Enjoy!
