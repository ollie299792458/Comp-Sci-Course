I cannot believe how many negative reviews this film actually received.  Were they watching the same movie I was watching?  I generally concider myself very critical when it comes to political thrillers such as "The Sentinel", so I am not going to just generally give such a movie of one of my favorite genres a high rating automatically without giving it some fore-thought.  "The Sentinel" is everything that an intense, well-crafted political thriller should be.  The acting is quite convincing and the suspense is riveting.  I guarantee you will be pinned to the edge of your seat through the entire film and then some.  Also, the scenario is extremely plausible, especially in today's world, with all the militant groups out there--from neo-Nazis to Islamic radicals--who would stop at nothing to make an assination attempt or terrorist attack against the President or some U.S. institution.  My advice is, before listening to the negative rants of the other reviewers of this film, go ahead and take a look at it yourself.  It's a safe bet that you will not be disappointed.
