Madonna has been a part of our public consciousness for almost three decades. Love or hate her, no one would argue that she is one of the biggest pop stars and icons of our time. There is just something so captivating about her. It's more than her talent (and unlike some of her detractors, I am a huge fan and I do believe that she is talented). It's more about her star quality, which consists of a mixture of ambition, charisma, nerve, and elusiveness. "Truth or Dare" is a daring documentary that truly captures the force of Madonna's compelling personality. We get to see many different facets of her persona: the boss, the narcissist, the passionate artist, the maternal figure. Of course, there are moments in the film that feel sort of staged and premeditated and intended to effect the viewer. But that just demonstrates the power of Madonna's postmodern vision. It constantly raises the question "Is this life, this is art, or both?" One constant theme of Madonna's work is to turn her life into a kind of performance art. She manages to do that brilliantly with "Truth or Dare". It's hilarious, it's entertaining, and (despite how "real" it is or not) it's very insightful.
