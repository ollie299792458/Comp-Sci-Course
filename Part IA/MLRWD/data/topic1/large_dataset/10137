If you've read anything of the description, you'll know the story doesn't appear to have any fascinating elements to it for someone who is perhaps 25 years old or younger. But if you have experienced death of a parent, or the awkwardness of dealing with grown siblings, or even dealing with embarrassing parental behavior---there is something here for you. In addition, if you are at all a History Channel buff, there is the added attraction of seeing life in postwar Japan, and what the middle-class there were doing while we were having our baby boom and moving to our "little boxes" in the suburbs. I like to look at the clothes and also see a society in a major transition while still having the influence (still felt) from American occupation. Plus if you are interested in religious and social practices, the funeral in the film is moving, and you may even come away with the Buddhist funeral chantings droning on in your head (I mean that in a GOOD way). It's kinda fun to compare this with American films about Japan made in the same period, like "Sayonara" and "Teahouse of the August Moon". And if you like this, you should see "Odd Obsession" and some of Kurosawa's contemporary films, like "High and Low".I don't know about what you learn about in 4th grade in 2003, but when I was in 4th grade we had to learn about Japan. I found it so fascinating I wanted to redo my room just like the rooms you'll see in "Tokyo Story" and I also wanted to eat Japanese-style constantly. So I rate this ichi-ban (#1)! If you're expecting some big color Douglas Sirk-style melodrama, you'll be disappointed, and the editing will seem very slow by post-MTV standards. But the actors are so good they hold your attention. I guess I made my point. Enjoy!
