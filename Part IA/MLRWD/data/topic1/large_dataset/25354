I first fell in love with Trinity blood when it was airing late night on Cartoon Network a few years ago. I finally broke down and bought it this past month and I dont regret it. Who doesn't love a gothic story that flows around the life of a thousand year old guilt ridden post apocalyptic genetically engineered Catholic Vampire Priest Cyborg  developed for the Mars colonization project. The main character Able is a wonderful mix of reticent power and the child like playfulness of a kind self confident soul burdened by guilt form past deeds and the determination to atone for his sins.

Trinity blood is an exceptional distillation then blending of Catholicism, idealism, gothic subculture, romanticism, the awe and attraction of fallen ancient civilizations, Technophilia, and humanity.  It has oh so many wonderful elements and they fit well together. There is little I can say that hasn't been said in earlier reviews.  Except that of all the characters development I would say that Brother Pedro's is the most stunning.  Even though he's not as present as the others his first introduction as a single minded religious fanatic known as the "Knight of Annihilation," a man willing to strike down friend or foe in order to "do gods bidding" and the man in charge of the Inquisitorial squad, his slow transition and awakening at the end of the series is one that seems all too rare in real life.

I recommend this series to all my technologically inclined Catholic friends and it's met with warm review.
