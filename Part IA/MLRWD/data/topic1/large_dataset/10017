Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade has to be one of the best anime movies ever made period. This great film was played out so well that they could make a Live Action or "Hollywood" movie version. Still its one of the greatest films of all time.

If you are expecting an Action film filled with gun fights then your expectations are wrong. Even there there are some fire fights in the movie, its not an action film movie, its more of a dramatic darker romantic version of Little Red Riding Hood since the storyline to the movie is based heavily on the original darker version of the childhood story.

Even though the movie might sometimes be slow in some areas, over all its a great film. Emotionally, this film will make you cry in some parts because of its strong emotional scenes the movie shows.

If you are an anime fan looking for a good and serious anime film, I say go for Jin-Roh. Its also a good romance film as well to be watched but I will probably say you will cry at some areas of the movie together. Still this movie should be watched by any anime fan who likes movies that are romantic, filled with drama and emotions, with a deep and heavily dark story line. Again if you expect so see tons of action and gun fights, this film is not for you.

I give it 5/5 stars because its a great movie and is prized item in my Anime DVD Collection.
