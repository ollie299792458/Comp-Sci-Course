First,

September 11th was a traumatic time for the US.  I had only moved here from the UK 8 months previous, but even so, found myself searching high and low for a US Flag to hang outside my house to show my patriotism.  This was a traumatic film to make - which may explain why it had to be made by two European Companies - Working Title & Studio Canal, rather than a US company (Yes Universal is American, but they are the Distributor, not the maker).  It is probably still to traumatic for most Americans to comprehend - let alone recreate.

The movie is excellent, and it is nice to be able to see that at least two of these low-lifes were unable to see the destruction of those onboard - they got beaten to death.  Also, the fact that many of the individuals play themselves - including FAA and Military personnel.  This allows them to accurately bring their true emotions and reactions to the screen.  I truly found myself on the edge of my seat - which is a very rare occurance.

It is an emotional journey, and I am glad the film was made.  It is easy to forget the events of that day in todays busy world - but that is just the point.  We should NEVER forget.  Finally - watch the special features, it offers a very emotional documentary with the family of the deceased, and those actors playing them in the movie.
