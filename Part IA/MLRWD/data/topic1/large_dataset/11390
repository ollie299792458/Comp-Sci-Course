When I purchased this film, I had my doubts.  I'm no fan of remakes, particularly after viewing  both the remake of and the 30th anniversary edition for NOTLD (1968). However, I was delighted with Hertzog's of Nosferatu.  He does remain true to the 1922 original while he also brings plot points a bit closer to Stoker's novel.  The film is simultaneously romantic and existential, and truely haunting.  The characterizations are fantastic, Nosferatu (who's meloncholy count struggles with the same qualms as the Bard's melocholy prince). The cinematography captures gothic noir imagery that I have never seen equaled.  And though it is a remake, I believe that this film is a classic in its own right.  As some have already mentioned, the pacing is slow.  The editing is more stylistically similar to that of Kubrick than to MTV.  This is not to say that it comes across as too long or boring, though some viewers may be fidgety at first.  It is very enjoyable.  Finally, I don't know if there is indeed an English dubbed version of the German rendition, but Hertzog filmed the movie once in German and once in English with the same cast.  From what reviewers have said here, I'd stay away from the dubbed edition.  But I highly endorse the edition that was filmed in English.
