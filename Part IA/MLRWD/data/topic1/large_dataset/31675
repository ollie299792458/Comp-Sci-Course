I just want to express my utter disappointment that this was another entry into the category of Horror Films That Have No True Ending.

The initial premise is unsettling, but in a dark, subversive way. The set-up is great, the characters engaging, the acting is perfect, and the stage is set for the protagonist (a professional assassin) to melt-down on the job. We see the moral disintegration of the lead, and I assumed that that would be the heart of the plot. But, guess what... that is NOT the story. The whole thing goes sideways when, near the end, without warning, the viewer and the characters are immersed in a scene straight out of The Wicker Man complete with goofy masks and a sacrifice parade. No details, no explanation, no story flow. The protagonist just goes along with it, and other less central players who have populated the story from the beginning are quickly revealed to be a part of it... THE END. No climax, no full circle, no logic... juuussst THE END.

Either the writers/producers/director of this film are horribly unskilled at their job, or this thing was improv from the get go, and they couldn't figure out how to end it.

I give two stars for the acting, and for the chills created by what the viewer is led to believe is the disturbing plot. Other than that, the viewer is left with a WTF vibe by the credits suddenly rolling, and there is absolutely NO plot resolution. I literally JUST watched it, and I feel a bit like I have the cinematic equivalent of a woman forced to deal with her man's impotence. FRUSTRATED and UNFULFILLED.
