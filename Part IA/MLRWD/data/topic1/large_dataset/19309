I'm not about to waste your time, or mine, reviewing the "movie". If you've seen it, you KNOW it's one of the greatest movies of all time (many list it as Number 1). If you haven't seen it, then buy it.
The real question for me, is it worth getting the DVD if you already have Casablanca on VHS?
The answer, for me at least, is an unqualified yes. If you have a good crisp TV, with three comb filtering, such as a Sony Wega (I have a very good Sanyo), then there will be a much crisper and detailed picture. You can see it early on, particularly in the map of Europe and when Bogert signs a chit. Probably the BEST visual improvement of the VHS is the cloying and annoyingly overdone "soft focus" shots of Ingrid Bergman are not nearly so obvious or overdone in the DVD version. Why? I don't know, but perhaps the lack of crispness in the VHS causes the soft focus blur to be overly pronounced, like driving a car at night with an astigmatism which smears the headlights of oncoming cars.
Additionally the dynamic range of the DVD is much more pronounced than the VHS and/or less compressed, so quietly spoken passages are much quieter and musical passages louder.
(This may NOT be a good thing, however, for the hard of hearing.&lt;G&gt;)
