This film is a Masterpiece, most people who have seen this film should agree with me if you do not then you do not like Cinema or you do not have any respect for great films of the past and their Directors.

There seem to be a lot of these people who i have mentioned above do not have respect for great classic films and there directors they would go out and see or buy garbage like Charlies Angels, Titanic, Bridget Jones Diary, Basic Instinct 2, etc, instead of buying any classic films of the past or recent memory, these people piss me off and insult me you should stay out of watching or owning movies!!!.

Anyway to this DVD, this 40th Anniversary Edition of The Night Of The Living Dead is a great film but it does not have enough extras to make it as good as Dawn Of The Dead UE 4 Disc set.

With this Restored and Remastred Edition the Black and White picture is sharp and i have spotted no grain whatso ever the picture is also so very clear to the Eye.
The sound is also very good with the music roaring to the sound of the extreme horror which dominates my HDTV.

Again going back to the extras i just wished there was more and i was hoping for either a 2/4 Disc set but nether mind thats life eh, the extras consist of the following:-
A 83 minute Making off Production Documentary
2 Audio Commentaries by the usual Suspects!
Q/A Session with George Romero
Ben Speaks The last interview with Duane Jones
Trailer
Still Gallery
Original Script
could of been so much more.

So final verdict
George Romero's 40th Anniversary Edition Of Night Of The Living Dead Restored and Remastered is a great classic Horror movie but with average extras.
