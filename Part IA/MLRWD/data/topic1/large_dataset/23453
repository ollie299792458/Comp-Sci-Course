This film is a truly enchanting portrayal of Shakespeare's finest and most magical comedy. It is a richly woven tapestry of laughter and love with a generous sprinkling of fairy dust. This film version of "A Midsummer  Night's Dream" appears to follow word for word Shakespeare's original  masterpiece, only exchanging the time and place of the story from classical  Athens to what appeared to be late nineteenth century Italy. The film's  scenery, from the mysterious and evocative depths of the enchanted wood to  Theseus' richly appointed palace, was magnificent. And the actors  themselves were both delightful and compelling. Michelle Pfeiffer was  enchantingly beautiful as Titania, the Queen of the Fairies, and Rupert  Everett was in his element as her darkly handsome and commanding consort,  Oberon. But it was Kevine Kline in his portrayal of Bottom, the enchanted  ass, who truly stole the show. I can honestly say that this was one of the  most truly beautiful and delightful films I have ever seen.
