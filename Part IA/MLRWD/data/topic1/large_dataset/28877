I really don't know where to begin.  This film is as nearly perfect as you can get.  Every facet of great filmmaking is flawlessly displayed to absolute perfection in Michelangelo Antonioni's, L'Avventura.  This is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.
L'Avventura is all about relationships.  The relationships between the main characters and also the territory they inhabit. Needless to say, topography plays an important role in this film and thus becomes an outside character in of itself. 
When viewing for the first time, pay special attention to the deliberate pacing of the film.  It's very bold and lyrical in its approach.  Motion pictures aren't made like this anymore and you'll be pleasantly surprised that there is very little intrusion or manipulation by the director.  Antonioni really lets this film breathe naturally; nothing is hurried or out of place.  
This is really the perfect film.  
I won't talk anymore about this landmark motion picture; it would be sacreligious to ruin a great experience for you.
