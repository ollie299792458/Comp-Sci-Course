My brother always refused to watch this movie when we were growing up.  "Too dark," he would say, and for the longest time I can't say I disagreed with him.  The injustice of Potter getting away with the money was almost too much to bear.  And the scene where Potter tells George, "You're worth more dead than alive!" is straight from Death of a Salesman, perhaps the darkest American story there is.

The SNL version had it right, I thought.  After George (played by Dana Carvey) figures out it was Potter he exclaims, "What are we waiting for?  Let's get him!" and then proceeds to march over to Potter's place and beat the crap out of him.  Now there's some real justice!

But a recent viewing changed my mind completely.  The fact that Potter manages to get away with his indiscretions is precisely what gives this movie its power.  What's the message to George at the end?  To paraphrase, "No man is poor if he has friends."  Potter, by stark contrast, is the Charles Foster Kane of Bedford Falls -- loved by no one, even the creditors he sends to George's house.  The movie is also a testiment to the randomness and downright unfairness of life sometimes.  The only thing we can do to make the lows bearable is to give love and surround ourselves with love, as George shows us.  Merry Christmas Bedford Falls.
