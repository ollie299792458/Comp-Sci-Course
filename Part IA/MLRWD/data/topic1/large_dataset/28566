I wasn't considering buying this DVD when it first came out since I really hadn't had much time to enjoy the Album Falling in Between yet. But my birthday came and gone and since I own all their material and seen them live  three times, I said what the heck? I popped it in the DVD player and turned on my projector and immediately was immersed in this very entertaining experience. Not even knowing which songs were going to be played, I was pleasantly surprised by the older material. There is no doubt in my mind that the musicianship quality shines throughout the entire show and that the bands 80`s POP side is probably never coming back. I enjoyed this too! It is after all, what made this band WORLD WIDE notorious back then. If it wasn't for their hits half of all of their fans wouldn't probably never been driven to them and other bands within the PROGRESSIVE rock spectrum.
Of course a lot of albums have gone by, a lot of the bands members lives have changed and it`s expected that their music will change but the way that they execute these new arrangements is still Flawless. I think Steve, Bobby and Simon are still at the top of their game. Even after more than 30 years. For the rest of the lineup, they are a fine compliment to the band.

In a nut shell, this is another great performance by MY all time favorite band TOTO. A band MADE from EXCELLENT PROGRESSIVE MUSICIANS, w/excellent progressive tunes, FOR progressive thinking music lovers.
