If you think good horror is supposed to be like Friday the 13'th or Saw or Wolf Creek or various other gory / torture-porn movies, then this is not the movie for you.  If on the other hand you like complex plots that are challenging and suspenseful, if you like witnessing a character change in the face of hellish adversity and trying to escape from an awful plight, if you like a movie that makes you THINK, then this is the movie for you.  People who liked The Shining or Memento will like this film.  When I first rented it, I wasn't planning on paying it much attention.  I figured it would be another cheesey Bermuda Triangle film.  I am SO delighted to report that this movie has nothing to do with the Bermuda Triangle.

Instead it is a film with far reaching roots, going back to Greek mythology, and, like Memento, as time passes you see events from different perspectives that suddenly change the context of what you saw earlier in ways that will surprise you.  Ultimately the decisions of the main character become clear, and the ending does this with dark power.

If you are willing to sit and pay attention to this movie, to immerse yourself in it, you will enjoy it.  I recommend it heartily... this is one that you will find your mind returning to long after the film is over.
