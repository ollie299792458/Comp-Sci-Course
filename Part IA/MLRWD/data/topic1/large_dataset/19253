I really like all the Harry Potter movies. I liked the way these movies came in its package and disc cases, just wonderful. The metallic bookmarks are perfect, and the collectible movie cards are nice too. I know, there's people who doesn't like the disc cases because you can't fit them inside those racks they sale and you are stuck to keep'em inside the trunk because the different sizes. I really like this because it feels like a very special way of keeping the movies together and collected. OK now the bad part, I'll talk about the video quality. I bought this over the DVD format because I thought that Blu-ray meant automatically superior sound and video quality but it wasn't the case. I couldn't really notice the difference between DVD and Blu-ray at least in none of the first 4 movies. The Order Of The Phoenix was the ONLY ONE (shakes head) that had a higher quality. I'll recomend that you'll be OK as long as you are a Harry Potter fan or a movie box set collector; go and buy it. But if you are looking for quality, convenience and price, get them individually on DVD and buy your favorite one on blu-ray or just get the DVD format package. I was really dissapointed when I play the first one and I couldn't see the reason for buying a DVD over a Blu-ray, it seemed about the very same. I would also recomend that if you're planning on buying this, watch your favorite movie in the two formats before and then decide.
