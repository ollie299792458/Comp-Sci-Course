So the other night i finished watching Interview with the Vampire - a film i love - and i'm left wondering what happens to Lestat? Well sure i could read the books but, i heard that Interview was faithful to the book in many respects so why shouldn't Queen of the Damned? Faithful to the book or not - reading from other reviews it's not - this movie Sucked . . .pardon the pun.

Stuart Townsed really makes for a poor Tom Cruise, i mean Tommy just carried a cool with him in the role which Stuart lacks but makes up for in . . .(?)

And i must say, the music in this movie is also exceptionally bad, granted it's meant for goths to listen to, but given the highyly unlikley event of a vamprie claiming superstardom, would ever make him bigger than Elvis, i mean honestly let's give the devil his due. Boring medicore thumping and growling, the only relief we have from this musically is Lestat going crazy on a fiddle, which in my opinion is what he should have whipped out on stage rather than his bandmates.

Like i said i didn't read the book, yet, but, from watching Interview you can see the large discrepncies in the scripts. In Interview lestat states "My Maker taught me nothing." Where as here we have a reltaionship between maker and made almost trying to mirror the relationship between Lestat and Louis as in Interview, poorly made if i do say so myself. The worst job done by anyone in this film though is given credit to soley Aliyah. I mean she's dead and we're supposed to play nice et all, but come on i've seen better acting from muppets.

All in all this movie is bad. Bad,bad,bad,bad, i've seen school productions of My Fair Lady that blow this hunk of **** clear outta the water.

Watch Interview, and take comfort in the knowledge that that's about as good as it's gonna get.
