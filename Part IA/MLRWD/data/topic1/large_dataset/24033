I've never been drawn to see a Will Ferrell movie.  I find his humor sophomoric and mildly entertaining with the exception of a few characters on SNL.  With that being said, I have to say from the moment I saw the trailer I've been itching to see it.  Since I'm not a big movie goer I waited for the DVD.  I figured that this is one that I would like to see for the first time at home with the kids around me, the lights out, the Christmas decorations blazing and eating goodies.  My patience paid off...I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!  I can't think of a better way to watch it.

 This movie has such heart.  Baby boomers will appreciate the late 50's early 60's Rudolf era feel in the music and even in the beginning credits. I didn't know that Will Ferrell had it in him to actually TAKE the viewer on a journey so you can genuinely feel his character's excitement
(ie  SANTA!!!! "OOOOHH, MMMYYYY GOD!!!!......I know him, I know him.")  His wild-eyed innocence reminds me of Tom Hank's performance in Big. (They say that comedians make the best actors because of their acting range)  His acting was wonderful and see if you can go 5 minutes between laughs from beginning to end.  Between the "Attack of the Dwarf" and Buddy trying to put the star on the tree, I almost lost my mind laughing. This is a must see!!!

Remember anyone expecting to see a "Will Ferrell Movie" might be dissappointed.  Just think like a child and watch the movie through those eyes.  With that in mind you'll like it as much as I do!!!
