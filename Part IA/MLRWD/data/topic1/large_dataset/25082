Just reading the plot of this movie, you might skip over it.  But you would be making a big mistake.  It's actually an Elvis redemption story that talks about the human condition.  It's about two elderly gentlemen, "Elvis" and a black "John F. Kenney" who are left to die in a nursing home, losing meaning in their lives. A war hero dies next to "Elvis" by a few coughs.  It's a place of no hope because its inhabitants are just waiting for their final journey. The outside world has shunned these "elderly."  They are just "OLD" and really serve no purpose. They serve no purpose because they are given no purpose.  An evil mummy quickens their journey to the "final adventure."  And the only two residents who will not just "die" are "Elvis" and "JFK".  They have found their meaning, even in old age.

Really, folks.  This movie is funny, with some awesome understated overtones.  And this is one of the last films that the great and wonderful Ossie Davis can be seen in. God bless his soul.  Bruce Campbell does an amazing job, portraying Elvis. I can't wait for a sequel.
