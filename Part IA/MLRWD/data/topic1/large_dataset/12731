I bought this for my husband for Christmas, since he's had it on his "wish list" for a long while.  I wasn't sure which edition to pick up, since there are multiples, but I know that he's a big movie buff -- wants the "bells and whistles" version with commentaries, associated documentaries, special features galore, and so forth.  When it arrived and he opened it, he was ecstatic, because this edition has all of those included.

Henry Lee Lucas is one of the lesser-known serial killers in the US, and anyone who's interested in true crime stories, serial killers, or simply likes dramatic horror, this is a good choice.  Plenty of explanation about him in the movie as character narrative without getting boring, and doesn't drag out more than we want to know.  It's a good glimpse into a chunk of his life, and truly shows who he and his associates were.

The movie itself is a little rough, visually, but most movies made in the '70s fall into that category.  Considering the era, the special effects are phenomenal, with the victims showing just enough blood to be a mild shock, but not so much that it becomes almost ridiculous gore (as some movies go with).

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this version over a lesser single-disc version, simply because it goes into the story behind the story for those who are interested in getting "the full story" or those who've never heard of Henry Lee Lucas before and wonder who he was.
