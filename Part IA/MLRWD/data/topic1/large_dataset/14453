I have a thing for foreign horror movies, I admit it. I get so disgusted by the lack of true horror and originality of the American films, that I actively search out foreign films. I have seen many very entertaining movies as a result and would like to pass on my reviews of them so that more people may enjoy and appreciate them. Once such gem is Dead Snow. This is a Norwegian zombie horror/comedy film that was released in 2009. Zombies, you say? Zombies have been done to death, right? Wrong! The genius of this movie is that it combines zombies and Nazis.

The film starts out with a group of young folks arriving at a cabin near Oksfjord for some fun and relaxation. Right away, they realize that one of their number, Sarah, is missing and not yet at the cabin as arranged. The group decides to continue on to the cabin and wait for her to show up. Later that night a strange old man shows up and tells them a very odd local story involving an invasion of World War II Nazis and stolen gold. He goes on to say that the locals formed an uprising and killed many of the Nazis, while others, including the leader, Herzog froze to death somewhere in the mountains.

The next morning, Sara's boyfriend Vegard decides to take the snowmobile and go look for Sara. Instead he finds a tent with the mutilated body of the old man. What follows is a horror/comedy delight of zombie Nazis, chainsaws, axes, and murder with a deadly snowmobile. This film is the closest thing I have seen to Evil Dead. It's at times gory, entertaining and even has some funny American pop culture references.

I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone that likes movies such as Evil Dead, Dead and Breakfast, Dead Alive, Night of the Demons, Cabin Fever and Slither. Dead Snow is subtitled but don't let that scare you. If you are reading this, then you can surely watch this movie and read the subtitles!
