If you are a fan of time-travel movies, you will love - or at least like - " Timeline".  It is very enjoyable for many reasons.  One is the immense contrast of the medieval world with the modern one.  We have an exact date in the middle ages.....1357.  We grasp the huge difference between the two ages when, at the end, some of the characters return to the present -- only a few hunded years later!

Gerard Butler as Marek is dashing, loyal and and virtuous.  Anna Friel as Lady Claire is a delight, managing to be both very feminine and feisty.  We actually feel that she doesn't belong in the modern world, that she truly is from this past time.  Their romance, handled with great delicacy, is totally charming.  The combination of romance and action make it a fine date movie.

The cinematographer is Caleb Deschanel -- the man responsible for the beauty in such films as "National Treasure," "The Natural, " The Right Stuff," and "The Black Stallion." Both the costumes and the sets are very accurate for the times, and the special effects never jar you out of the movie.

Richard Donner's direction brings coherence to a movie that, because it jumps up and back from 1357 to modern times, could easily be confusing. Donner also directed "Ladyhawke", another movie with a very good feel for life in the middle ages.

Donner's other films show his mastery of action scenes, including: "Superman" and "Superman II" (uncredited), the entire Lethal Weapon series, as well as "Conspiracy Theory."  Donner at long last received an academy award in 2000 for Outstanding Achievement in Directing.

Yes, you need to suspend disbelief; it is a fantasy!  The "science"  is fantasy science; some of the history is true, but many of the historical details are pure fiction.  And it is a movie, not a book, and better judged on its merit as a movie.  If you can do that, you will want to watch this movie again and again.
