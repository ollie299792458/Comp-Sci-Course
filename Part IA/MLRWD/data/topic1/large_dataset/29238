By some way of luck, this film opened, in my region, in Dubai, UAE this weekend, on Tuesday night, 3 days before the wide release in the US.

I saw the film. It was undoubtedly one of the best movies of it's genre. The issue at stake here is world democracy, peace, and the film handles then very well. Nicole Kidman, gave an excellent performance, and so did Sean Penn. The film is not what you may expect. It is not about a woman who tells the truth and no one beleives her, yada yada yada. This film suceeded in doing what other films of the same genre failed- in unveling the story in layers and coming to a conclusion in the end. The film didn't have any plotholes, stupid twist at the end, but was a masterful work of art.

Sydney Pollack was excellent here, and of course James Newton Howard provided a powerful and haunting score.

I loved the film, and this film is the best film of the year so far, so I hope this film suceeds at the box office and is liked by everyone
