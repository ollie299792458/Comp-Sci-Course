I got to see the sneak preview of this movie this past Saturday (6/12/04) and I absolutely loved it.  I've seen Ryan Gosling on television before (Breaker High), but I hadn't seen Rachel McAdams until now.  Their characters were so real and so believable.  Even though the end may be predictable, this film lacks the typical structure of most romantic movies I've seen.  It was interesting to see how the characters evolved and came together.  
The film begins with James Garner reading pages out of a notebook to alzheimer(?) patient Gena Rowlands.  As the story unfolds, we meet Allie and Noah.  Allie comes from a wealthy Southern family.  Noah works in the lumber yard.  We see their joys as well as their struggles.  Though they seem like complete opposites, they fall in love only to be torn apart when Noah leaves for World War 2 and Allie becomes engaged to another man. 
I won't spoil the ending, but the two lovers reunite and Allie is faced with the decision of whether to keep her promise to her fiance or to go back to the man she left behind.
