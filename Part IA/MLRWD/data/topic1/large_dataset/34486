This is my favorite movie of all time.  It is absolutely wonderful, both hilarious and touching.  Hoffman's performance is first rate.  He plays Ben, a repressed virginal character who is worried about his future.  He  has no idea who he is, what he wants, what he is going to do.  Anne  Bancroft plays Mrs. Robinson, a friend of Ben's parents who is cooly  determined to seduce Ben.
Subtle symbolism pervades the movie.  Ben is  drowning, and the director often shoots him in water, or looking through  water.  For example, Ben's parents buy him a scuba suit for his birthday.  They force him into the swimming pool, and push him back in when he tries  to climb out.  Mrs. Robinson wears animal skins and leopard prints,  suggesting blood thirst.  Mr. Robinson has one word for Ben, one word for  what his future is all about:  "Plastics."
Desperate to feel  something, Ben falls passionately for Ali MacGraw's character, the daughter  of the Robinsons.  She is engaged to be married to someone else.  Ben is  determined to woo her.  
The Simon and Garfunkle soundtrack is flawless,  many of the songs written specifically for this movie.  Brilliant writing,  brilliant direction.  The finest American movie ever made.  Hilarious.  A  must see.
