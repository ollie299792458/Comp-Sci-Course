Surprisingly excellent movie.  Not your basic ghost thriller.  I would have rated it 5 stars except I never got to know any of the characters well enough to really care what happened to them, one way or another.

Bottom line: Creepy enough to give you the willies, twisted enough to keep you interested and well executed enough to keep you from getting annoyed with cheesy sets, off character wardrobes and low grade CG.

The absolutely stunning scenery almost completely eliminates the need for CG.  Which is minimal and fairly well done. Sorry, but nobody will never beat the Americans on CG [except maybe the Japanese].

Demi's acting lacks depth as usual but don't be put off; the supporting cast is brilliant and picks right up for her.  Just enough mystery to keep you wondering till the finale, but not over the top on any account.  This is a movie with a twisted plot that won't leave you frustrated with obvious paradoxical contradictions; nothing is done or shown that absolutely forbids how the plot plays out.
