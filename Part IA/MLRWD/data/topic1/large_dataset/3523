I just wanted to add my thoughts about what really makes this movie so deep down enjoyable.  While all the other reviewers have praised it as simple entertainment, not burdened with heavy messages, I found something underneath all the great comedy, action, characters and scenery that I think also contributes a lot to the film's appeal.  There is a wonderful juxtaposition (yes I remember this word from my English lit classes lo these many years ago!) between the old and new worlds, between the traditional, homogeneous China, with its rigid rules and disciplined approach to life, and the new world of the American West, with its melting pot of cultures, its emphasis on individual freedom and all the possibilities AND problems that go with it.  The self-centered, sensitive, new-age cowboy Roy O'Bannon may have the answer that frees Chon Wang from his years of unquestioning servitude ("the sun may rise in the East but it sets here.." a perfect trite-but- true O'Bannon-ism! ), but he still can't hit the side of a barn with his six-shooter.  To me, this movie showed both characters learning from each other exactly what their worlds lacked:  Chon Wang found the individual freedom and self-determination that opened the door to his dreams (Princess Pei Pei) and Roy O'Bannon found honor and courage and responsibility.  This movie speaks to us about problems that remain in America even today, where many people expect everything to be easy and fast, and where freedom is mistaken for entitlement.  Freedom (the new world) must be joined with discipline and integrity (the old world) for a human being to reach her/his full potential.  This movie lets you share in the achievement as Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon make their way farther along their paths.  While I laughed through the whole movie, I cared because of this human story.  It's not Pulitzer Prize material, but it makes the movie more than just the jokes.
