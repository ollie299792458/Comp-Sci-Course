I really enjoyed this movie.  Hal was a total boob, but he was kind and likable even when he was drooling over gorgeous women.  There were several scenes that I thought were quite funny, in particular his "pink eye" where he uses vaseline to cover his eyes so he won't see Rosemary!  This movie seemed to cause a backlash from individuals who did not think 'fat' jokes were funny.  I don't think the movie was making fun of fat people, but giving a much deeper message that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder.  I think a comedic movie to portray these messages makes it fun.  I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I found it quite enjoyable and plan to purchase a copy for my home collection.
On a character note, Jason Alexander is good, but very much like his George role from Seinfeld, so no new sides to his acting here, but his character fits the movie, so I enjoyed him too.
Gwyneth did a fine job as Rosemary, pretty and beautiful, even in her 'fat suit'.  Overall, a fun movie, worth 4 stars.
