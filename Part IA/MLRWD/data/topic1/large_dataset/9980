This movie beats out the growing pack of disaster movies, for a number of reasons:
The inevitable concentration on the problems of individuals caught up in the growing disaster here focuses on people centrally related  to the discovery of the comet. They are IN the story for good  reasons.
The threat is real, and to a degree cannot be dodged. A comet is  coming, we cannot stop it, it arrives, and it does a lot of harm, and some  of the central characters perish, while others survive.
There is a  minimum of gooey treacle. The characters generally behave with a certain  nobility--just as we might hope to behave in similar extreme circumstances.  Sentimentality is generally avoided.
The plot is complete, the behavior  rational, and nothing of importance is dropped from the exposition. The  film is balanced, and we are not left with rip-roaring inconsistencies and  problems at the end.
But finally, it is a GOOD movie: entertaining,  fascinating, satisfying, disturbing, horrifying, fulfilling, and interwoven  with a satisfying amount of humor.
If disaster strikes us in real time, I  only hope we are in hands as good as these.
