Firstly, this is the film version of James Ellroy's Black Dahlia novel. It is not a novel that was immensely fact-based. The Black Dahlia Murder Case seems to have been an influence and an inspiration for the book, but will not offer up any insights for those of use who are avid readers/watchers of everything Black Dahlia. Nevertheless, it is worth a look, just because of the subject it was influenced by.

I didn't get an overwhelming sense of the era from this movie though. I like to wach a period piece that is steeped in the aura and feel of the time, like you get from watching 'Mrs. Parker & the Vicious Circle' set in the 1920s.

The cast is decent and the characters are well acted. The script is good. The one overpowering downer about the whole film was two of the female characters Kay Lake (played by Scarlett Johansson) and Elizabeth Short (played by Mia Kirshner.) I found both of them a little annoying.

This film, just as a murder mystery / detective movie is a fairly good one.
