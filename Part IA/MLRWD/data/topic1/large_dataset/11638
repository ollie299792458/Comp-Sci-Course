This movie is one about coming of age through change.  It follows three main characters:  a young writer for Rolling Stone, the leader of a Led Zeppelin-like band in the 70's, and a beautiful groupie.
Each person is faced with intense highs and terrible tragedies at the hands of the others throughout the story.  The strength of the movie is that, instead of shoehorning the characters into roles and making them tragic heroes, it instead makes the events change them.  By the end, it's the Rock hero that looks up to the writer, the suicidal groupie that mothers the other two into an understanding, and the aspiring writer who fails at writing but still finds his dream.
A huge part of the movie is probably the soundtrack, a collection of original works and the best soaring rock of the 1970's.
Excellent movie.  Even when it falls into the trap of being saccharine, it at least avoids seeming contrived.  I would recommend it to any nostalgic baby boomer, confused teenager, or wild gen-Xer.
