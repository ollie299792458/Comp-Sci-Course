Let me begin by saying that "Goonies" is by far one of the best movie of all time. It is appealing to all generations. It is every kids dream to break away from their parents and pursue their dreams, however far fetched.  Every young boy dreams of running away, fighting pirates and being the hero. This movie has it all.  It shows life from the view of a normal kid having the courage to do what all kids wish they could.  In the midst of murders and hidden treasure when all the kids get scared and what to go home, Mikey (Sean Austin) reminds them that "this is our time, down here, no parents...,". The Goonies will be popular for generations to come.  Although the plot is a complete fantasy, there is a lesson to be learned.  It teaches kids to follow their dreams and do what they know in their hearts is the right thing.  It also teaches parents that just because kids are young and inexperienced, doesn't mean what they have to say isn't important.  Adults sometimes have a hard time admitting that their kids may be right and they may be wrong.  I won't tell what happens in the end, but if you haven't seen it, it's a must!!
