I rented this movie in hopes that it would deliver something other than the predicitable outcomes.  Where I came up with that idea I do not know.  For starters it has Nicholas Cage in it and his last several films have been less than stellar.  He is one of the most deadpan actors I have seen. He brought that dead character he always plays to this film with him.  Strike one against the film.  Ok to start the movie the language in several areas of the film were "modern speak."  Which threw the movie off. I did not expect old English, but modern speak is just as bad. Strike two against the film.  And in typical fashion the "witch" was a girl around 18-23 which the characters (which were all male) felt sorry for.  Really?? Is there nothing new that can be written, but a bunch of older men taking a young woman to prison and feeling so sorry for her so they want to "save her".  Strike three this movie is out!  I am not going to ruin the ending, but it was predictable and such a let down.
Overall, I would not recommend this film to anyone unless they absolutely just were dying to see it. Not a horrible film, but you will never get that two hours of your life back!
