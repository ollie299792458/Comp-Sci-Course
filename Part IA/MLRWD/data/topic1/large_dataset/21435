Surely one of the top 10 "boozer" movies of all time. Paul Newman plays the lush/lawyer. Jack Warden is Newman's law school teacher and collaborator in their Woodward and Bernstein-style assault against the medical establishment. James Mason plays an Irish-American attorney, leading the green-shoe law firm (replacing the white-shoe Yankee version) that defends the Archdiocese of Boston and the doctors who botched a woman's surgery.
It's eerie to watch a 1982 movie dealing with a lawsuit against the Archdiocese of Boston knowing that the Roman Church was covering for pedophile priests during the period the movie was set. This 2007 viewer was half-expecting Newman and Warden to come across the pedophilia.
I was amused at not hearing much in the way of Boston accents from most of the movie's actors. Perhaps an oversight. Perhaps accents disappear at high levels of the legal and medical professions.
"The Verdict" is a great primer on how to deal with betrayal and loss of idealism. Newman, in a riveting performance, follows the dictum of the great philospher/economist Ludwig von Mises -- "Don't give it to the evil but proceed ever stronger against it." Neocons reading this should not take this sentiment as an endorsement for attacking any country or person that talks bad about America and Israel.
