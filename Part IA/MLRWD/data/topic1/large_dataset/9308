Requiem For A Dream is not for the faint of heart. If you buy this movie thinking you're getting just some conventional, nonchalant film, you are sorely mistaken. Never before have I seen a film that displays the deterioration of people's lives as a result of substance abuse so realistically before.
The story of the film follows four characters: Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), and Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans). Harry and Tyrone are heroin addicts who want to get into dealing to make some real money. The reason Harry wants to make money is to help his girlfriend, Marion, open a store where she can sell her fashion designs. Sara Goldfarb is Harry's mother. She gets a call one day to invite her to be a contestant on a TV show. She is old and out of shape and decides to go on a diet to fit in her favorite red dress to wear on her big day. The diet is futile because she can't handle not indulging herself in the foods she used to eat. So she sees a dieting specialist who gives her diet pills (methamphetamines). At first she loves them and loses a lot of weight, but as time goes on she builds a tolerance and begins taking double, and even triple doses...
To be frank, Requiem For A Dream is an assault on you. After you've watched it you feel both mentally and physically drained, much like the characters in the film. Viewing the deaths of these people's dreams is a trying experience, but honestly, it teaches you the true horrors of substance addiction.
To me, a powerful film is one that can alter your view on things and change the way you act. Requiem For A Dream affected me in that way and I honestly believe if more people viewed this film it would greatly decrease the likelihood for experimentation with drugs.
