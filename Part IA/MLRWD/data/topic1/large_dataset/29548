See also McMurtry's book of the same title. The film is exceptionally faithful to the book. But see the movie first, because Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones fit the two main characters perfectly: you'll hear their voices as you read the book (warning to Germans: don't buy a dubbed version of the film!). No one can write about Texas like McMurtry, and no actor can play a Texan like Duvall! What's it about:? The short transition period from the time of the outlaws (the lawmen were also outlaws now and then, as is portrayed in the film) and Indians, and the transition to the boring money-civilization of banks, shopkeeping, and corporate ranching. In this connection, see also the oral histories collected in the fine book 'In Their Own words'. My Geman wife hates kitch, smells it a mile a way, and loves both Lonesome Dove and The Evangelist, both played by Duvall. She also loves West Texas but hates the fences there. There's much more freedom of motion in Europe than in the fenced-in U.S. In Europe, you can walk across a farmer's land without asking permission, whereas in Texas you shouldn't.
