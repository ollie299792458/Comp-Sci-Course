This fine film is a great addition to the world of DVD, and it IS IN BLACK AND WHITE, NOT COLOR, as Amazon has it listed. I just received my copy from Amazon yesterday and to my surprise and relief it was in B&amp;W original format. The 5 minute commentary by Jimmy Stewart in 1990 with video montage is a nice addition as well. The picture quality on the DVD is good, and of course, the movie is wonderful. I won't go on about the story line, as many other good reviews have already documented that aspect, but I would like to state that Harvey is definitely 6 foot 3 1/2 inches, as I just finished the movie less than 24 hours ago ("lets' just stick to the facts, now" !), although Stewart indicates that he felt he must have been 6'8" since he had to look up to him. Jimmy Stewart's subtle, thoughtful performance gives a surreal quality to a film that feels mostly like a well done stage play, but has an edge to it that is hard to describe and should be experienced by any movie lover or person interested in thinking about life, familiy, and one's view of reality. A must for the DVD collection.
