I will try and keep this short. If you liked the introduction of Eric Blade in the first film then you will probably like this. I think it is a good film but by no means a better film than the first. On the plus side the DVD is loaded. It has got all you expect to see on a successful box office film DVD. What is very evident from watching the DVD is that they had more money to spend this time and I think that some of it was well spent. I am very impressed by the special effects (most of the time).  But the special effects were over used and one bit did really spoil it for me. When it comes pretty obvious that a scene is computer generated or is actually a stunt man it spoils it for me. However what really lets this film down is the weak story. Vampire films are pretty much predictable. We all know the main premise, we all know how to kill them and so on. The story could have been a lot better if the characters were developed more. The cast gave excellent performances with the material given to them.  But you can't help but feel that the characters could be developed even more. 
A major downer for me however, was the commentary on the DVD's. All I will say is that some of the language used was frankly vulgar and rude. It did not strike me as having the professional touch. Even though it was not as good as its predecessor, it definitely is worth a watching and (having for us Blade fans). Wesley Snipes is perfect as the dark avenger. Lots of action and lots of horror to satisfy all.
