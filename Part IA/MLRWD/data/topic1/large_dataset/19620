This is perhaps Boris Karloff's finest performance.  His resurrected Imhotep is tall &amp; cadaverously thin.  He moves with a carefully stilted walk, as if any misstep would cause his ancient bones to crack and crumble him to the ground.  The finely wrinkled face is still and impassive, the lips barely moving as he speaks in a papery thin whisper of his yearning for his long ago lost love, for whom he has sacrificed everything.  But the eyes burn in that masklike face, the same eyes that stared at us in mute terror at his living entombment.
This is great stuff!  Highly romantic with a marvelous mood and atmosphere, this is a Mummy with class.  The movie has great moments such as the above-mentioned living burial and that unforgettable stare of terror, the insane cackle of the unsuspecting perpetrator of Imhotep's resurrection, Karloff &amp; Johann staring into the pool, and so on.  And, in Zita Johann, Karloff has a beautiful, exotic woman worth loving across centuries.
This is The Mummy for grownups.  The Brendan Fraser version is more for the kids, which is perfectly okay. It's about noise and action.  This Mummy is about subtlety, mood, and eternal desire, and it is a quiet Classic.
