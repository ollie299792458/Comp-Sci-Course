This film is a cat's cradle of relationships in which some strings touch and others don't. Jeanne Moreau's Florence is never seen with her lover Julien, played by Maurice Ronet, except in photographs at the very end. A German couple on holiday crosses paths with two reckless teenage lovers and end up dead. Although this film, directed by a 24-year-old Louis Malle, is generally considered a precursor to the French New Wave, it has all the elements, in particular a mysterious, emotionally tortured femme fatale played with quiet elegance by Jeanne Moreau. Her penetrating eyes are haunting as she walks through the rain searching for her lover. She has one of those faces you either adore or are annoyed by. I go back and forth myself. But my own opinion of this film is that Malle was showing off his tremendous talent just a bit too much and it comes across sometimes that he's trying too hard to be cool. But most of the time his film really is cool. And it's nice to be reminded how cool a film can be.
