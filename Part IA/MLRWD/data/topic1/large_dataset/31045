"Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins" is an action/comedy with meager helpings of action and comedy. It is not very funny, and there isn't a whole lot of action. There is some excellent stuntwork - particularly the scene where Remo has to dodge cars on a Ferris wheel - but not much else to recommend it.

The movie fails to strike a balance between action and comedy. This works in Arnold Schwartzenegger's movies, which are first and foremost action pictures with little quips thrown in for levity. It doesn't work here because the movie can't decide what it wants to be. Half of the movie is slapstick comedy, while the other half is action oriented.

After a goofy apprenticeship with an Oriental martial arts instructor, Remo goes after a corrupt military official in some very tepid action scenes. They're not all bad - there is one exciting scene where he escapes from some Doberman Pinschers. But thrilling scenes are sparse in Remo Williams. Chuck Norris movies, as bad as they were, delivered more action, with more pizazz, than this movie.

It is hard to see what audience this was made for. It's not an "edge-of-your-seat, white-knuckle thrill-ride" of the sort Stallone and Schwartzenegger routinely starred in. It's even worse as a comedy. Had a sequel been made, I'm quite sure these flaws would have been addressed. They are so obvious.
