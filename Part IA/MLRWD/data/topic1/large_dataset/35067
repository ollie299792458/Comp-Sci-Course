I'm not only saddened by some of the negative comments regarding this movie, I'm also somewhat disturbed. I won't put this film on a pedestal claiming it's the best film to come out the same year but it's hardly the trash some reviews have chalked it up as. Amazon compared it to Moulin Rouge, WTF!? Underneath this visually stunning film is a great story that comes off as intelligent, emotional and chock full of dark gritty drama. Some just couldn't see past the visuals or the girls and the outfits they wear or were probably disappointed because they expected more skin. Snyder's work is somewhat underrated in that he doesn't get enough credit for placing a fantastically laid-out film in the middle of his visual wizardry; the death scene of Leonidas in 300 is a perfect example of this. In Sucker Punch, the scene where the girls are confronted by Blue Jones because he's figured out their plan is utter brilliance in the structure of the movie, the performances and how it was placed on screen. This movie isn't for anyone and in an sense making a film like this is a new direction for the industry, visual effects that aren't sterile, included for vanity or overshadow the actual movie. Sucker Punch is the kind of film that brings a smile to my face in view of all the other pointless garbage Hollywood drones out. One of my friends was proud to take her daughters to see this and they all loved it claiming it to be the ultimate "girl power" movie showing girls they can rise up from anything. If you could see the intelligence and artistry laid out in 300 or The Watchmen then absolutely watch this movie. If you don't like it, Hollywood made three Transformers films instead.
