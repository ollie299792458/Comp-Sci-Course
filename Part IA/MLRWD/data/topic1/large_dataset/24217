Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory belongs in the ranks of surreal film which includes The Wizard of Oz and An American in Paris.  Perhaps it is something about the musical genre which thus frees the mind.  One of the  more memorable films from my youth (the Oompa Loompas haunted my dreams),  having viewed it again I now see a tremendous amount of social commentary,  some of which is laughably dated (as are certain of the special effects).  Gene Wilder's performance is absolutely top notch, and one of the main  reasons to see the film; his oscillation between mania and dry indifference  proves how he intimately knows "the land of pure  imagination".
As for DVD details, the little bonus items (film  details, cast bios, a bit about Roald Dahl's book) are of the standard  variety, more like sprinkles atop a Wonka cupcake - you will appreciate  them as eye candy, but they are not really satisfying.  The film transfer  is good, the colors being quite vivid.  As for the remix of the soundtrack  into 5.1, prepare for a little disappointment.  While the sound itself is  crisp, the subwoofer and rear channels were not really utilized to any  significant degree.
