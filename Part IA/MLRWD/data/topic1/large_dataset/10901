Not really a movie about Bobby Fischer, but rather the drive in the chess community to find the next prodigy who will take the Chess world by storm.

Bobby Fischer began to play chess at the age of 7.  His meteoric rise to winning the national Championship in his early teens and then going on to defeat the World, is the Highlight of US Chess History.

Chess, like Soccer, is much bigger in the rest of the world than it is in the US.  Fischer caused a blip in the radar screen that elevated Chess in the US.  The Chess community has since then been on the look-out for the next prodigy in hopes of repeating the same event.

That's really not the main thrust of the movie, however.  It creates the context in which the relationship between Josh and his Father is explored.  In that regard, the movie is superior and excels.

Bobby Fischer represents the megelomaniac for whom Chess is everything to the exclusion of family, friends and relationships.  (That's really a pretty accurate picture of Fischer the man, by the way.)  Josh rejects that path and chooses instead to retain his humanity, and tender conscience, despite the forces battling for him and his future.

A Father who is tempted to live vicariously through his son's gift is all too common and present in sports and other areas as well.  A coach, who has his own ghosts and demons and recognizes the potential in Josh, who is unable to release him, for fear that he will leave the path of greatness.  Vinnie, the park speed chess player who represents the joy and fun of chess and rails against the establishment who wants to suck the life out of Josh to be their messiah.

It's all there.  The chess provides the back-drop to it all.

Many who have shied away from this movie imagining it to be a dull movie about Chess will be pleasantly surprised when they see it.

Simply an outstanding film and well worth viewing, even if you don't know a bishop from a pawn!
