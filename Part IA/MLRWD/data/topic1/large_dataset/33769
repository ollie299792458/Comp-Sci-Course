I just got done watching this movie. It was okay, but I don't think I have a need to see it again. I would let others borrow it though. A weak terrorized woman, who's battered by her coward husband, decides to become super woman in an event that she would never forget. After leaving a nasty note to a parking lot hog, she gets terrorized by a group of young punks, who think they own the world (so true for this day and age). It's funny how they used one black, one hispanic, one asian, and one white guy to play the parts of the young punks. I guess that way not one race can blame the other for stereo-typing. Anyway, armed with her tool box, she runs for the woods where she thinks it's safe to hide. Because this is a new neighborhood, and new homes are still in the process of being built, no one is heard while making loud noises in the woods. The killings are really predictable, and so was the cell phone dying, I mean, come on. I don't understand why she never stood up to her violent husband, but she could easily take on four men. It ended kind of weird, I mean what made her think she could get away with all that, and still keep her kids in the end without doing some time in prison? The plot sucked, but it had good acting by Kim Bassinger, and Lukas Haas. I think I liked the movie "Cellular" that Kim Bassinger played in better, that one I could see again, and still like it. I believe what kept her going was the thought of leaving her twins behind with her jerk of a husband , so that gave her character "Della", that extra boost to make it home to them again.
