A Comedy movie has a very hard job at trying to be credible. Most comedy movies, compared to drama movies and some action movies, have a very hard time having developed storylines and truly inspired acting and such.  The 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN, however, is able to escape the traps that many comedies fall into.  It is both funny and credible enough to actually not just be a good comedy movie, but also be a strong movie period.

Again, maybe the concept of the storyline is a bit absurd, the fact that the man is a "40" year old virgin, but it is definitely not unheard of or as nearly absurd as the concept of THE WEDDING CRASHERS.  The Basic storyline is that this 40 year old works at a store called Smart Tech and his colleagues who've previously disassociated with him, decide to invite him to play a game of cards with them.  At their game, they all discuss there relationship and sexual experiences.  Steve Careel (who plays the 40 year old virgin), fall short in this area and makes obvious the fact that he is a virgin at the age of 40. His colleagues at work then decide to teach and aid Carell in losing his virginity.  The advice often lands Carell in a number of uncomfortable bad situations.  However, not to give away the rest of the story, Carell ultimately loses his virginity at the end of the movie (big surprise right?).

I highly recommend this movie.  This is moreso a movie for twentysomethings or young adults, especially toward a male audience.  That isn't to say others wouldn't enjoy it, but it is aimed more that spectrum than any other.  Well done. 4 stars.
