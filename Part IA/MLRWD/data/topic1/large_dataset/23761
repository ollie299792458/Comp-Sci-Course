Because there are so many different versions of this film available, and Amazon does not differentiate the reviews - it should be known that I purchased the Criterion Collection version of "Charade".

If you're going to add this film to your collection - and why wouldn't you - do yourself a favor and spend the extra money, but be sure to buy the Criterion Collection version of the film.  The transfer to DVD is beautiful, taken from an original 35mm print - unlike some of the cheap versions of this DVD that are out there.  The sound has been re-mastered and engineered, bringing it to a crisp, perfect audio.

And then there is the film itself ... WOW !  Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn - it doesn't get better than that.  This film is often referred to as the best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock didn't make, and it is true.  Producer/Director Stanley Donnen creates a level of intrigue and suspense that is purely Hitchcockian.

If you love these old classic films, do yourself a favor and buy this one.  But, make sure to get The Criterion Collection version.  It really is worth it to spend the few extra dollars.

Enjoy !
