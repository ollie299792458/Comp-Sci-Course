I'm thoroughly convinced Stanley Kramer had absolutely NO SENSE OF HUMOR WHAT SO EVER! What other reason would the director of heavy dramas want to gather all the most brilliant innovative comedy geniuses the world has ever known, and put them in a 3 hour film, and not allow them to IMPROVISE AT ALL! What follows is a LONG LONG movie with not many funny things in it, and lots of prat falls and gags from people who were strictly verbal comics. The ultimate insult was forcing the greatest comedians of all time to force laughter at someone slipping on a banana peel, a gag many of them would have slit their wrists rather than even been in the same room with such a pedestrian gag, even to be "ironic".

In interviews with Kramer, he clearly stated he didn't trust comics such as Jonathan Winters who would rip apart any lines he was given, so he made EVERYONE stick to the script verbatim. This is one of the most hateful crimes in modern cinema, I'd rank it with the butchering Magnificent Andersons.
