Swan Lake is one of my favorite ballets, so when they started running trailers for this movie, I knew I had to see it. I read the reviews so I was somewhat aware of what I was getting into when I went to see the movie. I wasn't a big fan of Portman before seeing this movie, but her roll in Black Swan allowed me to see a different side of her. Knowing the kind of rolls she usually portrays, this part was fitting yet a step outside of the norm as you watch her character begin to detach from reality and descend into insanity.

Barbara Hershey is the ballet mother from hell as she slowly loses her control over her once shy, demure and obedient daughter. Mila Kunis' roll is a free spirit who inadvertely aids Nina (Portman) in her spiral into insanity. Vincent Cassel plays the artistic director you want to hate as he encourages Nina to get in touch with her sexuality and lose herself. There is nothing but off the chart acting in this movie. Black Swan pitches back and forth between reality and madness, leaving one wondering what's real and what's not. And that's exactly where Nina is, as she taps into a side of her psyche to play the roll of her life: the White swan... and the Black swan; good versus evil. Innocence and purity versus temptation and seduction.
