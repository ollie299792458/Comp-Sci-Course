Oh my, what can one say about Manos. This film is garbage and it flaunts it putridity frequently and without mercy. The MST3K gang however have a knack for turning poo to gold and they do so again with what may be the biggest stinker they ever took on.
So what's so bad about the movie? Talk about a loaded question. Well okay, first it looks bad. It was filmed with one camera that could only shoot for 30 seconds at a time. This leads to many awkward cut scenes. It also sounds bad. The camera apparently couldn't pick up sound so every line is dubbed. A couple people sound like they have the same voice. It's directed poorly. A trip through the country turns into an epic trek that seems to reach no end. Joel and the bots stare at the screen and mutter "Manos.....the Hands of Fate" and that is all that needs to be said.
Finally it's stupid. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but unless you're afraid of women in nightgowns, a street magician with hands painted on his cape, or a pervert with a speech impediment who has basketballs for knees, it doesn't particularly work. 
But the MST3K guys really had me cracking up out loud. Seriously, I could barely breath at a few spots I was laughing so hard. You need to know that people who aren't use to this kind of humor may be weirded out just because of the nature of the Manos film. Better to start with something like Mitchell or Eegah. However, if you like the MST3K brand of humor, than you have to get this. Trust me!
