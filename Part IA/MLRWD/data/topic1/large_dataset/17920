When I rate this video as 5 stars, please understand that what I consider a "good" movie varies depending on the effect intended.  In this case, I respect this movie as being the creepiest movie I have ever seen.  It's not gory and only brushes the edge of disturbing, but I find it surrealistically creepy in a way that transcends every other film I've laid eyes on.  I intend to watch it again, much like I intend to watch "A Clockwork Orange" and "Donnie Darko" and "Pan's Labyrinth" again sometime in the future.  I wouldn't pull this movie out for just something to see on a slow night, but I would show this movie to any of my friends who are into weird / horror / thriller or suspense movies.  Stop-motion is brought to the heights of its art in this film by using the medium to be intentionally jarring rather than trying to imitate life.  I believe Alice's spoken sequences were similarly intended to be jarring, which succeeds admirably.

Do I like it?  That's a hard question to answer, but I do appreciate the bizarre, or any movie that makes you think (or just look from a different angle).  If you are part of the 1% who enjoys stretching your limits then you may find this sublimely creepy work to be right up your alley.  If you were looking for happy colorful children's films, then this just ain't the one for you.
