Actually, I like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.  So much more my disappointment with this movie. The dialog tries to be snappy but came off to me as forced.  And the acting, well, both stars seemed to walk through their parts.  Jolie as Mrs. Smith just gives us her Laura Croft character and where, oh where, is that over the top acting the Brad Pitt does so well?  Both actors needed to crank it up a notch and give us some sizzle.

  The writer and director's gimmick of having the couple appear before a marriage counselor recaps the wonderful "When Harry Met Sally".  Yet it fails at humor.  Where there was chemistry between Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, there is ho-hum between Pitt and Jolie.

 Then there is the fight scene.  I don't think I'm giving much away because this part has been in the media.  I have rarely seen a more vicious and bad humored physical encounter between a man and a woman on screen; and this occurs in a movie which is trying to be tongue in cheek, if not actually humorous!  This would have been a great moment for a slapstick fight and some of those wonderful facial expressions that both Pitt and Jolie do really well.  This would have portrayed a couple who were angry but still in love.

 I wish I could find something to complement about the film.  Alas, the picture of Pitt and Jolie on the DVD box is better than the movie itself.
