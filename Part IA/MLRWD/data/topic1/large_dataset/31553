Based on the high ratings I saw for this show I obtained it with great expectations. These expectations came crashing down when I found myself barely able to stomach half of the first season before throwing in the towel. Two people who rated the show before me have pointed out the main weakness of the show

The individual plots are extremely thin. The main plot line is so thick with making this clan into a Brady Bunch gang that the whole thing becomes laughable. More so when despite the "Father Knows best" morality standards, the sons go out and beat and torture potential perps to get confessions! Right there in the interrogation rooms or out on dark street corners.

As another rater points out, Wallander a BBC collaborative effort is an order of magnitude better in quality, plots and execution than this run of the mill police show. The same could be said of George Gently (BBC). This show is Hill Street Blues revisited, sans the novelty. Another series that never received the well deserved praise it should have is Life (NBC/ 2 seasons 2008 DVD). This series does not have a tenth of the creativity that Life had. I'd rather go back and watch that one again than to suffer through another minute of this poor excuse of a show.
