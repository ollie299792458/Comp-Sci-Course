The setting for this thriller is the French Alps.  I lived and worked at the University of Grenoble for two years, in the heart of the region where the events take place.  The dialog and scenary provide a very good representation of the region. The distrust of the locals for the central governemnt in Paris is evident.  I was especially amused when one of the characters says "Paris sucks."

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F527">The Crimson Rivers</a> is a fast paced action movie complete with car chase and shoot out.  It has a surprise ending along the lines of Hitchcock.  You do have to suspend disbelief from time to time in order to get into the film.  Is it reasonable to think that an aging police commissioner from Paris can rappel into the depths of an Alpine  glacier?

The scenes on the mountain are especially stunning.  Sunrise over the Alps reminded me of many that I have experienced.  I am not sure how I managed to miss this film until now, but I am happy to have discovered it.
