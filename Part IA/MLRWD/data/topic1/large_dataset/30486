This movie was just the ticket.  It was, first and foremost: entertaining,next the plot was very intriguing, watching a clever little girl turn into a very clever & capable, reaper. Having her world brutally torn away from her at such a tender age, in such a cold blooded manner, causes her to be obsessed with a sense of revenge.

And she carries out that revenge, with a cold-blooded-calculated, precision that grips you as you enter the fray with "Catalaya."

Here is a strong character played by a strong young actress, "Zoe Saldana"  with the skills to make you believe you're right there; when she has her throw down death match, with the personal bodyguard of the well protected, man who ordered the killing of her mother and father, you're right there, struggling with her, hoping you don't run out of breathe before you can kill this maggot.

We start Catalaya's adult life with her, when she totally destroys a Vintage-Red-Ford Mustang, by running into the side of police car.  All that, just to go to jail and dispatch a target she's picked up, as a contract Hit.

Its a thrill ride, full of adrenaline-pumping...pulse-pounding-moments, where you'll forget to breath. This is excitement to good to miss.  From the beginning to the very end, you will be drawn into this movie.

Zoe is Hottt, and the action is sexyyy, you'll get more than your money's worth.

And that's what its all about escapism getting away from the every day with a good entertainment vehicle, and this is one...enjoy  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051VVOB2">Kindle Fire, Full Color 7" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi</a>
