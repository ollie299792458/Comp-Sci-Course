Twenty-two years after the original "Psycho" that took the cinematic world to storm, Anthony Perkins again stars as Norman Bates, the role that made him an international star.
Over two decades have passed since Norman was declared insane after committing horrible murders at his motel in Fairvale. Upon Norman's release from the psychiatric hospital he returns there to try and get on with his life.
The past, however, has a way of creeping up on Norman. Not only in his vivid memories, but also in the figure of Lila Loomis; the sister of a woman killed by Norman all those years ago. 
I must say I was both surprised and impressed to learn "Psycho" had a sequel. Surely after Hitchcock's famous (and yet perhaps slightly overrated) original there couldn't be another movie to match up to it?
What makes this movie such a good sequel is that the overall feel of the original is adopted so well. The same chilling house on the hill. The return of both Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles as the two main characters. The clever storyline slowly unfolds and the viewer is kept in the dark on the identity of the killer until the very end of the movie, which is undeniably a master stroke!
I would also like to mention the atmospheric music by Jerry Goldsmith and the excellent and original camerawork, both of which suit the atmosphere of the movie so extraordinarily well. 
The original "Psycho" was a worldwide succes. What impresses me the most about this movie is the fact that cast and crew dedicated enormous effort into making this a worthy sequel. And that they have in fact succeeded in doing exactly that.
