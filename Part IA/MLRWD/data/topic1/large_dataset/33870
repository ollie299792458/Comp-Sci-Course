First let me say that I am very biased when it comes to this actress, except for one tv show she did i found disturbing, i watch her in anything i can!Bagdad Cafe came to me one night, late at night in fact, you know right when you know you should be in bed, but stay up to watch one last flick? We have all been there and am i glad i did, this movie was beautiful, people use the word art, way  too often when referring to film, but in this case it fits perfect, it earns it hands down.Now i will be honest if CCH was mad at me, i might wet myself, she plays a mean ole ornery woman very well, then she turns around to show her heart and you want to hug her, she is truly an amazing actress, and while i don't know,,,i am guessing a sweet woman who has seen hard times and can channel them into her work.Also can't forget to mention the music, in particular the main theme Calling You,,,,beautiful, many have tried to cover the song, even one of my girls Babs Streisand , but noone can hold a note to the main singer Jevetta Steele her haunting vocals are the glue to the film , i just can't tell you how much i love this film and if you would take a chance on a rambling reviewer i bet you'll be glad you did!:)
