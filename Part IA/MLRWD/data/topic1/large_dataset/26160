Okay folks, it's not art (for the most part)...but c'mon, have some FUN.  This film had the misfortune to be shot at the end of the disco era and the beginning of the so-called "New Wave" movement, only to be released after disco had died HARD.  So, we are treated to a strange mix of 70's roller boogie/disco glitter, 40's nostalgia, and a premonition of 80's silliness to come (e.g., off the shoulder dresses, engineered hair--pass the mousse please, and leg warmers with flats).  A film in which the men wear shirts unbuttoned to their navels half the time AND one that includes leg warmers and big hair on the women in the other scenes is a strange juxtoposition indeed!

I remember all the preceeding fads well, because I worked retail at the time, and believe me, I sold TONS of crap as seen in this film.  People can rip on it all they want, but those 70's and 80's fasion faux pas were hugely popular.

If you can get past the tremendous cheese factor--or maybe you shouldn't--there are some lovely songs by Ms. Newton-John, several of which turned out to be pop hits, despite the commercial failure of the film.  The "Whenever You're Away From Me" song/dance duet is absolutely precious.  Gene Kelly is to be forgiven for that number alone.

The DVD version of the film has some nice bounuses, including some production notes on "What they were thinking" when they devised this vehicle.  The print is scratchy and grainy in some spots and okay in others--obviously no one thought enough of this film to preserve it well, and as for a restoration?  Not likely.

Overall, an odd, fun cheesy movie; enjoy it for what it is.  Let the purists go watch "The French Lieutenant's Woman" or something else deep.  I'd rather live in Xanadu, thank you.
