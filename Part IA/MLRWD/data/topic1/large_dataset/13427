I love Juno for reasons not only great in number, but reasons that are hard to express.
Firstly, Ellen Page is a likable teen girl who just happens to be pregnant. I can't imagine anyone other than Ellen playing Juno. Juno is a sarcastic, at times dead pan, normal girl who have her freaky quirks. Her sarcasm only hides the depth of emotion that she has, and Juno rarely lets anyone in her inner sanctum. She knows love, pain, both emotionally and physically, has high hopes for her baby, which is why she gives the baby up, and shows the true maturity it takes to raise a child. She knows that there are better things for her baby that she can't give and that there are things she wants for herself that would not be possible if she had a child. She is a child herself, just with a hardened, skewed vision of life.
Secondly, Bleeker is a cute and has an innocence to him that you don't always see in teens in movies. He loves Juno and wants to be there for her but it unsure of how to be and just does what he can to get by in the film but that generally means not sticking up for himself.
Next, I like that the movie looks differently at teen pregnancy. I am not saying that being a pregnant is easy, should be glorified or is a wonderful thing, but it is still a pregnancy, which is considered a blessing and a beautiful thing. Juno shows that it isn't just a have an abortion or "screw up" your life type of situation. People can find blessed miracles in garbage dumps of situations.
I recommend this movie for EVERYONE.
