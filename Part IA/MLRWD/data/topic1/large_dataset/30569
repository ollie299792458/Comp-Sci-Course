Unhinged where do I begin,why this movie was on the video nasties list is beyond me than again most of the movies on the list had no business being on there in the first place, plus there were a big mess of movies that should have been on there that had no mention. They say the movie was banned for graphic violence and gratutious nudity, as for the grapic violence 4 deaths total and the acutual death is implied, and than the camera pans to the victims face, as for the nudity one scene and you get to see everything nothing gratutious here. I guess the movie had little budget due to the fact they spent most of the budget trying to secure the mansion it was filmed in (could be wrong read about it on the internet)  My biggest qualm with this movie was not enough gore, yeah the 4 murders were pretty grim, but I would have liked to see the acutual act instead of having it be implied that it happened, the story was  so so and it was a very slow paced movie, Unhinged could have been a good movie had a little more effort been put into it, I went into this movie with an open mind, but the movie just fell apart and I lost intrest rather quick.  If your into low budget schlock and don't care for over the top gore than I guess this movie is for you.
