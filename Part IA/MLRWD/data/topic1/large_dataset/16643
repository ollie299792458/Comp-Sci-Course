I saw this as a kid and it scared me.I saw it recently and it still is scary.Mainly I look for thought provoking and intelligent horror because usually that is the only horror with the abillity to scare me for example the great Cronenberg masterpiece The Brood.Now this is something else.Its not what you would call intelligent in terms of plot but its no stupid little slasher movie either!Yes bad dubbing and such abounds but you know Lamberto Bava does have some artistic talent because the atmosphere he sets with the gothic looking theatre,the theatre running itself,the demon transformation,the entrapment and horror of the moviegoers is absolutely relentless and terrifying.It is like a painting it does not rely on plot for effects it relys on images and images alone and that is just fine with me.So bad plot does not mean stupid!Now Scream or those stupid Nightmare on ElmStreets those were stupid.You do not find stupidity in Italian horror you just find stupid plots and dubbings the movies themselves are made to perfection.The demons are gruesome.The end has a hopeless quality to it.Infact it very well could have been seeing this film when I was a kid that set off my dark and nihlistic outlook on life.Do not believe the negative reviews,have fun and suspend sanity and reallity and watch this movie!
