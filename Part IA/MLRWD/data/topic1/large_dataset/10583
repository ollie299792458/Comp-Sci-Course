4 stars
Finding Forester, A movie about a young boy living in the Bronx who is a prodigy when it comes to writing. Jamal Wallace(Rob Brown) is this young 16-year-old prodigy when it comes to writing. Not only is he a outstanding writer but an incredible athlete towards basketball. He shines right through his test scores and works his way into a private and very highly recognized school in New York. Once there he is faced with a challenge by he is English teacher who thinks that he is not who everyone thinks he is. Jamal then meets a man called William Forrester (Sean Connery) a famous writer for only one printed book who became a hermit in the Bronx. Jamal seeks help from William Forrester through out his first year at school
 I believe all stories based upon true encounters are interesting to me, but this one takes the cake for best movie based upon real facts. I thought Sean connnery was very good in this movie. Both him and first time movie making actor Rob brown put outstanding performances in this movie. This movie shows a great deal of prejudice in the American society today. Not only does it show prejudice but shows an athletic story and considering the point of the story of being just a writer and only writing, I didn't lose interest one bit. I was glued to the screen from the moment it started.
