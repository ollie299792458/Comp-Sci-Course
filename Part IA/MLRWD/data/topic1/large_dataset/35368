a good effort for wwe. could have been better since raw &amp; smackdown teamed up again. summerslam is wwe 's 3rd biggest event of the year. again, no extras on the dvd. what's going on here? this is summerslam for crying out loud!
WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP
LA RESISTANCE VS BUBBA RAY &amp; D-VON DUDLEY 7/10- resistance is getting better. need to drop the un-american angle. a good tag team match with a suprise ending
A-TRAIN VS UNDERTAKER 7/10- a better match than i expected. a- train finally looks decent. wasn't a bore at all
ERIC BISCHOFF VS SHANE MCMAHON 8/10- glad to see shane return to the ring. not a great match but gets a high rating because of the entertainment it provides. involvement of steve austin &amp; jonathan coachman was great. crowd was on their feet.
U.S. CHAMPIONSHIP(FATAL FOUR WAY MATCH)
EDDIE GUERRERO VS CHRIS BENOIT VS RHYNO VS TAJIRI 7/10- this could have been a 10 if rhyno wasn't involved. should have used cena, mysterio or kidman instead of rhyno. slow start but pace picked up &amp;  made for a good match despite rhyno.
MATT HARDY VS ZACH GOWEN 0/10- was very disappointed this match was canceled. gowen was brutally injured by lesnar on previous smackdown &amp; unable to compete. hardy declared the winner by forfeit on Heat. would have been a great match.
WWE CHAMPIONSHIP
KURT ANGLE VS BROCK LESNAR 10/10- even better than their wrestlemania match. an all out effort. this is the match of the year. awesome ending.
KANE VS ROB VAN DAM 6/10- weird to see kane without a mask. doesn't seem like the same guy. was expecting a great one; instead was kind of lackluster. a big letdown from these 2.
WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP(ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH)
TRIPLE HHH VS KEVIN NASH VS SHAWN MICHAELS VS CHRIS JERICHO VS GOLDBERG VS RANDY ORTON 5/10- a big disappointment! was not long enough. only 20 minutes compared to the 1st one at survivor series being 40 minutes. 1st one was a classic; this one was a dud. why was orton in this? he's never been in a ppv; now he's in the main event?should have put booker t back in it.if not for certain moments this would have been worse.
overall, this would have been a great summerslam if not for the last 2 matches. smackdown carried this one. raw was disappointing. why was john cena, rey mysterio, billy kidman, big show, charlie haas &amp; shelton benjamin left off the card from smackdown? why was booker t &amp; christian left out from raw? christian is the intercontinental champion for pete's sake!
