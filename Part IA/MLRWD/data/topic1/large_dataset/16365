This film's strength is neither the special effects nor the action sequences, but rather the time it spends exploring the psychological realm: anger, jealousy, and of course, what you would do if you never had to look at yourself in the mirror.
Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, an egotistical scientist who is leading a government-funded project on invisibility. Caine is so determined to make his project work that he sidesteps Pentagon authorization and brashly makes himself the study's first human test subject.
Trouble arises with the invisibility antidote, however, and Caine is unable to regain opacity. This turn of events, and his subsequent extended confinement to his underground lab, quickly bring out the dark side of Caine's megalomaniac personality. He begins to vent his emotions in most unhealthy ways, violently seeking outlets for his bitterness over a recent split with his girlfriend, his jealousy and rage towards her new lover, and his obsession with the female neighbor he watches through his window. Drawing on the premise that invisibility eliminates feelings of guilt, Hollow Man has Sebastian become a very, very bad man.
The dilemma, of course, lies in how to stop him: what do you do to defend yourself against a man that you can't even see? The situation is resolved, but not before Caine creates an enormous bloodbath, and unfortunately not before I began to lose interest in the film. Near its end, Hollow Man begins to transform into a fairly rote action movie, complete with fireballs and (spoiler alert!) a dramatic escape through an unstable elevator shaft. Trust me, you've seen it all before.
One advantage of the DVD format is that the discriminating viewer can skip fairly directly to the middle of the movie, which is where the psychologically-driven sequences lie and is the part worth watching. The rest, honestly, is rather hollow.
