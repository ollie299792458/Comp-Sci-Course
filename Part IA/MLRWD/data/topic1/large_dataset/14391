What "It's a Wonderful Life" is to Christmas, "Pieces of April" is to Thanksgiving.  Be it in an alternative-lifestyle, postmodern, artistically disjointed way.

April has volunteered to cook the big Thanksgiving dinner for her family and they have accepted.  However, April cannot cook and her family does not really want to see her.  The film illustrates the truth that the holidays are not always happily anticipated by everyone - some families, in fact, dread being together.

As April attempts to cook the turkey, she encounters her diverse neighbors in the run-down apartment building, each with their own quirks and pain.  The film is both gritty and uplifting.

When April struggles to explain to the Asian family how Thanksgiving first came about, you see her stumble onto the true meaning of the holiday.  Which is that these people from opposite worlds realized that they ultimately need each other.  Suddenly you realize that little has changed since Plymouth Rock, afterall.
