First of all, this a great movie that the whole family will enjoy! Your kids will love it!

Black Death is a wacky, fun-filled flick that shows what happens when worlds collide! Take a band of loyal Christians, a young, sexy monk and a village of ne'er-do-well pagans and what do you get? Why the best singing and dancing this side of the 4th Crusade! You'll cheer our new friends as they discover laughter, dancing and love. Your heart will soar as the monk Osmund (Eddie Redmayne, one of the monks from The Pillars of the Earth, who apparently already had the costume) finds his soulmate and learns to love again. Audiences will cheer when they see the lighthearted ribbing that comes when committed Christians meet salt-of-the-earth pagans. Oh, the whimsical, wacky hijinks!

If you're planning an inter-faith prayer breakfast, I can't recommend a better movie. Guaranteed to start a great spiritual dialogue. The characters of Black Death show how respect, love and rationality can lead to a better understanding of other faiths. Spread the word! This movie will really make you think about your own faith!!!
