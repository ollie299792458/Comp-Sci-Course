This movie is one of the most convicting and encouraging movies I've seen in quite a while. If you haven't taken stock of your relationship with God lately by challenging yourself, you will have lots to gain by watching Pilgrims Progress. I found myself walking along with the characters, all along challenging myself to deepen my walk with Jesus and challenging myself as to whether or not I can serve as I should. The movie walks at just the right pace to keep your attention and to draw you from one challenge to the next. The characters make it easy to put yourself in their shoes as well as to relate to others that cross you life's paths. My father-in-law has not sat completely through a movie at my house in the past 15 years. He has always nodded off. But, at the conclusion of Pilgrims Progress last night, he commented to me how it was the first movie that held his attention from start to finish. He told me that every time he got ready to leave the room, something else grabbed his attention. I believe so strongly that this movie can and will be used by God that I have purchased multiple copies to give to my neighbors. My family has watched this five times so far in the past week: my children love it (10 year old girl and 12 year old boy). This may seem excessive perhaps, but there is something in this movie that speaks to my soul-that says "we cannot give up; we must pursue Jesus at all costs." It spurs me on toward my goal of pleasing Jesus and of not being ashamed at His return. You will do well to purchase this for yourself and see what I'm talking about. Excellent!
