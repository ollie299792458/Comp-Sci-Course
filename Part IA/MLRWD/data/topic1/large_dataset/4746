In the cover of this complete season two, Master Yoda is holding his lightsabor with a firm look that he gives to the enemy. Although I have no idea why master Yoda is standing there with a smirk on his face, I kind of like the design. The complete season two is like the complete season one. It has 4 discs and 22 series in total. Each series has about 30 min running time, and starts with different wise-sayings. The keywords of episodes per each disc, I think, are these:
- Disk 1 : Holocron : friendships + trust
- Disk 2 : Geonosis + Grievous : letting go + understanding
- Disk 3 : Mandalore : betrayal + love+ patience + leadership
- Disk 4 : Boba Fett + Zillo beast : all life forms
For example, the first disc has episodes in which the Jedi Holocron is mainly dealt with. Darth Sidious ordered Cad Bane to steal the Jedi Holocron, and he did it. Desperate to get it back, Anakin Skywalker and Asoka Tano are dispatched to a mission. In the story, you will see the strong bond between master and a Padawan. Thus, you will understand that Cad Bane is more dangerous than you thought. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that in the story, there is always a thing to learn.
My favorite episodes are in disk 3. As said above, it is mostly about Mandalore, love, betrayal, patience, and leadership. I like it because, when I was watching the part about Mandalore, I found that like Skywalker, Obi-wan Kenobi has a love too (think about that!). However, the MAIN reason why I like is that it gives you a lot of wise sayings. For example, "a wise leader knows when to follow." from the episode where Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi engages an infamous separatist admiral.

To sum up, I think it is a really, truly, literally, wonderful.
P.S. if you haven't yet watched Complete Season One, watch it first.
P.P.S. if you haven't watched Star Wars please watch them. (At least 1 and 2)
