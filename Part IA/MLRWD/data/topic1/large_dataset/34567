This is one of the all time great Holiday classics. This is MY "It's A Wonderful Life" For Thanksgiving. We have to watch this movie EVERY Thanksgiving. I Totally Love this movie with the pairing of two of my favorites John Candy & Steve Martin. Jimmy Stewart had said "It's A Wonderful Life" was His favorite Movie Role and likewise I believe Steve Martin, had said the same about his role in "Planes, Trains & Automobiles"
It doesn't hurt that a classic scene was filmed in my hometown of St.Louis, Missouri AND I had lived in Chicago, Illinois for 7 years. I Love this movie so much, I had to buy the long out of print Rare, "Planes, Trains & Automobiles" Soundtrack CD. (OUCH that's a high price & it doesn't even have all the songs from the movie in it.) Great comedy with a beautiful sweet ending. Don't forget to watch to the very end AFTER the credits to see William Windom still sitting there deciding the Advertising lay-outs, from the very begining of the film. You gotta LOVE this movie. I sure miss John Candy.
