Again this is the most enrapturing love story I have ever seen on TV.  And they're only teenagers!!!! And to top it all off they have more than the normal insecurities to deal with. . . they literally have to hide who and what they are.  That's a lot to handle and I thought this show pulled it off with flying colors.  
Granted the 1st season was the best of the 3.  I didn't not like season 2 but I did feel as though it was a little less thought out.  And season 3 just rushed us to the end (nice last episode though).  Liz and Max showed us that love involved loyalty, doing things for someone you cared about and holding on to each other as you leap into the unknown.  They made it a point to say it wasn't all about Sex.  Something teenagers who watch the show should definitely see.  The actors were superb and the writing in the beginning gave this show characters that were believable and engrossing.  
The sci-fi part wasn't all encompasing but there was enough to the plot that you knew the special effects would have to escalate even though the 3 aliens really wanted to just fit in.  
I completely feel in love with this show and I am awfully sorry that it has been taken off the air.  Though if they ever decide to continue the story they'll need some really good actors (or bring back the old ones) because the chemistry was real and powerful.  And there is a lot rogue adults can do that teenagers tied to the apron strings can not.  
Thanks to crashdown.com and those who logged in for trying very hard to keep this show alive!
