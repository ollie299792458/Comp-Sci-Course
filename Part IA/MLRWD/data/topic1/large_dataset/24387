I wanted the special edition so I could hear the comments from Ted Neeley and Norman Jewison (who needs to consult Miss Manners about interrupting someone else who's trying to speak). The interview with Tim Rice was also very interesting and I learned a few things I didn't know!

This movie is very dated, and that is one of its charms! Some of the ideas used are still amazing and I find myself shaking my head in disbelief! The entire cast is amazing - especially Carl Anderson and Barry Dennen. Josh Mostel made a very funny Herod. Yvonne Elliman is only so-so in my book. A bit too clingy and whiny, but that's just me.

Then there is Ted Neeley! After Elvis, Ted was a Great Love of My Life, but hey, he's Elvis! Others may or may not sing these songs better than Ted (I won't go into that here) but NO ONE puts more passion into the words! I often put 'Gethsemane' on repeat and just let it play and play and play. His smile in 'Hosanna' lights up the screen! Ted NEVER ceases to amaze me!

I finally get to see him perform Superstar in person 5/12 - I absolutely can't wait! Yes, he's aged... who hasn't??? He's still out there, delivering a STAND OUT performance and I, for one, will be cheering him on!!!
