The late great VAL GUEST did a spot on job with this terrific doomsday thriller. Guest worked as a newspaper man during his early year and he gets the details of the journalism business just right and that helps ground the film in a sober and scary kind of work-a-day realism; his science is a bit wonky but who cares?

This film has got some excellent performances, especially from Leo McKern and, in his 1st and only acting appearance,real life newspaper editor Aurthur Christiensen (who I think gives a marvelous performance--I was surprised to hear  Val Guest comment that he had a difficult time memorizing his lines) The main character played by Edward Judd is a bit of an irritating jerk--sunk in self pity and equipped with a series of annoying one-liners that are designed to show everyone how "hip" and "edgy" he is--but he just comes across as unlikable.

 The SPFX are not too shabby considering the miniscule budget. There are some cool matte paintings by the great Les Bowie of a dry and cracked Thames riverbed and various  scorched and parched-looking English landmarks. The DVD version of this film has an excellent commentary by Mr Guest who provides a lot of interesting information.
The very first sequence of this movie--with Edward Judd plodding thru an empty sun-blasted London to his newspaper offices downtown-- is still a benchmark in low budget ingenuity. I am glad to have a chance to see this excellent film on DVD in a nice widescreen transfer with the original red and orange gel-colored beginning and ending; I first saw this film in the early 90's on Video and the red gels were not present--it was still impressively rendered but to see it with the colors is definitely superior. I can well imagine how gorgeous it looked on screens back in 1962!

THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE will remain one of the best apocalyptic thrillers ever made.Its an enduring testament to the talent of VAL GUEST, may he rest in peace.
