I hate when people take reviews and hit not helpful just to do the damage, good thing the rating stays. This movie is awesome", didn't expect much when it first came out but bought it on blu and have seen it like 7-9 times, really love the level of details on every gesture or expression the characters make. Reese makes a good hit out of Susan and my personal favorite, the missing link is hilarious. 3d not included, but the movie itself is worth the while... Never thought would love this movie the way I do, but it's really really good. Seth gives life to B.O.B. with his own laugh, it's great. I for one am glad for the choice made, and even better if they throw a 3d version out... hint, in the main menu select up in the control to the part "Don't push this" or something like that and have an easter egg to enjoy, with a teaser from a dragons 3d movie due soon. Special features are enough to make me watch them all and not get tired nor bored... For kids, From grown ups, to everyone else, Monsters VS Aliens is a top. "Let's take this thing down"!!!!
