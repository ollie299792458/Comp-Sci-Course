Magnolia is one of those movies that reminds one of the power of film. Director Paul Thomas Anderson masterfully weaves together the stories of several people, all interrelated, into one brilliantly orchestrated work. Every aspect of Magnolia adds tremendously to its ultimate design, from the cinematography to the music to the flawless cast.

The plot is difficult to pinpoint, especially since the film consists of several different stories. Don't watch this movie for the plot so much as for the themes, all of them poignantly addressed, and the characters. I found most of them less than sympathetic, but this is beside the point. Each one is arriving at some sort of break-down. The movie essentially analyzes their descent, their attempts to pull themselves out, and their ultimate recovery, although this pattern varies from person to person.

All the performances are right-on, but the best, in my view, come from Melora Walters, Julianne Moore, and Jeremy Blackman. Aimee Mann's songs also add further dimension. All-in-all, I give Magnolia my highest rating and recommendation. It is bold and beautiful. See this film.
