This review is for the Dragon Dynasty DVD release.

I read the negative Dragon Dynasty comments and viewed still images before the movie was re-released and decided
to take a chance anyway and make the purchase. I am happy with my purchase.

The only other copies I own of "The Killer" is the old Fox Lorber release which was great for its days and an even older VHS tape
beat to death over the years.

I prefer the Dragon Dynasty release as it is much cleaner and brighter then past versions as played on my up-converting JVC at 1080p.
It is not up to par with the Dragon Dynasty re-release of "Hardboiled" as the 5.1 audio track was not included on the DVD
but considering I originally watched "The Killer" in mono it does not bother me. The 2.1 audio track is clean and
the overdub is considerably better then past Asian films I have viewed which on occasion are filmed soundless and audio added after the film shoot ends.

Well there are some minor discrepancies of the character names I noticed twice. I have to attribute that to translation differences
that were not corrected by Dragon Dynasty but I was so engrossed in the movie I only noticed them the second time I watched the film.

The Dragon Dynasty re-release of "The Killer" is certainly better then most I own and like I said I am happy with the purchase.

Purists will disagree with my review but not everyone will agree with one another all of the time. I can see their points but
I am happy to finally have a version of "The Killer" that is bright and clean with audio I can enjoy abet 2.1.
