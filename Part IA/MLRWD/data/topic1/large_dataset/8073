for decades, critics have parroted the official line of how this movie looks soooo much like a documentary, with the cliche, too, of no documentary footage was used in this movie.

truth is: this movie has the very professional look of an I LOVE LUCY episode, complete with 3-camera type direction and editing.

the movie goes nowhere, there is no satisfactory ending to the movie.

one of those many movies that critics love for its politics, and not because it's an actually---enjoyable movie.

supposedly, when this movie was first shown, back in the crazy 1960s, movie goers would cheer when the terrorists/freedom fighters blew up french civilians.

this movie played at night---in dubbed english---on channel 3, kyw, in philadelphia; but only arabic version with subtitles is now available.

this movie was directed by an italian marxist---but according to marlon brando, who acted in the director's movie, BURN, this marxist director was a racist, making sure his italian crew ate better than the 3rd world actors, during the making of BURN.
