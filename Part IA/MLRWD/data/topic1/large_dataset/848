There was a Russian sniper ace by the name of Vassily Zaitzev in the Battle of Stalingrad.  And there was an instructor from a German sniper school sent to get rid of him.  The two dueled for days in the rubbles of Stalingrad until one day, the German killed an overly-enthusiastic political commissar at the side of Zaitzev.  But in the process Zaitzev caught a glint off the German's sniperscope.  He killed the German with one shot.
Those are the historical facts.  What happened in the movie is creative license.  Contrary to the claims of some reviewers, this movie is not a "chick flick" in the guise of a war movie.  If anything, the romantic triangle between Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz is underdeveloped, and seems oddly detached from the rest of the action.  There are some dramatic (read gruesome) battle sequences in the tradition of SPR, and the film does give a flavor of the brutality of the Eastern Front, although as some have pointed out, it is NOT a historically accurate depiction of the Battle of Stalingrad per se.
Mostly, this is a movie about the personal duel between 2 soldiers, played with admirable nuances by Jude Law and Ed Harris.  The grand ideological conflict behind the war does not matter here.  The bombs raining overhead merely set the stage for a contest of skills and will between 2 reluctant warriors, neither of whom takes pleasure in the prospect of killing, but both equally determined to perform his duties.  I was strangely reminded of Heat as I watched the film.  And in many ways, although the setting cannot be more different, this film is closer in spirit to the classic cop-and-gangster cat-and-mouse thriller than most war movies.
A very well done and entertaining film.  Although I think the film left a great deal unexplored with regards to the psychology of the protagonists, and the ending was too saccharine to be believable.  This weakness in the writing is what kept the film from being a 5-star masterpiece.
