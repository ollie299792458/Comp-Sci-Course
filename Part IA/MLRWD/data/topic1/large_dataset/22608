Man oh man...I love documentaries and character studies.

Crumb, Capturing the Friedmans, The Thin Blue Line etc...

But THIS...my god, the mind boggles at the level of pretentiousness of the folks who claim to "love" or "get" this horrible mess.

 Over an hour and a half of two crazy women who are essentially shut-ins rambling on about nothing at all in what looks like an abandoned shack surrounded by vermin and garbage a foot deep.

 The two women in question are "Big Edie" and "Little Edie", the aunt and cousin of Jackie O respectively.

 Let me sum up the whole 100 minutes for you;

Little Edie: I hate it here. I had to leave New York to come here and take care of my mother.

Big Edie: I was fine. I used to have a lovely singing voice.

Little Edie: But I missed out on my big chance to make it.

Big Edie: Oh well. You missed out.

Little Edie: I miss New York. I hate it here.

Big Edie: Did you feed the cats?

Little Edie; YES!!! I fed them!!!

Big Edie: I used to have a lovely singing voice.

 Now imagine this being repeated over and over again for 100 minutes.

 Do yourself a favor; Before you let anyone talk you into seeing this piece of dreck just go sit on skid row for 2 hours and listen to the rambling of the hobos and mental patients.

 You'll save the money and get some fresh air at the same time.

Horrible.

Just plain horrible.
