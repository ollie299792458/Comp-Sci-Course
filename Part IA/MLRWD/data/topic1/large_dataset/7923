I recommended this great film to a friend, who gave up on it mid-way
through.  It's true that this movie is not conventionally entertaining,
and the players are more like symbols than real people.  The deliberate
pace, and depictions of cruelty would be challenging to many viewers.
Regardless, to me this is just about the deepest film I've ever seen,
because it contemplates the evil rottenness in this world, and finally
says, God loves the meek most of all.  The conclusion of "Balthazar"
redeems the troubling sadness of the story with a gentle miracle, and
I've never seen a more moving ending to any film.

  One reviewer here asserted that the abuse of the donkey was genuine.
I can think of safe ways of simulating all the "abuse" that would cause
zero suffering to the animal(s) playing Balthazar.  The reviewer also
complained that the characters didn't react as would ordinary persons.
This movie is meant to be a poetic parable, and not actually "realistic."
Bresson preferred flat performances from his nonprofessional actors,
without "acting" standing in front of the message of his tale.
