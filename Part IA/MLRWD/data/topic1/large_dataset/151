There's one thing about this movie that none of the previous reviews have touched on, which is how do you know who are the bad guys and who are the good guys?  I realize that this sounds strange when talking about a Nazi movie, but it's the truth.  I always watch movies with a clean slate, meaning I suspend my reality and like to get lost in the movie's reality.  Other than the opening scence of the movie where Nazis are shooting through the floorboards of a house where a farmer  is hiding Jews, there's really nothing here to convince me to root against the Nazis.

When it comes time to intrduce us to the Basterds, there is really nothing to make me want to root for them.  There is a scene where, after a battle (which we never see)the Basterds are scalping dead Germans (which is the Basterds' trademark), they give one of the surviving Germans a chance to live if he informs on another German patrol, when he refuses to betray his countrymen, he is beaten to death with a baseball bat.  A second surviving German, an infantryman, is given the same option to inform and willingly gives up the information.  His reward?  He is allowed to live but the leader of the Basterds carves a scar into his forhead, in the shape of a swastiki, with a Bowe knife.

Latter in the movie, when one of the Allied informants (a German actress)is laying in an operating room, the leader of the Basterds sticks his figure in her open leg wound becuase he doesn't think she is giving him the correct information.

That sums up this entire movie.  There really nothing that make you want to root for either side.  You never see the Germans commiting attrocites, and you never see the Basterds doing anything but hurting people.  Would it have killed Tarantino to have a scene where the Basterds save civilons from Nazis?

I wonder if Tarantino isn't a closet Nazi lover?
