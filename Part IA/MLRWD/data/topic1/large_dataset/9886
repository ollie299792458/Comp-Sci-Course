This powerful and thought evoking film depicts an actual incident which took place on Christmas Eve, 1914.  The film juxtaposes the great beauty of Christ's birth with the unspeakable human tragedy of war.

The events chronicled in this film took place on the killing fields of France where The French and Scottish armies were entrenched across from the German army.  Here these powerful armies slaughtered each other for four years never giving up more than 25 miles of teritory either way.  On this special Christmas eve, the first of the Great War, these armies saw a chance to stop the killing to celebrate the birth of the prince of peace.  As the soldiers emerged from their trenches, littered with human filth and rotting corpses, one can not help but sense an immediate rebirth.  In doing so, they recognized their common humanity and fulfilled the promise of Christ's birth which is "Let There Be Peace on Earth".

The film is wonderfully acted and the attention to detail is spectacular.  The most moving scene of this film is when the Scottish priest celebrates mass in latin (as was done back then) to the Sottish, French and German soldiers.  While all speak their own language they were able to experience a spritual moment in the common language of the Catholic mass.  This simple act of mass reminds the viewer of the good that comes when human beings focus on the commonalities that bind us and not the differences that tend to destroy us.

I highly remommend this wonderful film to anyone who believes in the inherent promise of humanity and the power of good versus evil.
