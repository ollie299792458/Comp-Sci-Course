Discovered this flick a while ago and when watching it again now I remember why I bought it (on Amazon no less) for an old punker girlfriend immediately after seeing it!  I grew up in the 80's listening to all this music, and I will state loudly that SLC PUNK ROCKS!  If this was your scene then (or now - for all you posers) you need to own SLC PUNK!  Opposingly, if you think Black Flag is just for pest control, then don't bother - you just won't get it!
Matthew Lillard (more famous for roles in Scream and 13 Ghosts etc., etc.) is outstanding in this early role in his career and a final dramatic scene with Lillard shows just how talented this fine actor really is.  The film is a well-developed character study of Lillard and friends, and the performances and dialogue are exceptional.
It transported me, as the viewer, straight back to the mid 80's, of days and nights spent in the Channel and The Rat in Boston.  With a goofy smile plastered on my face, I watched these guys move around from: the package store, to the clubs, to the all-night house parties; and in the midst, scoop up all the punker honeys to boot!  You can't turn back the clock, but SLC PUNK does its' best to put you right back there in the middle of it all.  Oh, and did I mention that I LOVE THIS FLICK?!
