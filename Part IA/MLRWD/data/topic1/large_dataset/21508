I experienced a visceral reaction to Mad Men unlike any response I've had to a television show for a long time.  The show elicited a feelings of security and insecurity, comfort and discomfort.  The rigid social structure had me reflecting on a time very early in my life but had a continuous effect in shaping the adult I would become.  As a kid in 1960 I was very aware of racial prejudice and remember the subservient roles played by men and women like the ones cleaning the offices and running the elevators or so told to me with anger and disapproval by my parents and other adults.  I remember my mother dressing in the style of Betty Draper and learning lessons on "proper" comportment.  I remember how tall (like Dan Draper) my father was and the uneasy but comforting smell from my father's cigarettes. I remember how cute my mother looked in pedal pushers and how we went on family picnics together.  Only as I have grown older can I relate to Don Draper's darkness and the darkness of racial and gender prejudice in American society. Are we so different now?  A loaded question to which I will not speculate.
