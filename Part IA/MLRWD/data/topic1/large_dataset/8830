Charming and witty in an English sort of way, a bit of dark humor, but all said and done, a delightful little mystery/love story with Maggie Smith, Rowan Atkinson, Kristin Scott Thomas, and of all people, Patrick Swayze.Atkinson plays against his usual rubber-faced goofball type as a well meaning albeit bumbling Vicar in a small village parish of Little Whallop. Kristin Scott Thomas is his neglected wife, with a penchant for golf lessons from the legend-in-his-own-mind golf pro, Patrick Swayze. In their busy domestic lives comes a treasure of a housekeeper, Maggie Smith, helping not only the parents but their children as well, to learn to live life "with a little grace".  Smoothing out the "wrinkles" of barking dogs, nosey neighbors, demanding parrishioners, golfing Lotharios, and the occasional pond inspectors, is all in a day's work. A heart warming if surprising twist at the end make this a truly endearing movie. A couple incidents of brief nudity, and violence heard but not fully seen, gives this a PG rating. I watched it twice to catch all the little clues I'd missed the first time when I was laughing.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and recommend it highly. Why did we here in the US not hear more of it?? Stellar performaces throughout.  Maggie Smith is a real treat to watch!  Enjoy this with someone you love, and don't forget to put the kettle on.
