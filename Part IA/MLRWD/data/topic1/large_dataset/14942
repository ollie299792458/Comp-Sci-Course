This is one of the funniest movies i've seen in years and one of the few sequels that r good. My favorite parts are when Stifler finds a blue dildo- yes, i said dildo,I also like Stifler's horny little brother trying to be a pimp. But the best scene has to be the superglue scene when Jim uses it as lubricant. The special features are just as good and they are:
1. The Making of American Pie 2- It's funny, but boring at times
2. Outtakes and deleted scenes- The outtakes are hillarious, especially when Jim has a swearing fit over Stifler's mom. The deleted scenes, however leave a lot to be desired.
3. Auditions from American Pie- In my opinion this should be on the first movie's dvd.
4. Behind the scenes- this is funny, sort of
5. Top 10 scenes of all time from American Pie 1 and 2- This is an awesome feature, but they should just show the whole scene instead of 15-20 seconds of it.
6.Best lines from the movie- This lets you select from a list of lines said in the movie and go right to that part of the movie.
7. "Be Like That" Music video- I dont like 3 Doors Down so i didnt like this video.
8. Commentaries- The best one is with Mena Suvari and Jason Biggs among others
