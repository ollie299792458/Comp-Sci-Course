The first time I saw Intruder was via a good friend of mine who through his work as a publicist obtained an advance VHS copy of this film. I remember thinking it was weak story wise, but intense gore effects wise. Well, 20 some odd years later, I finally watched this DVD re-release and was very very impressed. Yes, the story may seem a bit insipid and trite, almost as if the story were really the supporting character to the starring role which was the incredible gore SFX by KNB -- THE masters of special effects. But, this time around, I could actually SEE the film, whereas the original VHS quality was so poor half of it was washed out and completely hidden in unintentional shadows. The story was actually quite good for what it was. This is a slasher film, and as one of the last true films of that noble genre, it succeeds wonderfully. The killer is as ruthless as slashers can get, blindly sadistic and with absolutely no remorse. Also, I was genuinely surprised by who the killer turned out to be. The familiar faces of Sam and Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell (in his best role since Evil Dead 2, yes, partly cuz it's so short), and Dan Hicks, who played one of the shemps in Evil Dead 2, they were all great to see acting together in this film. I also give Scot Spiegel TONS of credit for daring to film this audaciously violent film when other filmmakers were succumbing to the mighty thumb of the MPAA and the current anti-violent film campaign that permeated America in the latter part of the 1980's. I highly recommend this film to slasher fans and to those who have only heard the rumors of what a groundbreaking film Intruder really was.
