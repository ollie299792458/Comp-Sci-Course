I found "Scoop" to be a very charming, amusing movie that simultaneously (and ingeniously) combines elements of comedy, suspense, and maturity of script and plot. This is a great film in the tradition of Woody Allen and an excellent way for a new generation to be introduced to his movies.

Scarlett Johanssen plays Sondra Pransky, a college student who pursues a career in journalism after foregoing her former ambition of becoming a dental hygienist. The movie contains a good deal of well-placed comments having to do with teeth and dental hygiene, which I personally found very cute and original (I mean, who doesn't like quirky comments about teeth)? She goes to a magic show where the great "Splendini" (Allen) has her help him with a magic trick. She enters a box where she encounters a deceased reporter who gives her a scoop on a well-to-do British man, Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). The deceased reporter indicates that he believes Lyman to be the "Tarot card killer."

Sondra talks the great "Splendini" / Sid Waterman into helping her investigate Lyman, but in the process falls in love with him, and even though there is some mounting evidence against him, neither believes he is the killer. Hugh Jackman, I must say, is very charming in this movie. I would not believe that this adorable man with a British accent would be capable of killing anyone either. Of course, you must watch the movie yourself to find out whether this debonair man is a killer or not!

I therefore highly recommend this movie. You will be in suspense and second-guessing right up until the end. You really can't go wrong with a Woody Allen movie. Have a great day, everyone!
