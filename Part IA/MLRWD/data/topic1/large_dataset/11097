Another Burton classic.  As dark and rich as you're likely going to be able to swallow, but watch out for the nuts!  And this movie is full of oddballs, weirdos, nuts as well as several squirrels.

As usual, Depp adds an unsettling twist to the character of Wonka that makes him interesting and just a tad obnoxious.  This version of the movie more accurately approaches the character in the book than the Wilder movie did ( but I like that one too.)  The cinematography is breathtaking in scope and detail with special effects that will please the most finicky of viewers.  The acting from the children is flawless, they almost steal the show away from Depp.  Almost.  And last, Elfman's score is one of his best to date; menacing, creepy but playful and intelligent.  Unlike the original movie, you can actually look forward to the next Oompa Loompa song in this rendition.  The only real drawback to me was a decision to overdue the digital makeup on Depp and some of the children in the cast.  Their skin almost looks plastic and distracted me more often than it should have.  Then again, I did see it in an IMAX theater so it was more obvious but the movie is larger than life so the huge screen was definitely a treat!
