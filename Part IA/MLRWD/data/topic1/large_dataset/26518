I have been a Zorro fan for years; I remember watching the old Republic serials on TV in the early 1950s, hokey as they may be, and the Disney series with Guy Williams (1957-59).  This was a fun movie, plain and simple.  Much has already been said--pro and con--about the story line, characters, etc., but a couple of red flags really went up for me as a history buff.

This entire fictional story occurs in 1850 from voting on statehood through annexation of California as a state.  During the scenes in which Count Armand and the others are plotting against the United States, a couple of references are made to the Confederate States, which, of course, did not come into existence until 1861--11 years later.  The trouble that eventually led to the war was brewing by then, but the Confederacy just did not exist.  Also, near the end, Abraham Lincoln was present at the signing of the annexation.  Likewise, he was not inaugurated president until 1861 and was virtually unknown outside Illinois in 1850.  I am curious as to why such glaring historical errors were made.

Nonetheless, the language is clean and the action is great:  No graphic blood and guts--just good cliffhanger action.  All in all, it's a great movie, with lots of humor included to give it a lighter side.  If you like Zorro, James Bond, etc., you will probably enjoy this one.

The DVD has some special features about filming the action sequences that are very informative and entertaining as well.
