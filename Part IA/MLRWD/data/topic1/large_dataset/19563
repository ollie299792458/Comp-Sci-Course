This movie is the seminal work whose beauty and perfect execution and casting inspired writers of a number of excellent books in its wake. Elizabeth incited a devoted following by presenting the story of the young queen with new insights into the pivotal influences that affected her life, and the course of history.

The beginning of the movie presents us with an England in turmoil: catholic-dominated because of its barren queen, and poised on the edge of internal change because Mary must pass the crown to her hated sister Elizabeth, a protestant, at the time of her death. Elizabeth assumes her regency surrounded by enemies within her cabinet, but having two allies: Lord Robert, a romantic interest and nobleman, and Walsingham, a heretofore unmentioned force in british history who is initially appointed as the queen's chief body guard. Throughout the rest of the story, Walsingham emerges as a ruthless defender of the queen's success. Many books have since adjusted their focus in writing about the virgin queen to include this previously unsung power behind the throne. Lord Walsingham is portrayed by Geoffrey Rush as a man who gives his queen only as much as a fair chance. For success, the real queen relied on her native wit and intelligence to guide her country though religious and political crisis.

Liberties are taken in terms of the timing of certain events and historical figures, but the screenplay and perfect casting of this film well outweigh factual flaws. At the time this movie came to the theater, Ms. Blanchette was an unknown. Her performance in this debut has none of the rough edges of other actors' early films. She springs into the limelight a fully formed talent with an excellent supporting cast. A true dramatic gem.
