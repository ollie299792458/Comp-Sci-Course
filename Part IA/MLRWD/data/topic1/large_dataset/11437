Final Destination
As I sit down to write this review I am trying hard not to recall the events of recent tragedies in the skies. It seems such a shame that people died in such brutal fashion. Even though this is a review I can't help but think of all of those poor people. That aside this is a nifty little thriller that rises above the typical teen horror movie genre clich&eacute;'s that have ruined some horror movies ("Scream 3"). The movie tells the story of what happens when death comes a calling and you have to figure out when exactly it is coming to get you. Devon Sawa plays Alex a guy heading to France with his friends on a school trip. While on the plane Alex has a premonition that the plane is going to explode and after a major commotion is thrown off the plane along with some others. Well after you know what happens the survivors who were not on the plane find themselves the victim of Death as it comes a calling trying to kill them because as one strange character puts it "You can't cheat death". As the survivors die one by one Alex realizes that the killings are occurring the order of which they sat on the airplane. Now Alex must outwit death before it kills everyone including himself. The movie features allot of suspense and jolts to startle even the most fearless viewer. What bothers me about the film though is that the plot never really ends on a satisfactory level leaving us with questions that may never be answered until the unnecessary sequel (for which the film's climax sets up) Still the movie is a fairly good one if you just don't think about it too much too much. Review: *** out of five
