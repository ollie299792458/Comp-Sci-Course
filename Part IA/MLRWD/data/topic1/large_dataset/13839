First things first: I love this film.  I love its unevenness.  I love its drenched decadence and splendor.  I love its inability to stay on a single track.  I love that it avoids the bigotry of _The Birth of a Nation_.  I love its weirdness.

I am bringing a postmodern sensibility to this 1916 film, but although this film frustrated viewers when it was originally released (film historian David Cook suggests that audiences found its four separate story lines too hectic to follow), it seems right in line with today's multi-tasking world.  Is this a flawed film?  In some respects yes.  The film takes place in four different eras but is really only interested in exploring two of them (the present day and ancient Babylon).  There are plenty of intertitles but they're not always helpful.  Griffith's notion of _Intolerance_ doesn't seem very stable, and halfway through the film one realizes that Griffith himself perhaps didn't exactly know what he wanted to say.  And then there's Griffith's stubbornness.  Too many people wrongly read this film as Griffith's apology for the brilliant but bigoted _The Birth of a Nation_, but that is untrue.  _Intolerance_ is Griffith's thick-headed, angry response to the critics who (rightly) attacked _Birth_ as bigoted.  Despite these flaws, however, _Intolerance_ is a dazzling film.  I am not at all surprised that _Intolerance_, more than _The Birth of a Nation_, inspired early Soviet cinema pioneers like Eisenstein.

My favorite moment: an extreme long-shot of the stairs of Babylon, which closes in to a full shot of funky dancers performing a choreographed version of "Walk like an Egyptian."  Enjoy!
