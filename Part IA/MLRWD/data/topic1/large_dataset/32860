Warning-- This is a rare widescreen (16:9) disk which is NOT anamorphic (sometimes labeled as "enhanced for 16:9 televisions").  That means the black bars top and bottom are hard encoded, so instead of the movie having full 480 vertical pixels, its vertical resolution is limited to about 300 pixels. Other than some early Disney titles, this is a rare exeption to the CORRECT way to master a DVD.

Some additional postscripts to help novices think about this: When an anamorphic DVD is played back on a player which is still set to the factory default of "4:3", the player itself is responsible for re-scaling 480 vertical pixels to 300 vertical pixels and putting black bars on top and bottom. This preserves correct aspect ratio (circles are circles not ovals). But when your DVD player is instructed to output to a new "16:9" screen from its set-up menu, then no re-scaling is done and the picture extends from top to bottom of active scan lines. The result is a beautiful widescreen picture with full 480 pixel vertical resolution.

Bottom line: This Dimension Collector's Series of "From Dusk Till Dawn" is not mastered per industry anamorphic standard and looks pretty poor on new widescreen sets.
