I bought these videos because I was getting bored of doing the same workouts at home and needed some variety.  I looked more for dance workouts but couldn't find any that didn't either require a wooden floor (uh, I work out on carpet, sorry) or didn't show the person's feet who was doing the moves.  Needless to say, I hoped these videos would be different.  First off, kudos to Richard for motivating so many people and having fun doing it BUT his screechy voice and constant high pitched yelling WILL get on some people's nerves.  Plus, I didn't care for the fact that there were pauses in between songs (don't want to give your heart rate a chance to drop.  I've never seen people walk 5 minutes on a treamill and then stop briefly), the choreography was at times hard to follow (please keep the camera on Richard so I can figure out what he's doing!) and I didn't feel like I was getting my heart rate up.  Probably really good for people that are just getting started but not so much for those that are advanced and just need that little extra boost.
