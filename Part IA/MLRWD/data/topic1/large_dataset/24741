In the beginning, I have to say that we read the book "The Beach" during English classes at school (I'm from Austria and in the 7th form now) and afterwards, we watched the film.
Well, about two weeks ago we saw "The beach", and I really imagined a completely different film, after I read the book, I was sort of impatient, I wanted to watch the film, but as we started watching the film, I thought, Ok, but...
The, when we continued and I felt more and more worse, about the settings, about the plot, about all the not so important and more important details I missed, about the whole making-off. To my eyes this film is a perfect example for a n Hollywood production - the whole story with all of its psychological contents is reduced, and the movie just contains sex and action scenes (to be watched or to be lucrative). I think this is a miserable production, perhaps the fault of the director, perhaps a fault of Hollywood, perhaps even a fault of the famous main character.
 But I can say to all of you, who saw the film, but didn't like it: Read the book, it's much better!
