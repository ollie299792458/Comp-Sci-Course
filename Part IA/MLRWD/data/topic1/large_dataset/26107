The 1949 movie adaptation of Little Women is my favorite screen version and also one of the most gorgeous adaptations! The story of the four March sisters - Meg [Janet Leigh], Jo [June Allyson], Beth [Margaret O'Brien], and Amy [Elizabeth Taylor] and their mother, Marmie is a classic story that has held its appeal all these years. It's a human drama that is a blend of the comic and tragic and will have sensitive viewers reaching for their hankies during some of the heart-rending scenes [one of the sisters dies].

June Allyson shines as the strong-willed Jo March who dreams of becoming an author and whose feminist ideas are convincingly [though by no means overbearing] portrayed.Elizabeth Taylor's performance as Amy is the best of all the movie adaptations - and her 'growth' from a petulant child to a genteel young woman is very credibly done. Peter Lawford as their next-door neighbor, Laurie is credible but lacks the dashing looks of Christian Bale. This is not important however, as what I liked about Peter Lawford's performance here is the lack of chemistry between him and Allyson, which is apt considering Jo only thinks of Laurie as a brother/friend. I loved Rossano Brazzi's performance as Professor Bhaer [ok, perhaps he was too good-looking to make a credible Bhaer, but his character portrayal was excellent].

Watching this version in its full Technicolor production is a visual delight and will enthrall all fans of the classic novel as well as those who love period dramas.
