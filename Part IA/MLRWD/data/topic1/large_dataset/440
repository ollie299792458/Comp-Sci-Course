One could only imagine the pitch session that led to the making of "What Women Want." Sexy male advertising executive hasn't got a clue what woman are all about. Nor does he really care. Then, one day, an... accident in the bathroom enables him to hear the private thoughts that women are thinking. Yes, all of this sounds pretty stupid. But in the capable hands of director Nancy Meyers and screenwriters Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, "What Women Want" generates enough laughs and pathos to keep you hooked for 126 minutes. Half the fun is watching Mel Gibson cope with his newfound abilities. The other half is watching his character's transformation from sexist hunk to someone quite sensitive to women's needs. Yes, the film is romantic. Yes, the film is sappy. Yes, the film is chock full of stock characters. But underneath, it says something really important about women, why they should be treated as equals and why men should not take advantage of them. In my book, that goes a very long way.
