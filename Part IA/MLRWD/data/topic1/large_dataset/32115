Still the best film I've yet seen. The film has so much in it, it is an experience rather than just a movie. There is much which helps this interpretation, the musical score which is simply astonishing, the scenery, incredible, the story itself, the sense of being there captured through the sound of crickets chirping, you can feel the hot sun beating down on the grass. 
The soldier who looks for a world where his fellow human beings are not ignorant savages escapes the war torn fields of the civil war through a crazy stunt and by travelling through beautiful wilderness encounters an abandoned fort which he rebuilds. Through the journals he keeps his humanity is divulged, the experiences decribed become real, his own meeting with a wolf and the feeling of communication between them totally silent whose sensitivity so rarely seen is something else. The meetings for the first time with the Sioux and the friendships he forms, this is what makes this film more than just a movie. There are few films like this, with Forest Gump, Dr Zhivago and a very few others which approach this raw sense of being there.
No words convey it
