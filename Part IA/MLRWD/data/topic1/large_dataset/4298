For most of this movie, it is a basic 80's teeny-bopper skin flick (for which the 1980s were so famous!).  As I went to high school during the 80s I saw plenty of these types of movies, which made it rather nostalgic.
To be sure, the film has a healthy dose of beautiful women.  And, as is the case with so many 80s movies of this genre, most of them remove their clothes.  Nothing surprising so far, except that the girl on the cover appears nowhere in the movie.
That said, this one had an unexpected twist.  For the last 20 minutes or so, the film crosses over to the dark side and is anything like so many other 80s movies such as HARDBODIES, LOOSE SCREWS, REVENGE OF THE NERDS, etc.  I had a faint feeling that the story was going to have an unhappy ending, but was rather surprised when I found that my premonition was correct.
In short, this is one of the most realistic pseudo-romantic comedies I've ever seen in my life.  I could relate so well to the main character that I actually felt physically wounded, seeing what he had to endure.  
The old adage that "Nice guys finish last" is something that almost no women believe, but every guy knows is true.  The nice guys know it, just like the narcissistic fellows.  While women traditionally deny the veracity of the tenet, selfish guys instead encourage nice guys to be more self-centered and egotistical.  To we guys, no matter who or what we are, there is no mystery that the adage is dead-on.
All of these factors make this a worthwhile movie to watch.  To my fellow nice-guys out there, this one is for US!  Watch it, feel it &amp; remember the times in your life when you felt just like the persona in the film.
