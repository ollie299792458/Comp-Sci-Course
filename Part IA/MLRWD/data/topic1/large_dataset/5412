Okay, let's face it. Now a days horror films just aren't scary anymore. They seem to be more comedic than anything. Well, this is a film that has all of the above.
Paul Walker plays Lewis Thomas, and Steve Zahn plays Fuller Thomas, his completely opposite brother. After bailing his brother out of jail, Lewis and Fuller take a road trip to Colorado to pick up their friend Venna Wilcox, played by Leelee Sobieski. However, on the way there, not too intelligent Fuller decides to have a little fun over the cb radio. They end up messing with the wrong guy, known only as rusty nail, and end up running for their lives. This film will deffinately have you at the edge of your seat wondering what move will be made next. This film may be very tense, but it is also very humorous. The cast of this film deliver an amazing performance that was better than I even expected. 
The dvd has special features like a 29 minute alternate ending that I highly reccommend watching. You'll feel like you're sitting through a whole new movie all over again.
