Let It Be is often attacked as a weak ending to a fantastic career.  The thing is, it wasn't the end.  Abbey Road was the final album and the Beatles combined to end their career mastefully.  Let It Be on the other hand is far from being as good as that album...however, it still has important qualities.  It was intended as a return to roots and parts of it (those not "re-produced" by Spector) are the rawest music since Please Please Me.  Also, the songs, for the most part, are great...some of them showing the Beatles in a slightly different light.  Besides, it's a welcome change from studio experimentation (not that there's anything wrong with that).  And for those Beatle fans out there who haven't bought this yet, do you really want to be without the album which (kind of) united two of the most important music acts of the 60s (i.e. the Beatles and Phil Spector)?  But what really impresses me abou this album is how it predicts the future.  By combining a return to the roots with Spectors over the top production, the album sums up the following half-decades country music boom combining with pop-fluff in the same category such as Desperado and Born to Run (supposedly roots based music).  Any time an album can accurately predict the music that follows it for a decade or so you know it's important.
