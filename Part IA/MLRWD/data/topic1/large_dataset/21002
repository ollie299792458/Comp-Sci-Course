I have only seen this film once, probably about 15 years ago when I was in my early twenties, but it stays with me as one of my all time favourites.  I had scived an afternoon off work, came home with a bottle of wine, turned the TV on and Summertime or Summer Madness as it was called in the UK appeared.  I instantly fell in love with this film, probably because I am a romantic at heart and you want the girl to get her man !  The innocence of Hepburn in this film is there for all to see, she gives her all and you cannot help but feel for this very naive woman in a city where inexperience in love is rare.  Venice itself is shown to be a beautiful city, alive and full of energy, a perfect setting for this story to unfold. 
I am English and live in the UK and have been unable to get a video copy of this film that will play on my TV, but I would recommend this film to anybody who enjoys a love story.  It tugs at your heart and really does stay with you as one of Hepburns best films and her main main Rossano Brazzi is great too, he plays her emotions magnificently - Sit back and enjoy a truly wonderful film...
