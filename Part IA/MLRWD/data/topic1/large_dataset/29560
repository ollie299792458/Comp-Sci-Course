This has fast become the king of a catagory I call "Saturday Afternoon Stupid Movies".  I'm not saying this is a stupid movie, as this is probably one of THE BEST movies to come out of the seventies!  Saturday afternoon stipid movies are whisical films you wouldn't pay $7 to see, but are good, brainless entertainment for those lazy satruday afternoons when there is nothing better to do.  This movies has been played to death by the networks, and edited all to hell as well, which is a shame.  I hgave to urege you to buy a copy and watch it without all the network senorship; it's almost a completely different movie!  This is frome the era where Burt Reynolds was king of the "B" movies, and he is at the top of his game as a cool customer here.  Sally Fields did this role before her acadamy awards, and played great opposite of Burt.  Jerry Reed put in one of his best acting jobs as well as the musical score.  Jackie gleason is the real scene stealer here, though, as Sherrif Buford T. Justice, the bumbleing, tenatious Texas Sherriff.  I wish Gleason had more roles like this, as his timing and expressions are absoulutely priceless.  This wouldn't have been half the movie it was without Gleason.  At under $10, buy it!  This movie belongs in everyone's collection!
