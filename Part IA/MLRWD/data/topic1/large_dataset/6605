Late in the movie, a character asks:

  "What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to recount all the points in my life leading up to this moment, and then hope that it's coherent; that it makes some sort of sense to you. It doesn't make any sense to me. You know, I was there. And I don't have the slightest idea who I am. And I'm supposed to be able to explain it to you..."

The film believes that open, sincere discussion can make us aware of the solutions to most of our lives' problems. But it's not necessarily something a therapist or even a husband and wife can always accomplish. Effective discussion probes into the depths of our minds. Effective discussion finds a way underneath the surface of our routine, everyday thoughts; reaches deep into our memories; and illuminates those choices/values that matter most, that best define who we are.

The topic the film talks most about is sex, as you probably guessed. But it goes deeper than that, too, into how we define ourselves, how we live our lives.

The film is enormously ambitious, and succeeds beautifully.

I will watch this one many more times.
