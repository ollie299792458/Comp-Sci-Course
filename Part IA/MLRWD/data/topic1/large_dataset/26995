Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame tells the tale of a radio talk-show host (Jeff Bridges) whose thoughtless on-air remark inspires a massacre.  In a fit of self-loathing, he quits his job and survives on the good will of his dovoted girlfriend (Mercedes Ruehl--who won an Academy Award for her part in this film).  While wandering drunk on the streets, he attacked by street thugs, but his life is saved by a deranged homeless man (Robin Williams at his most insane).  He learns the man went insane, when his wife was killed in the massacre inspired by Bridges's character.  Seeing this as a chance for redemption, he tries to help the man, but is drawn into the man's delusion that he is a knight on a quest for the Holy Grail.

While this story has been done countless times in countless ways, Gilliam gives it a fresh spin with a lot of heart.  The actors each shine in their own way.  Ruehl earned an Oscar for best supporting actress and very much deserved it.  The film is funny, but often very dark.  Well worth seeing, but not for everyone.
