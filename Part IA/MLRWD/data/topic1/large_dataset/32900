I don't get it!?  All 12 reviewers before me give KABLUEY very high marks.  I purchased this film on a friend's recommendation and took it to dinner at the home of a couple of other friends.  After eating a great meal we sat down to enjoy the movie.  Somehow we knew we were in trouble around the first fifteen minutes, or so.  We just didn't connect with the rather weak story, the contrived characters or the extremely flat production.  About 40-minutes in we determined there was no way things would get better, so we decided to call it quits.  But after stopping the DVD we wanted to see how the movie ended, so we popped it back in the player and went to the last few chapters.  It turns out we were pretty much on the money in predicting how it would end.  So, in addition to being hopelessly boring, it also suffered from a bad and totally predictable screenplay.  KABLUEY was an unfortunate waste of time that tried very hard to get laughs and failed miserably.  I would give in no stars if I could.
