To be honest, I rented Ginger Snaps for the first time because the cover was fascinating (yes I judged it by its cover) and the two girls on the cover (whom I later learned to be Ginger and Bridgette) gave me goosebumps. When I first watched it, I believe the movie had just came out, in America, and I was either 12 or 13, so the movie sat well with me (I am indeed an odd child). The disturbing slide show in the very beginning of the movie made me laugh and kept my attention for the 'real gore' later on. As the movie progressed I was entranced by the beauty of the movie, the blend of soundtrack and film was perfect, and the actors fit their parts well. The devotion of Bridgette to Ginger, and Ginger to Bridgette (though she didn't want to show it) was beautifully pulled to its peak at the end of the movie, when (well I don't want to spill the ending) but when Bridgette's love for her sister is finally put to the test. Most of my friends hate this movie, but I love it. A warning, if you don't like a lot of blood and gore, even though it's well, fake, I wouldn't watch this. There's enough death and blood in this movie to feed a population of vampires.
