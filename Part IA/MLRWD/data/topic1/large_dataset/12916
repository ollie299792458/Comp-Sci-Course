This ensemble cast plays the same characters (with the exception of Julie Strain who goes from bad "guy" to good "guy" during the series), hardbodied American CIA agent types that have a pentient for blowing things up, shooting unique weapons and best of all, getting naked!  There are also a couple of brothers who play the bufoon role and are actually pretty funny.
  The usual setting is Hawaii and one gets a real feel for the Islands watching these high value production romps.  Like in real life, most of the gunfire misses its targets, but when there is a "hit" the cheesy paint ball type red spots keeps the killings light hearted, just what you'd want from movies meant to entertain.
  Julie Strain is her usual kick-a_s, take no prisoners type, whether she's on the right side of the law or not, and my, my, my, she has certainly aged well.  Not to let the gorgeous and ever busty youths gain anything on her, she displays her "abilities" (both of them) well enough to set a fine example for the future of the younger set (pun intended).
  Did I mention you get all 12 movies for under $6!  Now that's a bargain.  About 5 cents per shot of beautiful naked women!
  The only thing these iconic Andy Sidaris films are missing is the great Shannon Tweed, but she might be out of Andy's budget.
  Buy this set and watch again and again.  But stay well back from the screen, because a couple of these agents can "poke your eyes out with those things"!
