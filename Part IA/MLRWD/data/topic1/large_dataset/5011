Sony released DVD sets of these colorized episodes of BEWITCHED about a year ago in Japan. They included a special feature documentary about how they restored and colorized the first two seasons (Season's 1,2 & 3 were released almost simultaneously in Japan).  Apparently, they were colorized without altering the original B&W.  The original greyscale and density were not affected by the process.  So, yes..you can turn down the color on your set and view the eps. in their original B&W appearance. You can read a review about the colorized episodes and how they compare to season 3, which was the first season to be shot in color here: http://www.dvdscan.com/bewitched_jp.htm

(An interesting note to this article is that each of the box sets in Japan were missing 1 or 2 episodes, reportedly due to an inability to restore the audio tracks to some scenes.  Yet, we get all 36 episodes released here in the U.S... how odd.)

This is why I chose the color set over the B&W.  Plus, I already owned several of the original B&W episodes on VHS from Columbia House, so being able to now see them in color makes them different & fun to watch.  Whichever you choose to buy, this show is one of the greatest sitcoms in television history.  The first two season's are the best.  There are even some elements of drama in some of these early episodes that seem to be missing from the writing as the series went on. Hopefully Sony will continue to release more seasons on DVD.
