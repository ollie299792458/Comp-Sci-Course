This is an outstanding release of three of the very best Christmas specials ever.  
The Year Without A Santa Claus is an extraordinary work.  The plot is intriguing, the music is devine, and the voice actors are extraordinary.  Mickey Rooney and Shirley Booth are the quintessential Santa and Mrs. Claus.  Much has been written about the dynamic duo of Heat Miser and Snow Miser, but has anyone else noticed that Snow Miser bears a striking resemblance to James Woods and that Heat Miser looks just like John Goodman?  One of the lovliest songs ever written about Christmas is included in this special: "I Believe In Santa Claus," sung touchingly by Mickey Rooney.  When the special first came out in the 70's I was just about at that age where I started to question Santa's existence, but after hearing Mr. Rooney sing that song, I believed once more.  "I believe in Santa Claus, like I believe in love.  I believe in Santa Claus, and everything he does.  There's no question in my heart that he indeed exists.  Just like love, he's always there, waiting to be missed."
"Rudolph's Shiny New Year," is a gem itself.  Red Skelton steals the show with his many voices, and the whimsical animation is charming.  How many of us wouldn't like to go back to the archipeligos of time and find our joy again?
"Nestor," is a three-hanky boo hoo, and absolutely wonderful.  It shares the message of the hope of the Christ Child without becoming a preachy mess.
You can't go wrong with this set of joyful entertainment.
