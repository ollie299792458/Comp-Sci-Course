I have read about a dozen books on The Doors. Needless to say they are one of the GREATEST bands ever to enter the human ear. In fact, I personally, believe they are the GREATEST band ever (Yes, even better than the  Beatles), so I'd have to say the movie was not what it should have been.  The Doors were art. The movie was not. The movie prefered to concentrate on  the (semi-fiction) "antics" of a mentally unbalanced Jim  Morrison, instead of the poetic side. Also the movie did not live up to  it's own title! It's called "The Doors," not "The life and  times of Jim Morrison!" It should have concentrated on the band more  (not to say Jim was not a very interesting person...HE WAS!!!) Anyhow,  other than a few lies (ok, more than a few) it's overall an entertaining  movie. Watch it for Val Kilmer as Jim (EXCELLENT performance!!), watch it  for the WONDERFUL concert scenes, and watch it for the great soundtrack,  but don't count on a truthful account of the greatest band EVER!
