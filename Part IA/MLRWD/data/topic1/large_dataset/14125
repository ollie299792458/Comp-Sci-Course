In the beginning of the film, when Edward appears, I said myself "How may I watch such a film?" But as I watch a little more I noticed that this film was a really excellent film, which is full of psychology. It was about Edward, who is not a real human, I think. The mysterious old man in the old building probably produced him. After she brought him to her house the neighbors loved him. Also he loved everybody especially the young girl. Nevertheless I think these happened very fast. No adaptation could be seen. Only the girl was frightened when she saw him, but she loved him very fast, too. There was also comedy in the film. I think the scenes, which Edward was cutting the neighbors' hair, were only for fun. May be the scenarist wanted to find a reason for people to love him. The scene in which the friends of the girl make Edward a thief was very strong. But the dishonesty of the boys made the film more similar to the normal films, I think. But I am sure that the most electrifying scenes were the last scenes. I mean the scenes after Edward started to be angry. But it can also be said that it was too emotional. Finally I think the design was actually good. Since Johnny Depp was perfect it was impossible for this film to be wonderful. I can watch it several times.
