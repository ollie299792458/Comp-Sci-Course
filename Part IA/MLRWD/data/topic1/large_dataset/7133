I went and saw this movie in the theater a couple of days after it came out and I was a bit nervous, since it had gotten such awful reviews.  In fact, it ended up being a wonderful cinema experience.  I've played D&amp;D since I was 15 (now I'm 22) and the film really captures the experience of playing the game.  There are so many in-jokes for gamers in this movie.  For instance, the characters wear black hooded cloaks in the middle of the marketplace to disguise themselves from Damodar and his thugs, something that looks ridiculous but never fails to work in a D&amp;D game.  Also, I loved the part where Ridley and Snails laugh at Marina because she's a "low-level mage" and we all know that "low-level mages are practically useless."  Ordinary folks should like this movie too.  There is no moral relativism, so you can really root for the good guys and pick out the bad guys immediately.  It's a fun popcorn flick and it doesn't pretend to be anything else.  Some people are saying that the acting is bad.  I would say that I was only disappointed by Thora Birch's acting, because she is very, very wooden, as if she doesn't know what she's doing in the movie.  Jeremy Irons has a blast and hams it up, but then again, what would you expect to find from a megalomanical evil wizard?  Marlon Wayans as Snails was a fun character and very heroic (as can be seen in his scenes with Damodar), definitely not a "Steppen Fetchit-like" character as some critics suggested (people are too sensitive.)  I would have to say, however, that the script could have used a little more work.  The characters of Norda the elf and Elwood the dwarf don't seem to have any purpose, even though the actors do the best they can with the roles.  Also, there could have been more summary in the beginning of the film to help the uninitiated learn what are elves, dwarfs, mages, etc.  Those changes are the only reason I did not give this film 5 stars.
