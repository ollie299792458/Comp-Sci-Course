Sadly this is a disappointing film about a great thinker. Assante is not too bad in the role of Nietzsche but is let down by the supporting cast who are unconvincing; the plot which is meandering and directionless; and the absurd dream sequences which add nothing to the movie and only serve to distract you further.

This had the potential to be a great movie but instead it seems to drag on interminably. I never fall asleep during movies but actually felt compelled to have a snooze rather than persevere with such nonsense. Even as an introduction to the ideas of Nietzsche this movie does not make a convincing case. You would be much better investing the couple of hours into reading his Ecce Homo or some of Thus Spoke Zarathustra.

If they gave Assante a decent plot involving some of the more interesting aspects of Nietzsche's life such as his falling out with Wagner and Lou Salome, explored how his philosophy developed out of the many problems he faced and tracked his descent into insanity, it would be worth watching. As it stands, I wouldn't bother with the movie at all, unless you feel like boring yourself into a stupour.
