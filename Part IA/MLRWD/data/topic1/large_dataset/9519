This movie is not your average horror movie or werewolf movie either, it is much much more.

1st of all its shot like a military movie starting off with war games being played by the brittish militay. but when are unit shows up to do battle with a elite group of brittish special opps we really get started.

  we find a bunch of mutilated corpse's shreaded to pcs (note this is special opps) and now the action really starts. see there are werewolfs everywhere and now our unit is under attack. they manage to fend them off and get to a run down house in the woods to use as a base. during the escape the colonel has had his guts pulled out and now has to have them crazy glued back in.

at the shack there is tons of fighting relentless attacks from werewolfs and tons of blood and gore. the movie has a very intense feel to it throughout and the acting by the brittish soldiers was very realistic and comical with all the brittish slang and funny stories.

  i highly recomend this film its fairly new (2002) and seems to have a decent budget as the effects seem really well done.

  now onto the "DOGsoldiers" the wolfs are done great and the director does a great job of showing them through shadows , behind tree, moving very fast all well sort of camoflauged(my spelling notsogood) so you really dont see all of them tell there in the house and this works very well. you assume its cause they may look cheap but they actually look great(better than the howling by far) and they r f*cking huge like 7' tall and very well done.

in closing highly recomended a great watch,gorey and brilliantly done very bloody and a intense feel all through reminded me a little of predator (no arnold but some good laughs) and a little of platoon because of the great military feel to it.

 if u want to watch something bloody gorey lots o guns and sweet looking were wolfs **this is the movie 4 u** rent this
