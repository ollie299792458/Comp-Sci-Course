Despite a lot of negative reviews, the Bone Collector is not a bad movie.  The problem is, that we have all seen this sort of thing before. The  psychopath theme is so well known, that every new movie can be linked to an  older one. In this case, there are similarities with a lot of movies.  Rutger Hauer's Bone Daddy springs to mind, but Silence of the Lambs, Evil  has a Face and a lot of others also contributed. Still, th Bone Collector  holds enough new elements to be interesting. The characters are worked out  rather better then usual and the gruesome details of the murders are  treated with less then the normal circumspection. The movie is borne by the  actors, not by the script, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The one  point, that I really disliked is the final scene. The 'everything comes  right at Christmas' idea is already too sentimental for my taste and in a  movie like this it does not have a place. While this movie may not appeal  to everybody, it should be perfectly acceptable to fans of the genre.
