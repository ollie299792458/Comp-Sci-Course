TRON is the story of a video game designer digitized into the world of a computer where he must overcome the tyranny of a greedy executive in the real world through a confrontation with an oppressive force called the "Master Control Program"

  I remember seeing this film as a kid in the theatre and was awed by the computerized graphics.  Although the action scenes were pretty intense, the more dramatic momemnts were a bit awkward and plodding.

  Watching the TRON SPECIAL EDITION DVD today, I find TRON to be not as dated as I assumed it would be.  The CGI effects are simple compared to today, but still attractive and immersive.  Looking back, it is interesting how much the plot parallels the cold war drama of the real world at play during the early eighties.

  The DVD transfer is quite good and the sound, with Wendy Carlos soundtrack, is excellent.

  Overall, I do recommend this DVD for the good film itself as well as the quality of this DVD transfer.
