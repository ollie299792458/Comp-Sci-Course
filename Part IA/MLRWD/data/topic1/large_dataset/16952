I almost gave up on this movie.  About one-third of the way through and I was bored senseless.  There seemed to be no forward movement and the acting felt stagnant.  I knew that Denzel Washington couldn't let me down in this way and Jurnee Smollett is just too captivating of an actress to not keep my attention, so I decided to give it jus a little bit more time.

Once we hit the halfway point I was hooked, I do not know for sure what happened, but the storyline started to evolve and I was becoming more attached to the characters and the story they were telling.

Based on the true story of Melvin B. Tolson, a professor at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, who inspired his students to form the school's first debate team.  Not just any debate team, but a team from a small rural all-African-American college during the height of the depression.  A team that would one day take on the likes of Harvard in the national championship and would go on to record one of the greatest debate records of their time.

I do not know if this movie will appeal to all, but if you stick with it and watch the extra footage at the end of the DVD, you will get a completely new appreciation of the people and the times.  This was an extraordinary group of young people and to see what they have achieved since is in itself remarkable.
