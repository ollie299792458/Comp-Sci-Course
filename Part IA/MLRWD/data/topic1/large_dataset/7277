I liked "Dogma"  With it's star studded cast of Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, Linda Fiorentino, Alanis Morissette, and Jay and Silent Bob.  What could go wrong right?  The film was funny but to cluttered.  The filmmaking was cluttered and not up to par.  Kevin Smithis a great director but he made this film cluttered.  Here is the plot:
Two banished angels (Affleck and Damon) find a loophole that would get them back into Heaven so they set off to go.  The only problem is that if they got back into heaven it would prove that God (Morissette) would not be perfect and the world would end.  So a girl (Fiorentino), the 13th Aposile (Rock), an angel (Hayek), and Jay and Silent Bob set off to stop them. 
Seems like a good plot, right?  It is and the acting is great, especcially by a very funny Rock and Jay and Silent Bob, but Kevin Smith makes the movie cluttered and sub-par bringing this funny and good movie down to four stars.  This movie is incredibly funny, with jokes about sex and religion including Rock saying Jesus was black.  Rent it but the directing wasn't the best because it was to cluttered.
Rated R for humor, language, violence, nudity, and drug content.
