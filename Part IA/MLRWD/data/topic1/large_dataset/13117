So i broke down and bought this today. I had originally bought the first five single dvd's that came out (where it all began, dance your cares away, etc.), then rebought most of those epesodes with the first three season releases. I figured, "What the heck. I'll suck it up and buy it." Let me tell you that those of you who decided not too are better off.  This is just awful.

First, the packaging is horrible. The binder like book that the dvd's are held in makes it very easy for them to fall out and come loose in the box. When first opened it, about a third of the discs were out of the sleeves.

Second is the Bonus material. there are some new on disc pieces that were not offered on the first three sets, but thats pretty much it.  none of the extra little things that made the other sets fun (like the character art pages from season three). The only non-disc extra in the box is a poster sized concept art picture of "The fraggle rock universe".

And third, it even lacks the one sentence synopsis of the episodes that was included with the other season releases. It just lists the names of the episodes on the pages opposite the discs.

It seems that all the thought that went into making the first three season sets special went right out the door when they came up nwith the idea for this set. It's simply a plan to drain money out of fans, and i guess they got away with one here.  I higly reccommend NOT BUYING THIS SET.  rather wait and hope they release the fourth season by itself with some actual thought for the fans.

Hope this helps at least one person.
