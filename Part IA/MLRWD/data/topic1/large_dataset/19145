This was one of my favorite movies of 2008.
I don't know HOW people are saying this was like Forest Gump. They're nothing alike, past both being great movies.
The tone of the movie is completely different. The language formation isnt anything like Forest Gump either. Clearly, the people who think so either saw something I missed, or (I think)just didn't get the movie.
Clearly, its a story about something that hasn't actually happened and more likely than not, never will. That aside, the characters are as believable as any other fiction of this sort if not more so.
I also didn't think this move was about his ineveitable death so much as what he did while he was alive. The ultimate 'you may never see tomorrow, so do what you can with today' movie. If you were depressed with the turns in this movie than you missed the whole point.
Everything about this movie was beautiful, endearing even. The score, the filming, the amazing fx, and brilliant actors made this movie the best I have seen in a VERY long time.
