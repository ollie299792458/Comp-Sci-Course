For me, this 22 cartoon set is pretty much season 4 of the Original.  Some say its not canonical because shows AFTER this animated series didnt follow the storyline, one example, The cartoon series in 1974 said that the very first Capt of the Enterprise was Capt. April, then in 2001 comes "Enterprise" series saying it's "Archer".  So Then they call the animated non-canonical, BS!!!!!  "Enterprise" is non-canonical if they are too stupid not to use the correct name, thsi BS about being canonical or not all stem from shows AFTER the animated series, there is no contradiction from the Original and Animadted.  The real problem was hiring some pretty bad writers in the 90's and beyond who had no clue about star trek and star trek history, other than common knowledge of the show.

The budget was ok on this series, but Doohan did so many of the voices, its gets old, I wish they had a slightly higher budget and hired extra voices for alien characters, and I wish NBC didnt cancel the show after only 22 episodes, I mean think about it, this series could have went on for 5 years, 8 years, you have the original cast!  The problem was this was no "kids" show, the scripts were way above a 6 year olds head.  They shouda ran it sunday night or monday night as they run cartoons now like "The Family Guy" or "The Simpsons".

Just another example how idiotic tv execs are and how out of touch they can be, oh well, at least we have these 22 gems, just wish there were more of them.
