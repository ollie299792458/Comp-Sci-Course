I had caught bits and pieces of this program on TV over the years, but never more than that. I finally got around to watching a whole section in sequence. It is a bit bizarre, but I have to say, it is very entertaining.

Prince Edmund (son of the fictional King Richard IV of England) is the main character in the series - he adopts the name Black Adder. Richard becomes King when Edmund "accidentally" kills Richard III.

Black Adder seems to always come out with the short end of the stick, but never gives up. Given the circumstances, it is hard to label him as the bad guy - though he is pretty bad. His sidekicks are Lord Percy and Baldrick the peasant - they help keep things interesting.

Black Adder's mother is a great character. It is really funny to see how she saves her son from being burned at the stake in the Witchsmeller episode. Very unexpected.

I guess this program is sort of like Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I mean, the humor is similar in some ways. Very British I guess.

The program continued through several series. Give series I a try and see what you think. Some say series II and/or III are the best. I have not gotten that far, so cannot comment on that now.
