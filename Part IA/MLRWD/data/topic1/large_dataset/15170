I loved this movie on several levels. First, and least important, any movie with Zeta Jones is good by definition, even if she's pregnant. Second, the screenplay is well written, tense, and keeps your attention. The Zeta's character develops from a blissfully ignorant stay at home mom to a take charge drug kingpin pro tem, in a fascinating way. Third and most important, the social issue.
The drug czars daughter develops a drug problem; her preppie boyfriend tells the drug czar "It is easier for a teenager to buy drugs than alcohol or cigarettes" Here, in this one phrase is the whole drug war conundrum, thesis, antithesis and synthesis, if you want dialectic materialism. The degradation of the African-American neighborhoods by the drug seeking adoloescents, the effect on the neighboring countries. How can any public officer remain honest, in the face of the amounts of money that the drug trade brings, and in addition, the alternative; silver or lead is the question, the answer is obvious.
The answer to the question of what to do, is hinted at, in the drug czar's speech, If there is a war on drugs, our children are the enemy, and I wont fight our children.
Watch this movie, it is worth it.
