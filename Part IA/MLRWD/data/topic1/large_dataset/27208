First of all we have a strong female character (Nicole Kidman no less) who is fighting for the life of her son. The invasion of the alien spores has caused people to behave parallel to how our society is functioning today. We have lost the feminine value in society and we all function as aggressive machines. We do what everyone tells us to do by doing, buying, living how they tell us. The feminine heroine is fighting for the child, because the government-like authoritarian paternal conservative (they dress conservative in the movie) society wants him dead. This is metaphor for how we are destroying that in us which is lively, real, true, and holds hope for our future. The child is a threat to society. Is this not how we are functioning today? Anyone with new ideas needs to be eradicated. Does not fit in the mold. Suppress him. Better yet, kill him. But the feminine value in all of us with her nurturing. mothering side can be the savior for the child.

Other reasons this movie rocks is the editing. Great job in editing. The only thing I can say was a bit disappointing was the ending. It was a bit weak, but I still LOVE this movie!
