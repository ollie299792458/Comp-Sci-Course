What can be said about Bruce Dickinson.  He certainly needs no introduction. Back in the early nineties when he announced he was leaving Maiden I was crushed. But his music kept my hopes up and gave me something besides Maiden to listen to.  It wasn't Maiden, but it was still fun and interesting. After Skunkworks (his most risky musical venture) he started to go back to his melodic metal roots - it was only a matter of time before his return to the Beast.

Fortunately, he kept making albums. They all have their strong and weak points - but one thing is persistent - Bruce Dickinson can sing his throat out and make your skin shiver. As a huge fan of Maiden and of Bruce, I ordered this DVD with high hopes.

This DVD set delivered and surpassed my expectation.  I thought I was getting two DVD's, instead I got three!!!  All of them rule, all of them will knock you off your seat and start headbanging.

DVD 1 has two live shows - one with his Tattoed Millionaire era band (which also includes the energetic Maiden master guitarist Janick Gers), and the other show is with his Skunkworks era band.

DVD 2 includes 10 songs found in Bruce's live release "Scream for Me Brazil."  The songs here are from "Accident of Birth" and "The Chemical Wedding."  (Another Maiden master guitarist, Adrian Smith, also performs alongside Dickinson).

DVD 3 has all Bruce's videos from "Tattoed Millionaire" all the way to his most recent one "Abduction" from his latest studio release "Tyranny of Souls."  It also features an interview and a surreal video of Bruce's first video when he was fronting the band Samson (before joining Maiden in the early 80's).

If you love Iron Maiden, and also appreciate Bruce Dickinson's solo work, this DVD will definitely not dissapoint.  Maiden has inspired me for years, and Bruce has been a big part of that for just as long. Long live the Beast, long live Eddie, and long live Bruce.
