This is the film Kristen Stewart was shooting when first approached about "Twilight."

Those expecting a comedy may feel short changed.  Comic elements surround a bittersweet but ultimately satisfying core story and prevent it from getting too dark.

This is writer/director Greg Mottolo's reminiscence about a summer job in 1985.

Jesse Eisenberg ("James") and Kristen Stewart ("Em") have a lot in common.  Both are out of high school and attending college in the fall.  They meet as summer employees at an amusement park and are drawn to each other, but things are not all that they appear. He's a virgin, and she's not ...  and there's a car crash there waiting to happen.

Roger Ebert wrote:  "What surprised me was how much I admired Kristen Stewart, who in "Twilight," was playing below her grade level. Here is an actress ready to do important things. Together [with Eisenberg] and with the others, they make "Adventureland" more real and more touching than it may sound."

Take his word for it.

Kristen Stewart's "Em" comes alive as a real person you won't soon forget.

Don't expect laughs -- expect to be deeply moved.

This movie is honest and sincere, with real substance.
