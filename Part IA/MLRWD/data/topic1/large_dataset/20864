Put the children to bed, unplug the phone, get out the tissues and refuse to watch this movie with anybody who likes to talk during a movie. You will be blown away.
Holocaust and comedy. Two words never spoken in the same  breath before "Life is Beautiful." To smiply label this movie as  such, would do it injustice. Every emotion comes into play during the  viewing. You soon begin to empathize with Roberto Benigni as he portrays a  father trying to keep the harsh realities of a German concentration camp  from his young son. Benigni protects his son with two weapons that the  German's could not seize: Humor and Imagination.
I thoroughly enjoyed  this movie, and yes I cried. But I also laughed and smiled.
I recommend  the Sub-title version of the movie. After five minutes the reading becomes  natural and the depth to which you become involved with the movie is well  worth it.
I so enjoyed the music in this movie, that I purchased  "Tales of Hoffman" by Offenbach. The second playing of this piece  in the movie will not allow you to maintain dry eyes.
