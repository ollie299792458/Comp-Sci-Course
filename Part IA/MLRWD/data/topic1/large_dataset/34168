This movie is great on many levels.  For a baby-boomer like me who remembers the fifties it reminds me of growing up and watching the "crazy" teenagers in my neighborhood. If that's all you get out of the movie it satisfies. As a high school student in the sixties it reminds me of the major cultural and economic shift that occurred.  If you graduated from high school in the mid-sixties you know what I'm talking about.  And, if you lived in the northeastern U.S. and came from a diverse community, you remember that changes that occurred from 1962 on.  While some of it was painful, it was also liberating and I learned a lot about myself, about people not like me, and and about people who I thought were like me--members of white, lower-middle class (or was it upper-lower class?)  
The subtext is on point and I am always blown away when the character, named not too subtlely "Whitey" describes Margaret as a "coloured" girl. I've made sure my teenagers have seen the movie, but doubt the reading theme which I love, hits them the way it hits me. Most of all it provides memories--too many to recount here, like the screen when the TV was off, and the "fifties" women with heels and aprons.  I never saw anyone's mother dressed like that!
Enough said, just buy or rent and enjoy.
It's a beautiful movie.
