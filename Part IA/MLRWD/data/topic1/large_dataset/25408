The Magic Christian is an inspired, wacky sixties film, based on the brilliant novel by Terry Southern. Appearing with Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr in the film are Pythons John Cleese and Graham Chapman, Goon Show alumnus Spike Milligan, Christopher Lee, Racquel Welch, Roman Polanski, and Yul Brenner as a lounge-singing transvestite. Paul McCartney wrote the film's theme song 'Come And Get It' performed by Badfinger. I have to admit, this movie makes me laugh. It's a great vehicle for Peter Sellers as the not-so-business-like Guy Grande, and Ringo as his newly adopted adult son. In the story, multi-millionaire Grande has determined that one can use money to teach lessons about the ugliness of greed, elitism, snobbiness, and authority. It is typical of british comedies of the late sixties inasmuch as it climaxes with a scene of things dissolving into general chaos. On the other hand, the humor itself seems very untypical and funny. Some people may not "get" this movie... probably the same people that don't find Monty Python funny. Generally, if you enjoy irreverant, quirky humor, you'll find The Magic Christian entertaining.
