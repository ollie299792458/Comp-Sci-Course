"Guys and Dolls" is a 1955 musical, based on a Broadway show, which was itself based on the stories of Damon Runyon. Runyon was known for tales of low-level criminals who spoke in improbably formal dialogue. (If you've seen Fat Tony on "The Simpsons", that's it.) Some of the actors here pull this off better than others.
The plot is really irrelevant to the fun, but in brief: Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is in need of money so he can secure a location for his crap game. He makes a bet with legendary gambler Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that Masterson will not be able to win a date to Havana with the missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). Meanwhile, Detroit has his own problems with longtime girlfriend Adelaide (Vivian Blaine), who wants to set a wedding date.
The idea of Marlon Brando in a musical may be enough of a novelty to draw people in. I am happy to report that his singing voice, while unspectacular, is pleasant enough, and he dances a fair amount as well. He also does the best job of making the dialogue sound convincing (although, when he promised to save the struggling mission, I couldn't resist adding, "He'll make them an offer they can't refuse"). He and Simmons (whose singing voice was dubbed) show real charm and chemistry in their scenes together.
My big complaint about the film is the length (2 1/2 hours). A few songs, and probably some of the story concerning Nathan and Adelaide, could have been cut. Some of the musical numbers that are great on stage look awkward on film. But there are also some very good ones, notably Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down You're Rocking the Boat." In general the director, Joseph Mankiewicz, seems more comfortable staging dialogue.
This isn't a great film, but it's quite entertaining.
