If you like a "edge of your seat" movie then check out Air Force One and you will not be dissapointed. I originally saw it in the theater and the DVD does it justice (especially if you're watching it in a  home-theater setting!). Watching the movie with the Director's narration is  almost as good as the movie itself.
Harrison Ford's character is a bit  too honest and upright to be a believable president but he put in what I  think is one of his best performances to date. Gary Oldman is very  effective in his role as a Kazakhstani who is willing to die for his cause  and injected a tremendous amount of energy into the film.
What makes this  movie work is that you get to watch something happen that is improbable and  that is something audiences can't get enough of (example: Independace Day ,  etc). Yes, there are some technical aspects of the story that you need to  be willing to overlook, like terrorists walking  onto Air Force One posing  as journalists (yes, reporters really do fly on the plane, but they are  "familiar faces" to the crew).
So if you are thinking about  adding this movie to your collection, do it! You will enjoy every minute of  it!
