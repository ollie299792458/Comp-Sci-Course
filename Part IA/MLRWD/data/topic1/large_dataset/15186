It took some convincing for me to actually go to a theater to see a movie with Tom Cruise in it. But i did, and it was one of the top best decisions i've made this year so far. I could never understand why i hear this movie  being called "boring."  Magnolia had me laughing, angry, and in  tears. Julianne Moore's angry pharmacy scene was fantastic and powerful.  With the movie's brilliant variety of characters, you will find someone to  relate to in this movie. Magnolia gives its audiences subject topics that  we all deal with at some point of our lives, directly or indirectly, but  nonetheless we are faced with these topics: death, abuse, adultery,  nonexistent relationships between relatives, drug use, insecurity, the  desire to always succeed, and the yearning to find someone who will love  you unconditionally.  I probably forgot to mention some stuff because just  thinking about this movie gets me feeling like i'm still in the theater.  All these characters have obvious flaws that they bring to the screen with  realness.  This isn't about Hollywood glamor and wealth.  Magnolia has such  an eerie, breathtaking way of making you feel at home.
