A while back I was perusing Rachel McAdams' imdb.com credits and saw a season of Slings & Arrows amongst her earlier work.  Being a big fan of Ms McAdams and noting that my local library system had Season 1 in the system I requested that it be sent over to my local branch and picked it up when the powers of the library system deigned me worthy.

And what can I say?  WOW! Sometimes you just don't know what you're missing until you get a taste.  With alacrity and joy, I watched my way through the first season (Rachel was as beautiful, charming and talented, as always) and then checked out the next two seasons in quick succession.  Simply put, this might be the best situational comedy that I've ever seen.  I'm a big fan of the British version of The Office but this Canadian series may just supplant Ricky Gervais' brilliant, but very dark, comedy at the top of my personal list.  Slings & Arrows certainly finds a way to mine the laughs without resorting to being tasteless.  (Not that I'm adverse to tastelessness.)

Don't let the Shakespeare-themed theatrical setting put you off this gem because the few moments of actual plays are done quite well and are integrated into the whole production beautifully, usually bringing a touch of poignancy to the show in the process.

I would be remiss if I didn't note that I really enjoyed watching Sarah Polly's work in season three.  Having never seen nor heard of her before I believe that I can safely say that I've made a "star discovery" here.

Great show, without a doubt five stars.

Oh, and I just bought the boxed set of all three years.  Even though I've already seen them all once, I'm quite sure that I'll be watching them again shortly, likely on my PC, when football and American Idol invade the family room.
