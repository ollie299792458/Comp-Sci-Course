Being a Sherlock Holmes fan (I'd rather say expert!), I really enjoyed this movie, although I did not appreciate the character of Watson, presented as funny and not intelligent, which is not true (remember, he is  the one who narrated the Sherlock Holmes stories). The main idea of the  movie is interesting: was Holmes a homosexual? why was he that much  doubtful about women? was he ever in love? The plot is also very  attractive: for the first time in his career, Holmes would fail to fully  use his computer-brain, because, and for the first time in his career, his  feelings will be guiding him, although the mystery seems easy to resolve  for a mind like his, and this is proved by the intervention of his brother,  Mycroft. Robert Stephens perfectly incarnates the role of Sherlock Holmes,  much better than Basil Rathbone (but still very far from the excellent  Jeremy Brett). Melancholy, romance, mystery and suspense: a very nice  combination. See this movie even if you know nothing about Sherlock Holmes.  You will just love it.
