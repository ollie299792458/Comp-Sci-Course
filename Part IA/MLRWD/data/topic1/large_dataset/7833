The virtues of this now-legendary Oklahoma mounting are many, with its (often extended) choreography not the least among them. But its attempt to explore the piece's "darker" elements (actually, it wears its Freudianism on its sleeve) results in some odd tonal disjunctions.

On the one hand, we have a rather cartoonish musical comedy dimension, ripened particularly by overplayed accents, and then, suddenly, a disturbingly naturalistic turnaround, the encounter between Curly and Judd in the latter's cabin--from which the show never quite recovers.

(Too, it becomes hard to cheer Curly after he tries to get Judd to kill himself, at great length, and to deplore Judd when he is played heartbreakigly as a wounded animal, as he is here.)

In short, this version, though admirable in many ways, is at odds with itself. Add to this its very evident canned quality--the show was shot sans audience and the numbers dubbed--and a less than stellar experience is the unfortunate result.
