This movie gets a lot of hate, which it does NOT deserve. Sure it did not live up to the hype, but nothing could ever match the expectations set for this film.

However, it was still very entertaining, it had great special effects, great story, great acting and fits perfectly with the first two.
Everytime I'm sick and stay home from work, I watch all three back to back and love every minute of each film.
There are many comic book films out there that trully deserve a lot of hate, Catwoman for example, but Spidey 3 is not one of them! The people bashing it are simple and narrow minded or like to complain about everything. It is important to keep in mind that Spider-man's main audience is made up of kids under 13, so making the film dark (like the new batman movies) would be stupid. Sure there are many real problems that each character has to face, and some themes are trully grusome, like the murder of Uncle Ben, but at the end, the movie leaves you with a better attitude and improves your day and may be even your entire personality.
