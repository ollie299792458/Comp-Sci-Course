This movie was excellent, very charming and entertaining with great acting and directing.

Elisha Cuthbert is PHENOMENAL in this!!!!  If you are already a fan of hers then this should be a definite dvd purchase for you.  This role is perfect for her and she plays it brilliantly.  She's hilarious and very likeable in this and her antics are incredibly amusing.  Easily, one of my favorite movie characters ever.

The guy in this was very good and had chemistry with Cuthbert which was important to this movie working.

Writing and directing, top notch.  This movie never had a dull moment.  I was constantly engaged and entertained, and there were a ton of laughs, mostly provided by Elisha Cuthbert.  This movie had an awesome visual style, very pleasing to look at, with some particularly impressive shots throughout.

This is the kind of movie that I will be able to watch over and over again, so a dvd purchase is a must in my case.  I really hope this movie catches on and more people give it a shot, because it's definitely one of my favorite films.
