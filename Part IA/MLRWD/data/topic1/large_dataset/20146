First of all, let me say that I see posts from reviewers here describing the movie as ten minutes too long, fifteen minutes too long, etc., - I respectfully disagree.

I've seen the movie three times with three different people (one of them my teenage daughter - teenagers, as you know, don't have a lot of patience), and I find the running length just right, and additionally, none of the people I saw the movie with were complaining that it was too long.

Second, I unabashedly loved this film. And surprisingly, the aforementioned teenager really liked this film as well. I was certain she would complain that it was B O R I N G when it was over, but she thought it was great, so perhaps teenage viewers in your household might feel the same way.

I won't belabor the plot or the characters as it's been done so well in the previous reviews posted here, but I want to note that one of the most interesting things in the movie is the mother/wife's realization that she has become a much finer person as a result of the years spent with people she considered sub-human when she arrived, and secondly, as a result of the things she was forced to learn and do to survive (and eventually prosper) in Africa.

She doesn't wish to return to Germany - she is a better person in Africa.

Even though she does reluctantly return to Germany with her husband, she knows that she will never be as complete an individual as she was in adopted land. It's a nice piece of character development that acts as a interesting sidebar to her daughter's maturation in Africa.
