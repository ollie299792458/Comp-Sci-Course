My cousins and I picked WENDIGO up from the local video rental store hoping for a good scare, but, unfortunately, we got just the opposite. Now, it isn't fair to criticize this movie for not being scary since it never set out to be (and it was our stupidity for hoping as such without any research), however, that doesn't mean this movie was any good. We tried to sit through it, we really did, but in the end it just was boring and didn't really make sense.

WENDIGO starts out well, though. A dysfunctional family, while vacationing in the Catskills, accidentally hits a deer on a snowy road. This deer, however, is being pursued by a group of redneck hunters who are not happy their catch is disabled by this family. The lead hunter then stalks the family to get revenge on his missed kill.

It sounds entertaining, like it could go somewhere, but it honestly goes nowhere very fast. And the Wendigo? Well that's just a figment of the kid's imagination; a sort of deer body-builder thing scurrying about the forest. What is it's purpose in the movie? I'm not sure. It seems like this is a family-in-crisis drama disguised as a horror flick with a bunch of eerie scenery shots thrown in. And a bad on at that.

I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially those looking for a scare. Like another reviewer said, if you need to watch it, wait until it's on TV.
