I admit, when I first watched the film I had my preconcived notion that this musical would be "ok" I watched the film,and is parade of bright colors, upbeat songs, and korny characters. When the film was over I took out the film and said to myself 'eh...It was ok". Later that evening I found my self humming "brotherhood of man" And The next day the song "How to". At one point I was even belting out "Groundhog!". It was infectious. I put the film in again (manly cause I thought it would help get the song out of my system)I enjoyed the film more the second time around actually. Then it launched a great likeness of the film. The Character I once thought were Korny are now hillarious. I guess I should give other movies I thought were "ok" a second look because now I have found a gem of a film that I never seem to get tired of watching. It also launched an intrest in the Broadway production. I could say one thing about the film, it would be. "One turn deserves another, and another, and another..."
