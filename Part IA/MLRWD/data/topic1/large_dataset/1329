This is my absolute favorite Branagh version of Shakespeare's "Much Ado About Nothing"!!
Thank you, Mr. Branagh, for creating interpretations of Shakespeare's masterpieces which are entertaining, understandable, and excellent in quality. If the thought of reading Shakespeare makes you nervous, please do yourself a favor and rent one of Kenneth Branagh's movie versions first. He does an EXCELLENT job of interpreting Shakespeare's text and of helping to bring the stories to life (in a way that almost anyone can understand what's going on!) The casts of these film versions are equally talented and greatly contribute to the success of these movies. If it obvious that the actors understand what they are saying, and understand Shakespeare in such a way that allows them to pass that understanding on to the viewer.
 This version of "Much Ado About Nothing" is wonderful in it's imagery and dialogue (interaction between the actors/characters). Emma Thompson (Beatrice) and Kenneth Branagh (Benedick) bring their characters to life with wonderful humor and personifications. Their dialogue and bantering is absolutly amazing in it's flow and "natural-ness"-- they truly make the movie. Please see this one-- it's most definitely the best!!!!!
