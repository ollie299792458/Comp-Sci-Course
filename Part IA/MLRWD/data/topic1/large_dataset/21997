What a terrific movie!  All the characters are very believable, and what a bunch of characters they are.  Too bad some of them don't appear in more movies.  Lots of talent there!  One expects stellar performances from the likes of Kelsey Grammer, Harry Dean Stanton, Bruce Dern, William H. Macy, and Rip Torn, and they deliver.  But the lesser-known actors do an outstanding job as well. (Some great-looking guys are in this flick!  I could watch Brad Tatum flex his muscles all day -- Jonathan Penner and Duane Martin are very easy on the eyes, too.)  The humor is there all the time, in varying degrees, from dry and subtle to out-and-out slapstick, and it all works.  There's not a player in this movie who doesn't bring great skill and great "business" to his or her part.  As a confirmed landlubber, I have no idea if the "underwater" scenes are real or not, but they work for me.  The plot has some neat twists and turns, and you'll find yourself laughing hysterically, sitting on the edge of your seat, wondering how they'll get themselves out of one fix after another, and constantly rooting for the unconventional crew of the ancient USS Stingray.  From the piss-ant Exec Officer who gets to walk the plank, to the super-slob cigar-chomping king of the mess hall, to the electrician whose brain has absorbed a little too much voltage, to the sonarman who talks to whales, you'll come to love every crew member.  Don't miss this movie!
