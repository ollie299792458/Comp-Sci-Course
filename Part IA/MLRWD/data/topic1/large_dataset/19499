The plot of this movie seems to be somewhat alike to the plot of Jim Carrey's 1996 hit "Liar Liar".  An average, hard-working citizen is living his life peacefully and successfully, but is thrown a curveball one day when an uncontrollable force alters him and the appearance of everything around him.  In "Me, Myself and Irene", Charlie Baileygates is a Rhode Island police officer who is taken advantage of regularly.  Jim Carrey's role is unchangeably naive.  This characteristic is featured in one of the early scenes, where his long-term girlfriend leaves him for a midget.  For the umpteenth time, Charlie acts helpless and fails to do anything for himself all by himself.  As Charlie's personality progresses with no sign of fighting back, a spark is finally lit in his subconscious mind.  Out of nowhere, another person is born inside of Charlie named Hank.  He is everything that Charlie lacks and has several other problems that weren't supposed to become involved.  This alter ego helps Charlie become a less gullible man.  Irene, an endangered woman, is the first person to discover Hank.  She, more or less, follows Charlie around throughout the movie for safety's sake on a journey across the state.  Charlie willingly risks life and limb to keep Irene vertical, while Hank conducts himself as a pervert toward her and anyone else that he interacts with.  A campy classic, "Me, Myself and Irene" passes a rapid flow of quips and puns to the plot.  Every joke is funny, but a small number of them involving his 3 African-American sons are repititious and a handful of other jokes show offensiveness.  These minor setbacks do not stop it from being one of the better masterpieces of comedy brought to us by 20th Century Fox.  Carrey and Zellweger work well together and give this movie a good name.
