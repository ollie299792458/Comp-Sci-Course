When people bring up the director DePalma, they probably think Carrie, Scarface, or perhaps Bonfire of the Vanities, the later a spectacular disaster, perhaps the biggest let down of Hollywood lore.  Somehow DePalma is always slightly "off" when making his films- the tone is not quite suitable, the material mediocre, the acting off-key.  But he gets it right in the Untouchables, and shows why he is a director to be reckoned with and remembered through the ages.  This is a great American crime saga in the same vein as Once Upon a Time in America or the Godfather. Based on the true adventures of Elliot Ness trying to catch and convict a notorious gangster whose name escapes me at the moment, it is a riveting and grand-scale account of this heroic and dangerous pursuit of evil.  This is not a film of moral ambiguities... Kevin Costner as Ness is the good guy, along with the great Sean Connery as the Irish Chicago cop and a young Andy Garcia as the Italian rookie.  Those three make the movie worth watching right there.  But add Deniro as the ruthless gangster, and a magnificent musical score, and you have a great night at the movies (or on your couch).  This film is not for the squeamish (is any DePalma film?).  The bat scene is intense and disturbing.  As is the shoot out in Grand Central Station - but it is a testament to DePalma's signature style (though some would say that style is a carbon copy of Hitchcock, but that is not a bad thing).  This movie will not let you down on any level.  If you like gangster films, sagas, Sean Connery, Costner, Andy Garcia, DeNiro, or great movie soundtracks, this is required viewing.
