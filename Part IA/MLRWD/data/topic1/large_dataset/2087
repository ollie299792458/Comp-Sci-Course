I got this movie because I enjoy movies with nostalgic settings; the medieval era being such in this case.  I also like movies about religion, especially ones that depict the life of the Catholic Church throughout the ages.  I am a man who upholds principles of morality and honesty.  I learned this movie was about a series of murders in a monastery.  Fine.  Nothing too wrong with that.  But as I started to watch the movie, the first thing I noticed was how grotesque and demonic-looking the monks appeared.  Their behavior was even suggestive of diabolical possession ; everything contrary to the attributes of a monk.  The graphic sex scene is repulsive to someone who leans towards morality.  Again contrary to the attributes of monastic life or a holy life for that matter.  There is also blood and gore in this movie.
If you enjoy historically accurate movies and do not appreciate graphic scenes or sins of the flesh, or object to portraying men who are supposed to be holy as sinful and possessed, then do not waste your time watching this shameful piece of trash.  I watched about half of it and had to discontinue.
