Coolest cartoon ever I never missed it but over time forgot a lot of the episodes as I was only 9 at the time. One of the coolest theme songs ever though DON'T forget the ending theme it rocked like Space 1999 or the ending Gilligan theme.

I won't bore you with the synopsis or plots like the rest of you wanna be reviewers just tell you it's about time this kind of stuff gets released and actually done justice. Even though the third season sucked Grumpy dung it was still enjoyable to a degree but without Rick Marshall only good for a one time viewing whilst I have seen the season 2 Zorn episode maybe 14 times now. The robot dino was just cool!! Seresa Taka!!

The commentaries with Wilrah and Hahry are hilarious too bad Holly didn't grow up into that hot blond that played her as Ronnie in the one episode all grown up but hey you can't have everything just cool memories in living vivid dvd color!

OK I take it back--Season 3 upon second viewing really wasn't that bad! Some of the new look of the sets were very cool along with the fire breathing dimetrodon and the two headed dino. The medusa episode was weak along with the Richard Keil appearance but overall I like it!

Peace out you freaks

This just in: Will Farrell can officially kiss my A$$ for agreeing to a comedic version of this awesome classic. Did they remake Star Trek a comedy? This is the second lamo remake he has botched Bewitched was LAME. I hope you never work again Farrell and guess what you were never funny on SNL David Spade on his WORST day dogs you you Effin loser. Oh...I mean DESPERATE for a gig loser...
