This is honestly the best romantic comedy I've ever seem, at least in recent memory.When people say this movie is predictable, I want them to ask themselves this, is there a romantic comedy, where you have absolutely no idea how things will turn out?I think that answer would be no, and while here you do have the basic idea on how things will turn out, that's basically it. Many romantic comedies these days are so shallow and predictable, that you can just tell what each character is going to say.Ok, so lets get to the point.The movie starts out with a talent scout for an aspiring national network, tabloid television show,Her name is Jane Goodale,(played by Ashely Judd).Within 10 minutes of the movie, she meets coworker Ray Brown (Greg Kinnear), and right away sparks are flying between the two.After a few dates the two start dating, and are on the verge of moving in together.But after Ray breaks up with his girlfriend(whom he was cheating on with Jane), things start to change.The romance is definately wearing off, and Ray seems to be avoiding Jane.Then Ray breaks the big news,he "can't do this".Of course Jane is left completely crushed, and also without a place to live(her apartement has been re-rented, and she and Ray are obviously not moving together).Which brings us to the third of the main chracters, Eddie(played by Hugh Jackman).Eddie is another one of Jane's co-workers, and he is your typical womanizer.Well, as it turns out, Eddie is in search of a roomate, and Jane jumps at the chance,mainly to make Ray jealous, and also because she doesn't have a place to live.The relationship with Eddie starts out with them constantly bickering, and complaining about one another's behavior.But, slowly, the two start to unravel, and a more understanding relationship develops between them .Meanwhile,Jane, still broken-hearted from her sudden breakup with Ray, is obssessed.There seems to be no way to put her mind at rest, because Jane needs a reason, on why she was so suddently dumped by the man of her dreams.And then she discovers what she feels explains everything-"The Cow Theory".In this theory, it is explained the men leave their women because the newness simply wears off, and the men want "new cow".Jane becomes obssessed with this theory, because it seems to give her a reason as to why the relationship of herdreams so suddently ended.A little more into the movie,Jane's best friend(played by Marisa Tomei), who works for a magazine, gives Jane an idea.To publish a story on this "cow theory", under a pseudonym.Well, Jane chooses to be the a 72 year old Phd, Marie Charles.What Jane doesn't expect is how the story just suddently blows up into a national phenomenon.Before she knows, "Marie Charles" is to appear on Jane's television show.This leads to a discovery, and a newfound happiness.
I won't spoil the ending for you.The performances are just awesome.As far as I'm concerned, Ashely is the next big thing.Forget the overrated Julia Roberts.Ashely is hilarious, but when needed, her emotion is raw and real.Hugh Jackman wittily handles his role.And Greg is perfect as Ray, the seemingly inocent,perfect guy.To anyone who likes good comedy, or just good movies, then I recommend you see this movie.It's really  a hilarious,charming,just excellent comedy.
