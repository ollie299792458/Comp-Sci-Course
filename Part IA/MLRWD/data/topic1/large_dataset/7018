Norma Shearer's Marie Antoinette embraces all that is spectacular, pageant, and tragic.  I first saw this movie as a little girl and it inspired a lifelong interest and sympathy for the last Queen of France. Shearer and Morley not only resemble the fallen monararchs but their portrayals bring to life an uncanny accuracy to the French Revolution.  Having studied the French revolution this film has captured details and characterizations of the royal family depicted in many historical document.
The history encapsuled in this epic is one of many delicacies in store for the viewer.  Tyrone Power is always food for the senses.  Robert Morley is outstanding.  Joseph Schildkraut's Duc d'Orleans is treachery and greed at its most distastful.  This should have won Oscars across the board.  There is more than a revolution going on in this film and it is a must see for every, every, every fashion design student.  The costume design has never been surpassed!
I saw this film as a child, never forgot it,  taped it, lost it, never saw it again on television, and recently purchased it. It  has its share of the melodramatic, typical of its era, but once you see it, you'll never forget it.
