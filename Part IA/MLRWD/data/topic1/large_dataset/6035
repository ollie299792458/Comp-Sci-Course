I don't want to go deeply into the details of this movie since enough has been said about the storyline already. It is nice to see a sweet and romantic movie about the topic of long-distance relationships. After all today many people start off as long distance, especially since the internet brings people together. The movie realistically shows the problems that can occur when two people who love each other cannot see each other every day. It also shows the typical comments of friends on both sides. You can see this movie and either think "been there, done that", or you know that you could be there if you tried it.

Justin Long does a few things to show his efforts to be romantic. For example he shows up for a surprise visit, etc., and when you watch these scenes - not only do the female actors in this movie have the "I wish someone would do this for me" look in the face - I had that look in my face, too.

The ending is a happy endling, but even the happy end does not come in the typical way.

The most hillarious scene in this film is when Justin Long and Drew Barrymore get caught in the act on the dining table. The way the unvoluntary witnesses react makes me laugh even now although the movie is already over. I am glad I bought this movie, and I am going to watch it again one day.
