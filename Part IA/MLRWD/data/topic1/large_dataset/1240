I knew the American Showtime version of the British program and am an admitted addict.  While it took me a bit to catch on to it (I was put off by the sex, which seemed sort of soft core porn initially) I am completely under it's spell.  The Showtime version is on hiatus for the summer and I was feeling withdrawl symptoms and went mad and just ordered the original British series plus the movie (part 2).  Did I like it?  Well, yes.  The first package (part one) is exactly the same story line as the American version.  Same story but different attitude.  It sees the story from a very different perspective.  While I found this a trifle disconcerting at first, I at last settled into it and went with the flow.  Of course this is a much shorter verson (6 hours) and so it cannot by it's nature be an ongoing story.  Once I was reconciled to the differences, I loved it.  The story, as I have said, is the same and we have the same characters......but they are different.  Nathan (Justin in the Showtime program) loves Stuart but is not immobilized by it (he is also 15!  Yikes).  He is a force of nature and not the least bit as single minded about Stuart (Brian) as his American counterpart.  Vince (Michael) is a bit more inept in all respects, but just as loveable and endearing.  And Stuart is the most disappointing and also, somehow, the most refreshing change from the Showtime character.  His motives are more obvious and his reactions more predictable.  But eventually, I ended up loving Stuart.  DVD 2 is a revelation.  A complete departure from the American version, this wraps up the whole thing.  There can really be no more QAF (this version), and you wouldn't want it after this finish,  The conclusion was masterful.  Concentrating on the love Stuart (Brian) and Vince (Michael) have for one another, it explores areas the Showtime series has pretty much abandoned.  I LOVED IT.  Bravo.  Check it out.  You will not be sorry.
