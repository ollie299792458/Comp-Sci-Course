Okay - so the movie is about catching animals in Africa for zoo delivery - well where do you think the zoos get all those lovely animals? Do you think they just waltz into their cages with engraved invitations? Heck no, they don't. This movie retains it's classic appeal as an adventure and a bit of a love story thrown in as well. But let's face it - you can't impose today's politically correct environment on a classic old movie. It just doesn't work. For the time period when this movie was created - all the characters are true to form. The men are alpha males doing a tough seasonal job in Africa, but they also have tender and funny sides to their characters. The women are fiesty, smart, and well drawn. (The ladies are NOT jiggle and giggle girls). This movie has adventure, humor, great scenery, good action, and offers a glimpse into a different kind of world - a time when animals roamed in huge herds in Africa. Highly recommended movie for the person who loves classic older movies, and can appreciate the movie for what it is without imposing modern views onto the story or characters. I love this movie, and I have no trouble watching it over again. Very enjoyable.
