One way to see this film is boring, quirky and random(especially if you were hoping for the ultra violence of Oldboy.) Another way to look at this film is brilliant, with an entirely new way of looking at vampires. (think requiem for a dream with vampires)

It all depends on the person, I watched it and was mesmerized. First time they seemed to be a few loose ends but if you take the time to evaluate the events piece by piece you will realize there was a reason for everything and nothing was merely a random act of violence(which I believe is why everyone who is gay for Oldboy was so disappointed) this isn't part of Park Chan-wooks revenge trilogy so don't expect pointless carnage.

This is a story about a priest and his transformation into a monster, which he never asked for, he intended to do good and happened to get his blood transfused with vampires blood... trust me on this though that they portray this concept very non nonchalant and it works.

I'd say this was the best vampire movie made in some time, which is a genre that needed the revamp since twilight came along.

The only reason I don't give this movie 5 stars is its pacing, a lot of the film could have been condensed and you'll find yourself growing impatient as the depressing mood of this film drags on.
