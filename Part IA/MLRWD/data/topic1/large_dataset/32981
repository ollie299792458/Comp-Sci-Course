I don't understand why everybody is so upset about Iraq, war looks like a lot of fun! You get to sing, dance, dress up like a woman, and boss around your drill instructor!

Kate Smith is a BIG woman, I guess she is supposed to be some great singer or something, that is good for her, because she was two fat to do much of anything else, check out that turkey neck with the three chins!

This show must have been very important if they put a president in charge of it. So now I know how Ronald Reagan married Nancy. She sure was hot back in the day.

My favorite character was the moron with his bugle. It's OK if people die, they will live forever on his bugle. So even dying is cool, you get to be on a horn.

If this movie proved anything, it is that even back in the World War II days, black people could dance better. The black men put the white dancers to shame. I didn't even know there was such a thing as Tap/Break Dancing.

And check out the old dude when they bring him up on stage. He's crying as he and his World War I buddies are singing their corny old songs. I guess he was sad because he was old and he wasn't going to France again to get some sweet French loving. I don't blame him for crying, his wife was really old. But the old dude tried to dance with a bum leg and a cane. He should have just stayed in his seat.

I found it weird that a little Nazi dude got to sing in the show. His name was Igor Berlin or something like that. He sang about killing American soldiers, like the bugler and the guy who wakes the bugler. I don't know why they let him sing that. Don't you think it would have been better to squeeze some intel out of him instead? I would think so, but maybe back in World War II it was better to let people sing.

I think the only reason that this is not history's worst movie of all time is because thankfully Ethyl Merman is nowhere in sight.
