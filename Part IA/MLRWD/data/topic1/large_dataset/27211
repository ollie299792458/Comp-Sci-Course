The story of the re-conquest of the Sudan by Lord Kitchner is done best by this release from 1939 starring Sir Ralph Richardson, John Clements, and C. Aubrey Smith. The issues of cowardice, valor(of a different sort), romance, adventure, and redemption are much needed today. The story, directing by Alexander Corda, and superb acting and highly credible disguise for Faversham, make this the very best of the several(?5) films of the novel. The 1978 version for television(Beau Bridges and Jane Seymour) is also worth watching, but the current 2002 version starring Heath Ledger is a very poor remake.
Most of us probably didn't study the historical basis for the story in high school. I suggest watching the DVD(available in stores) of Khartoum(Olivier as the Mahdi and Heston as General 'Chinese' Gordon) before viewing this movie, and also reading the abridged 'The River War' first published by Winston Churchill in 2 vols. in 1899(paperback available-I got mine through (a local store))-a fascinating historical account-Churchill served in the Hussars and writes vividly of the Dervish defeat in the battle of Omdurman, Sep. 2, 1898. The scenery in the current 2002 version now showing is spectacular,but that's it.  This is a movie with a strong message, viewable by the whole family without incessant vulgarity or needless 'bathroom-urinal-etc' scenes.  definitely a 'G' rating in my opinion.
