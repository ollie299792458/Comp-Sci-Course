The cover told me this was a comedy. Well, after an unpleasant car accident, we thought we could use just that. But this film is all pretense, no content. It aspires to the inspired lunacy of "Being John Malkovich", but comes nowhere near it in execution.

While it has several actors I really enjoy, and a great look and feel, it just never caught me. The premise is interesting; the execution feeble. What does it mean to have the soul of another person inside you? What do you lose when you lose your soul? What would happen if you're carrying the soul of another and that person dies? Well, these interesting and, indeed, theologically profound issues, are given an 8th grade term paper treatment, slight, superficial, and silly.

Some movies try to embrace grand themes but can't quite pull it off. "Nothing" is a great example. High aspirations, worth watching, but that long drive down the line went foul. "Cold Souls" is a weak infield pop-up of big ideas, a film that looks good, sounds good, and has a few fine moments, but is ultimately rather empty.
