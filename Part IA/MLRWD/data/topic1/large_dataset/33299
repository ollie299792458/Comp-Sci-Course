Seriously, this is the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen.  This is the movie that B movies think they aspire to be.  Poorly made, poorly acted, poorly written and directed.  It's all there.  Oh yeah, and the visual effects were the worst!  But that's why you love a movie like this, because unlike parodies of B movies, this film actually loves every aspect of film and pays homage to every aspect of the B movie, from the subconscious acting and technical decisions to the highly conscious visual effects work.  It was all done on the fly, for very little money.  You may have noticed I haven't called this movie a B movie, it's because it isn't.  Watch it and you'll see the difference, read between the lines and know these are skilled filmmakers at the top of their game who know how to entertain for every frame of film.  This isn't Slither, this isn't the new Dawn of the Dead.  This is real old school.  This is the most fun I've ever had watching a movie.  I laughed harder at this than any pretentious comedy horror imposter.  Watch this and tell me it doesn't put you in stitches, I dare you. Buy it.  I am a cineasthete, I collect Kubrick, Scott, Wong Kar Wai.  But what do I watch when I just want to kick back? I watch Shark Attack 3: Megalodon.
