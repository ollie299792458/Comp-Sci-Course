I'm not going to comment on "The Hunger Games" or "The Condemned."  Having said that, Battle Royale is THE REAL THING.  There is nothing cleaned up for PG or for younger audiences.  There is serious violence here.  It is very well done - not overdone fountains of blood, but relatively realistic blood.  The story is basic - unruly kids placed on an island and forced to fight to the death.  The students react in different ways, from rejection and termination, to suicide, to all out slaughter.  It's gory and fun.  There is a plot, but it becomes more evident in the second movie.  The set has 4 discs - two are different versions of the first movie.  One disc is BRII, and the last is extras.  Good stuff, but most is in Japanese.  Actually, the whole thing is in Japanese, but the subtitles are very good.  About BRII - I know a lot of people panned it, but I think it is necessary.  There are a lot of loose ends and unanswered questions at the end of BRI.  BRII attempts to answer them.  I am not always happy with the answers.  Many of them are quite anti-American, but at least there is an attempt to answer questions about how things changed so much that a BR-type spectacle could happen in a civilized country.

It's not for everyone.  Some kids may find the hyper-violence upsetting.  There are many references to children being 'at war' with adults.  There is extreme and graphic violence, and references to sexual abuse of a preadolescent female. Adults and the government are viewed as enemies, and (particularly in BRII) the United States is portrayed unfavorably. This is not a film for younger viewers.
