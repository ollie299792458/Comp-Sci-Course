Definitely good if you're a Pacino fan. The special features add

a lot to what is already a good movie. The only thing to realize

is that if you haven't seen this movie it's important to be

patient. The movie moves slow if all you want is a bunch of explosions and fight scenes. These things are in the movie but you have to wait for them. The movie starts off exciting but soon becomes a story that is being built for the confrontation

at the end between the two main characters. If you don't pay attention to the performances of not only the main actors

but the less featured actors then you won't hear or see all

the details that build the story for the ending. It's worth

watching if you can watch a 3 or 4 hour movie. I liked it because of the cast, espically Pacino and Deniro. If you don't like Pacino or Deniro or can't wait 3 or 4 hours for most movies

that long then I reccomend you rent it before you buy it.
