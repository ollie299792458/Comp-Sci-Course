With a wife and two young daughters, selecting this was a no-brainer. I was sure they would enjoy it. The only question was my older daughter (5 years old) is very sensitive to loud sounds and unsettling situations. But she had no problems at all with this, so I would recommend it even for more sensitive (easily scared) viewers. My wife and younger daughter (3 years old) also liked it immensely.

What's surprising is that I actually found it watchable. I usually get bored with predictable plots and am not into fairies or fairy tales. [Off topic: my daughters dressed as fairies for Halloween and won third place in a costume contest. The announcer kept calling them butterflies so my older daughter asked me why. I told her most guys don't know the difference and if I didn't already know I would call them butterflies, too.] But I sat through this movie without fast forwarding and thought it had a decent storyline, had good lessons about friendship and responsibility, and had very good graphics and sound. There were some sections that seemed to drag while other sections seemed rushed, as if to wrap up in under 80 minutes, but overall it was a good length.
