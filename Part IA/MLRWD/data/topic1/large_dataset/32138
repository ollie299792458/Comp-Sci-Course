I saw this at the theatre when it first came out.  I arrived early only to find people leaving the show before it was over, telling me to get my money back.  Of course...  that only heightened my anticipation of this film, of which i previously knew nothing about.
The first hour of the film was slow, like "if it were on t.v. i'd change the channel" kind of slow, although the photography and overall sense of design was top-notch. Slowly the whole film started to twist itself into a bizarre depravity, creeping up on you like an altered state of conciousness,  and i was hooked.  I didn't find anything overly shocking or gratuitous about this film, in fact i found a deep sense of beauty and brilliance on the part of the director for being able to flawlessly morph both the story and the viewers emotional attachment, to the point where fifteen minutes before the resolution a dozen people got up and walked out of the theatre disgusted. I, on the other hand, felt privledged to have experienced a great work of art.
However, after the film I looked up some reviews, and was shocked on how everyone else COMPLETELY missed the point by turning the premise of the movie into "a statement on the objectification of women in Japan".  I can assure you that this movie has no political agenda whatsoever.  It's as if anytime a director makes something that doesn't fit our standards of political correctness, then he must be trying to expose us to the injustices that exist outside of our perfect p.c. world...  gimme a break.
This film is a brilliantly realized work from one of the great directors of our time.  It's the kind of film that demands a response, and will stay with you for long after the credits roll.  Highly recommended.
