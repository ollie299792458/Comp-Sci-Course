WOW...WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT THIS LITTLE B-FLICK WAS COMING OUT ON DVD...I WAS SO EXCITED. IT'S SOOO FUNNY BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO PULL OUT MY VHS COPY..(STILL IN MINT CONDITION)..AND TAKE A RETRO-TRIP BACK TO THIS FLAT,GENERIC CARBON COPY OF 'HALLOWEEN'. SEE, I'M AN 80'S GUY...TOTALLY OBSESSED WITH ANYTHING FROM THE 70'S AND 80'S...I GUESS YOU JUST HAVE TO OF BEEN THERE TO GET IT....IT'S NOT THAT THESE MOVIES REALLY 'EXCITE ME'...WELL, YEA THEY DO (!!)...BUT IT IS ALSO A THROW BACK TO MY YOUNGER YEARS....AND, I GUESS 'THESE' FORGOTTEN B-MOVIES MUST APPEAL TO A DECENT SIZE CROWD BECAUSE THEY KEEP ON BRINGING THEM OUT ON DVD. MANY WHO WATCH THIS, ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER GENERATION TODAY WILL PROBABLY BE VERY 'BORED' OR 'IMPATIENT'....BECAUSE THIS SLASHER YARN IS BASCIALLY 'HALLOWEEN' WITH ALL THE ENERGY AND COLOR DRAINED OUT!! IT'S 'THE BOOGEYMAN' WITH OUT JOHN CARPENTER'S CREEPY TECHNO THEME..OR STYLE..OR INTERESTING CHARACTERS...HELL, BUT IT BASICALLY GOES IN THE SAME DIRECTION..SOME SCENES ARE ACTUALLY 'SHOT' AND 'PLAYED OUT' THE SAME WAY..( THE 'SMART' GIRL STARTS TO SEE A 'SHADOWY FIGURE' OUT THE WINDOW...THE FINAL CHASE SCENE HAS HER AND THE PSYCHO FACE-OFF ON A DARKEN STAIRWELL)....BUT PLEASE KEEP IN MIND...THIS WAS 'EARLY 80'S' AND THOUGH IT IS 'DULL'...IT STILL LOOKS DECENT AND HAS SOME EFFECT. WATCH IT JUST FOR THE 'HISTORY AND FACT' THAT THIS IS THE 'REAL' DEAL...ONE OF A HANDFUL OF EARLY SLASHER FLICKS THAT PUT THE FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN....AND ENDED THE 'BODYCOUNT' MOVIE FOR GOOD...(AT LEAST TILL MUCH LATER). THE BIG BUDGET 'SLASHERS' YOU SEE NOW ARE ALL 'RELATED' TO THESE OLD GEMS..) I WOULD OF NEVER EVER IMAGINED A RE-MAKE OF 'BLACK CHRISTMAS'...OR..'PROM NIGHT'...?  I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH 'FINAL EXAMS'...AND I WILL 'KEEP THE LIGHTS' ON...ONLY BECAUSE THOSE CHILDHOOD FEARS WILL START TO CREEP INTO MY IMAGINATION,BESIDES..I WANT TO SEE THAT 'FINAL CLASSIC' CHASE SCENE AT THE END,ESPECIALLY WHERE THE 'GIRL' GETS TRAPPED IN THE SCHOOL CAFETERIA..I THINK SHE 'STUFFS' HERSELF...? OR TRIES TO HIDE IN THE SMALL 'TRASH' COMPACTOR..WHERE ALL THE DIRTY DISHES GO...?..SOMETHING LIKE THAT...I CAN'T WAIT TO 'EXPERIENCE IT' ALL OVER AGAIN...ESPECIALLY WIDE-SCREEN..! I ALSO PRE-ORDERED 'SWEET SIXTEEN'...ANOTHER SLASHER,BUT MORE OF A MYSTERY. THIS 'SLEEPER' STARRS DANA KIMMEL FROM 'FRIDAY THE 13TH pt 3' AND DON SHANKS WHO PLAYED MICHAEL MYERS IN HALLOWEEN 5..I think...!  ANYWAY...IT'S A KOOL LITTLE FILM..IF YOU'RE INTO 'SLICE AND DICE' OLDIES...AND CAN KEEP AN OPEN MIND WHILE VIEWING IT. WATCH WITH SOME FRIENDS WHO CAN APPERICATE 'HORROR MOVIES' AT IT'S MOST PRIMITIVE...OTHER 'CLASSIC' SLASHERS THAT HOLD VERY DEAR TO MY HEART IS....'ONE DARK NIGHT', 'THE INITIATION', 'THE BOOGINS', 'MOTHER'S DAY', 'HE KNOWS YOUR ALONE', 'THE BURNING', 'TO ALL A GOODNIGHT', 'TERROR TRAIN', 'HALLOWEEN 2'..'HALLOWEEN 3', 'HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW','MORTUARY' 'THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD-AKA-PRANKS', 'THE PROWLER', AND MY MOST BELOVED- 'TOBE HOOPERS THE FUNHOUSE!!''  THANX FOR READING.....KEVIN BRIAN....where the BODYCOUNT CONTINUES.......
