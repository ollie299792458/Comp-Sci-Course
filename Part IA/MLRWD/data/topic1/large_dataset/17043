Chocolat is the intriguing story of a woman who brings flavor to a quiet French town.  This film "works" in a rarely beautiful way. The actors are all perfect for their parts, the acting is wonderful and the whole experience is truly magical.  The message is a bit extreme, making it appear that there is no actual need for rules, but over all it is a very enjoyable movie. It is easy to look past any flaws it may have and relish the beautiful treat that it is. Although the main character Vianne is made to seem kind and loving despite her mistakes and the church-goers cold and rude, it is still heart-warming to see the way Vianne opens her heart to each individual nomatter who they are, and the way the village is influenced for the better by her kindness. It is a great tale of how we need to treat one another, and shows how life is meant to be savored and seen for the beauty it can have.  It does almost have a fair-tale feeling to it, and I find that to be a brilliant move on the part of the makers of the film.  It is uplifting and beautiful as well as spicy and entertaining.  A true MUST SEE!!!  It is in my top five list of favorite films with good reason!
