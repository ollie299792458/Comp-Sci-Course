Anyone who after seeing this film and doesn't admit they enjoyed it, is a lier. While definately not a great film by any standard, the dialog, colourful characters, and clever story make this film very entertaining: 
Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels successfully achieves a bizarre cross between traditional heist/gangstar movie( ala Resevoir Dogs) and traditional British non-romatic comedy ( ala 'Nuns on the Run'). 
As a comedy containing plenty of enjoyable action, it can in no way be interpreted as a serious or intelligent film. The flaws in this film are clearly evident; Firstly, the location of this film is dubious, although supposedly set in East London, it was obviously not actually filmed there as the location in the film looks more like Portsmouth. Secondly, apparently the film takes place in the side of town where there are no women- -the film has no female characters. Thirdly, Guy richie's direction can at certain times be nausia inducing: as a former pop video director he retains an annoying tendancy for 'flash' camera angles and over cutting.
However a combination of an excellent storyline; full of twists and meaningfull coinsidences, very very colourful characters and the novelty of seeing Football's least talented but most violent thug in his acting debut, not only keep the film afloat but make all the films aformetioned flaws forgiven.
To conclude, this is a deeply flawed but still very very enjoyable film. Worth watching just to see Vinnie Jones in his first role since leaving Wimbledon where he along with John Fashnu and Dennis Wise once terrorised football. He is wholly convincing and scary mainly because he is playing himself! And that is not a testament to his acting ability but to his character.
 I'm sure Gary Lineker can't dare to watch any of the scenes starring Vinnie, With Vinnies infamous death threat's to him after Lineker dived, and got him sent off when they played each other in 1995/96 season.
