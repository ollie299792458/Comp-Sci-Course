This movie is all you've heard -- inventive, imaginative, and thoroughly enjoyable.  At 90 minutes, it feels fairly short, and the final showdown (with only one alien) feels somewhat anticlimactic, but the film is still a  fun, fresh twist on the 1950s gooey alien sagas.  A box office blowout, the  film was released in the midst of a brief resurgence of alien chic,  released a year after Independence Day and Mars Attacks!, and just before  Starship Troopers.  It is interesting to note that 1996 brought the highly  successful ID4 and the box office bomb Mars Attacks, while 1997 brought us  the highly successful Men in Black and the bomb Starship Troopers, which  didn't even get past the $100 M mark in the States.  ID4 and MIB were more  straight-laced films with elements of parody and humor, while Mars Attacks!  and Starship Troopers were more intentional send-ups of their subject  matter.  Mars Attacks! went for a Mel Brooks-style spoof, while Starship  Troopers (spoof or satire?) was similarly over the top.  Apparently  American audiences like their self-conscious irony lite.  Or maybe they  just like Will Smith.  Either way, MIB never takes itself too seriously,  while at the same time taking on legitimate issues (America's concern with  immigration) in an imaginative way.  Fun.
