Most movies about sports (besides "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MNOX94">The Natural (Director's Cut)</a>") are usually weird, cliche and not really good story or character pieces, aside from not properly portraying the games and how the players actually think in them.

Throw that all out the window for this movie.  This movie accurately captures what it is like to be on the field.  The voice overs are very close to what my friend and myself said we  were thinking when we played in High School.  Your mind is every where.  Your ability to focus is key, which is shown very creatively cinematically in this movie.

This movie also is a great story for Kevin Costner's Character.  Lots of flash backs based that give context and depth to his current problem make for a really interesting story.  The movie is certainly a drama with lots of romance interwoven.  It is hard to describe the story without revealing much.  Much of the movie is him pitching, while flashing back to memories of his life with a girlfriend.

One thing that I loved, but also kind bother me was Vin Scully announcing.  As a Dodgers fan, there is NOTHING better than hearing Vin announce a game (Vin Scully is does the TV broadcast for the Dodgers alone and is an old-school, one man show).  He is a living legend and one of a kind.  The problem is he would never announce a Yankees Detroit Game, but is a perfect fit nonetheless for the role and type of movie this is.

Overall, a great movie, especially considering most sports movies are awkward and clich&eacute;.  This one was not.  A great movie for baseball fans and movie fans.
