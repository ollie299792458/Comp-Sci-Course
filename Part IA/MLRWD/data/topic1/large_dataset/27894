I was torn about this movie for one fact - I really like Denzel Washington as an actor and if I see his name associated with a movie I will see it because I expect good things from him. And with the hype about this movie when it came out, I walked away from the theater a bit unsatisfied.

When he received an Oscar for this role (as oppossed to some other movies) I felt the same way the I did when Russell Crowe received one for Gladiator and not A Beautiful Mind. But that seems to happen at the Oscars.

Both Hawke and Washington turn in overall good performances (I think Hawke was better based on his role) about corruption in a police department, where Denzel is knee deep in it.

There were some very good scenes, but I did find that the movie dragged a bit. And when things became really heated during the second half of the movie, some of the scenes to me were a bit over the top/drawn out. I understand that there is a suspension of belief for these things, but it seemed to be just a bit too much.

Watching it again on DVD changed my mind a bit and I enjoyed it more than in the movies, but perhaps it is because my expectations had changed somewhat. It is probably somewhere between 3-1/2 to 4, and since I was probably a bit skewed in my initial impressions based on what I expected, and which may have carried over, it probably is a 4.
