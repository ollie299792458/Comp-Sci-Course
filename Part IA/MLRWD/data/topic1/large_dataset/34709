I thought this movie was hella awesome, but i cant understand all the bitching about there being no plot to follow, or character development. I don't know if the movie was purposely made to be this way, but thats what makes it so realisitic. If youre one of the people thinking theres no plot, then you clearly havent been spun/cant relate to the movie. I can say ive been there, and the life of a meth junkie is just that. No plot, no nothing. All there is to think about or do, is anything that will get you more quicker. The hours just sort of go by, with no real meaning. I thought the movie was an excellent example of showing what a junkies life revolves around. It showed how quickly extreme ups and downs can come and go, just like that. It shows how relationships can deminish, just like that, because the meth becomes more important. This movie did an awesome job of showing just how jaded you can become, and what your willing to do for another fix. I definately prefer this movie to requiem for a dream, although maybe its because i can really relate to this movie, everything going in fastforward and nothing matters until that next rail.
