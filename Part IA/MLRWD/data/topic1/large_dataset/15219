The thing I love most about this film is the casting.  Knowing very little about the book that it was based on, other than it was a book, I had no real expectations.  I didn't have some doubts about Sofia Coppela pulling of a film of her own, but it shows that her dad has raised another great director.  One reviewer on this site seems very unhappy that she Sofia Coppela was given a "pampered" life and had this movie handed to her.  Well....good!  She made a great film.  And her casting could not have been better done.  James Woods (True Believer, Vampires) gives an incredible, Oscar worthy performance as the father.  Kathleen Turner (Romancing the Stone, Body Heat) is incredible as the no-makeup, insane mother.  These two actors really set the tone for the film and make it what it is.  
Kirstin Dunst (Interview with the Vampire, Bring It On) seems to have been a more obvious choice for Lux.  She plays the sexy sister with the most lines.  With all the teen movies she is in right now, there is no doubt this was a rare chance for her to show of some real skill and she did.  
This is a great film.  Very much worth the time and money to check out.  As for Sofia Coppela being "pampered", who cares!  Being the daughter of a great director is no differnt then being the daughter of a great chief, anything she does will probably be pretty good and she may in fact end up better than her father.  She is off to an excellent start.
