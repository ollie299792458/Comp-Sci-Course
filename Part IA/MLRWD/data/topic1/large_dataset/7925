Rather than offer another version of what's already been said, I'm going to focus on the one part that, in my opinion, put a big gash on an otherwise beautiful, intelligent anime.

I'm not a fan of having to read movies, so enjoyment of an anime hangs in the balance of whether or not it's dubbed well.  In the case of Ghost in the Shell, there's some very good dubbing (Richard Epcar as Batou) and some efficient dubbing (Abe Lasser as the Puppet Master and William Frederick as Aramaki, to name a few).  However, the movie depends mostly on the voice of the Major, and Mimi Woods was (no offense) a terrible choice.  Motoko Kusanagi is practically a perfect cybernetic being, so one might think she'd have a beautiful, almost mystic voice to go with her looks and personality.  Woods, however, sounds unrefined...natural, but too simple and out-of-character.  If you close your eyes and try to picture the Major through Mimi Woods' voice, you don't.  You can't.  And everything she says loses its strength because the voice just can't deliver it with the thoughtful tone it needs...and since most of the insight revolves around her character, that leaves a big dent in the strength of the film's philosophical core.

If you hate all dubs and are strictly a "subbed" person, then enjoy; otherwise, be warned: with that dubbed voice, the Major's credibility only hangs on by its teeth.
