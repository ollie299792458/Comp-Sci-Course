The protagonist's father from beyond his grave wishes his son a better life than what he'd had.  But can his son escape his fate?  Life as a gangster seems to offer that chance -- the money seems easy, and there's no lack of work.  But his son almost loses his life the same way his father did, and it's a jolt -- to the viewer, to the cyclo.

What is this movie about?  Can we ever escape our fates?  Are we always victims to our screwed-up childhoods?  Is there redemption in death?  Does capitalism suck?  Does this shade of blue look good on my skin?  I can't say definitively what the movie is trying to express, but I know that I have been mesmerized by the film every time I've seen it.

If you are curious about the world, this movie will grab you and stay with you, urging you to see it again, making you wonder about your own life, filling you with a sense of thankfulness about the world that you inhabit.  Let it draw you in with its lush cinematography:  you will feel that you are with them in the summertime dusk, you will feel that you are right there just before the sun rises.

A magnificent work; one of my all-time favorites.
