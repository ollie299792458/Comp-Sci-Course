I had heard about this movie being made since friends of mine were extras during filming done in Baltimore.  Since it was supposedly a football movie, I did not rush to the theater to see it, but waited.  When I finally watched it I definately thought that this movie was right up my alley.  It starts out with the football league players all going on strike since they weren't making enough money.  The players were portrayed as spoiled know it all types.  So, to salvage the season, the owner of the Washington Sentinels hires a coach played by Gene Hackman to scout and put together a team of replacement players.  The variety of guys is incredible and sets the audience up for a lot of laughs to follow.  The quarterback of this team is played by Keanu Reeves who plays a solid working class guy who is now given a second chance for glory.  
  There is the inevitable romance, tons of laughs, and football sequences where you don't have to know much about the game to understand what is going on.  I thought that this was a cute, funny, romantic movie to watch.  I'm not sure if it's one that I could watch over and over again or if it really has any memorable lines, but definately worth watching at least once.  If you found Major League to be entertaining,but more with football then this is your type of movie.
