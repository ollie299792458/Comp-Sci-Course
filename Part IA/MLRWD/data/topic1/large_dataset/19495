Pitch Black was arguably one of the most overlooked films of the early  year.  Although the setting of the film could seem routine to a casual  viewer(space travelers stranded and bickering on a hostile planet infested  with alien nasties), director David Twohy's wonderful use of color and  stylistic flourishes more than makes up for any trivial complaints.
For  those of you curious about the film's plot, it deals with a group of  marooned space "passengers" who spend the majority of their time  searching for a way to evacuate a harsh desert planet. Their efforts are  unexpectedly forced to quicken however when they discover a particularly  vicious type of nocturnal alien ready to emerge to the planet's surface  during an eclipse. 
Viewers can't help but like the film's villainous  hero(played by Vin Diesel of Saving Private Ryan and Boiler Room)who brings  to memory Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous role as the Terminator.  
The  film looks and sounds great and has more than a few moments of nail-biting  tension thrown in for good measure.  For Science Fiction fans this is a  must-see.  And as for the rest of you, try giving this fine movie a  chance.
You'll thank me when you do.
