I herd this one is hopley better then all the copy's that I
bought.  -"Night of  the Living Dead."  -I am a pure fan.!
I thought the 30th;  -Anniversary was; -rediculous.!  -yes.
therfore; -it was fine..  -I can't believe;  -many;  -George
Romero.  -John Russo.  -Or;  -"The Night."  -Fan's.!
Discrased this;  -30th Anniversary.!  -Even thought
They made some mistakes on it.?  -I think;  -It's
director and creator.  -George Romero.  -John Russo
and; -it's comppany
The Latin Image.  -Has made a valuble mistake.?
Yes. -They ttempted two make it more a real..  -Classic.!!
Let me tell you;  -Mr. -Romero is wasting his money
which i think 
It's kind of sad;  -that his company wood attempt
and tamper with such a classic.!  -I'm talking about the
light's of the 30thAnniversary.

I hope they'll do the same with my favorite;  -cult
Zombie classic.  -"Return of the Living Dead."  -Do more
with that one I thought;  -"Day."  -Was;  -dissapointing
and; -disturbing.
I think;  -"return."  -Will go;  -Triumph with it's
worth marketing four;  -DVD.!  -Any way;  -you decide the
fate of all the camp romp of allthese Horror movies..
The Dead are coming back two life.! -Their is no end
four the people trying and fighting their way
towards the zombies.! -and. -no one can get in their path
they half two listentwo radio and Television.?  -And;
The Authority's two
fight their way through. -It is time two make a stand again in
this compelling black and white.  -Slasher.!  
Although; -the film ranges from;  -exciting;  -campy humor
"no brain eating heads;  -in this one."  -Just people
fighting their way two the end of  the picture."
Though;  -this movie goes way two boring.!  -So; -just watch
the extras.  -Don't turn off  the lights.
