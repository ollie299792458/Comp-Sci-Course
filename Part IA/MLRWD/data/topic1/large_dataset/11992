Scream 3 wraps up the trilogy of the best American Horror/Slasher revivial of the 90's and early 2000's. After narrowly surviving 2 psychotic events, Syndney Prescott is now in hiding, secluded from any human contact, and coping with the horrific events of her life, and her mother's death. And that is what the final chapter of a horror trilogy is all about... going back to the begining and discoving there are more skeletons in the closet then you or anyone knew.

Scream 3 takes Kevin Williamson's amazing horror story, and concludes the 3rd chapter of Sydney Prescott and the Ghost faced killer that never stays dead. This time, the success of STAB and STAB 2, plus all the events at the Winsor College have launched a STAB 3 movie, which mirrors the haunting events of Sydney's life...and the terrifying eventst to come.

Again, some of the best cinematic elements, scenes, and nods to the genre/its best, Scream 3 loops you all the way back to the begining of the story, and leaves you gasping for air. Turn down the lights, and grab a blanket, for the thrilling and terror filled conclustion to the Scream story....
