From time to time I've revisited this movie. Entertaining it is.
"El Dorado" has its hokey moments, James Caan going on and on about "ride boldly ride" in a poem about El Dorado, Maudie (John Wayne's love interest) taking up where numerous women in Wayne's movies have left off: "I'm not going to cry. I'm just going to buy a pine box, about 6-foot for you" and then the requisite speech about how men are dumb for fighting and women are saintly for waiting valiently for their men to come back home, blah, blah blah.
It has has a geezer sidekick (Arthur Honeycutt)who mimics Walter Brennen from "Rio Bravo," James Caan who mimics Ricky Nelson from "Rio Bravo" and Mitchum who mimics Dean Martin from "Rio Bravo" and, finally, Charlene Holt, who mimics Angie Dickinson in "Rio Bravo." See the pattern? "Rio Bravo" and "El Dorado" are essentially the same movie. A sheriff, his sidekick and John Wayne, his sidekick and his girlfriend. Formulaic.

Nonetheless, there is a good movie in here.
There are elements of Wild Woolly Westerns here.
Christopher George plays the bad guy gunslinger who nonetheless warms up to John Wayne's Cole Thornton and SPOILER ALERT! gets it in the end.
But there is a scene that is gold: George and his band of bad men walk into the bar to see the other bad guy/rancher Edward Asner.
As they walk in, tinkly piano music plays and they swagger in. It's straight out of a 1920s shoot-em-up.

It's not a work of art. But it will entertain. It will grow on you with subsequent showings.
John Wayne is the ultimate John Wayne with his John Waynisms. Mitchum is pretty much a bystander and goes through the motions.

All in all, entertaining and a poem to formula Cowboy movies.
