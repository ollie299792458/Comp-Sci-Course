El Dorado may lack the status of some of Wayne's true classics, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393SG0G">Stagecoach</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F0UUIM">The Searchers</a>, or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O179FY">True Grit</a>, but it is still in my opinion one of Wayne's most enjoyable movies.  In this movie, Wayne plays his standard "tough guy with a good heart" as so many of his fans like him best.  In El Dorado, that lovable character is combined with the typical snappy dialog of Howard Hawks, a great co-star in Robert Mitchum and some fine supporting actors.

This "Centennial Edition" contains an excellent transfer of the film.  I'm not sure what the previous releases might have been like, but this one is definitely first rate.  The two-DVD set also includes some very worthwhile supplementary material, including a couple of very nice documentaries.  I was somewhat disappointed in the commentary, however.  There are actually two commentaries on the DVD and while they do include some interesting facts about the movie, the actors and the director, as you listen it becomes obvious that neither of the commentators are terribly great fans of this movie.  They both spend a lot of time "damning with faint praise" or comparing the film unfavorable to the director's other movies (in particular the very similar <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O599WG">Rio Bravo</a>).  I think their choice for this set was a mistake, as I would think most people would not care to listen to two "experts" pan the movie they just purchased.

(Personally, I find El Dorado much superior to Rio Bravo, if for no other reason that a far superior supporting cast.  Robert Mitchum is a far better actor than Dean Martin, and even the young James Caan is far preferable to teen idol turned "actor", Ricky Nelson.)

In the end, I think this "Centennial Collection" release would make a fine addition to the video library of most fans of either Wayne or Hawks.
