"Spartacus" is, at its heart, a film born out of conflict between its star, Kirk Douglas, and its director, Stanley Kubrick. That conflict, in fact, would become so intense that it led to a permanent rift between the two men.

Kubrick was brought onto the picture by Douglas after the actor fired director Anthony Mann. In addition, the screenplay (by Dalton Trumbo) was already finished, whereas Kubrick had already gotten used to the idea of helping to develop the story at hand himself.

One of Kubrick's main objections, apparently, was that the character of Spartacus was just too perfect -- a man without serious flaws or defects.

Well, what a classic confrontation, right? Actor wants to play a purely heroic character, while director wants to complicate things a bit more.

Douglas basically got his way. This is not surprising; he had a lot of power at the time. Also, "Spartacus" was released in 1960. The moviegoing public's view of film heroes, it could be argued, was much closer to Douglas' simple take than it was to Kubrick's richer, more complex stance.

In the end, though, Douglas and Kubrick created a brilliant film. First of all, you just can't take your eyes off it -- the scenery, the cinematography, the absolute grandeur and spectacle of it all. The film featured a cast of more than 10,000, including 8,000 real soldiers.

And the performances! Douglas, but also Lawrence Olivier, Tony Curtis, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov -- all delivered the goods in this one.

I do fault the film for being overly long, but with its running time of more than three hours, it was a harginger of Kubrick films to come.

Partly because of its running length, this is not a film I watch as often as some Kubrick movies in my collection -- yet I always end up enjoying it, especially the genuinely moving final scene.
