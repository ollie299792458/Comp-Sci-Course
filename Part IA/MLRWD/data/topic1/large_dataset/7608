I recently saw "Sleepaway Camp" for the first time. As a fan of horror, I have rememebered seeing the case for this video in the video store as a kid and wanting to see it. I didn't have the pleasure until last week. Was it worth the wait? OH YES!!!!

Don't expect high-end special effects or even great acting.

As you watch the film, you will probably be right as to who the killer is, but that isn't the whole story. With Sleepaway Camp, it isn't who the killer is. You will be frightened, perhaps amused but suprised at where the tale leads you.

This film is packed with tons of amusing torture and screaming and a large, um, really large pot of boiling water. This film will have you and your friends laughing, talking and analyzing. Oh yes my friends, it is that good.

Yes, Sleepaway Camp is cheese at its cheesiest but it does have some depth which I love. There are a ton of things in this film to laugh at, like James Earl Jones' father (who stars in the film), silly lines and very, very tight shorts, not to mention the fake mustache and walls with graffiti.

There are only two things in Sleepaway Camp that are even similar to Friday the 13th: 1) they both take place at a camp; 2) the counselors aren't really great at supervisoring. That's where it ends. This film did disappoint me with no nudity and very little blood but the tight shorts and atypical "murders" made it worth while.

If you love camp and horror all rolled into one, this is the movie to see.
