This one is worth watching once or twice. Otherwise, If you buy the DVD or blue Ray it will ONLY be taking up space. Your shelf space is more important.

What makes it worth watching are two things ... the car and the actor that plays Kato. They put all their energy into creating a great car (and thats why the trailer is great). Thumbs up for picking the actor that plays Kato. An the car with the music helped the trailer look great. Think about it.

On the other hand, the Green Hornet character reduces the credibility of the movie. The character will only appeal to all the un-employed playboys that love cars.

The fight scenes had too many special effects. They should have toned it done to appeal to more adults.

If your desire to watch it is very strong then use the "Video on Demand" option with your TV cable service. You will save 10 to 20 dollars.

Or, if your budget is tight, watch all the various trailers several times. The trailer has at least 85 percent of ALL the good scenes.

Good Luck
