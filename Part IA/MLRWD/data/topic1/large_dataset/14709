I saw one of the "Wolf Man" pictures with Lon Chaney when I was in one of the primary grades in elementary school.  I was in the front row as they put the youngest and lowest grades in front as the children in the higher grades could see over our heads. It was on a Friday afternoon, and I, being just a child, had the hell scared out of me (the large bed sheet used as a screen was no more than 10 feet in front of me) when Larry Talbot changed into the Wolf Man in a jail cell, snarling and rattling the bars as the camera panned in for a closeup.  To mention just how effective the special effects were at the time, that scene created a fear that lasted for a very long time.  I was especially fearful at night when alone and for years afterward dreaded going into my dark bedroom.  No matter how I tried to describe my fears to my parents, they could not understand and never allowed me have even the tiniest light to allay my anxieties. (They were not cruel . . . things were simply different in those days.)

Looking back, I think that those original "Wolf Man" movies were the state of the art in their day and there are few things new today that can compare with those ground-breakers.

This is the first time I came across the movie ("Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man") where I thought the scene was.  It was not.  Next I watched the first in the series, "The Wolf Man," and it was not in that movie either.

This is the first time I have seen any of the "Wolf Man" series since I saw that movie almost 70 years ago, and I can still picture that transformation from man into beast, with the creature wildly raging against the confines of the bars in the cell.

Is there anyone out there that recalls this scene and in which movie it occurs? Perhaps I am recalling the correct movie but the scene was not included in the re-release.

Thanks,
