Given how much movies have sucked in the last year or two, I've been pleasantly suprised this summer.  I've seen a couple movies in the last month that I can't wait to get on DVD, and The Brothers Grimm is one of them.

The movie is sharp, witty, suspenseful, funny, well acted, and well scripted and a general good time.  It also is classic Terry Gilliam, and reminds me more  of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" then anything Gilliam has done in the last decade.  It also manages to completely avoid any similarity to his worst flick, Time Bandits, a movie so painful to watch that it makes my short list of worst movies ever.  You'll notice that the people who hated this movie all mentioned loving Time Bandits, so that tells you a little something about their taste.

I also have to praise the acting in this movie, Heath Ledger and Matt Damon completely surpassed my expectations of them.  The last thing I saw Ledger in was "Knights Tale" which is fluffy teenage fair, so to see him in something where he is not just relying on good looks was a shocker, he actually can act.  And Matt Damon was so into his character that I was able to forget that it was Matt Damon in bad sideburns.  Kudos to both.  The supporting cast was also great, special props to MacKenzie Crook, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite supporting guys and Peter Stormare and Jonathan Pryce gave the kind of quality performances I've come to expect from them.

All in all, a great fun flick.
