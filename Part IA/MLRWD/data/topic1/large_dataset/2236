Sure its about incest and the rapacity of LA but without Polanski's eyewitness to the Holocaust and a country in the midst of political, social and moral crisis, there wouldn't be, "Chinatown."
The music for the opening credits couldn't be more perfect, capturing the big band sound of the thirties but hinting at a deep and painful weariness that goes to the heart of the film.  This is a film of beautiful surfaces where evil suddenly appears and shocks like maggots swarming the pit of the perfect peach.
Jack Nicholson makes J.J. Gittes sleazy, angry and desperate whose quest for truth is both foolish and noble.  Fay Dunaway displays a fragile strength and desperate pain as Evelyn Mulray that she doles out beautifully over the course of the film.  John Huston uses his oily warmth to great creepy effect.
And then there is the screenplay; beautifully constructed, wonderfully original with dialog that is both memorable and natural.  Is there a better original screenplay in Hollywood history?
Finally what is a mystery to me is how this film which is so sad and hopeless manages to feel so inspiring.  Is it that in its richness like all great works of art is the stuff of life?
