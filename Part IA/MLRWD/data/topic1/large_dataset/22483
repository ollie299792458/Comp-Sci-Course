The Forbidden Zone is a fabulous journey. The best way to describe it would be like falling into a Max Fleischer cartoon from the 1930's and hallucinating on the various edibles from Alice in Wonderland, set to some amazing music ranging from Cab Calloway and Josephine Baker to Oingo Boingo. This movie is fun. It frolics and pulls you in with the strange characters. Even the villains are extremely lovable.

My favorite part of this movie is the amazing Susan Tyrrell. She is a real Hollywood oddity. She did this movie just after being nominated for an Academy Award. The chemistry between Tyrrell and her then boyfriend, Herve Villachaize, is so sweet. Plus, she wrote the song "Witch's Egg" which she sings the heck out of. And don't miss the great performance by Danny Elfman as "Satan"!

This movie is not for the mainstream, close minded person. It is odd and out there and wonderful. I reccommend it for the daring person who enjoys an occasional journey to another dimension.
