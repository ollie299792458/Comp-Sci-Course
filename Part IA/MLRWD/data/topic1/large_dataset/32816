Very feww movies have ever captured the intent and the meaning explicit and implicit in the literary piece being adapted for film. THE DEAD does this superbably. Gabriel repeate ver batom the words from Joyce's story in bring-to-terms manner in the conclusion as he ruminates while looking out the window at the falling snow. he powerfully--in an almost quiet voice--reminds us of the coming deaths of all without being maudlin. Other reviewers have commented on the beauty and pathos of the party and the dinner and the dancing so that I need not comment on those aspects of the film other than to say except for GONE WITH THE WIND I can recall no film that has so elequently captures a time, a place, and a mood. One would have to be sensually dead and time-ignorant not to savor his film. My wife and I watch it every Christmas season along with FANNY AND ALEXANDER. As a matter of fact these two films along with a couple of HAMLET films are the only VCR films we own. What does that say? Any way, if you have not seen this film, do so.
