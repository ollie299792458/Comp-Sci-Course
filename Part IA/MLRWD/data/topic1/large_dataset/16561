Once in a while you watch a television show and, within five minutes, know that the writers "get it".  This is one of those shows.  From the first episode, the cast clicked, the writing worked, and it was a blast to watch.  I've watched each episode on this set several times, and I still find I'm laughing out loud.

Now the bad news...

The DVD set has no extras, and their absence makes a difference.  Would it be that hard to shoot a few "get to know the actors" bonus features?  How about commentary on at least the pilot?  Or even a few words from Chuck Lorre about his title cards?  Nope.  Not here.  You'd think a show about the kind of geeks that get into DVD bonus features would include bonus features on the DVD.

But the show itself is great.  Buy a copy.

EDIT: So much for my credibility.  I just realized there is one extra, a short called "Quantum Mechanics of the Big Bang Theory.  A Behind-the-Scenes Look Into Geek Chic."  But I still would have liked some commentary tracks!
