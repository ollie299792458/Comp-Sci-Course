A tag suggestion for this movie is "waste of time and money", and I agree. Here is the premise: Agnes (Ashley Judd) is a waitress living at a run down motel and hiding from her abusive ex-husband. She meets and falls for Peter (Michael Shannon), who is a drifter. Peter claims he is on the run from the Army, who did experiments on him. He eventually convinces Agnes that the Army implanted aphids into him, the egg sacs hidden under fillings in his teeth, which have begun to hatch through his skin after sleeping with Agnes. Agnes is eventually convinced that she is carrying the "Super Queen", which is why the aphids are all around them. The movie ends with Agnes and Peter destroying themselves so the Army can't get to them.
It is almost at the 40 minute mark when the first "bug" appears. The problem with this movie is that we never, ever see the "bugs". An Army consultant, Dr. Sweet, tells Agnes that Peter was diagnosed as being paranoid and schizophrenic, so it's possible that what Peter was saying was all in his head.
In the end, this movie had no thrills, no scares, no chills, no nothing.
