Season 3 of Moonlighting arguably contains the best episode of the best season of the best TV show from the 1980s.

All the sexual tension that Moonlighting rode on was on display in The Atomic Shakespeare episode.  Considering the real life tension between the stars, the episode practically wrote itself.  The wit of Moonlighting combined with the greatest writer of the English language make it the best 50 minutes of TV ever broadcast.

But Atomic Shakespeare is only the best of the best.  It's a Wonderful Job is my favorite take of the many parodies of the classic Capra movie.  Big Man on Mulberry Street contains a dazzling dance/dream sequence directed by the great Stanley Donen.  Throw in the usual strong Moonlighting episodes (see Cybill Shepherd with her feet sticking out of a mail cart in  Yours Very Deadly) and you have a must have DVD.

The last two seasons were not as strong for a variety of reasons but you can't go wrong with season 3.  Atomic Shakespeare alone is worth the cost.  Throw in the other episodes and you would have a hard time persuading me that any season on commercial TV was better.
