While the seller feedback option isn't available yet, I've already received the item from goHastings. They are prompt, deliver quality goods in a very short amount of time and I'm always happy with the product, whether it's a book, a cd or a dvd - this can be said of the numerous sellers I've dealt with, although I have ordered from goHastings quite a few times in the past year. The movie "The Departed" is a thriller/suspense/drama/action feature film with a superior cast and directed by Martin Scorcese, no less - talk about a seriously intense and engaging movie! Non-stop thrills, tension, constant action and interactions with the various characters, intriguing plots and sub-plots; just an all-around wonderful movie worth watching many times over. Everyone in the movie did a superb job and the movie was very enjoyable. Highly recommended!
