Based on the real life account of a thirteen-year old boy living in Mount Rainier, MD (a suburb of Washington, D.C.), The Exorcist is not only an effective horror film, but also an effective psychological tour de force.

In the movies' version of events we are taken to the more glamorous location of Georgetown, Washington, D.C. where Satan decides to possess a young girl (Linda Blair in the role as Regan). Why would Satan do this since demonic possession would prove the existence of the spiritual world, and therefore indirectly the existence of God? Let's just say (without ruining the movie for those who still haven't seen it) that if Satan is forced into revealing himself, there must be a good reason for it, otherwise he wouldn't.

To this day we still don't know the identity of the thirteen-year-old boy who was possessed in 1949. The family moved away from Mount Rainier, MD and converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism. The fact that no money or fame was sought by the young boy and his family is proof that whatever odd experiences the family underwent, they felt those experiences to be initiated by Satan.
