There are countless reviews of the movie itself out there so I will not rehash them, but I will just say I think it is an outstanding masterpiece and would recommend you watch it.

I bought the 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition Blu-ray and I am not at all disappointed with what I received. The boxing for the set is unique and well made. You could definitely display it on your movie shelves if you wanted to. The extra materials that are included are listed in the description (so again I won't be redundant) but I will say they were great. The included book with pictures and cast bios makes a great coffee table book if you wanted to do that since it's not too detailed, but gives enough interesting information that I'm sure a lot of people would like to browse it. Heston's personal journal from when he worked on the film is great! This was not a "look back", but is the text from his actual journal that he wrote in almost every day during the filming of the movie. Seeing his personal thoughts and hearing some candid behind the scenes info was really interesting. At the point of writing this review I have not watched all the bonus footage on the 2nd disc so I will not comment on that for now but will update this once I do.

Bottom line, if you are not a big Ben Hur fan you probably should steer towards a regular edition since the extra money will probably not be worth it to you, but if you love Ben Hur I think all the extras in this Collector's Edition will be worth it to you.
