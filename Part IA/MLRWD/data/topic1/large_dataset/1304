American moviegoers, I am sad to say, have a tendency to think of comedy only in broad terms. If a film isn't filled with bawdy jokes or slapstick humor, then it can't possibly be really funny, right?

Wrong.

"The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain" is a gentle comedy about simple people in a small Welsh village during World War I who take great pride in the mountain in whose valley the town is located. But when two British surveyors come to measure the mountain as a part of the war effort, the townsfolk are dismayed to discover that -- at least by the British standards -- their mountain is only a hill. Of course, the Welsh will do anything to ensure that their mountain is deemed a mountain.

Underlying the humor of this film is the poignancy of a community that is trying to hold on to its identity in the face of a war that has devastated the population and has left the community something of a shadow of its former self. They have lost men in war -- some killed, some who come back shell-shocked -- and so they do what they can and what they must in order to hang on to their identity. The scene in which a shell-shocked young man journeys up the mountain during a thunderstorm is particularly moving.

Although the Brits can do broad, over-the-top comedy as well as anyone else (Monty Python comes to mind), they also have the knack of doing small, gentle comedies as well as, if not better, than anyone else. And the scenery of Wales is absolutely breathtaking.
