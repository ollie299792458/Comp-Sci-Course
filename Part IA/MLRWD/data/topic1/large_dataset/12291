Hi Queequeg...I agree with most of what you said. However, I love the ending of "Sudden Fear" when Myra screams out Irene's name. It shows how her character is instinctively a good and honest person and could never kill anyone in real life. I find it highly effective.

I really don't think she is smirking at the end. I think she looks almost resigned, numb, somewhat exhausted by the whole surreal thing. It's my favorite ending of any Joan movie (next to "Humoresque"). There she is a survivor walking into the SUNRISE. She is alone yet liberated.

Remember, when Myra found out her hubby was going to kill her and the only proof she had of this was destroyed--and thus no cop would believe her--she had roughly 48 hours (and no sleep) to react, plan, and defend herself.

I would like to think her character smirked later on when she came home, took stock of her bank account, and found herself free of that evil little man. Finally, with some serenity back in her life, she would write her next and greatest play: "Sudden Fear".

On opening night of Myra's new play--who is in the audience but Joan Crawford. Joan runs backstage after the final curtain and tells Myra she wants to buy the film rights. After a few drinks, Myra admits it was all true. "Actually, Joan...", Myra confesses, "...when  I was sweating my ass off in that mink, running away from that evil little man IN MY NEW HIGH HEELS, I thought to myself: 'Crawford could totally pull this off!!'"
