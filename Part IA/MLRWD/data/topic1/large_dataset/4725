Enough
This film takes the socially constructed image of a downtrodden weak, yet family oriented woman, and places her in the visual gaze of combat. The plot of the movie uses Lopez' sex appeal to its full potential as this revenge thriller is clich&eacute; down to the last drop. Jennifer Lopez dawns the initial guise of a beautiful, frail waitress, whom seemingly meets and marries the man "of her dreams." That dream however, quickly becomes a nightmare. The two marry, and Jennifer Lopez' character, Slim, has a daughter. She later finds out that not only is her husband unfaithful, he is also abusive. Her solution?  Rather than confront the cinematically portrayed "dominant" image of her husband, she flees, reinforcing the stereotypical representation of a "terrified woman."
 It just so happens that she is the illegitimate daughter of a business tycoon, who helps fund her "new life" or rather, several of them. She learns that running serves no purpose, as her husband tracks her down time and time again. The law cannot help her, as she has, in a sense, kidnapped her own child. It seems being a woman isn't enough to resolve the issue, as her only solution is to confront her husband man to man. She invests in personal combat training to prove to him once and for all she has had enough of everything, with the exception of tight body suits.
