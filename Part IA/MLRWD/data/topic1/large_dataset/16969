I was drawn towards this movie because...well, first of all, I'm very inclined towards movies that have teens as the main characters...particularly teen girls...and I love movies that delve into people's psyche and this looked like (from the box) a movie that would do that, and it did this and more.  The movie is well acted (Phillips stands out in my mind because of her scenes where she becomes really angry and really lashes out, and you can just FEEL it, even with the tv on mute).  I haven't seen a lot of movies on school shootings, but I was very much impressed with this movie (and their ability to get so many recognizable names squeezed into the film...Jay Leno, Wal-Mart, The Bangles...must've cost a good bit for licensing)For a bit more in-dept description of the movie check the other reviews...they do a good job.  Now...only two slight problems that I had with this movie, which will hardly make a difference to the average viewer, but...the cover line says something about a lesson in true evil...very misleading...gives the impression that you're about to watch something really dark, maybe a thriller, and there are scenes that are edited in a way that give the feeling of distortion, intense trauma or something that doesn't really fit with the movie (e.g. Christensen suddenly...err...flips out...and then she's talking and the dialogue doesn't fit with her actions...this is a cool effect, but it doesn't really fit the style of the film)  But...this is not something that would bother a casual viewer.  It's a great film
