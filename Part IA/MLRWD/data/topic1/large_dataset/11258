Old movie, likeable love story:
The characters (Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison) are likeable enough in this fourties period piece. A determined young widow and her daughter decide to get away from it all, moving to a house by the sea. The house has been for sale for quite some time and the locals say it's haunted, which only seems to encourage her to move in...but the owner still has yet to move out. The sea captain, the man from a too-realistic painting in the house, resents that his accidental death was called a suicide and hence punishes all who try to live in his house, like his latest house guest the widow. But she's the proverbial different and nether widowing, a corset, or a ghost can hamper her. Eventually the captain and the widow forge a living together (he can stay if he won't bother the widows daughter), complete with .... tension, until a suitor moves in on Mrs. Muir and eventually the captain and his painting are taken down...
Rex Harrison plays a less articulate version of the unapologetic, well, sadist that was Henry Higgins (of "My Fair Lady"). The widow is smart but sensitive (and a lady, who covers up the captains painting before undressing) and likeable, who notices that neither she nor her daughter have no accent? Will the couple end up together, despite the boundaries of class AND mortality? 
This is not a masterpiece, but why compare it? The story is sweet and the characters are likable. A good rainy day yarn...
