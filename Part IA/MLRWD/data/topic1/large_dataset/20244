What a great and fun movie!  Tatum O'Neal steals the show here; she definitely deserved the Oscar for her great portrayal of the way-too street smart for her age orphan (maybe) Addie Pray (Loggins).  Adults and kids can enjoy this together without much fear of the admittedly seedy subject matter -- con artistry, prostitution, racial exploitation, the corruption of youth, etc.  You can't help but root for Addie all the while knowing that Moses will never be a good father, role model or successful "businessman."  
The black and white cinematography recalls classic Margaret Bourke-White Depression-era photos as well as "The Grapes of Wrath," but without the need for Prozac or counseling.  The soundtrack is comprised of Thirties pop radio standards that fit perfectly without calling too much attention to themselves.
Madeline Kahn is a scream as Miss Trixie Delight, John Hillerman excels in two roles:  a sheriff and his brother, a local bootleggar, and P.J. Johnson is great as Trixie's maid, Imogene.
I loved it when I first saw it as a 12-year-old.  I still love it now.  So will you.
