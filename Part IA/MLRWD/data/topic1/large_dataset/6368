Mel Brooks' career really took off with this rip-roaringly hilarious send up of everything Western. Cleavon Little as the first black sherrif in the west with Gucci saddle bags shines in his best role. The cast is loaded with Brooks regulars; Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman, Dom DeLuise, Madeline Khan and, of course, Mel himself! All having a hell of a laugh at the expense of EVERYONE! That's EVERYONE! Even the bit players leave you crying with laughter! Especially Alex Karras' horse punching Mongo and Slim Pickens moronic railroad foreman Taggart. This film gets a ton of flack these days for being "racist"? People who see this film in that sort of light should take off their blinders and realize that political correctness is just another form of censorship. Why can't you let free thinkers enjoy a GREAT MOVIE without having to worry about the thought police busting down their doors? The top notch script, written by a "collective" of writers including Richard Pryor(who wrote most of the more racially charged material and finds it hilarious), is so full of verbal jabs and visual japes that you will find yourself visiting this movie over and over again when you need a good dose of laughter. Don't let the conservatives scare you off, this is one of the funniest films ever made! Enjoy repeatedly!
