I like Daryl Hannah, but this movie, while not entirely without its virtues, is almost devoid of dialogue, none of which is in English.  I prefer a film to include more articulate expressions of feelings than the primitive gestures that the subject-matter of this story allows.  I do, however, give the film 3 stars, because it is not easy to tell a story almost solely through action, and I feel that the cast and crew did a fair job with the project.  However, I honestly don't find the story in and of itself to be thoroughly enthralling, though the situational tension and humour tend to use thralls as an illustration of the dangers of misogyny and sexual discrimination in a society composed primarily of neanderthals.  Very relevant.  In summary, it's an original story, but that is because, by defying conventional plot forms, it has no one unifying theme, no ultimate antagonist, and no great cathartic moment.  The climaxis too near the end, making the movie end abruptly, and without resolution.  As a film, "The Clan of the Cave Bear" feels more like a documentary of life in the wild, because there is no accounting for the accidents and disasters that transpire.  There is no fairy-tale feel, but there isn't any one focus that at least makes this film germane to the (civilized) modern human perspective of struggle.
