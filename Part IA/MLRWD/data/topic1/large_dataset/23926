great pic of alex pettyfer in 'popstar' mag.  other than that, nothing much has been mentioned about the summer release.
alex was in 'tom brown's school days' and 'alex rider: operation stormbreaker'.  they were hoping for a full series of movies based on the books, but 'rider' bombed at the box office.
alex did a great job in both movies, esp. 'rider'.  it is good to see him back and working.  i hope he gets the recognition he deserves, even if it is only becuz of people wanting too see vanessa hudgens at the movies.
the added bonus of neil patrick harris, might bring in the adults as well, making it a family movie nite.
the story is 'beauty and beast' told from the beast's point of view, which hasn't been done before.  alex spent 4 and half hours in make-up (and 1 and half getting it off) every day.  but i hope we get to see a lot of him as he is as well.  he has certainly worked hard in everything he has done.  (martial arts and stunts in 'rider'.)  he deserves a break.
