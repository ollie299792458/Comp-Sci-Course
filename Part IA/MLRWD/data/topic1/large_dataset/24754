This is the first film production that entails both generations of the Earnshaws and Lintons.  As a Graduate student of English, I am very familiar with the text and I find this version is adequate and fascinating.  Ralph Fiennes utilizes his ever-charismatic talent for drama to pull-off the complex and dark Heathcliff character. Binoche gives and exceptional "I am Heathcliff" speech.  I was able to follow the text along with the movie's scenes.  There are some variations, and I am biased since I stand forthright in my allegiance to text rather than film.  One of the main aspects of Heathcliff's character in the text is his envy for the blue eyes of Linton and Fiennes' blue eyes are a bit distracting in the movie.  The film industry has yet to really apply the physical description of Heathcliff to film version.  But, this version is perfectly tuned into the Gothic and dreary features of the text.
