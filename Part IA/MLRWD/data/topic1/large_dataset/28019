Yes, the movie is long, and involved, and over-dramatized, and long, but if you have a problem with any of that then you really shouldn't be watching an Indian film in the first place.

Once you get past the afore mentioned minor details you will absolutely LOVE Devdas.  I consider myself experienced in the "bollywood movie viewing" genre, but this movie absolutely blew me away.  It truly takes every Bollywood trademark to the extreme: elaborate costumes, elaborate songs, elaborate dances, elaborate relationships.

But what I really like about Devdas is the way it was filmed.  I love Indian movies but they more often than not make me feel like I'm watching something straight out of the 80s.  Devdas is nothing like that.  It is very modern in its direction and it is masterfully filmed.

Another thing that sets it apart from most other bollywood films is that the end doesn't leave a warm feeling in your heart and a smile on your face.  In fact, it leaves you with quite the opposite.  But the entire story is so well written, and the ending is so tragic and haunting that you won't give a second thought to those streams of tears running down your cheeks!

Personally, Devdas has become my favorite bollywood film (just knocking out Dil To Pagal Hai and Kahbi Kushi Kahbi Gahm) and I hope you all buy it and enjoy it too!
