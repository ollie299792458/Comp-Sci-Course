This film is based upon a story written by British writer Clive Barker.  More of a thriller than a stright horror movie, Virginia Madsen starts as Helen Lyle, a grad student at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  She, and her friend, are writing a thesis on modern folklore.  One story she is researching is of the "Candyman", a slave spirit with a hook hand who is said to haunt Chicago's notorious Cabrini-Green housing projects.

Upon hearing of a recent death at Cabrini-Green attributed to the Candyman, she wants to add a new chapter to her research.  Helen investigates and interviews the witnesses who found the dead person and the circumstances which led to the murder.  All agree- the Candyman did it.

Helen assumes that the people in the projects are simply buying into the urban legend of the Candyman and that there must be a rational explanation for the death.  However, her doubt in the existence of the Candyman only provokes his anger to prove to her that he is indeed real, and not a figment of imagination.

The Candyman starts paying personal visits to Helen, and, under his demonic spell, new deaths occur all around her.  She gets framed for those deaths and escapes a mental hospital to prove her innocence, and to save a child that the Candyman abducted from the projects.

Nice performances by Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd, along with the music by Philip Glass make this an effective thriller, a modern day ghost story, and a tragic tale of obsessed love.
