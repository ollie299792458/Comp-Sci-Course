Beautifully restored Disney classic.  The last great animated film of Disney's old school animators. When animation took the turn to more CGI I grimmaced.  Illustrated in a loose style with a sketchy feel, the animators infused far more life than a sterile computer graphic modelling.  These artists could really draw.
With incredible voice talent of New Orleans' Phil Harris and Louie Prima, this movie is so jazzy and cool that you become addicted to their style of lingo and banter. Just like being in New Orleans French Quarter!
This two disk set is curiously missing the theatrical trailer(s) while they managed to put in an extraneous music video.  Who really cares about these young kids singing a Jungle Book updated (gasp) song.  I don't.  So as a collector I felt somewhat slighted when the theatrical trailer and any promotional material was absent.  I guess Disney will go to the old cash cow once again for a SUPER DUPER PLATINUM GOLD EDITION and include all promotional materials then.  How shrewd!
Disney should start releasing older films to dvd and preserve them for posterity, titles like "Dr. Syn Alias The Scarecrow (of Rominey Marsh)."
