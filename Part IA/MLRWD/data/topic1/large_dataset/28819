A white couple lose their young son in a tsunami in Thailand. 6 months later, the husband has accepted his child's death, but the mother can't handle the loss at all and keeps seeing her son in other children. When they watch a video of Burmese children, the mother is convinced that the blurry kid they see only from behind is their missing son. He must have been washed ashore in Burma! After all, he's wearing a red shirt just like their son did! The husband doesn't really believe it, but he doesn't want to disappoint the wife he loves deeply, and he still feels guilt because he couldn't hold on to the son during the tsunami, so he agrees to go  to Burma with her. Since the country doesn't permit travellers, they pay a very large sum of money to criminals to take them there and find the child. This leads to a life-threatening horror trip into the Burmese jungle.

So far, so good. The plot is psychologically interesting, the actors are truly fine (especially Rufus Sewell as the husband), and up to a certain point, the story is convincing. But after a while, the director loses himself in weird scenes that don't make any sense, there are no explanations for the strange events in the second half of the film, and he basically steals from other movies when he moves into this section (think Apocalypse Now and the like). What could have been an interesting psychological drama turns into meaningless nonsense with a few shock / horror elements. The title (Vinyan means 'angry spirits', which are supposed to remain on earth after a violent death in many Asian beliefs) may explain the otherwise inexplicable hundreds of brutal children with painted faces that start showing up more and more as the film continues (maybe, I'm really not sure). But on the whole I see this film as a wasted opportunity to tell a good story with fine actors in an interesting landscape. I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste your money on this.
