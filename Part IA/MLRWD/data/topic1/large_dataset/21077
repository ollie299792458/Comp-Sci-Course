I really enjoyed and appreciated the first High School Musical.  It had a vital message for young people, not highly original, but possibly stated in such a way that it would reach a few individuals that wouldn't necessarily pay attention to anything else.  Right now, there is a student who is breaking the mold and surpassing their expectations because they learned that they could from the Disney Channel! The sequel left most of that out, and the third installment looks more like something a Government agency would come up with.  The original cast have become caricatures of themselves and so many elements of the storyline have been reworked from the first two movies that it eventually becomes a chore just to sit through it. This film fulfilled all of my expectations, but not in a good way.  I was sincerely hoping that they would have poured a little bit of that high budget movie money into the script, but it was my perception that nobody even went back to watch the original film.  Sure, the first movie was posturing and silly, but in the end it meant something. This film just means that there is no concept so insignificant that a movie studio can't throw money at it in the hopes of making more.  Lesson Learned.
