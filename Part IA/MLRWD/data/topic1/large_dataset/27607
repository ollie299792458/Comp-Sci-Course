Boy, the reviews on Amazon for this movie are very extreme.  Some hate it because they wanted a zombie flick.  Others hate it because it was a frame for frame remake of Rec.  Still others hate it becuase the characters don't act the way they wanted them to.  This film really seemed to strike a nerve around here.  Look at the reviews for most other Amazon titles.  You will rarely see such a mixed bag.

Jeez...

I'm glad I didn't read these reviews before seeing it for myself.  I whole-heartedly enjoyed it.  It very much had a Cloverfield feel, but with a rampaging virus instead of a monster.  I didn't see any Resident Evil in this movie - it was much better than that.  This film was solidly Cloverfield meets 28 Days Later.

The ending is no surprise; we all know that we are watching a video of the recorded events.  That of course gives us no reason to root for our heriones to see the light of day - no reason to become too attached to them or care for their safety.  Nevertheless, I like the fact that the filmakers gave us 10 minutes to meet the main characters.  Even that small connection to them was important.

If I was forced to find a single negative about this film, it would be that it is unlikely that a camaeraman would film the events as well as he did once his survival was at stake.  I'd think the camera would be used as little more than a flashlight at that point.  Cloverfield did a better job of explaining the camera, as the cameraman felt as though the video would be his legacy - that he knew he wouldn't survive the day.

Putting that minor point aside, this was really a great film.
