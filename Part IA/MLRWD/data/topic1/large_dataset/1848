After reading the editorial review, I was a little miffed to say the least.  This isn't just some story that Hollywood made up.  This is a man's REAL LIFE story.  Just because it fits or doesn't fit into some quaint box that you've made for it, doesn't make it any less real.  I've met Sam and he's been to speak at our church.  This is what he's been called to do and unless you've walked in this man's shoes, don't judge him! The movie was well done and yes, not widely distributed because it is controversial.  Gerard Butler and Michelle Monaghan did a wonderful job portraying these real life people.  It's a little dicey in the beginning and I was thinking maybe I shouldn't have brought my 15 y.o. daughter to see it with the violence, drug abuse, sex scene and cursing but it was his life and she's met Sam so she knows how he has changed.  It lets you see the atrocities being done to these people in other parts of the world and how Sam and others are helping them too.  Whatever you may think of helping "African children" doesn't matter. They are still humans who live real life and should be protected and cared for and loved like you love one of your own.  Absolutely worth seeing!
