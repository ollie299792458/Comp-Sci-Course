Because of all the teen-hype, I was planning on never seeing this movie.
Luckily, I ended up renting it and loved every minute of it! As it says on the video-cover, "Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Julia Stiles shine!" After seeing it, I took the movie to be about two very mature human-beings having a very mature relationship around friends who were anything but mature. The ending, by the way, is wonderful, I love Barry White! (You'll have to see it to get it...)
I felt a little bad for Selma Blair's acting r&eacute;sum&eacute;, though. She plays a highly promiscuous porn-star.
Julia Stiles is always amazing, so it was no surprise that she was great in this film. Her acting abilities are incredible. 
Freddie Prinze surprised me. I'm not one of those screaming fans of his, and never really liked the "teen-ie" type movies he was doing, so I was quite pleased to discover that this wasn't just a teen-flick.
I'd say, in the beginning, before I saw it, it seemed like a movie that would attract tons of "first-date" couples. You know the ones: 5th graders-through-Freshmans in High School.
But after seeing it, I think that college couples and young-couples in their 20's might benefit more from seeing "Down To You".
It gives you a more realistic idea of what makes a relationship work than most of the romantic comedies today do.
This is a really sweet movie. But not too sweet. Guys will like it, too. :)
