<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LAIGX2">The Secret World of Arrietty</a> is one of those rare films that only gets better with each additional viewing.  Beyond the visual beauty and simple emotional honesty that engage you from the start, there's a world of seemingly endless detail that gradually emerges, giving the sense that you've entered into a deeply layered reality.  The transitions from one shot to the next and from scene to scene are utterly masterful.  Students of film making might study Arrietty to learn how all the elements of a film maker's vocabulary should be fit together for optimal effect.

I could go on and on like this, but the main thing I want to get across is that this is an unusually good movie--a rare pleasure for both eye and ear.  (That last part has to do not only with the exceptional voice acting and sound effects, but also with the voice and harp of C&eacute;cile Corbel.)  You really don't want to miss this one, whether you're an adult or a child.  For children, a movie like this is pure magic--something that will stay and be fondly remembered.  Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki can be counted on for things like that.  Long may they shine!
