Had the pleasure of seeing Stone Reader last May at the Angelika Dallas. It's a wonderfully delicious film that deals with books and the people who write them, read them, and love them. It made me think twice about being embarrassed to have so many books on our shelves here (most of which are still in boxes after a 10-ton move to Dallas; most of those ten tons were books) and come to terms with it.
What is remarkable is that this is a film about reading that sends you out of the theatre ready to read at least one of the books that you saw in the film on a shelf, in a stack, shared in discussion, because you will recognize many of your favorites, see some of your "I really want to read this" books or "I tried once and put it down" books discussed by people who read them, and be intrigued by the themes running through books and the film, the main theme of which is "remarkable books by 'one-book authors,'" a fascinating category into which falls the author of "The Stones of Summer," a book with which Mark Moskowitz became so fascinated that he documented his search for that author in this film that covers something no other film has -- a love of reading and books that is both intellectual and visceral, or viscerally intellectual - never dry, always loving.
...and with the DVD, there's more!
