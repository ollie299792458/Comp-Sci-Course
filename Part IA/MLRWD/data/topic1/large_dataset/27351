An incredible movie with dialogue nearly on par with "The Big Lebowski."  A review on the box says "Reservoir Geeks," but anyone who comes away with only that impression has been lured by the Hollywood hook and really misses the depth of this film.
Amongst the many brilliant one-liners and silly cite gags (there are lots!) is a truly profound story of friendship, sacrifice and the importance of following your dreams.  Disillusioned with the vanity and idleness of "laying out by the boat house" with sorority girls, Anthony Adams (Luke Wilson) "goes nuts" but is able to resurrect himself by helping his bumbling friend Dignan live out his oddball dreams.  In the end Anthony and Dignan are exactly where they dreamed they'd be even though one's in jail and the other dating a housekeeper who can't speak English.
If nothing else, this movie is worth watching only to see Owen Wilson play Dignan, who is easily one of the best comedic characters of the last decade.  Wilson plays the character as well as anyone could, which is no surprise since he also co-wrote the film with Wes Anderson, who is himself one of the hottest young director's in Hollywood.  A cast of fresh faces (minus James Caahn, who's fantastic), great performances, and a remarkable screenplay make this an absolute must for fans of the modern, 20-something comedy and beyond.
