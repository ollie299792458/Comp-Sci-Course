Let me start by saying that Forever Changes is one of my favorite albums of all time.  I have listened to it hundreds of times and I am still not bored with it.  I seem to love it more as the years go on.

Last fall I stumbled upon this DVD here at Amazon.  I have not been as excited about a potential Christmas gift since I was a kid.  I emailed my wife a link to Amazon and said "top of the list for me for Christmas"

Needless to say I got it and played it Christmas night after the kids went to bed and the house was quiet.

There he was.  The genious.  The man who suffered internally but found a way to produce a timeless album almost 40 years ago that reflected his gift.  And there was an audience full of people who also love the album whom I immediately found a certain kinship with.

Now to the content.  Incredible!  First of all the sound was flawless - from horns to the strings to the drums to the bass to the guitars to the vocals.  Secondly the video production was nearly perfect.  Whoever managed what cameras shot when really knows the album because he/she knew just what to cut to and when.  I was very happy with the video production.  The only issue I could have was the lighting could have been better at times on the stage.  The details of each song do not get overlooked.  What you hear on the album pretty much is reproduced live on stage.

Arthur was sincere and really into the whole show.  The fact that he is no longer with us makes this show even more special and timeless.

5 stars.  I highly recommend.
