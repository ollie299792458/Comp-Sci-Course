What do you say about the quintessential Christmas movie that hasn't already been said?  Nothing, so I won't try.  This is movie making at its best.  Great characters, great actors (supporting and main), great story, great direction, and superb messages.  "It's a Wonderful Life" was perhaps at its best when it was still in the public domain and could be watched practically every hour on a different television station.  Thanks to a greedy media industry, we can now only see it once a season, or on DVD.  Okay, enough of this soap box.
George Bailey is a man down on his luck.  His dreams always took him far away from Bedford Falls, but his realities kept him firmly secured to this small New York town.  Every time his bags were packed, another emergency forced him to take on another responsibility that would more deeply root him.  Finally, he faces another crisis from circumstances beyond his control that make him consider suicide.  What could keep him from jumping off the bridge?  A well meaning angel named Clarence that knew George would never fail to do the right thing for someone else.  In an answer to George's prayer, Clarence shows him a world without George Bailey.  For a brief time, he sees how his life and love had made a real difference on those around him.
The morals of this movie aren't likely to be seen in Hollywood for a long time to come, if ever.  So enjoy this treasure from 1946.  It might not be "realisitic," but it should be.
