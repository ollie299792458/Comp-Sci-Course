This is an intriguing film. There are a lot of odd choices in it that make it distinctive. It's in lush color, uniformly brightly lit. The fashions are dramatic, and for Moreau, mostly variations on black or white. Which is fitting, as she's an avenging angel, acting on a moral imperative.

Though, to her victims, she's a femme fatale, the film interestingly does not demonize her. As the story unfolds, we learn her reasoning, and she is insanely dedicated to efficiently targeting her victims. She doesn't allow for innocents to get caught in the crossfire.

Perhaps most interesting of all is Moreau's performance; she rarely smiles, in fact underplays every scene. So we're left with the beautiful enigmatic presence of a woman acting as she must, by her own moral reckoning, alienated from the rules and constraints of society. One minute of confession finally lets us in to the pain under her stony visage; yet even that is intercut with flashbacks and underlined by Hermann's expressive score.

Truffaut's Hitchcock homage works on several levels, not least of which is each of the varied guises the bride wears to snare her foes. She makes herself into their perfect object before killing them, and they make it all to easy for her. And yet each encounter is distinct, a portrait of the character of the man who wronged her as much as of Julie herself.

Most unusual of all, perhaps due to the Hitchcock influence, is how old-fashioned the movie is. The narrative is so direct, so visual and so well-plotted, there's none of the verite' or hand-held moves that were making other films look natural and experimental at the time. The look is more 1960 or 1964 than 1968; it must have looked old-fashioned even at the time. And yet Moreau's Julie, in costume after costume, is an indelible vision.

There are few extras on the DVD, just scene selections and the theatrical trailer, which is a kitschy treat.
