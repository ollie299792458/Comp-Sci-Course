Sortof a harlequin romance with a bit of a twist, this charming movie is  the story of a young wife and mother, Pearl, (Diane Lane) who is  disillusioned with her life and her marriage and is beginning to regret the  opportunities that have passed her by. She married early and settled into  the role of wife and mother without really getting to experience her youth.  Set in 1969, the year of Woodstock and the moon walk, Pearl, her husband,  Marty, (Liev Schrieber), his mother, and their two kids travel to their  yearly campsite in the Catskills, 2 hours north of New York City. The same  cabin, the same scenery and the same people every summer, and, as usual,  Marty has to remain in the city during the week working at his dead end job  as a TV repairman to support their family. Pearl resents Marty's absence,  and yearns for the freedom of being young again. As the story unfolds,  Pearl finds herself attracted to a travelling blouse salesman who has come  into the cabin grounds to set up shop. The turning point for Pearl is that  fateful weekend of the moon walk, when Marty is unable to return from the  city because of all the TV's needing repair work. So begins a voyage of  discovery for Pearl, an awareness of her self that is paralleled well  alongside her daughter's first tentative discovery of young love,  Woodstock's discovery of free love, and a country's discovery of the world  beyond.  Diane Lane is superbly convincing as a hopeful, but despairing  young woman and she is well supported by a strong cast of supporting  actors. Anna Paquin is marvellous as the young teenage daughter, Viggo  Mortenson is believable as the sensitive, hippy lover of Pearl, and Liev  Schreiber is outstanding as the cheated husband. I really enjoyed this  movie. It's kindof quiet and charming and takes an honest look at love,  marriage and relationships.
