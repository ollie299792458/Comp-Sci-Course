Believe it or not I was lucky enough to study this one at uni along with Thelma and Louise and Shane.  I lapped up every minute of Easy Rider, of course there is very little plot, but that is not the reason you watch it.  The stylised late sixties 'acid induced' camera work, fabulous sound track and wonderful male leads is a testament that even when people are doped to the eye balls some stories are begging to be told.  This film was so of its time - almost like the foretelling of the autumn and winter of the 'Summer of Love' when the warm fluffy ideaologies where crumbling and decaying and the establishment where again ascertaining their will.

Dennis Hopper is so wonderful in this he holds the screen.  His maniac/OCD behaviour is a foretaste of many of the great characters he portrayed in the 70's, but also a stern reminder of his own personal descent, that thankfully now he has overcome.  Of course like many films of this time and even now the females are just window dressing.  It does frustrate me a bit because I like many of my contemporaries imagine myself on a big Harley cruising through the landscape, any way 'the times they are a changing' and some day I hope we will see more strong, sassy and beautiful women on the screen.
