Despite some rather inane special effects, Otto Preminger's "In Harm's Way" quite effectively, convincingly captures the feverish urgency and utter uncertainty of military life in wartime: Fleeting, furtive, forbidden, incandescent romance; misguided, chaotic mass troop movement and catastrophic command indecision and ineptitude; the omnipresent backbiting and naked ambition of officers and men as they greedily, unabashedly jockey for power in the turbulent wake of bitter disaster and career-ending disgrace.  If the viewer will look past the film's admitted flaws--toy battleships slugging it out in a bathtub, for instance, or Coates and Lawrences' "Sleepy Lagoon" playing to partying officers and wives at a social gathering a full two months before the hit song was recorded by Harry James, in February '42--he will discover far more than first meets the eye.  More than just a war film, "In Harm's Way" is a lusty, sprawling paean to the exquisite beauty which lies in wait just beyond the International Date Line, and beneath the Southern Cross.  For those who have sailed southwest--that is, to Viti Levu, Espiritu Santo, to San Cristobal or Malaita--they will taste the Mai Tai in their cheek when viewing the movie, will recall the heady scent of frangipani, the velveteen caress of tropical zephyrs at twilight, or hear, as William Manchester wrote, "the rhythm of surf on distant snow-white beaches."  Indeed, every character, every scene, every sub-plot is an adventure of it's own; and, of course, John Wayne, as always, stands tall, expansive--all powerful--seemingly every bit as vast and all-encompassing as was the Pacific war itself.  And somehow, as he has so often accomplished in his war films, Wayne makes us think again of our giant fathers, and of their lofty perch in history--an unparalleled epoch that once was, and will never be again.
