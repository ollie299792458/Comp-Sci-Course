I did not even buy the movie from amazon but wanted to write a review because no one has yet.  This movie was one of the better 3d flixs  i have watched on my 3dtv.  3d worked great no ghosting, and almost no break down in the 3d image.  I was nervous about future 3d movie releases after i received how to train your dragon from samsung.  The dragon movie was great in theaters, but horrible on 3dtv, it was not full screen (this completely ruins the 3d quality), and the 3d broke down continuously, unwatchable! This was not the case with Alice. Full screen, and almost no break down. Even though it was not filmed in 3d it still gave great sense of depth at home.  If you own a 3dtv i def recommend you add this to the small list of 3d movies to buy. PLus its pretty cheap for a 4 disc combo. I only gave it 4 stars because i reserve 5 stars for the completely flawless(story,3d, ect. Avatar if ever released in 3d, and if it does not have a single split second of 3d break down will get 5 from me)
