RAT RACE is definitely a movie you've gotta see. It's so hilariously funny you'll be rolling around on the floor laughing by the end. RAT RACE is about a billionaire who gets like, ten very different people together who are willing to do anything to earn 2 million dollars. He challenges them to race--dividing them up into different teams. The first team to reach the locker which holds the $2 million wins. But it isn't easy; the teams have to go through hilarious and difficult obsticles to get to the locker, and all the while the billionaire bets some other millionaires on who will win the race. He gives the teams keys to open the locker...but the keys have tracking devices on them which helps the billionaire find out where they are.
RAT RACE has an allstar cast including John Cleese, Rowan Atkinson, Seth Green, Whoopi Goldberg, Amy Smart, Breckin Myer, and more! To me, the movie is sort of like a spoof of reality TV shows like "Survivor" and "The Amazing Race". I'm not really sure if that's what the movie was aiming at, but in anyway, it's very hilarious. RAT RACE is a film your entire family, plus all your friends, co-workers, and classmates will all love! So basically, it's a movie for everybody. It's very much worth your time and money. The acting is superb, and the storyline/plot are solid. The comedy is excellent! Seth Green and Breckin Myer are the best in this one.
The DVD for RAT RACE is highly recommended for anyone in search of an excellent, smart, non-gross comedy!
