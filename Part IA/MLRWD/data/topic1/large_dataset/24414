This movie is all about a black mother, her two children, and a black man who just bought a new car on New Year's Eve.  The mother is a divorcee who's preparing to go on a business trip while her children spend the New Year with their father, Frank.  He, of course, doesn't care about the children so he calls in sick, meaning that they're going to have to go on the business trip with her.  The black man, Nick (who hates kids), has his eyes set on dating her, so he become her friend then decides to take the children on to the business party so that she wouldn't have to stay behind and bring the children herself, thereby losing her job.  This is intended to impress her.  Quite frankly, it's a disasterous feat to try and pull off.

The children believe that their father is still planning to get back together with their mother, so they chase all their mom's dates away.  They're forced to go with Nick, so they decide to make it **** on wheels.  1st they miss the plain, then they miss the train, then they start driving and cause trouble by acting like Nick's being abusive and telling a truck driver that.  The truck driver, Big Al, decides to push Nick off the road.  This destroys the cars wheels.  And while Nick's trying to convince the shop keeper of a car repair shop to fix his car, the children hop on a train an ride to the town where their father lives.  They go right to his house.

Their father is remarried and has another child, whom they see him play with.  This dashes their hopes that their parents will ever get back together, and makes them feel as if the divorce was all their fault, becauase their father has another child, so they think that they weren't good enough.  Been there, done that, not doing it again.  After they get over this there's a whole other bunch of mishapps and then a happy ending.

I really think you should see this, but look for better buying options, such as an Amazon Auction.
