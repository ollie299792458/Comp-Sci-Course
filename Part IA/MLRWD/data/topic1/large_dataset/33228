Sometimes film critics act as if 'quality' and 'enjoyment' are somehow mutually exclusive, summarily dismissing many of the mood-boosting movies that are actually FUN to watch. No one's arguing that Legally Blonde is an Oscar-worthy classic, but it's an eminently pleasurable, endlessly rewatchable gem.

In a world full of stress and sadness, there's something to be said for such unapologetically optimistic, escapist bliss. And at the risk of eliciting a few (well-deserved!) eye rolls, I actually don't feel this movie is quite as vapid and meaningless as many believe; the messages about female unity/empowerment, the power of optimism, and the benefits of collaboration over cutthroat competitiveness are actually quite nicely conveyed, at least in this fan's opinion.

As so many of my fellow reviewers have noted, Reese Witherspoon is sublime, transforming a character who might otherwise have been benignly forgettable into a heroine whom many women still adore years after the film's original release.

I'm so happily surprised by how rewatchable I've found this film to be.  I've viewed it a truly embarrassing number of times (don't ask!), but it still hasn't lost its power to delight, charm, and amuse me. Legally Blonde won't be the most layered and meaningful film in your collection, but it just may be the one you can most rely on to boost your mood and elicit a smile. Enjoy!
