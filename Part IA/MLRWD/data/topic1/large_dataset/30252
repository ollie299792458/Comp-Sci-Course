first, i want to say that this is no doubt the WEIRDEST movie I HAVE EVER SEEN.I wish it was longer. I was afraid it would ruin the way i think of the monkees, you know, like i wouldn't like them anymore. don't worry, you can still watch the t.v. show and you'll still think it's great. the movie DOESN'T change the way you feel about the monkees. I was afraid i would say, "oh this movie is horrible, i don't like the monkees anymore" but i think i like them even more. i think it's funny the way they sneak comments about the way they feel about the show in the movie, like when peter says "I'm the dummy, i'm always the dummy!" and the song in the beginning: "we're made of tin" but this movie is strictly for monkees fans, the other people wouldn't understand at all. (us monkee fans still don't understand most of the movie, no one will) but if your watching the show, you know, if you got a couple episodes on tape, this movie won't spoil the fun monkees episodes!!!
