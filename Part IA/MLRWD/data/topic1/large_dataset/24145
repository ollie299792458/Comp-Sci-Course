At first glance, this version of Devdas has everything going for it. Big name stars, heart-stopping visuals, stirring music and a storied pedigree as yet another adaptation of a Bengali literary classic.
Well, all those things do work but it is a bunch of sound and fury signifying nothing. The more you think about the film, the less it holds up. Part of the problem is that Shah Rukh Khan's performance is embarrassingly bombastic. If you enjoy watching him be a jerk, then you'll like him better in Don, and even Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna ( I did!). It makes it mind-boggling that not one but two gorgeous and possibly intelligent women would go through so much for him. By the end you might just want his character to just die, already.
Also, if you care to look into it, there are some definite issues with how this director chose to adapt the book, glossing over some key issues about class, dropping some plotlines and character developments, amongst other things; and what his decision to bling out everything in sight did to the original story.
There are some good performances in this movie: Madhuri Dixit and Jackie Shroff, to name a couple. Aish isn't asked to do much but look fabulous and so she does, acquitting herself well in the big Dola Re Dola dance number ( as improbable as it may have been for a "respectable" wife to invite a hooker into the family manse for a song and dance).
You may well want to invest in Devdas because it really is spectacular, if flawed. Just don't kid yourself that this is the ultimate in Bollywood/Indian film-making. Do yourself a favour and check out the earlier versions of Devdas, for one...
