As some of you may know, I am a huge Opeth fan and I discovered them when my friend mentioned them to me. We checked them out on Kazaa and downloaded "Demon of the Fall". Not being a huge fan of the demonic sounding cookie monster vox at the time I decided it wasn't really for me. Then I downloaded all of Damnation and loved it! "To Rid the Disease" was a track that just blew my mind. Anyway, on to business. I then began to notice the amazing musicians behind the music of Opeth, and now I am a huge metal fan of all sorts. Black metal, Death metal, Doom, you name it. This DVD truly shows the beauty of Opeth's playing. It shows two separate sets of live footage. One heavy, and one soft. I do wish that earlier albums would have been played on this DVD, such as Orchid, Morningrise, My arms...,and Still Life. Those are great albums that I wish would have been showcased on this wonderful dvd.
  The overall DVD is nice, the sound is terrific and displays the beautiful and sometimes raging sounds supplied by Opeth perfectly. The picture is also very well done, it almost looks as if it happened just yesterday. Some of the greatest performances on this DVD are "To Rid the Disease"(Mikael.. I love the mixture of Phaser and echo on the ending measure!), "The Drapery Falls", "A Fair Judgement"(One of the greatest songs of all, I find myself comparing it to Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven"), "Harvest". and basically all the songs on the DVD are awesome.
  One downside to this DVD are the annoying yells and shrieks from the crowd, as one customer already noted specifically at the beginning of "Hope Leaves" where one fan screams "OPETH" at the top of his lungs. It's actually pretty funny. Do yourself a favor and go buy this DVD, of course you should be an Opeth fan first so you can love the music displayed here.
