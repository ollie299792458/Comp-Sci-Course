I had only ever heard my dad talk of this show and when it became available I thought I would try it just to see what Tv was like back in my parents day.WOW! This program has stirred something in me. In the past nine months I have discovered guys I had never even heard of before in other wonderful old series such as Rod Cameron,Clu Gullager,John Russell,What Im trying to say is that I have discovered that there is a treasure chest full of DVD releases of fantastic series from the fifties such as Highway patrol,tall man, Soldiers of fortune, Wagon train,Coronado 9 and lots more which blows the pants off what I was watching a year ago, and Top of the rock is Highway patrol. Broderick Crawford is so freaking cool as he hollers commands into his walkie talkie. The guy has an awesome screen presence and is the John Wayne of the highway. I wasnt even born when these fine shows were being created and I encourage others to try them out.Had I not gambled with this box set I would never have discovered that tv today is so so poor in comparison to what went before. God bless you Broderick wherever you are. A true male hero of a bygone age.by the way,every time I go on here recently season two is listed but never available? Is this just an error. I hope not.
