There are very few movies on which I am actually willing to spend money, and before this movie, I could easily have crossed Disney off the list without a thought.  "Lilo and Stitch" is a wonderful story in which the main conflict has very little to do with the climactic battle/chase scene (which all kids movies seem to require these days), but rather with the definition and the bonds of family.  It's nice to have a family movie with redemption and warm fuzzies without a mother, a father and two point three kids at the end so you know everything is OK.  To misquote the movie: "This is my family.  It may be a little broken..."  
Additionally, the art is phenomenal.  Finally, a movie in which the women do not resemble Barbie Dolls or super-skeletons... er supermodels.
Of course, my favorite line from the movie turns out to be in the deleted scenes section.  "I'm worth twenty rabbits?"  :-)  A movie that can bring tears to my eyes even on the third viewing is a rare gem.  I consider this movie to be the same calibur as "Fight Club" and "Casablanca," although not neccessarily for the same audience.
