...should've been my first clue, any movie he likes I hate. Without doubt easily in the top 5 of the worst movies I've ever seen. Now I am a Jason Statham fan, and I loved the first film which was the best action film in years...and we haven't much action films for a while and what little there is has been garbage. Unfortunately The Transporter 2 is the absolute worst...ever. This film is totally different from the original, whereas the original was a great action flick for our modern age, this one takes the franchise and Statham's main character and turns it into some mixture of James Bond, Fast & the Furious, and Looney Tunes...that's right, Looney Tunes. This is the most unbelievably retarded movie I've ever seen, I'm not going to give away anything, in fact I kind of recommened it so people can see for themselves just how terrible it really is and how not to make a movie...but just to illustrate how beyond idiotic this movie is, where do I begin? Ok, the guy keeps a bunch of freshly pressed and plastic sealed suits in the trunk of his magical car, a car which half the time is flying in the air jumping from the tops of skyscraper to skyscraper fleeing the Miami Police Force as well as machine gun toting hermaphrodites. Anyone that lives in the South Florida area like myself will surely find some of the scenes hysterical where one moment there's a car chase in the streets of Miami, the chase goes down another road and the scenery magically transforms to West Palm Beach...about 90 miles and 2 hours away...those are some really fast cars there!
