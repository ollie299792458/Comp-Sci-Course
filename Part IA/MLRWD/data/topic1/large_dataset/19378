On par with Fincher's 'Fight Club', Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', Hawks' 'The Philadelphia Story', I have not watched a movie so many times as this. Director Tarsem Singh's vision is hallucinatory, dream-like, and stunning in it's process. David Lynch fans unite....this is his dream. A visual painting of emotions, this is The Cell. Taking cues from movies like 'Coma', combined with Marilyn Manson videos, Singh comes up with a great story, told by visualization. The inherent dread of a horse being cut up into anatomical, freeze dried specimens, with a still beating heart...the abject horror of depression when Vaughn faces the new world of Carl's delusions....chandeliers of snowflakes tinkling...every picture is a new illusion....
The Cell is a hallucinatory experience, for the straight...you don't need to do any kind of drug...this movie does it for you...
the commentary by Singh is also illuminating, how he sees each characterication and how it affected him throughout...
No doubt in my mind this will be the film people will talk about 20 years from now...it's just that good.
