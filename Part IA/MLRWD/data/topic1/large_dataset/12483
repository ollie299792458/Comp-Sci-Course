I was lucky enough to find a VHS copy of this movie a few years ago for two bucks in a pawn shop. One of the best deals I have ever gotten. This movie in absolutely incredible. If you read the reviews here, you will see that some people hated it, but liked it later when they revisited the movie. Some never gave it a chance. Some people thought the people had lines and were actors. I have watched it with people and got the same variety of responses. Some people fell asleep, some people thought it was hilarious, some thought it was sad, some feel it is too long. The truth is, if you've ever struggled to accomplish a personal goal, you will see a lot of yourself in these characters. That's one reason a lot of people enjoy the movie.

This movie is a real look at a guy trying to make a movie. It is deep enough to always catch another life lesson with each veiwing. I have watched it dozens of times and it is so good. The relationships and unique cast of characters in Mark's life are incredible.

There are a ton of parts I would like to mention here, but it really does take away from the work if you don't see it yourself. You see where time has just passed this poor guy by as he chases the impossible dream that has eluded him for years. You wonder if he really ever wants to get the movie completed.

The movie is pitiful and sad at times, while sweet and funny at other times, but it is inspirational throughout as this man goes for his dream of completing a feature film. One of my all-time favorite movies EVER. I highly recommend you check it out.
