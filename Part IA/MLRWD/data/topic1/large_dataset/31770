I saw this film recently on a long haul flight.  I hadn't even heard of this film so it was more out of curiosity that I watched it.  I'm so glad I did. I loved this film.  It is not the straightforward boy meets girl, fall in love, have a hiccup, get together, the end - there is an affair involved. In real life I am disgusted by this sort of behaviour but the characters are played and developed so well that you really feel for the main characters. I even found myself rooting for Rachel in the end.  Because of this surprising feeling, I found myself thinking about the film long after I had watched it.

One potential shortcoming of the film is Kate Hudson's character which is very one dimensional and unlikeable. I have since read the books 'something borrowed' by emily griffin and the sequel 'something blue'.  I think having read the latter, I understand more why Darcy's character was portrayed in such a one dimensional way in the film, so I'm prepared to overlook it. I guess it has to be this way (SPOILER!) otherwise the viewer wouldn't get behind Rachel and Dex.  The guy that plays Dex is incredible, he articulates emotion and feelings of angst so well and you get really involved in the story.

I would urge anyone who enjoyed the film to read the books.  I actually enjoyed the 'something blue' book more than 'something borrowed' and I hope they get to make the film!
