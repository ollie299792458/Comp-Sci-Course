I have seen about all of the DVDs on the French & Indian war by now (not a huge number), plus those on Pontiac's Rebellion and various ones about the Old Northwest, and this is the best collection of them all.  It is worthy of Ken Burns in how carefully it lays out the chronology and geography, and gives good maps to tie it all together.  They use realistic depictions of the period and authentic locations where possible, such as the Carlyle House in Alexandria, VA for example, in the actual room where Braddock did ask the colonists to contribute money for the war effort.  But the one thing they got really right is that they show that George Washington was in at the beginning to become the father of our country, in ways that could not have been foreseen at the time.  How many of you have been to Jumonville Glen?  I thought so.  You will have a hard time finding it on a map, but it is probably the most important location in American history.  I know, you don't believe it, but you will get an idea after seeing this show.

The acting is credible and the quality of the video is very good; it looks almost like Hi-Def on my plasma TV and upconverting DVD player.  The sounds are realistic too, and good period music is used.  It could be used as a valuable travel guide for places to visit in the various regions too.
