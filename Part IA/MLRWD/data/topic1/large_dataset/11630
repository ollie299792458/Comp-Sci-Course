And it's a very personal choice. I can totally understand the reviewers who said "Huh?" because it's just that kind of a movie. You either get it or you don't, as the one featured reviewer pointed out (a reviewer whose review I was quite amused to see, as I agree with every word of it, and that probably will never happen again). Yes, the acting is overdone (or "stylized," if you're one of the people enamored of this film). The plot is implausible and absurd (or "fantasy-like and surreal"). The musical choices are a bizarre hodge-podge (or "brilliantly eclectic"). About the only thing there could be no argument about is Ms Lane: you know how good she looks now? Imagine what she looked like in 1984 in a red and black leather mini-dress. I think my feelings are best summed up by the monologue of Raven in this 1984 box-office bomb that I've seen more times than any other film besides Escape from New York: "You're making this harder than it has to be. You and me fall in love for a week or two. I let you go. No one gets hurt." That's what you do with this film for 90 minutes. And with DVD technology, able to skip the slow parts, you can get this down to about 45 minutes of nearly rapturous bliss.
