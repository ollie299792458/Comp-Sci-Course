I have tried every diet out there, Atkins, diet pills, cleanses, cutting calories etc... but have never really maintained any serious results. A girlfriend of mine lost 60 lbs on this after she had a baby and I thought I'd give it a try. I'm not going to lie, the first week was brutal. I almost had to have my husband carry me up the stairs because my thighs hurt so bad but the after the second week I couldn't believe how many squats I could do and the pain was gone. I'm on week three and down 30lbs. I'll break down the program
Phase 1: 3 - 14 days a simple cleanse with no - moderate workouts. Basically you have a protein shake and fruit for breakfast and eat healthy all day... really easy
Phase 2: 3 weeks add a workout regimen. It's VERY difficult at first so don't expect to get through a whole work out without pausing. Work outs are 30 - 45min
Phase 3: 3 weeks Kick up the work out a little bit. Lots of lunges and you start focusing on your arms a little more. I was able to start doing push-ups without being on my knees during this phase!! Work outs are 45-60 min
Phase 4: 3 weeks Work outs get a little more intense and weight literally just fell off me during this phase.
Phase 5: another cleanse - I haven't started this yet
The exercises switch up every day so you never get board and you do 2 - 3 workouts a day which can be broken up or done all at once.
The only cons are they don't really explain what vitamins or supplements you should take so I just stick with a multivitamin and I travel a lot for work so it's difficult to stick to because you need free weights. Otherwise I HIGHLY recommend this product if you are serious about making a change.
