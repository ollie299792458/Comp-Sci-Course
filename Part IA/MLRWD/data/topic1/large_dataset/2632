It is difficult to watch this film knowing that some children in this world will have to endure neglect of this capacity (or any other for that matter).

Roughly, the story centers on a quartet of siblings who are more or less stranded in a city apartment. At first the struggle can be humorous, however those moments become few and far between as the kids drain through the cash they have and must resort to scraping by any means necessary, barely making the "rent". Throughout the film the family "hides" themselves from the public view and tries to bond with  the few outside people they come across, which are other children of similar age.

The one reason that makes this film so great is it truly balances the good and bad events that make the experience all the more real. It never sugar coats the terrible portions, but despite how low times go for the children it depicts their spirit of survival. It is brilliant to witness how minimal/basic they have paired their lives down while existing in the gluttony of civilization.  The Boy playing the eldest child (Akira) does a marvelous performance (which he won an award for) trying to keep the clan together and not fall into despair himself. The remaining cast are very good as well, turning out a believable story.

If you come across it, definitely see the it. However uncomfortable it may prove, you'll be glad you did.
