I love the Shaw brothers but this movie was just amazing! I had a blast watching it. You really can't fully appreciate Kill bill until you see this movie imho. And the guy that gave one star... you gotta be kidding me right? I damn for sure don't watch kung fu movies with the subtitles the dub is the only way to go it's just always been that way like in the late night kung fu cinema's downtown, yea not JAPANESE CINEMA it's KUNG FU cinema these are cult movies dude. However, films like Amelie or Delicatessen,Pan's Labyrinth or Variety lights the subtitles are necessary, it adds to the film's overall power. The Japanese language is beautiful like in seven samurai or yojimbo or sanjuro because those are epics and are considered JAPANESE CINEMA because they took it extremely serious like Jet li's Hero or fearless those are serious movies they need subtitles. The American stigma with kung fu is flicks is the dub and the action and occasional comic relief when the face doesn't really match the voice that's part of the fun. Almost all Kung fu movies are serious but These are not vast 207 minute in length movies they are action from top to bottom not meant to get Oscar's  or go into the criterion collection though some deserve it, (Come drink with me 36 Chambers of Shaolin) Just enjoy them for what they are.
