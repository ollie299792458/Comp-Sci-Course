So yeah, this movie basically has very little to do with the Resident Evil game series we all know and love. Granted, there are zombies. Lots of zombies. And zombie dogs. And there is *a* licker. No tyrants. Boo. But, we can't have everything jammed into one movie, can we?

Basic plot is that the Umbrella underground lab known as "The Hive" has had an outbreak of the T-virus, and everyone was killed. Milla Jovovich 's character awakes with no memory of what has happened, and is forced by Umbrella-sent commandos into the Hive to see what went on down there. Chaos ensues.

Milla did a decent bit of acting in this movie. Granted, the outfit was an obvious ploy to get fanboy response, but oh well. Eric Mabius did an excellent job as supporting lead, especially towards the end. (god bless those candid muscle shots) Michelle Rodriguez was also very believable in her performance.

So, if you've got a free afternoon and need some decent entertainment in terms of action, suspense, and zombie-popping fun, go for this flick. It's not like the games, but I guess we'll have to gag and bind Paul Anderson for him to do a *real* Resident Evil film.
