While I hesitate to say that this was Wayne's best war picture, it does stand in the first ranks.  The story (and Rockq there is a story) lies in the period when the American forces and the people of the Philippines were being kicked by everything the Japs had--which was plenty.  The story tells the story of the PT boats, their crews, and the work of making the top brass see that the little boats had a place as an offensive and defensive weapons--especially in places where larger ships could not go or were not available.  Everything is placed to the side to tell this--and thanks to the motion picture crew, you can see how frail and dealy they were.  As for romance, war is no place for romancing the ladies although, Lord knows, the guys tried.  This is a film to own, and to remember the real men and women who lived these perilous times.

Two notes, if you look at the picture in the back, I got a feeling that the picture is one of Dan Daily and the Duke--who were in "The Wings of Eagles".  Also, when the delivery service is bad--and sometimes even Amamzon has a bad mail day--don't blame the flubbin' picture!!!!  Giving this picture one star because of delivery problems is both unfair to the film  and to other readers.
