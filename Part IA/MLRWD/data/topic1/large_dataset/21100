I am so glad I bought this DVD.
I graduated High School in 1970 and remember a lot of ABBA songs from the 70's-80's.
This DVD gave me all my favorites and some I had never heard. It's been 25-30 years since I saw some of these videos and heard some of these songs - I found them fascinating to watch. This DVD provides a timeline that chronicles the band, from start to finish. It is the journey of 4 people through time, covering approximately ten years. The songs reflect happy, sad, reflective moments. The videos still succeed today. Good music accompanied by images of people you want to watch. The journey itself is both happy and sad.
I have been watching this DVD for the last 3 weekends. It keeps drawing me back. There is a wealth of music styles here ranging from Bubble-Gum (which drew them criticism) to Rock, Jazz and Broadway, with everything in between. This is no garage band - these are talented musicians and performers, and, yeah, they are all pretty good looking, too, which makes watching the videos real easy.
Listening and watching evoked some strong emotions associated with those years - when I hear certain ABBA songs I return to that time.
While nastalgia is a part of my appreciation, there is a timeless beauty to these songs. I still find the music very appealing and the accompanying videos charming.
There is a "story book" quality to ABBA. No political issues here, just universal feelings we all have.
It's a DVD that's not only suitable for children but will probably have them singing the tunes the next day at breakfast. Just watch "Dancing Queen" or "Felicidad".
ABBA should be proud. This is a legacy we all should be proud of.
I fell in love with Agnetha (the blonde) all over again. Agnetha, I still love you.
