I had come to know about the "Murder Rooms" series made by BBC (but mysteriously abandoned by them, as it appears) thanks to an extremely informative article written by Lenny Picker in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1434403831">Sherlock Holmes Mystery Magazine 3</a>. And finally, after a long-wait, I got to view the episodes which have assumed somewhat Apocryphal value for all lovers of Sherlockiana. Yes, the episodes are utterly fascinating in terms of details and atmospherics. Yes, Ian Richardson would have made a terrific Holmes with his smouldering passion for justice working in tandem with his analytical mind. Yes, the story is very well crafted, and the film is one of the all-time best Sherlock Holmes-pastiches that has been made. My only regret is, this excellent film is devoid of subtitles, which often act as an invaluable tool for us, the non-English admirers of Holmes who are not used to hearing and comprehending even the "British" English when it is spoken fast & colloquially. Nevertheless, a superb & very-very dark film for all lovers of anything to do with Holmes. Recommended.
