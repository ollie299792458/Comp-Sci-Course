"Nanking" is an excellent docco about the infamous Rape of Nanjing in the winter of 1937-38. The clandestine 16-mm film shot by the few westerners who helped thousands survive, and who memorialized the dead, never loses its power to shock. (The documentary is especially good in explaining the role of Herr Rabe, the Nazi who turned out to be a humanitarian, and who paid the price for it when he foolishly sent the films to Hitler.)

Astonishingly, after seventy years, the film-makers were able to find Chinese who not only remembered the Rape of Nanjing, but Chinese soldiers who fought in the retreat from Shanghai to Nanjing--and even more amazing, Japanese soldiers who participated in the horrors. Nobody really knows how many died in those months, but the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal put the number at 200,000, and that's probably as close to the truth as we'll ever get. (The Chinese say 300,000. The Japanese say "what massacre?")

The one flaw I have with the film is that it mixes actors with real people. I don't mind having Woody Harrelson and Mariel Hemingway read the diaries and letters of the westerners at Nanjing (they mostly died soon after, at least one by her own hand). But better the film-makers had followed the model of Ken Burns, whose actor-readers are only voices on the sound track. It was jarring to see Ms Hemingway pretending to show emotion after seeing the genuine tears of the man who'd watched his mother killed and his baby brother bayoneted in an alley in Nanjing.
