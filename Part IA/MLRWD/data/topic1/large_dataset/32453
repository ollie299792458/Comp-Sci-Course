Unlike some people, I think I'll actually review the first U.S. Blu-Ray release of "Night of the Living Dead," as opposed to one of the zillion other U.S. DVD releases that have absolutely nothing to do with the Blu-Ray format.

It's simple. There are no U.S. releases of this classic film on blu-ray, and even if there WAS, I'm not so sure it could come close to being as sharp, crisp and film-like as Forgotten Film's version. Not only is the 1080P picture stunning, but the mono soundtrack is as clear as I have ever heard this. In fact I SWEAR I heard things on this blu-ray disc that I have NEVER heard in the film before, and TRUST ME, I've seen and scrutinized this film numerous times.

Other than a photo gallery, there are no extras. While that would have been nice, it is no big deal. The trade-off is that this Blu Ray is the absolute best this film has ever looked and sounded. My guess is that this may be tough to obtain someday, so absolutely GET IT while you can! You will NOT be disappointed.
