I watched it on NETFLIX but when it was removed I decided to purchase it from Amazon. This is a story of a man who lived for a long time and had seen history unfold through the eyes of a common man. Because he never aged, he adopted the practice of moving every 10 years to avoid discovery. At the end of one of those ten year cycles, he decides to 'fess up to a select group of Professors and co-workers, all experts in their various fields.

Of particular interest in this film is how Bixby portrays the types of people that compose the group that he chooses. From the disbelieving Christian that can't let go of any element of her faith to the academic critic that grades each question that John is asked.  It's an excellent study of belief, disbelief and is exquisitely well researched in the authenticity and possibilities of each of Johns answers.

You should watch this if you are open to new idea's. You need to avoid it if you are such a devout Christian that any questioning of the official dogma is offensive. I enjoyed it as a well told story told in a sparse living room as John packs up to move on.
