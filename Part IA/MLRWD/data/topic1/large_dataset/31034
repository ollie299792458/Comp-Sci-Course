This film is based on the heros journey,  which is a universal mythology found in all cultures.  All children are heros.  Aside from the struggle they have as they attempt to hold onto their imagination, which is the focus of this film, just going through the journey of being born is heroic.

The film takes you through the different aspects of the inner world of a boy named Max, the story's main character, who is attempting to hold onto his dreams in the face of a culture that favors collective conformity over individual creativity.  All mythologies originate from the body. Sharkboy and Lavagirl represent the sacral and solar plexus, respectively. Like most of us, Lavagirl is trying to discover who she is.  Being fire, she is that part of the body that 'destroys every thing it touches.'  She asks, who am I?  Am I evil?  Am I bad?  Finally, when her true powers are revealed she is told, "you are light."  The three journey together to see the Princess who resides in the Crystal Palace located in the heart, for she possesses the diamond needed to cool the fearful aspect of an overheated nervous system appropriately named "Mr. Electric."

We were all dreamers once until socialization slowly took them away replacing them with the inflexible collective dream of our culture.  From my point of view, the message of this film is to explore the possiblity of children - as well as adults - to face their fears and recover their dreams from a belief system that does not encourage individuality.

Children are wise because they have not been filled with synthetic knowledge.  With the wisdom that originates from the physical body, most children will recognise the powerful themes of this film on an intuitive level.  If you are an adult and you also recognise them you are lucky.
