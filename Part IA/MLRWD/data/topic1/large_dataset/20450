1) Script written by Craven @ 1970-71 on Long Island; film shot in Manhattan (first 15 mins) and Westport/Weston, CT (in daylight) (2) Manson murders, summer of 1969....seemingly random, but if I recall correctly, Manson was aspiring musician and was refused recording contracts...those targeted were related w/recording industry (Polanski was renting house of recording exec.). Krug and Co (the killers in LHOTLeft) kill for the pleasure of it. (3) image/house/men on cover art do not appear in film (4) music written by David Hess, aka Krug...music and sound is used rather skillfully (clashing sound recalls Bonnie and Clyde 1969)(5) acting and script at times very poor (6) shot by someone involved in documentaries, and this film has, intentionally, a documentary feel to it. (7) Very early 70s feel to film...effective/disturbing at times; pathetic at others. (8)Only other Craven film I've seen is 'Deadly Blessing' (81), which I saw in the theater, was 13, and it scared the hell out of me...should be released on dvd soon.
