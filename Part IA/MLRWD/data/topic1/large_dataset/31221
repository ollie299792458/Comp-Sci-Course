This is one of my favorite sleazy horror movies. It's all about people getting stuck in a tavern and trying to not get eaten by creatures that are never explained, which I think is a good thing, in American films, we get so caught up in why that we forget the what. I HATE CGI, most CGI are totally out of sync. I mean the tones and light don't match up with the background and ends up looking like someone cut and pasted it in. This movie takes just about every horror cliche and trashes it. Oh, yeah, and the girls kick more butt than the guys. I mean, the heroine killed the last monster in such an over the top, totally not female-like way. My favorite cliche? Ok, it's not a cliche, it's more like something you see a lot in survival flicks. In most flick towards the end of the movie, the survivors get in their cars and ride off into the sunset with happy rock music playing in the background. In Feast, they get in their car and start to ride off into the sunset and happy rock music plays (Never Gonna Kill Us). Suddenly, their car stalls, the happy rock music stops. Heroine 2 gets out of the car and they manage to get the car going again. And off into the sunset they go. Resume happy rock music. This movie is not for the faint of heart. It is for die hard horror fans who understand the rules and want to see them broken. There's maggots, decapitation, head explosion, rotting, ect. They even use one of the charas as a battering ram! Another reason you should watch this film: the only film out there were Donkey Kong is being used as a battle technique. Also, go buy the cd, it's great.
