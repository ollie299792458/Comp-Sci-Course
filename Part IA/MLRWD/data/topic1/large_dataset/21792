I've read all the reviews available, by good reviewers such as Roger Ebert, and by bad reviewers which are most of the rest, and none of them get it!  Yes, The Usual Suspects is convoluted; yes, it's hard to follow; yes, it takes some getting used to.  But in the end the Kevin Spacey character, Vocal, the con man, the guy who makes it up as he goes along, the guy who gets away with it -- he's the culprit and the source of all the intrigue, robberies, and murder.  He and his partner, the so-called Kobayashi, are the real bad guys -- and they get away with it!  If any of you remember reading Lord Jim in your high school or college days, you'll remember that two-thirds of the story is told from Jim's point of view and, consequently, we never know what's true, what's truth.  And that's what this movie is all about:  What is truth?  Do we really want to know the truth? Or are we willing to settle for what seems to be the truth?  Gabriel Byrne has made a remarkable film because he's willing to play with the audience just as he plays with both time and characters in the film.  I recommend this film to anyone who has a bit of imagination, a sense of humor (preferably off the wall), and a willingness to be confused in order to be unconfused at the conclusion.  Sort of like life?
