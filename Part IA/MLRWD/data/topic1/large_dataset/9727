pay no attention to the one star reviews if you haven't seen the origional movie . this is a remake but I haven't seen the first one so I'm going just on this movie . the one star votes are either people who are comparing this movie to the origional or because it's not scary . first of all I can't say anything about the ones compairing it to the origional because I haven't seen it but to all the people who are upset that this wasn't scary, check the back of the case . this is a thriller NOT a horror movie . thrillers are not supose to be scary , if there are scary parts in a thriller than it's a bonus . don't watch this movie if you want something to scare you. now since I got that out of the way , on to the movie . I would probably have only given this movie 3 stars because I figured out who the killer was at the beginning of the movie even though it made me wonder a couple of times if I was wrong I stuck to my pick and I was right . I did give this an extra star because I really didn't see the ending coming , it was a shocker . there were a few slow points in the movie but all and all this was a good movie with a pretty good ending .
