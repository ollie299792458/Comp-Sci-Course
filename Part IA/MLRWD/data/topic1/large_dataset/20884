I've seen most of Takashi Miike's movies and I can say this is a rare disappointment from his previous films.  I've seen hundreds of different Yakuza/Samurai movies and when compared to them, there are simply better movies to be found.

13 Assassins does 2 things right as far as casting excellent actors for the movie and the cinematography is amazing.  However the movie's downsides are blatant use of CG, why would you make such a beautiful picture only to ruin it with horrible Computer animations?  Also the movie feels rushed, the character development is made unlike something like the 7 samurai where the build up each supporting character, no one really cares about their deaths which makes this movie fall short.

If this is your first samurai film, yes it will be amazing and thats why this one is rated so high however there are better works to be seen like izo, Lone wolf and cub, and the 7 samurai just to start.  Veterans like myself will be disappointed to say the least.
