The majority of the people who don't like this film simply can't just get past the fact that this is a break from the Halloween Series plot and that Michael Myers is not in it.  Now, granted, I do think it would have made more sense to simply call this movie Season Of The Witch and leave Michael Myers for the Halloween movies.  However, if you can look past that, this is a great film.  It does have its cheesy 80s aspects, but it's an interesting plot that will make you think and have many questions going through your mind even after the film ends.  This movie would be considered a masterpiece if people were able to just get past the fact that this is NOT a Michael Myers movie.
As for the DVD itself, I originally had the out of print Goodtimes release but sold it for the new Universal version and I'd say its a slightly better change.  The picture quality is a tad better and as for the sound it's deffinatley an obvious improvement.  However, no special features at all, not even a theatrical trailer as originally promised.  I guess that's why its a cheap price.  Oh well; I would have loved to have seen some features on this new release but it's still well worth the money.  So for those that are yet to see this movie, I suggest you check it out and watch it with a completly open mind.  Chances are you will like it because it's a shockingly well made film.
