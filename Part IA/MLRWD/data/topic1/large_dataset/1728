In general I was disappointed in the way this film progressed.  That is, it seemed to be very linear.  There were very few plot twists or complex  points.  The parallels made between the main character's lifestyle and that  of a Samurai warrior via on-screen text were all one-to-one, simple  comparisons.  There wasn't much substance to the coincidences therein.  Rather, when a Way of the Samurai quote was followed by its fulfillment  through the actions of Whittaker, it was cliche and kind of  one-dimensional, if not altogether weak.  To me, it seemed an easy job to  superimpose a criminal's actions over vague idioms such as those in the  Hagakure.  The irony the movie attempted to convey was lost somewhere in  the shallow character development and ordinary cinematography.  Just a  sporadic dollop of unique camera angle up the drain pipe, or deep  friendship transcending language barriers was too little to spread over 116  minutes of formulaically droll murders and poor acting.  Not that Forrest  Whittaker's acting was substandard, but he could have personally stretched  much more than the script and production seemed to allow.  Perhaps pairing  him with better actors would have helped this movie, which I give two stars  out of 4.
