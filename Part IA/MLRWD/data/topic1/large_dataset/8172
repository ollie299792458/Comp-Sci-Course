I first saw Baraka in a theater shortly after its release and I have been mesmerized by this film ever since.  Until recently, I had been watching the original DVD release on a small television for years.  I have now made the jump to a Sony 57-inch widescreen.  After attempting to watch the original version on my new big screen, I simply could not put off purchasing the Collector's Edition any longer.

Let's make this clear up front, the Collector's Edition does bring some very much needed improvement.  Watching this film on my big screen is now a very enjoyable and worthwhile experience, despite the image quality still coming up a bit short.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by the razor-sharp picture that comes with today's big DVD releases like Lord of the Rings.  I think it would be fair to say that I'm just being nitpicky.  Nevertheless, a film like Baraka yearns to have a restoration and transfer that's on par with the Star Wars Trilogy DVD's.

For those who have seen this film and enjoyed it as much or more than I have, then this DVD is a very worthwhile purchase.  Those who have not seen it need to rent it first.  Baraka needs to be taken for what it is, a collection of images ranging from beautiful and startling to chaotic and disturbing.  Some have chosen to decry Ron Fricke's acheivement.  I have even seen it called a racist film, which leaves me dumbfounded.  The message that continues to repeat for me each time I see it is the plight of mankind and how our greed, hatred, overconsumption and neglect is shaping our world.
