First off. Ive used Amazon on demand now for over a year and the only problem i have had with video quality was  because of a weak internet signel. If your only getting one bar then of course its not going to be as clear as if you are at full bars. Some of the problems people are having really sounds likes video settings of video card settings being off or it might be time to get better hardware. I use the Amazon on demand to watch movies on my desktop, laptop, and my HDTV via Roku box, all not more then two years. Video quality is great and everyone i have introduced to the service love it and continue to use it more and more.. If you are having problems with video streaming and dont know how to fix it yourself, Amazon people on staff to help you and answer questions. It would be smart to contact them insted of making ignorant post in a place meant for reviews of the movie itself.

Ok now that is over with i would just like to say that the movie was Great!! If you have watched and liked the other harry potter movies then you will like this movie.
