I feel I must comment on this so called "Authentic Guitar Tab Edition" of the Eagles "Hell Freezes Over" sheet music.  While I absolutely love the DVD and the CD, guitar players should not waste a dime on this worthless piece of garbage.  I hate to be so harsh, but it is evident from the first line of tablature that these "professional" tab transcribers (Joe Deloro, Dale Turner, Kenn Chipkin) never even watched the DVD.  Practically every last line of tablature in Hotel California is completely wrong.  They have Glen Frey using a capo on the 7th fret.  It is obvious in the video that no one (Frey, Felder, nor Walsh) has a capo on the 7th fret.  Clearly, Frey is using a capo on the 2nd Fret.  I believe the old original 1976 LP version probably was played capo'd at the 7th, but not this version.  From here, the accuracy of the tab just deteriorates further.  Fret positions are all wrong compared to the video and some progressions are just plain inocrrect.  The Eagles are perfectionists when it comes to their music.  You'd think that when Warner Brothers Publications approved and licensed the sheet music, they'd of done a better job than this.  You're much better off just figuring the guitar parts out yourself by watching the DVD and combing the internet for tablature.  There are several people who have done an admirable job of transcribing Hotel California and many of the other songs.  They have done a MUCH better job with the tab than the professional lackies mentioned above.  It is shameful that such an incredible, beautiful piece of music has been given such lack-luster attention to detail when it comes to providing accurate guitar tablature.  OK, I'm done :)
