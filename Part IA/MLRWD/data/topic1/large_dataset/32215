Bette Davis, Olivia deHavilland & Agnes Moorehead gives fantastic performances in this wonderful if slightly over the top horror classic. This film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards and when you watch it you can see why. In my opinion this film is even better than "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" Just the dialogue and snappy lines alone is worth watching this movie and having Bette, Olivia & Agnes deliver those lines is pure fun! Some of the lines that Bette says in the film: "Where you are I could spit in your eye...with no strain at all", "What do you think I asked you here for...company?!", and the best line of all (directed at Olivia deHavilland)- "You're a vile, sorry little [...]!" Wonderfully witty and campy dialogue that is a joy to watch and see. Agnes Moorehead has some great lines with her drawn out southern accent: "You know she broke that dadburn teapot up there...tea running all down the walls! Shooooweeee! "She nottin but a chil'" and my favorite (also directed at Olivia deHavilland) "Oh so your finally showin' the right side of you'face ain't ya...well I seen it all the time". If you can't find something to love about this film, then there is something wrong with you. They don't make classic suspense/horror films like this anymore.
