Well having read most of the other reviews of this film I have to say that the title 'Deep Impact' is more a reference to the deep emotional impact Mimi Leder was trying to create and sucessfully did evoke.

One other aspect of this film is it's attempt to scare you with science.  What better way to create a feeling of dread than to be as factual as you can and I think this is apparent in her film and greatly enhances the impact as the film draws to it's moving closure.  Of course not everything in the film matches up to proper physics, but the imperfections are minor and as previously stated we as an audience are far more interested in the fate of the characters as we grow to care for  them and every scene where we see them having to make life or death decisions rings true.

This film shows how not to make a claptrap disaster movie driven only by big budget special effects.  Make your characters believable so you can empathise with them.

Deep Impact.....always moves me when I watch it and makes that other 'film'...look like a bad 'Lost in Space' episode...
