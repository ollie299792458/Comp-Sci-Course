A sure sign of "The Searchers'" greatness is the array of thoughtful comments here.  It is complex, and enigmatic, enough to inspire widely differing views, and the substantive reviews add welcome insights. It is among the greatest Westerns, and the primal AntiWestern; Ford and Wayne's supreme collaboration; and the first half, through the winter homecoming scene, is simply as good as filmmaking gets.  (Monument Valley deserves a special Supporting Oscar; such astonishing vistas transcend mere backdrop.)  John Wayne is at his peak, though "True Grit," "Shootist" and "Stagecoach" rival this among his best.  It is not uniformly brilliant; as many note, the second half drags with a romantic subplot and is no longer very funny.  But these scenes reflect Ford's conception of community; its very mundaneness highlights outcast Ethan's problematic character.  As a product of its time we may deplore its racial and gender stereotyping; these aspects do not date well and keep it from being in the same class as, say "Seven Samurai" which eternally satisfies on all levels.  It's still a remarkable realization of a filmmaker's vision.  John Ford's best works often have a core scene which, sans dialogue and solely through visual/musical imagery, sums up the whole film while saying something profound about the human condition.  In both "Grapes of Wrath" and "Searchers" these miniatures come near the start and are absolute gems.  With so much to absorb, repeat viewings help to grasp its depth; critics in the 1950s clearly missed a lot.  But enough profundity!  An entertaining film and a great way to spend an evening.
