The second movie in the `Evil Dead' series is a somewhat more polished, sophisticated follow-up to the original `Evil Dead' with a sense of humor thrown in for good measure. (I must add a caveat to that last statement; if the humor potential of seeing the main character amputate one of his own hands with a chainsaw, then watching it crawl across the room on its own to give him the finger evades you perhaps you should skip this title. You don't watch a movie like this to follow the permutations and subtle unfolding of the plot.)
Similar to `Halloween II', this film starts on the same night the previous one ended. The opening moments are a bit of revisionist history with only the main character, Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend at the haunted cabin instead of the group of five in the first film. Not to worry; the girlfriend is quickly dispatched, clearing the way for a whole new quartet of cannon fodder. 
What happens after that is fairly predictable. The dead are evil, and manifest their evilness by trying to make the living into more of the dead. They are, in a sense, only doing what comes naturally. That this involves dismemberment, as well as the oozing and spewing of substances of varying levels of viscosity is merely incidental.
What makes this appealing is the sheer gusto of the filmmaking. Mr. Campbell and director Sam Raimi are old high school buddies, and the enthusiasm of people getting to do something they've wanted to do and talked about doing for years comes through. They are shots and sequences in the movie that only happen when the people making the movie are going at it with ambition and energy.
If you enjoy this genre, this is a title you want on your shelf. The commentary tracks are excellent bonus features, especially if Mr. Campbell cracks you up.
