You've been handpicked at birth and trained to serve in an elite military unit...indoctrinated from the time that you can walk and talk that the military is your only friend and family..that weakness is death, to only speak when spoken to by your superiors, and that trust is a commodity you cannot afford to possess...in short, to believe that you exist for only one purpose. What happens when after nearly 40 years of "following the path" you become obsolete, are discarded like trash, and abandoned countless miles from home? In this case, you discover that being more than what you can be goes beyond that well known slogan. Watch Kurt Russell's finely shaded performance in "Soldier" and see for yourselves...This picture breaks no new ground in the action film genre - there's loads of explosions and gun play (fine with me) and a bit of martial arts/hand to hand action courtesy of Jason Scott Lee ("Dragon") - & to be perfectly honest the drama that emerges when Russell's Sgt. Todd interacts with the surviving members of a space ship crash who have taken up residence on a planet used to dump refuse (or expendable soldiers) is not really all that dramatic...What makes this film really watchable is that Russell gets the job done in making you realizing what his character is experiencing using only sparse dialogue (roughly 35 words), facial expressions and (to his great surprise)a couple of tears. This picture's worth a look.....RG
