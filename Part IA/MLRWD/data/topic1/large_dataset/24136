I actually bought this because my wife loves musicals and this one especially. I'm not a huge fan of them, and only watched it to make her happy. In the end, though, I wound up watching the entire movie and will watch it many times more, not because of its inherent charm (which it does have in plenty; can you say young Ron Howard faking a lisp?), but because of it's amazing picture quality (PQ) and sound.

I didn't know this film looked this good. The large scale dance scenes are marvelous because of the colorful costumes and sets and the non-stop action, all captured beautifully in 1080P with extraordinary detail. The recorded sound has a great depth and punch to it. The barbershop quartet scenes will make you crank your home theater system out of sheer enjoyment. This transfer competes with the quality of the 2001: A Space Odyssey transfer that I consider a high mark. I'm not fascinated by special features and so I haven't really evaluated the ones available on this disc, but it doesn't seem lacking for those folks who really enjoy these features; especially when you consider the age of most material associated with this film.

Summary:
-Surprisingly *EXCELLENT* PQ
-Excellent audio
-Reasonable price, especially if you or someone you love loves this film as much as my wife
