I grew up surfing and in the "surf culture" of Southern California. I watched many, many movies over the years and found that most were good as far as the surf scenes (Pipeline, Java, Australia etc.) but ultimately became boring due to a lack of any examination about real watermen/women and what drives them in this art & sport. This sport/art is about a relationship with a vast and ever changing ocean. An eye on the weather, tides and several of other Mother Nature's elements is what the true "soul" surfer does on a daily basis to deepen that relationship.

This movie successfully captures that essence through well placed & crafted interviews along with recording the many faces and moods of the ocean. Can you imagine a man paralyzed by this very sport, yet is still very keen to continue to have the same "stoke" (excitement) out enjoying waves again? Or a group of surfer atheletes daring to surf waves so big 100 miles off the Pacific shore that if any of these giant waves hit any cruise ship it would sink it in seconds. Why? What drives these individuals and others to brave the elements for what appears to be a silly ride? From the professional to the novice, all who surf on a regular basis possess this spirit.

Watching this movie you will begin to discover the answers about a true modern day explorer's mindset.
