In perhaps the single silliest marketing ploy of the last ten years, Warner released Subzero as part of their plan to promote the ludicrously popular live-action franchise in its latest installment, Batman and Robin.  That movie, of course, is to comic book movies what the Hindenberg was to blimp sales: less than a windfall, to put it mildly.  The animated film, however, retains the same earnest, serious, and smart demeanor that earned the television show its Emmys and works magnificently over the feature-length running time here.  Warner can't quite seem to believe that grown-ups are sick of the campy approach, so the DVD is, farcically, aimed at children, without storyboards, concept art, or a reasonable documentary.  That can't detract from the feature, however, which fleshes out the Mr. Freeze character (easily the best villain on the show) tenfold, giving voice actor Michael Ansara a real chance to shine, and even to upstage the excellent Kevin Conroy, who has been doing an exemplary Batman since the series launched.  This is a minor quibble, really, as Batman always plays second fiddle to the villains, even in the better comic books and the first two movies (can you remember a single Michael Keaton line from "Batman?"  Neither can I.)  At any rate, if you have any affection for the Batman characters left after Arnold says, "Everybody... chill," check this one out.  Warner knows kids are watching, so it's perfectly acceptable family viewing, and the dialogue, plot, and acting will engross most older viewers as well.
