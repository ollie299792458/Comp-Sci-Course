I liked the romantical theme of whether Agnes finds out the difference between true love and lust,in the film"Flesh and blood".Martin,one of her captor's,out of a band of motley,pirate like,rebellious,crew of misfits grew to care for her and protect her when the other men wanted to ravage her too.Agnes knew little of love but, she grew to understand her own sexuality and the power she had and that it gave her, to keep Martin from throwing her to the wolves or killing her.Alas,prince Steven,(that she was destined to marry and falls in love with at first fight( cuz she was feisty with him),hatches a plan to rescue her.His growing feelings for herlead him to risk his life by entering the castle where she is held,and poisoning their water with meat from a dog that died from the plauge.The swashbuckling former religious pirate,rouge Martin(Rutger Hauer),or the handsome prince Steven, who'm she sparrs with? P.S. loved Rutger Hauer in it.'Twas one of his most romantic parts though,Martin was misguided in his ways.(warning;graphic scenes and nudity!) Ah,gentle viewers,Sometimes love wins over lust.And sometimes a captive identifies with a captor and mistakes it for love.So,who'm would you choose? :)
