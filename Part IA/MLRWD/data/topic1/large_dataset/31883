I love Zombie movies. I even watch those aweful Italian zombie flicks in an attempt to see all in existance. If there's one thing I hate more than a zombie that knows how fly and land a plaine (City of the Dead), or fire a gun (Day of the Dead) it's a zombie that can run. As you probably know, this film is filled with sprinting zombies. Top that with the fact the original Dawn of the Dead is simply one of the greatest horror works of art to ever be made and you'd think I hate this film more than just about anything. But I loved it. Despite what I happen to hate most about every single new zombie movie being a very prevelent theme I still loved it. This movie did a great job of basically just satisfiying the little zombie hunter inside of me and hopefully it will satisfy yours. My third time seeing it in the theater was with a friend who hates horror movies and for the next three days he was doing nothing but asking about zombie movies, and the whole mythology that accopmanies them. \
Also I should say 28 Days Later, while it was great is not a zombie movie. I'm sick of hearing people say that. If they're not undead they're not zombies (though I can't deny the common themes).
Dawn of the Dead is a great remake of a great movie.
