I have to respond to the previous reviewer who dismissed the series as inappropriate for children and full of sexual innuendo. Obviously, Faerie Tale Theatre's prime audience today is going to be adults and teens who grew up with the series and have fond memories of their favorite episodes. However, it would be unfair to deny today's children the opportunity to fall in love with it as well. I honestly can't remember a series that sparked my imagination and sense of wonder more than Faerie Tale Theatre. Discerning parents of course should watch each episode before allowing their children to see them. The series had different writers and directors creating each episode, so that the style and content can change significantly from one to the next. Some episodes are very faithful adaptations of the original tales (more comparable to the reverent Storyteller series), while others use the source material as a jumping off point for more satirical or zany flights of fancy (think Fractured Fairy Tales or the Stinky Cheese Man stories). While the series never ventures beyond PG-rated territory, some episodes would be too "adult" to show in a classroom setting for example. I would advise watching "Tale of the Frog Prince" and "Sleeping Beauty" especially before letting your children see them. However, I'd say the majority of the episodes are fine for all ages, and I hope a new generation of kids can enjoy this show just as I did. Thanks to these DVDs, I don't see why not.
