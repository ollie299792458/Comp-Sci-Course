Burr Leonard is a living testimony of what she preaches - fabulous, toned and extremely youthful-looking at age approaching 60!!! "Bar Method" may best be described as part-pilates/callenetics/resistance-training for busy people who are too tired after a long day at the office or too unmotivated to work out as it is simple and enjoyable to follow, yet taxing enough to sculpt your body miraculosly. With the aid of a pair of light-weight barbells and a chair, one can breeze through the entire routine in 45 minutes. The best part - the workout is so good that you can do it on a relatively full stomach! I completed the routine after a major binge last night and immediately felt less guilty and bloated, not to mention that I can feel the good kind of soreness in my inner thighs (a hard to target trouble spot) this very morning!  I highly recommend Burr Leonard's "Bar Method" to anyone who's interested in getting in shape, feel healthier and younger - the effortless but no less effective way.  5 STARS!
