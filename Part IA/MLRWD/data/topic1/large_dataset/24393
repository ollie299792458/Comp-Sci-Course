What I liked about the movie was that not since The Matrix have I seen bullet time used to such a great effect.  If you're a fan of bullet time then you'll like this movies use of it.  It doesnt feel like a Matrix clone or a cheap parody.  It's used as part of the plot itself, so it becomes more relevant than just a special effect. Nonstop action scenes start after a very short character delvelopment period, and I do mean nonstop. The action is fast and furious throughout every scene.  The budget on this film must have been phenomenal, or else they found some cheap CGI labor.  That's what I liked about it, what I didn't like about it is that it was poorly written.  By the time the twist in the movie is revealed, it will be obvious to the viewer what it is.  They used too much forshadowing. One event that happened was forshadowed three times, and blatantly at that.  I'd rather be kept guessing until a twist occurs, to me that's not even a twist.  The dialog was mediocre at best.  Even the stellar cast couldn't save that. All in all I liked it.  I'd recommend it as a rental for sure.  As a purchase I believe it'd be one you'd watch once and then put away in your collection.  Of course, if you are an uber fan of Jolie or Freeman, it's a must own.
