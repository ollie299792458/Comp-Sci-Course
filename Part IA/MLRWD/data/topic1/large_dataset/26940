If you bought into the all the hype that was put into promoting this film, Hulk is not a film for you to see.  But if you can remove that terrible ad campaign from your mind, you'll find a really dark and interesting film that is brilliant in story-telling, cinematically wonderful, and probably the one Marvel movie that is truest to the comic book.  Like all of the Marvel flicks (Spider-man, X-Men) it took a lot of liberties with the characters.  But The Hulk stays true to the concept of the comic:  a normal guy forced to deal with a side of himself that expresses immense anger.  I watched the movie trailers and and saw all of the advertising and The Hulk was promoted to be a summer block-buster action flick.  But it's not.  It relies heavily upon story-telling and a lot of it takes you into the mind and trauma of Banner.  As a director and editor I found the directing and editing to be awesome.  A lot of scenes were cut to resemble a comic book page with several panels of action appearing at once for different characters.  The transitions were really cool and I think George Lucas could learn a thing or two from watching them.  And the acting was superb.  Great film.
