Besides Space Jam is eight years younger than Roger Rabbit, and this movie (Space Jam) has CGI effects (this movie is from the Digital era), it lacks a lot of things:
1.- Roger Rabbit was one of the last jobs done by Mel "1000 voices" Blanc.
2.- Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Droopy Dog, Betty Boop (and a loong etcetera) don't appear in Space Jam, meanwhile Bugs Bunny did appear in Roger Rabbit.
This movie is one of my long favorities, when it was released in DVD, i don't think twice and i buy it ..., but i noticed that this DVD have nothing of extras or foreign language support (but the movie itself worth the money that i expended); fortunatelly and finally Touchstone/Disney will release a special edition of this DVD, with all the things that the fans expected from a movie like this (and foreign language support, at least with Spanish audio track, something very important to me)...
I can't wait to buy this precious DVD! (did i say that i have to sell my old DVD for less than 1/5 of the original cost?)
