This movie came out at about the same time that I was married and the DVD came out the day before my 20th anniversary.  It was a symbolic thing, but we HAD to have it &amp; we made it part of our anniversary.  We had been awaiting the anxiously because while Julie Andrews has been my idol since I was old enough to know who she was, and the Broadway cast was excellent, the movie in 1982 was one of those combinations in Hollywood that can't be decribed or explained, but is just accepted as BRILLIANT!  We were worried about the quality, since the VHS quality was not so great, but the wait was well worth it.  The picture (letterbox) is SUPERB, as is the sound.  Great care was clearly taken in the transfer of this movie to DVD and I would have gladly paid twice the price for one of our all time favorite movies.  After watching it the first time, my husband looked at me and said "we're never going to watch the video-tape copy again are we?"  We have even purchased a back-up DVD copy incase the first one ever gets scratched or broken or lost.  I can't wait until my sons are old enough to see this movie because this is one of the greats of all time.  Actors, plot, music, scenery, costumes &amp; director.  "Who could ask for anything more?"
