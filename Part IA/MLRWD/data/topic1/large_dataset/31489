Before watching this film I read a review from a critic who said he was hard-pressed to recommend the movie even though he was giving it five stars.  It's dark, philosophical, and superbly acted - which is not necessarily everyone's cup of tea.  The film revolves around its male lead who experiences terrifying dreams and hallucinations.  At times he feels they are prophetic, at other times he thinks he's developing schizophrenia (which his mother had).  Each carefully crafted scene presents enough evidence to both support and negate either possibility.  Visually, the film is timeless, yet it taps into contemporary fears regarding the economy and global warming.  The ending is a stroke of genius - although it took me a few moments to process.  And then I couldn't stop thinking about it.

This is filmmaking at its finest.  It's so perfectly crafted and nuanced that the real fun is the discussion you'll have afterwards.  If you're looking for glossy, mindless entertainment (and no, there is nothing wrong with escapism) then this is not a movie you will enjoy.
