I was astounded to find, when I ordered and watched this Special Edition of the Escaflowne Movie, in the footage of the US premiere at Anime Expo 2000, I am on the DVD during the footage of "The Line" and the Director's question and answer period before the Midnight showing of the movie.  My kids and I are in the second row of the audience and can be seen during the audience entrance and the question period where the camera pans toward the back and back up front when they speak to another technician at the rear of the room.  It is our moment of glory LOL..  I will never forget the opening scenes sitting there at the Disneyland Hotel.  The beat of drums and the sound of the airships' engines.  The thrill of expectation, to see the movie for the very first time of my favorite anime.

 I have to say, I was disappointed in the changes made for the big screen, the character's personalities and character designs are not the same.  A LOT of content was naturally condensed and dropped, due to the limitations of time, but Millerna as a space slut was NOT an improvement.  Oh well, at least we're on the DVD.  And they fixed the Pinnochio noses....
