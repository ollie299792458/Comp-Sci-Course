Leonard Maltin even criticised the movie for throwing most of it's subplots to the wind and focusing largely just on Coalhouse Walker's subplot. The problem was the film was doing great being about several things until it mostly just becomes about one thing. Elizabeth McGovern for one is beautiful and brilliant in her role as the alleged model of Stanford White's questionable nude statue. McGovern received an oscar nomination for this. I find it sad the last time we see her in a scene advancing the plot McGovern doesn't even say anything. Great to see Cagney back on screen too.

The real value to this film is it is not a whole fiction Stanford White actually existed as of course did Harry Houdini.

Now for some comments on this film by amazon posters. Jack Nicholson is not anywhere in this film! He appeared in Reds, another film about early 20th century, that was released about the same time Ragtime was. Also, why does somebody find it wrong that a cop would even slightly help a black

person in 1906? In the 1800's (earlier than this) there were actually some black policemen in New Orleans. Besides Coalhouse Walker has a predictably hard time getting justice against the local firemen presumably because he is african-american. Is that not believable enough for you?
