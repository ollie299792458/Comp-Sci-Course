I am a fan of Marshall's work, so my impressions may be clouded. And yup, I enjoyed the heck out of Doomsday as well. ;)

The cinematography, first off, was outstanding. They did an aces job of getting the feel of the period, while showing off the beautiful landscape.

Battle scenes, as expected, were full of gore and the red stuff. Like the sound of that? It should be enough to keep you entertained.

Story. Well, it had its moments, but this is an action/chase/escape film, so you are going to see more of a Classical Hollywood Cinema story approach rather than something that will blow you away. I for one, thought it was adequate, even though there were some holes. Not a huge deal considering how well the other aspects balanced this out into a very watchable and entertaining film.

Acting. Good, sometimes great. Loved the script! Michael Fassbender (300, Inglorious Basterds) was fantastic!

4/5 here, 8.5/10 for me. I saw this last week on Comcast OnDemand. I pre-ordered the blu ray today.
