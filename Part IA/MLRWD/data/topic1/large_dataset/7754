So if you really like those 2 movies, you might find that you will love the scence in this movie too.

But I really don't like the "Chairman" guy (who helped little Sayuri and became her love and life purpose).

Compared with LiMuBai in Crouching Tiger and Hidden Draggon, the Chairman is same kind of role, but LiMuBai sacrificed his life to protect the young girl and lead her to a right and better life.

This Chairman knew she loves him but chose to avoid. When Sayuri was selling her first night to the highest bidder, he didn't help out. Can you imagine the leading character will see such a lovely girl to give her night to the 'Doctor' guy (played by the key maker of Matrix)?

Finally he told Sayuri he loves her and the excuse of not saying that for so many years is because Nobu (he might love Sayuri too) saved his life before.

Yes, I know that might be Japanese' culture, to sacrifice a girl's life for a friend. But I don't like it, it made me sick when he kissed Sayuri.

When you see the little girl Chiyo (young Sayuri), you will know what I am talking about. What a lovely girl. She should have a much better life. Where's the Master Li there in Japan?
