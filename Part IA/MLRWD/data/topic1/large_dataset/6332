This movie is a classic Sci-Fi from 1951, produced by George Pal, and providing a very interesting story, based on accurate scientific facts, at least in theory, as two of the characters say all the time in parts of this movie, upsetting one of the other person involved. The collision course theory could happen for real, just like all the meteorites are happening every day, just imaging a little bit bigger !
From an astronomy stand point the story line is accurate, the launch pad for the rocket though isn't but remember it was back in 1951, so overall the story is good and believable, but maybe not for the general audience who has seen Armageddon in the meantime, the true Science Fiction lovers will enjoy this very good movie, with a great cast, and pretty good special effects of tsunami, volcanoes and so on, at least for a 1951 movie.
The picture quality is great, perfect, but only in Fullscreen though, and the sound is all right but only mono, remember old movie. The Technicolor is perfect as well and it is a pleasure to watch, the DVD menu is nice but the extra feature is limited to only the trailer, nothing else(Paramount classic). A very good movie for all true Sci-Fi lovers of all ages, the only setback being that it is not long enough, 82 minutes, again standard length for a movie of these times, but we would like it longer.
