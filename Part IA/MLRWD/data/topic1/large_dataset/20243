I've seen this series several times in Japanese and it just gets better with each viewing.  Now, Funimation is bringing it out here.  They have been trying to get it onto US Television so they have not only dubbed it into English, they have also re-recorded the opening and ending themes.  I got to take a look at a screener of the show this past weekend and the re-dub of the songs is well done and the translation is surprisingly accurate.

The dub itself, while not perfect casts for the various characters is one of the better dubs I've seen.  The translators and cast made a strong effort to stay true to the original Japanese version but Haruhi's voice is a little too deep, Hikaru and Kaouru sound a little too forced, Honey sounds a little too old, and Tamaki and the others - while getting the feel of their characters down - are little over the top of their Japanese counterparts in my opinion.  With only minimal differences between the Japanese and English dub scripts, and the attention the English cast puts into matching the Japanese cast in inflection and emotion, this is one dub that I personally wont mind watching despite the minor personal annoyances.
