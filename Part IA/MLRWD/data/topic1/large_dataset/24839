This is one of those movies that gets better with every viewing. William Castle and Joan Crawford are a magic combination, producing some of Miss Joan's most memorable moments on film. Watch as she gets drunk and hits on her daughter's boyfriend. Fall under her spell as she takes up her knitting. Marvel as she repeatedly launches into histrionics. And all the while those bracelets just keep clanking away!

The wardrobe is a joke (in a good way). Joan's daughter (played by Diane Baker) picks out a cheap looking floral print dress and a wig that was better left on the dummy in the store (meow!), plus these really noisy bangles that would make it really difficult to sneak up on anybody and chop their head off. And Joan's remarks on the shopping/makeover trip are equally bursting with irony. Saying high heels are not practical and worrying about how expensive everything is? Miss Diva Joan? Never!
The supporting cast deserves much recognition as well, especially Diane Baker, who gives JC a run for her money. I also thought George Kennedy was great in this flick, too. But then again, I'm biased. Live it, love it, embrace it. This is Joan at her campy best!
