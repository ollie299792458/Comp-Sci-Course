"If your a bird, then I'm a bird"-Noah, The Notebook. The Notebook is a story of how true love has it's up's and down's but if it's real then it can overcome anything. Our story begins with Noah, a boy whose family isn't the wealthiest, and Allie, a girl who comes from money, sharing a beautiful summer romance. Unfortunately, good things don't always last, and it all works out UNTIL the end of the summer. Allie is going away too New York to college and Noah says he will wait for her. But in that time span, Noah was recruited for the Military and sent off too war. Allie volunteered to be an assistant for wounded soldiers, and she meets another man. They fall in love and plan to get married, but Allie finally see's Noah has kept a long promise. What is the promise? And what will Allie do, be with her true love Noah or go a separate way? This is defiantly focused towards females, but it keeps your attention with the love and passion. If a couple watched this together you could pull males towards this too. That is why The Notebook is a fantastic movie.
