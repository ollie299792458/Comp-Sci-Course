I AM SO HAPPY THAT SOMEONE IS FINALLY GOING TO RELEASE CIRCLE OF IRON aka. THE SILENT FLUTE BY BRUCE LEE THE KING OF GUNG FU. I DID HAVE THE VHS YEARS AGO AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO BUYING THE DVD AS SOON AS IT IS AVAILABLE.

I'M ALSO GLAD THAT CARRIDINE IS DOING AN INTERVIEW AND THAT THERE WILL BE A TRIBUTE TO BRUCE LEE. IT IS REALLY NICE WHEN THEY PUT THOSE EXTRA GOODIES ON DVDs.

BRUCE LEE WAS AND WILL FOREVER BE AMAZING. HIS GUNG FU HAD ITS BIRTH IN THE WING CHUN STYLE OF GUNG FU UNDER THE TEACHING OF YIP MAN THE LATE GREAT GRAND MASTER OF THE WING CHUN SYSTEM.

I RECENTLY PURCHASED ANOTHER DVD ON AMAZON DOT COM CALLED WING CHUN THE SCIENCE OF FIGHTING BY LEGENDARY MASTER WONG SHUN LEUNG. MASTER WONG WAS A SENIOR STUDENT IN YIP MANS WING CHUN SCHOOL AT THE SAME TIME WHEN A YOUNG BRUCE LEE CAME ALONG. BEING SENIOR STUDENT MASTER WONG WOULD OFTEN BE CALLED UPON TO LEAD THE CLASS BY GRAND MASTER YIP MAN, THEREFORE, YOU CAN SAY THAT BRUCE LEE LEARNED QUITE A BIT FROM THIS GREAT WING CHUN MASTER.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOTH OF THESE DVDs TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN BRUCE LEE AND THE ORIGIN OF HIS JEET KUNE DO WHICH HAD ITS BIRTH IN THE WING CHUN SYSTEM.
