Toward the end of this forever timely and excellent film, Resnais states that it is absurd to think that such atrocities could never happen again.  Unfortunately, since 1955 such pogroms have happened over and over again.  Even today with nearly one billion going to bed hungry each night, human rights violations are an ever present reality.  It is also noteworthy that the director in contemporary times is making films lamenting the taking over of social policies in Europe by the so-called "free market," which has led to an erosion of social protections there.  While I understand that some may see this as an exaggeration, perhaps it is not far a jump from the concentration camps to those living in extremely isolated and poor conditions, having to scrounge for a meal and unable to find meaningful work.  My only concern is that the director at that time was trying to "stick it" to the Nazis (as one should), if not the Germans for what happened, mirroring centuries of animosities between these two countries.  France, too, had its share of human rights violations in Algeria, for instance.  I know that was not the purpose of this excellent and worthwhile film to give a balanced accounting so to speak, but a concern, however minimal.
