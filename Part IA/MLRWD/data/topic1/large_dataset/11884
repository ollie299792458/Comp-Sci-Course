The first thing that made me want to watch this movie was the layout of the DVD cover and its large ensemble cast.
The Laramie Project is a story of a town trying to cope with the aftermath of a young homosexual man who was beaten to death by two local youths.
As I said the DVD cover, with it's great photos of the large ensemble cast was the very first thing that made me check this movie out. I am attracted to films that have a large cast in it and this one was no exception. Everyone in this film had something going on for them; they signed on to this project not because they just wanted to work with other people but, they signed on to this because they belived in it so much. Each person had their time to shine. I felt that this film is one big monologue of the same idea. Each actor/actresses were given a monologue and had to present them and each and everyone of them presented their parts perfectly. I cannot even imagine how big this cast was. It's truly something to be seen. The editing and music of the film is great and so is the story. I belive that there is at least one charatcer in the movie that a viewer can relate to. I felt like I was looking through a telescope and watching these people just present their souls to you. It's very intimate and real, and you feel like you are part of the whole story.
Overall, if you like movies that are dramatic, real and one that has an enormous amount of actors/actresses who want to make a good film, then The Laramie Project is the one for you. GO CHECK IT OUT.
