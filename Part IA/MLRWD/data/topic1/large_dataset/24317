One day I was channel surfing and AznTV was playing this movie. I must have caught it fairly close to the beginning, where the mayor was trying to get the new substitute teacher to come in to the classroom.

I'm not sure why, but it kinda grabbed me, and just sort of kept me watching. I don't speak any dialect of Chinese, so the subtitles were a bonus. I have no idea how correct the subtitles are. At one point, the mayor calls the local troublemaker a "farthead". That was probably the clincher.

In any event, this is really a movie worth watching. Most of the other reviewers will give you good indications of the plot, but it basically seems to be a movie which points out how callous and uncaring many people can be, towards those less fortunate. That's a message which can easily break any cultural barrier.

But one thing I did walk away with was a sense of culture shock. Sitting in my comfortable middle-class American living room, drinking coffee. Watching a group of 20 children sharing two cans of Coke, most probably never have even tasted a Coke. This kind of gives you a stark view of what life must be like. Other scenes and conflicts bring this to bear, such as the woman at the television station who "was only doing her job" by effectively forcing the child to sleep outside the gates...
