I merely wish to express here my concurrence with the other reviewers.  What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?  All I can tell you is that I have been in love with this film since I first saw it four years ago.  I have seen it countless times since then, and it never loses its charm.  Though this was one of Shakespeare's earliest plays, I think it one of his best.  The film, though it was shot on a low budget, is a masterpiece except for one glaring flaw:  the casting agent picked entirely the wrong man to play Cicero.  Tall and slim, with a deep but soft, calm voice, words tripping off the tongue slowly and carefully -- this isn't the Cicero I remember from Latin class!  Spoke he words graceful and well-thought, yes -- but was he calm and thin?  Never!  Anyone who has seen a bust of Cicero and read any of his speeches knows he was corpulent, bold, and blustering!  And quite bald, unlike the actor in this movie.  But, it is a minor role in the play and the film, and we must forgive the production staff for not researching the character thoroughly.  Although I can tell you, were Cicero still alive, he would be indignant at having so small a role to play, and Shakespeare and Hollywood would feel a tongue-lashing so savage they would yearn to be beaten with a real whip instead!  Buy the movie and enjoy!
