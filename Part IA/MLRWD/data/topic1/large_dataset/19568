The other reviewers have already gone over the plot so I'll just add my own opinion on the DVD itself:

I wish that there were more special features which is the reason I gave this DVD a 4-star rating and not a 5. There's the obligatory commentary, one alternate scene (which wasn't much of an alternate) for the first scene of the movie, and a "making of" feature which ... left much to be desired because all it was were film crews being visible behind the filming of certain scenes. I would really liked to have seen more interviews for the "making of" from the cast and crew. Seeing as to how the movie revolves around schizophrenia, it would have been nice to see some type of feature (or even a full-length documentary) on the illness and/or something about the real Alphabet Killer beyond the last part of the movie that stated he had yet to be found.

I enjoyed the movie itself and was stoked to find out that the same guy who directed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMDZ">Wrong Turn</a> also directed "The Alphabet Killer." I was happy to find out that they are very different movies that happen to have the same actress in the lead role.
