To start off, I been watching amine types shows/movies for over 30 years. I am not expert, nor am I a writer.

I really enjoy watching the show and the art work that went into the making of the show. If there other seasons to add on to this I be looking forward (But in itself its really impressed me). Its a heck of a lot better then the old cartoon style from the xmen 90's. Art work is really in detail. They did the charters personality well from the comic books, and from their own point of views. Wolverine getting trash here and there was great to watch. As for blood and guts, I give this a Not even a PG-13. People that put this show together shows a lot of promises. Story line flows really well to its own toon.

People have there own ideas and complates about this show. I thought it was a good balance.

Why title getting better: 1.  Beats the 90's Xmen cartoon, not the comic. 2. Depends where show/movie made, they can only go so far because of control rules.
