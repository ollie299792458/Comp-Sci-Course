This is one of my favorite holiday films that carries a clear message: You get what you wish for. So starts our film with a bishop who asks for help from the almighty to build a cathedral. The problem is that his major benefactor wants the church built like a Mausoluem for her departed husband. To top that off our dear Bishop has been trying so hard to get his cathedral build that he has forgotten about his wife and daughter. Help comes in the form of Dudley the Angel, charmingly portrayed by Cary Grant. This is a wonderful role for Grant, who was originally slated to play the Bishop with Niven in the role of the angel. One chat between Grant and the director caused  a switch which, in turn, created a magical film. I can't imagine anyone else in the role of Dudley the Angel. You can almost see how much Cary Grant enjoys playing the Angel. Anyway, I won't ruin the rest of the movie for you accept to say that Dudley is there to help the Bishop. Thing is that the Bishop thinks Dudley is their to help him build the Cathedral. Dudley has come to aid the bishop and give him the help he needs. The bishop just doesn't realize where the help is needed.

My recommendation is to rent this movie for now.

This movie was shot in letterbox but is presented in Pan & Scan. Many of us are discriminating collectors that cherish the original format that the movie was presented in. Why the studio chose to present this movie in Pan & Scan when it was clearly shot in letterbox, is beyond me. All movies made after 1945 were shot in Letterbox. This info is public knowledge. So, listen up studio. Give this movie the treatment it deserves and release it in Letterbox for all of the fans of this wonderful movie who want to own it in it's original format. Letterbox please.
