This is the best Chainsaw movie ever directed and filmed! Most people simply put this movie down because, of the very low budget for the film and the subject matter. People are saying ... like "Who wants to see a guy wearing a mask kill off a bunch of virgins in the boonies" and that really ... me off because, Tobe Hooper is Alfred Hitchcock for the next Generation! He brought that inspiration on me when I first rented it uncut on vhs! He knew how to not put to much gore in a movie but, at the same time he would use an element that never leaves the viewer behind and curses them with pop up surprises! This was how Hooper shocked everyone that was brave enough to actually go out and watch it when it first came out in its theatrical format. Like when the guy in thw whell chair says something like "Cindy stop I think I heard something" and all of a sudden Leatherface comes out from nowhere and her poor invalid brother is left to die by Leatherface. That was truly a surprise that shocked everyone! Hooper is a master of horror that is very underrated just like this classic piece of 70's horror. This movie has the most shocking ending and the scariest dinning room scene ever! Tobe Hooper has also directed horror classics like The Poltergeist, The Funhouse, and Salem's Lot. When you mix elements such as gore, an excellent plot, a terrific killer, and things that you see in your mind but, not visually on screen with chainsaws and horror. Then you have yourself a well made cult classic based on a real life ...! Buy this and enjoy the terror of chainsaws cutting ...
