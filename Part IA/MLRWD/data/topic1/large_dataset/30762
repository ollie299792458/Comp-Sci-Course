People either love this movie or hate it.  I love it.  I had to watch this movie about a dozen times before I could come to peace with it.

There are only two main characters and two main sets in the entire movie.  Both characters are fascinating.  The dialog is brilliant and darkly comedic.

Hard Candy takes a really hard and twisted look at a topic that has worked its way into our collective unconscious.  Internet stalkers are the monsters of our time.  14 year old Haley Stark takes on an internet stalker head on and punishes him.  How?  She drives him over the edge until he finally sees himself for what he is.  It takes desperate measures and determination to force him to that point.

Could a real 14 year old do something like this?  Probably not.  Haley Stark is as much a comic book hero as any X-man (Ellen Page played a young superhero in X-Men 3, her next film after this one).

Jeffrey Kohlver (Patrick Griffith), on the other hand, is frighteningly realistic.  I firmly believe that he is an accurate portrayal of an internet stalker, and that some of them really think and operate the way he does.  The man enrages me to hatred and breaks my heart at the same time.  In the end, he simultaneously gets what he deserves and earns forgiveness.
