I don't know about you, but I can't drive by the video store without thinking about which video I want to rent next.  Recently I rented "Welcome to the Dollhouse", a thoroughly fresh take on adolescent  geekdom.  The low-budget, independent feature, written and directed by Todd  Solondz, drew major attention after winning the top prize at the 1996  Sundance Film Festival.
The plot revolves around the spectacularly  unpopular Dawn Wiener (well played by 12-year-old Heather Matarazzo).  Known around Benjamin Franklin Junior High as "Wiener Dog", Dawn  is shunned and tormented throughout the film.  If popularity were a ladder,  Dawn would be near the botton rung.  She's not even popular in her own  family, her irritatingly cute kid sister grabbing all the attention.  I  really liked the way the film showed there are those who are even lower on  the pecking order and how Dawn, herself, is not above lobbing  insults.
"Welcome to the Dollhouse" doesn't pretent to be  absolutely realistic.  Some scenes are over-the-top.  But the movie is  universally appealing, I believe, touching memories that are shared by many  of us.  
I read where New Yorker magazine described the film as  "Hateful".  I disagree and would describe the movie as a comedy,  but a sad and brutal one.
