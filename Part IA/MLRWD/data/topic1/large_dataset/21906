I just saw one fantastic movie.
  Snow Falling on Cedars
The story is about a forbidden romance set against the isolation of the Washington forests, a murder trial, and racial prejudice.  It is 'Romeo and Juliet' mixed with a bit of 'Othello'
That alone is nothing special, but what  truly makes this movie unique is the fashion of telling.  Like Willaim  Faulker's 'As I Lay Dying' the author uses a stream of consciousness  technique wherein the plot jumps rapidly from one event to another... like  the recollection of memories.  
Most of the story takes place in the  distant past rather than the immediate present, requiring the viewer to  piece together the various past events to understand the motivations of the  present.  The result is a flow of images and sounds and emotions that draw  you into the characters' minds and make you a part of the  drama.
Excellent.
I note that a number of other reviewers have  commented that this movie is near perfect but flawed, because it ends with  a conventional happy ending.  I have to wonder: What happy ending is that?  
The man can not hold the woman in his arms.  
Nor the woman hold the  man.  
It's an unrequited love.  The man sees his lifelong friend and  lover every day, but he can never have her... and he has no other  prospects... he is a lonely, lonely person.  *This* is a happy ending?  I  call it a tragedy.  Were I in Ishmael's shoes, I would likely kill myself  in order to end the pain.  The ultimate in classic tragedy.
Obviously,  this movie had a profound effect on me.  I believe that is the ultimate  goal for all authors of books, plays, and movies: To effect the reader  emotionally and mentally.  Catharsis.  On that count, I give 'Snow Falling  on Cedars' a 10 out of 10.
