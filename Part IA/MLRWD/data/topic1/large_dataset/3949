The above quote is from original AND current Woodstock music engineer Eddie Kramer (I'm not going to go into his MULTITUDE of credits, Google and ye shall see!).  I would rather have a few added notes, vocals or percussion than the alternative, either an original track that STILL doesn't represent the way it was heard, or NONE AT ALL!  Anyone who thinks that 99% of ALL live concert recordings haven't been "fiddled" with at least somewhere, is kidding themselves.  I once read that "Absolutely Live" by THE DOORS had over 100 edits! (Hey, if all the edits WERE live, they can get away with it!)  In fact, most of the edits to live recordings are sections/pieces/notes from other live recordings, so the timbre matches the original.  I mean, come on! Eddie Kramer even went as far as getting the ORIGINAL band members, and when that wasn't possible due to death, their progeny!  At least he didn't do something like getting the drummer from THE KNACK to "fix" a Jimi Hendrix track, as Alan Douglas did on the CD "Voodoo Soup"!  As for myself, I loved "Woodstock" when I first saw it as a lad in a NYC theater (my first "contact high"), I bought it on VHS, I LOVED the "Director's Cut" on Laserdisc in 5.1 Surround Sound, and have been holding off on DVD for this version to appear.  As a final note, the short video on the product page was titled "RESTORATION" , and I can't see how anyone who has watched it, and saw the obvious care and affection Kramer and the musicians exhibited towards "fixing" the original material, could accuse them of "changing" it.  Next time, pay more attention......
