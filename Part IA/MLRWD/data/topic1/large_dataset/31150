I first saw "Blacula" when I was about 9 years old at the drive-in.  Being a horror movie fan, I really didn't care much about the story as long as I got to see William Marshall change into Blacula!  Watching it again 37 years later brings back great memories.  I also find that the story line is actually a pretty ingenious one.  "Blacula" was originally an African prince (and a really good man) who went to Transylvania to meet with Dracula, seeking his help to stop the slave trade in the late 1700's.  What a big mistake!  I wonder how he came up with that great idea ("Hey honey...I hear this Dracula cat is pretty cool with some clout - maybe HE can help...let's go visit him - it'll be a nice getaway!")!  When the prince thought Drac was trying to put moves on his wife, the good prince tried to fight back to defend her honor and to escape the castle.  That's when the evil Dracula decided to turn the African prince into a vampire.  The corniest part of the movie (to me) was how he actually got the name "Blacula".  200 years later, the vampire prince makes his way to America to start his reign of terror!  The story is a good mixture of camp and classic horror.  It also has campy, comic-book like African American characters inspired from prototypes seen in previous Dracula movies, including Blacula himself sporting the traditional formalwear and an African American version of Van Helsing.  The nightclub scene was pretty funny - with the old school Soul Train look and dancing!  There was no nudity or extreme usage of any profanity in the movie, so other than a little blood here and there, it's safe for kids over 10 to watch (it is a PG movie).  I enjoyed the movie, expecting some degree of corn along with it.  If you go into this movie expecting nothing but good clean cheese and a little corn, you'll enjoy it too!
