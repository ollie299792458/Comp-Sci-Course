Amreeka is one of those films that won't necessarily change your life, but will certainly give you a new viewpoint and make you think. The plot is very simple and the action is low, but I say this not as criticism because I think it's part of the essence of the movie and the message. It doesn't try to be flashy or over dramatic, but rather portray what life is probably like for the average immigrant to this country.

It's a story centered around Arab Palestinian immigrants which are regarded in this country as "the enemy" although as you see clearly in the film this particular family is the type that makes America stronger. They're not terrorists, though they're frequently accused of it, and they seem to keep closely knit, for protection and familiarity.

Some issues dealt with in Amreeka:

Tensions in Israel/Palestine that force them away.
A single mother trying to protect and raise her son.
A new immigrant in a strange country.
Having nothing, being robbed in a strange country.
Teenagers trying to fit in with American culture and deal with adolescence.
Intolerant people displaying hatred and ignorance.
Supporters and open minded people helping the immigrants adjust.

Although simple and low key the movie is surprisingly complex due to the issues above and the superb acting by the cast. The range of emotions is great, and everyone in it is very convincing. The characters are very realistic and well developed as well.

To make it brief, this is a very well done movie that's very enjoyable and makes you think. I would recommend it, especially for fans of indies.
