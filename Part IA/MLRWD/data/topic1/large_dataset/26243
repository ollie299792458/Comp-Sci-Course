Top Gun made so many people want to become fighter pilots. As a movie it was probably one of the best promotional tools the Navy and armed forces ever had and the spike in enrollment for years was measurable. Of course there were very few who became pilots or even RIO's and probably ended up in crap roles and not even on an carrier, but I digress.

It's strange to look at the film now and see the outdated old Ninja motorcycle, know that F-14's are no longer in service, Top Gun itself doesn't exist, Anthony Edwards is bald, and Tom Cruise is a Scientology freak.

People also comment on the 'homo-erotic,' volley ball scene, but I prefer to think that there are many more straight women who enjoyed that one scene in a guy's film vs homosexual males.

Top Gun as a film is out dated, but it is still fun to watch and feel like I'm a little kid again who thinks that one day I could be a fighter pilot. It's a film locked in a period of time in US history that has come and gone, but it still makes me smile.
