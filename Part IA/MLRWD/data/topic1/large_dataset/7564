im sorry but isnt this what we Americans love? The perfect motion picture blend of action, involving story line, humor, and sex? You're a stupid person if you call this movie stupid. It wasnt meant to appeal to your intellectual side. It would be boring. No, this movie is exactly what you want when you pay 20+ dollars to go to a theatre, which is a thrill ride.  The Crank series are super fun movies for you to enjoy, let your guard down, ESCAPE INTO. Life is already way too overly serious to want to deal with anyway, so why pay for realism when we're always trying to escape it. Some of you people out here just cannot be loose and enjoy something for what it is. Always with the speculation, criticism, and disappointment. I feel sorry for your kids, no wonder they get drunk and do drugs.  This movie really reminded me of playing Grand Theft Auto 4 on speed. Its just awesome. I give it 5 stars just off pure fun and, what's most necessary for the arts, which is (drum roll) Non Conformity! It's a lot different than any other action films I've even seen, it went even further than "Live Free And Die Hard".
