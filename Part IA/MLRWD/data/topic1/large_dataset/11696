I have to admit that this is one of my favorite movies. It is an absolutely hilarious, romantic comedy. The story was based on an interesting love triangle composed of Julianne (Julia Roberts), Michael (Dermot Mulroney) and Kimberly (Cameron Diaz).  Julianne and Michael have been great friends forever.  They even dated and made a pact to marry (if neither found someone years later).  At the beginning of the movie, Michael calls Julianne to inform and invite her to his wedding.  Immediately, Julianne becomes overwhelmed with jealousy and plans to break up the happy couple.  Michael and Kimberly completely trust Julianne and do not suspect her plan.  In fact, Julianne's meddling seems to make the couple's relationship even stronger.  Kimberly seems to be the perfect fiance in every way. She is willing to do whatever it takes to make her man happy even if she has to sacrifice her own happiness. She also seems to be very naive because she never really knew what her fiance's best friend was up to until the end of the movie. (I guess that is the whole point of the movie.) The dialogue was good and full of laughs.

If you liked Notting Hill or Runaway Bride, you will love this movie. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes romantic comedies or is getting married in the near future.
