It is difficult to imagine that so many moviegoers have been captivated by this massively pretentious, mind-numbing excuse for a film, but perhaps moralistic spoon feeding is making a comeback. Writer-director Gary Ross could not have gone much further in pounding home every heavy-handed point of this infantile fantasy except, maybe, to have inserted explanatory subtitles for the audience, whom he must obviously believe cannot think for itself. 
With the exception of the first ten minutes or so when David and Jennifer, the main teen characters, are in "real life" and provide us with occasional moments of hilarity and entertainment based on genuine human frailty, the film is devoid of any redeeming humor.  Pleasantville is, nonetheless, astonishing and amusing for its ability to take its two-dimensional, blatantly transparent self so utterly seriously for a full hour and twenty-five minutes.
Nevertheless, outstanding performances by Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels, William H. Macy, and Don Knotts, who provides the only true comic relief herein, salvage Pleasantville from massive walkouts in theaters and rotting on the video store shelves.  
For diehard fantasy buffs, however, Pleasantville may be just your cup of schmaltz.
