I love old movies and I love Marilyn.  But this just stinks.  There's none of Marilyn's glamour or gold-digging charm.  She's shrill and whiny in a terrible hick accent.  "Beau" is obnoxious and completely over-the-top.

The premise of the movie is Beau, a young cowboy, going to a rodeo.  He's an innocent, never off his ranch in Montana.  He decides he's going to find himself an angel to take back home.  So he meets "Cherie" in a saloon.  He manhandles her, browbeats her, and eventually kidnaps her.  His screaming and fighting make a person think that if he managed to force her to marry him (after abducting her with a lasso as she desperately tries to flee), he'd probably force himself on her on the wedding night.  It's just that creepy.

So they end up stuck at a bus station together due to bad weather.  FINALLY someone steps in when they see Beau manhandling Cherie, and says he can't kidnap this woman.  Beau objects and ends up getting his butt whipped.

Which somehow makes Cherie love him and they ride off to Montana together.

It's really objectionable.  Offensive, really.  I can't say one single good thing about the entire movie.  It wasn't believable, enjoyable, amusing, or entertaining.  I'm really sorry I watched it.
