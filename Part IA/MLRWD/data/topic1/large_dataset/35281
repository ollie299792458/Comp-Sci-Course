3:10 to Yuma,

In a world where making a good western is a long and winding beaten path, Hollywood has managed to rope in two hits this year, "No Country for Old Men," and 3:10 to Yuma.  Not since Young Guns has such good westerns been available. Russell Crowe is Ben Wade a ba ba ba ba bad to the bone gun slinging robber who gets caught because he had his pants down. Now that Wade fought the law and the law won, the task of getting the outlaw to another town where the train headed to Yuma Prison arrives at 3:10, proves a deadly task. Dan Evans, (Christian Bale) is a down on his luck rancher who signs on to get the prisoner to the train on time for $200.00. Some male bonding goes on here as Wade gain respect for Dan Evans for his strong upright principles. They get to the train on time but Wade's gang of ruthless outlaws come out blazing their guns to save Wade from going to prison. The only real surprise in the simple plot but nicely done western is the last man standing. Great looking western movie sets, cinematography, period costume designs and some great acting makes 3:10 to Yuma a good DVD choice. I also credit a noteworthy performance by young rising star actor Logan Lerman. Veteran actor Peter Fonda also stars. 3:10 to Yuma is a remake of a 1957 movie of the same title which stared Glen Ford.  Couch potato review, 5 potato 6 potato
