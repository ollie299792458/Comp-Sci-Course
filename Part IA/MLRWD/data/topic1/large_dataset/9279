This movie was the first anime movie I saw and it is one of my all time favourites being that Im a Street Fighter fan.I bought the VHS version some time ago and loved it.I recently bought the Street Fighter Anniversery game on Xbox that contains the movie.HMMMM well kind of.The version on the xbox/ps2 has been edited down to PG rated rather then a M15 rating.Examples are:Guile to Bison(Unedited)"ILL rip your f%#^ing heart out!"Now the edited version goes"Ill rip your stinking heart out!" Now there are many of these lame attempts to cover up the swearing and also the Chun Li shower scene is pretty much edited.So Im buying this proper DVD release even though I have the Xbox game,it doesnt do the movie justice and dosnt make it as serious and funny.But the original movie form is fantastic,rocking soundtrack(this movie introduced me to Alice In Chains who I am now a die hard fan :)also Silverchair's Israels Son is a rocking song.Only thing missing in this movie would be Akuma and more of how Ryu and Kens master is killed by him but this was poorly covered in the Alpha movie and would have liked to see it here.But as a Street Fighter fan I highly recomend the normal unedited version but buy the Anniversery edition for the games of course because being Street Fighter,they rock.
