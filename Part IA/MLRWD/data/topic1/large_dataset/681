Hands down, this is an amazing movie.  There is very little to find wrong with this movie.

The acting is by far the highlight of this film.  While not his breakout role, this is the first movie where Norton really showed he was a star.  He goes from downright scary to completely likable through the movie.  More importantly, its a transition you really believe.

Furlong, who bothers me a lot, mostly it's his voice, also puts in a good performance.  The rest of the cast also adds a lot to the movie.  I am a fan of Ethan Suplee, and this is role is one of the reasons.  Also Fairuza Balk puts in a sold performance.  And Avery Brooks, always a winner, really comes through.  I think Brooks puts in the second best performance, next to Norton, of the whole film.  In a movie with the caliber of acting, thats saying something.

The story itself is uplifting in it's own way, but still very dark.  This is definitely a drama, so anyone looking for lighter fair should steer clear.  Normally I am not a fan of flashbacks, but they are handled very well.  The pacing is dead on, and the viewer is not left wondering how much time is left until the movie is over.

This is a quality flick, one of my all time favorites, and a must see for any moviegoer.
