It's a good movie, there's not allot of space in the movie.
As far as 3D, sure but nothing floated out of the screen of popped out at you.

2 movies I have are WOW on the Visual, Journey to the center of the earth and Journey to the mysterious Island.

Throughout both of these movies you can see things just jump out of the screen looks like you can touch it.  Those are great.

Ghost Rider 2 had just a few things wasn't what I was hoping for.

Underworld 4 just a few things also.

Parana 3DD it had allot of pop out effects as well as the first Parana

Wrath of the titans was fairly good on the effects.

John Carter an awesome movie but as far as 3D visual there were NO POP-OUTS or anything to come out of the screen.

Transformers 4 if my memory serves me, I believe it had allot of 3D Visual effects.

Sector 7, It's NOT IN ENGLISH, you have to read the movie not giving you the chance to really watch it.  It had some Visual Pop-out but not much.

The Darkest hour wasn't so great.
