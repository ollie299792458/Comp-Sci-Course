This has to be my favorite J Carpenter film as it deals with the basic age old dilemma of good vs evil, science vs religion.  The twist to this confrontation is an existing cylindrical ooze swirling filled chamber located in the sub terranean level beneath a Catholic Church (apparently a secret to all except a monk-like order who has guarded it for thousands of years and whomever happens to be the priest du jour).

Long story short, the information falls into the hands of Donald Pleasance (Catholic Clergyman) who in turn turns to an old friend, who happens to teach theoretical science at a local university, for help.  Students of various specialties are recruited to aid in the study of this cylinder.

Biblical external warnings are subtle and not so subtle at times. There are catatonic homeless surrounding the church (Alice Cooper playing more than a cameo role as one of the homeless), who seem to resent the presence of the clergy as well as those of science in the church, I wont be a spoiler and mention the other warnings.

The Cylindrical Chamber is discovered to be a prison....and as expected its prisoner has escaped.  The film concentrates on the effects the escaped "prisoner" has on each character.  Also who the prisoner is and what lengths are gone to to free it permanently are clever and unique.
