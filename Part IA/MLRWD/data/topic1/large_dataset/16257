i've been watching the repeats on television of this series. i was an avid fan when it was on in the 90's because basically i (amongst many many other women) was living their lives minus the uber expensive shoes and fab digs. i have to admit i still think the first three seasons were good.

having had a few years gone by and gotten married has changed my outlook in a major way. now, when i watch the show i realize how shallow and selfish they all seem and don't wonder that they couldn't keep a relationship; serious relationships mean giving up part of yourself, but then you want to because you love them.

watching it now, i find most of them unlikable. especially miranda(embittered ballbuster) and samantha (total slag)it's amazing that she never caught an STD- so not realistic. i loved charlotte and related to her the most until she divorced trey. i mean they didn't even try to work things out, and then she changed her religion for harry like she was throwing away an old dress. and carrie treated aidan dishonourably. i also think the writers crapped out with the russian; he would have been the only one who could seriously rival big and they turned him into an a-hole- what a predictably contrived plotline.

and when the first film came out(didn't bother with the 2nd); mid age samantha breaks up with smith because why? stupid and unrealistic; like he would even still be with her at this point? come on. if madonna and demi couldn't hang on to their youngin's she sure as heck wouldn't be the one breaking up with such a sweet considerate hot man like smith.

it had it's time but they all should have grown up.
