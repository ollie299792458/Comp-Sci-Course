I am not usually a fan of Bette Davis but I am a huge fan of Charles Boyer.  However, in this film they both shine.  The appeal they have to one-an-other other is enormous but because of the circumstances in which they live, they can`t give in to their feelings.  He is a grand duke in the French Court, she is the governess of his childrem.  His wife is a vitriolic, spiteful and an extraordinarily jealous woman, throwing out wild accusations and making life unbearable for everyone except her spies and servants.  She has no interest in her children.  She cares only for her husband but has driven him away with her terrible possesiveness.

This role, amazeingly, is not played by Bette Davis but by Barbara O`Neill who played Scarlett O`Hara`s mother in `Gone with the Wind`.  Instead Bette Davis is the the gentle, loving and well loved governess of the four children.  The peace that she brings to the house is in stark contrast to the screaming and tears that were part of their lives before her arrival.  To the Duke, the governess is his refuge and they become very much in love.  The tension that this creates gets stronger in every scene they have together.  Two wonderful actors giving great performances.

I believe this film was Warner Brothers answer to GWTW.  It was shot in black and white because off the sombre nature of the story.  Standing on its own, it is a fine film.  I recommend it.
