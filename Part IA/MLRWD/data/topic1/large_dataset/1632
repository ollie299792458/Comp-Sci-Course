I've always loved Rob Zombie, so I had really high hopes for this movie. I'm a big fan of animation in general, and bizarre, nonsensical cartoons in particular, but this film just didn't do anything for me. Within the first five minutes I had lost all interest in watching any further; I forced myself to watch all the way to end anyway, anticipating something that would draw me into the story, but alas, it never came.

There were gratuitous amounts of violence & toon nudity, but it came from out of nowhere and didn't go anywhere. I didn't walk into this expecting Shakespeare or anything, but despite the appeal of wild themes like zombie Nazis & monster strip clubs, from start to finish the whole thing just felt stupid & pointless. A couple of jokes landed nicely, but 9 out of 10 were just plain lame (despite being punctuated with unnecessary boobs or decapitations).

Ultimately, I rented this movie for a dollar and still felt pretty ripped off.

On a final note, I have no idea where people are getting the idea that the animation was epic - I was pleasantly reminded of Ren & Stimpy cartoons, but it sure wasn't anything special.
