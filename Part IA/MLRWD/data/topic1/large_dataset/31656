I remember the days before Rolling Stone was mainstream.  It covered the newly emerging world of rock'n'roll and the stars with an upfront and personal hand...Some of the correspondents became as followable as the stars themselves.  Cameron Crowe has converted his memories of life as a 16 year old rock stringer, a career he started on a lark, (with little knowledge of the music)into a very watchable and likeable movie.  This movie leaves you trying to guess who the characters are based on in the real rock world.The cast is outstanding and true to the times.  Patrick Fugit is perfect as the wide eyed, idealistic young man( William Miller, the character Crowe based on himself), entering a world previously unknown to him.  Francis McDormond is William's mother struggling to retain some grasp on her disintergrating family (it is easy to forget how devisive rock music was within families). Phillip Seymour Hoffman, dead on as the world weary Lester Bangs, providing  Willaim Miller with entry to the rock world, while warning him of its dangers.  And luminicent, Kate Hudson as Penny Lane.  It is easy to see this as a star making role for her, she inhabits the role of a proud, ever hopeful "band aid" and draws your heart to her.  A wonderful look into the beginnngs of rock and roll, bringing back many , many memories.
