"A Passage to India" is brilliantly acted, shot and conceived, but I would like to speak in defence of this amazing film.  I feel it is absurd to claim that the film, "A Pasage to India" is in itself racist.  The story upon which the film is based forces one to question what was really going on in India during those times.  That's the point, racism forces one to take sides, sometimes when we know we're standing on the wrong side of the fence.  The movie brings racism out into the light but does not participate actively, it only observes and allows the audience to decide which side to take.  If you feel uncomfortable or angry while viewing this movie, congratulations, you may be onto something.  Any movie about assimilation & racism will have it's detractors, that only proves the film has taken a stand.  Any film that pleases all sides is catering to it's own box-office requirements.  The films "Gandhi", "Shindler's List" & "Gone With The Wind" were all criticized and were all brilliantly biased..... I wouldn't have them any other way.  I think everyone needs to look a little deeper into themselves while viewing "A Passage to India".  Either that or stick to Hilary Duff movies.
