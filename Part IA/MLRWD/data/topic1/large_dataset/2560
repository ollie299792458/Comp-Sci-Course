There have been several king arthur films made over the decades. but, none have ever come close to be as excellent as this film, excalibur. we have the legend here in a 2 hour and 20 film that is worth every minute. the acting is fine, and the cinematography is breath taking. I didn't realize Ireland ws this beatiful. You will recognize some of the actors when they were young and starting out (patrick stewert-was in star trek, liam neeson has made many us films-includung an oscar nominated turn in schindlers list, nigel terry, was in troy, and of course helen mirren won best actress for the queen)

I was 13 when this film was released in the u.s. and i didn't understand what the arthurian legends were. as the years went by, i read about many of the legends and even read le morte d'arthur and i grew to appreciate what a fine film excalibur was and still is.

this film is not suitable for younger viewers asthere is an intense sexual scene and a few scenes of graphic violence. but, still worth watching.
