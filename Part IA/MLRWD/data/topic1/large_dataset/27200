I just discovered this little gem. I had been seeing that it was on the USA network for a couple of years now, however, I had not taken the time to watch. Today, I watched 2 episodes from season 2 I would guess and I absolutely loved what I saw. I am a huge fan of this sort of happy ending character driven (though not to deep) type of show. The stories are simple yet realistically believable. There is a certain continuity as well. The two stories that I watched also involved a much older Henry Winkler playing the father. I won't go into details of the story-lines, however, I will say this show is worth the time, if not the money. However, not for the price that is being charged here or by the manufacturer. There are only 12 - 13 episodes to these sets by USA as that is all they do to make a season. It's the same with all of their shows. The shows are great, but the price is ridiculous. That is not to say that I won't purchase the sets, just not at this price. I will wait for a sale or get them used. I refuse to pay more than $10 - $13 with tax and shipping for a season of less than 14 episodes. The good thing is that Amazon and other sources sell not only used copies but have great sales. So, if you can wait, it's well worth your time and investment to own this show.
