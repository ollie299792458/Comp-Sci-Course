Valentina Lisitsa is a young pianist from Ukraine who emigrated to the United States about 10 years ago. The first time I heard her playing, I was struck by her awesome and dazzling technique. I had never heard faster runs, arpeggios, and octaves, with precision that seemed supernatural. Valentina's recording of the Chopin Etudes is fabulous. Whenever I hear a rendition of the Etudes, I automatically compare it to my previous gold standard, which I consider to be Maurizio Pollini's Etudes cd from 1972. Valentina's playing matches Pollini in technique, as one would have expected. But there is also a depth of passion which makes these Etudes very special indeed. But what is really amazing is that this recording appears to have been made without a break or cut. She plays the entire set of Etudes straight through, one after the other, without any editing or retakes. Each Etude just flows off her fingers with ease, with power and ease. Unedited recordings are a trademark of Valentina's, but doing it with the complete Chopin Etudes seems that much more startling. The camera angles are very good, allowing the viewer to see her hands and fingers flying over the keyboard up close. I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to have a special experience, to hear and see the Chopin Etudes played by a wonderful and dazzling pianist and musician, and, of course, to anyone who has ever tried to play these technically and musically challenging works. You will love it.
