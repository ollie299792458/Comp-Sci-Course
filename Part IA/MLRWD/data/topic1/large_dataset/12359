This film is starting to look depressingly similar to the current business ethos of this day.  Don't believe me? View the film and then watch CNBC during the day and listen to some of the philistines that rave on about how good it is that American jobs are moving overseas and how  the trade deficit with China is nothing to be alarmed about, even if they are upgrading their military with the income and even though one of their generals threatened to nuke us this week. While watching CNBC I often think of this film.  Where do these philistines come from and how is it that we watch the decline of our country like some deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming car at night?  I am not suggesting that they are extraterrestrials but they sure as hell aren't patriots, I don't care how many American Flags they wear on their lapels.

Greed and narcissism, which have taken over our culture, are right out of this film's basic theme. Carpenter was truly a prophet when he made this film 17 years ago.  It is an allegory for our time.  I highly recommend it.
