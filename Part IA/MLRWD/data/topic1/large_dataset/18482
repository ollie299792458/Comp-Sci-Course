A lot of us have never really heard of Master IP until this movie came out. This is one of the best true to life martial arts movie ever made.
Started from the time before World War II. Before the Japanese invasion there was Master IP. He was a well known good martial arts fighter and a good man who loved to help his people in need. Although he never had a martial arts school people knew how good he was and he was the best at it. He was modest to the core a really nice guy that cared for his family and respected his wife fully.
In china in the old times in order for a master to start a school for martial arts they had to fight the best to make their name known so students will sign up at their school.
if the masters wanted to make a name for themself they had to fight the best. And in master IPs town he was the best so they had to test him if they could really defeat his style. In order for IP not to embarrass the losers he always asked them to fight inside his home so no one can find out who won or lost or how bad the oponent can get beatten.
then the Japanese invasion came. You will have to watch the movie and then you'll know how it used to be in China when they were invaded in WW II.
