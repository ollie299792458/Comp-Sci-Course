Powerful movie making in this Wachowski Brothers sequel to their phenomenal hit "The Matrix"!  The special effects are a sight to behold...there were several scenes in which I nearly pee'd in my pants - it was that breath-taking.  This story takes you to where Neo left off as the Chosen One.  Now, he must continue his fight to free the human race.  Wonderfully acted by returnees of the maiden Matrix film.  Keanu Reeves, what can I say...Oscar winning performance in my book.  Lawrence Fishburne, again, another excellent performance as the mentor to young Neo.  And then there is Trinity, as a girl who also delves into the martial arts, I am in awe of Trinity.  She is my role model, my hero.  Portrayed like someone who has lived the part all her life, Carrie Anne Moss is a Goddess.  This movie is, in some respects, better than the original Matrix.  This film is more thought provoking and poses questions that drives you deep down into your soul to make you find answers in your own life.  Truly outstanding movie making!  I foresee, as history unfolds itself, that this movie will be mentioned in the same breath as "Citizen Kane" and "It's a wonderful life".  A throwback to when movie making was about plot, character development, and storytelling.  This film makes you think about where your life is in your present day; griping you and not letting go until you are left sitting in your seat in a pool of sweat going "wow!!"
