I'm one of those people that wonders whatever happened to child actors of my favorite movies.  This movie definitely caters to that curiosity.  The new featurette has interviews with all the actors talking about what it was like to make the film and what they've been doing since.  There's also a touching interview with Gene Wilder in that featurette.  I had a delightful surprise with the running commentary!  It's all the kids from the movie together for the first time!  They share interesting stories about filming the scenes and seem to be having a great time with some good-natured teasing.  The guy who was Augustus doesn't seem to talk much - I'm not sure if he understood what  everyone was saying - or maybe he just doesn't speak much.  I get a feeling that those kids really WERE playing themselves from the commentary.  It adds a fun dimension to the film but I tend to like the commentary features on DVDs.  I think the commentary's my favorite part.
The sing along does not have the popular "Candy Man" song, which is a bummer, but it also doesn't have that maudlin "Cheer up Charlie" song - always had to fast forward through that one.  It does include the corresponding scenes with the songs but doesn't always have the words at the bottom:  "I've got a Golden Ticket" with Grandpa Joe, "World of Pure Imagination" with Willy Wonka, "I Want it Now" with Veruca Salt, and the Oompa Loompa song that came after Veruca fell down the eggdicator.  
All in all it's a fun DVD.  Only complaint is its not widescreen.  But I've really been enjoying all the features.
