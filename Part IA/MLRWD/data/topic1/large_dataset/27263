I enjoyed this movie so much because of the intense interaction with the characters.  You end up feeling like you know them and I watch the movie over and over.  When i first saw this movie I was so shocked about the ending.  It is so sad and depressing.  I keep thinking.  Why don't they wait a little longer.  So far in the movie they have been safe in shelter.  The land rover was sort of a shelter.  If only they waited maybe a little over 5 min they would of seen the tanks rolling up and knew they were saved and only then all that they have been through to try to surive would of not been in vain.  It is a very human story to the core which Frank Darabont focused on and in my opinion struck right to the human heart.  I loved the characters.  Never read the book.  Maybe 1 day I will buy the book and read it.  I bought the 2 disk collecter's edition and I recommend it as a MUST HAVE for any fan of this movie.  FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!! Still wish the last 5 characters made it though.  The ending will haunt me forever!!!  Thanks Frank Darabont!!  That was his intention all along.
