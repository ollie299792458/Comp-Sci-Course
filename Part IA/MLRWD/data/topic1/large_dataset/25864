I realize a lot of people haven't seen this movie, so I'm not going to talk about it too much. I simply want to encourage anyone that hasn't seen it to take a chance and watch it. Sure, you may hate it and decide you've wasted 2 hours, but that's a small price to pay. What's worse is holding off seeing this classic. I'll go ahead and say it's one of my top 5 favorite films: It's one of my top 5 favorite films.

Scorsese takes a real sweet approach to this one. Travis Bickle (Deniro) is just a great character that benefits even more from the way Scorsese zeros in on him. The slow pace of the flick allows for some excellent plot development. Some might argue that this is boring. Don't listen to them. The movie should have you sucked in from the start. The dark, gloomy feeling, the mesmorizing jazz score and the loneliness that is Travis Bickle is fascinating stuff. I've seen this a few times and I can't emphasize how awesome the character of Travis is enough.

So I guess all i'm trying to say is "Definitely get this!" At the very least bring yourself to see it when it comes on a movie channel or something.
