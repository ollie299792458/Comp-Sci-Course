This is the kind of film that makes you yearn for the late '60s and '70s, when there were actually entries into the canon of the horror film that approached true brilliance.  In my honest opinion, this is a nearly flawless piece of cinematic work.  The acting is top notch, with the always reliable and visually stunning Julie Christie as co-lead to Donald Sutherland, whose performance here is just short of bravura.

In addition to top-notch acting across the board, DLN is notable for the exceptional quality of its cinematography and editing as well as its amazing use of what might just be the most beautiful city in the world - Venice.  Having just visited there, I can attest to the fact that Roeg and co. nailed the sights, sounds, and vibe of a city that is as mystical as it is ancient and charming.  Also outstanding, the film's score, which was done by then novice Pino Donagio, who would later go on to score Brian DePalma's masterpiece, Carrie.

Last but not least, the script and the dialogue are crisp and adult, depecting what is perhaps the most artful sex scene on celluloid.  Issues of faith, love, and the mysteries of the human spirit are also captured beautifully here.

A true ***** star classic.  I recommend that one watch it at least 3 times before judging it; it really does take that many viewings to fully absorb.
