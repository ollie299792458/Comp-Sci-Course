This is one of my favorite films of all time.  It's perfect, from the camera-work to set-dressing to deeply "poor london slang" dialogue.  It's fast-paced from beginning to end, with every moment thought out with the utmost care given to detail, humor, and pacing.

Unless you're unable to cope with the English accent, make SURE you comedy & action fans watch this movie.  I'd say that each and every performance is also fully fleshed-out and well done, but the cameo by "Sting" as a pub-owner & father of one of the main characters was a bit unbelievable.

Notably, it's got a distinctly non-hollywood, almost independent-film feel about it.

The plot has more than enough twists to keep you entertained.  Peripheral characters and subplots abound, and each one works like part of a jigsaw puzzle to make the whole film work perfectly.

Buy...watch...enjoy.  Lather, rinse, repeat as necessary.

P.S.  This glowing review does NOT extend to the remainder of Guy Ritchie's work.  The similar-sounding, similar-feeling "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock, and 4 smoking hooves" fall flat, like a dessert snack that was once great, but has grown stale after 3 weeks in the fridge.
