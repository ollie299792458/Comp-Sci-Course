(sigh)

Thinking just isn't in style in this country anymore, is it?  Reading the negative so-called "reviews" of this gem is like reading a page or two of historical "wisdom" from a certain attention-craving, ex-(part-time)-governor from Alaska.  It's just sad to realize that our education system has failed THAT badly.

Ah well, pointing at lemmings never makes them anything but sillier.

About the movie:

This critically acclaimed and Oscar-winning screenplay provides a typically brilliant, quirky and chancy role for Kate Winslet, who has opted to be in some of the most interesting (and intelligent) flix in the last two decades (and I ain't just talkin' 'bout Titanic, folks).  The supporting cast is also very good, and well-selected.

The real surprise here is Carrey, who is almost exclusively known as a master of silly, physical comedy.  With the possible exception of The Truman Show, this may well be his best (and is certainly his most sensitive) role, ever.

Entertaining on several tiers, this movie definitely has its hilarious moments, and is continuously entertaining. Though billed as a "romantic fantasy", the film also crosses into the realm of smart, speculative fiction-- reminiscent of Harlan Ellison, or Phillip K. Dick. Yet it also manages to keep its plot points grounded in the emotional realities common to anyone who's ever suffered for love.  And there are some quite touching moments, which might just have you in tears, as well.

Well Done!
