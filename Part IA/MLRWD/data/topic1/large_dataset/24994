This movie was one of the most pleasant cinematic surprises I have ever had. I went to see it prepared to wince through the entire thing. Instead, I started smiling and laughing at the beginning, and ended up smiling all the way through. The word that most succinctly and accurately sums this film up is: FUN. It's not a movie you have to think a lot about (although there are a few twists and turns of the plot). It's not the kind of movie that will be known for its great writing. But it is an incredible amount of fun. The action is quick, the pacing keeps you engaged. The acting of the main stars was surprisingly good -- in particular, Cameron Diaz played the air-headed blonde role to the absolute hilt, and it came off very well. The sound-track was extremely entertaining -- I believe they must've played at least a little clip from every song ever made with the word "angel" figuring in it. In addition, the DVD has lots of extras in it, including 3 deleted scenes (they're very short, so don't expect anything monumental), and documentary-style clips on how they did the martial arts, the special effects, and wardrobe. And it also contains a short clip with some very funny bloopers. In all, the DVD is well worth the purchase price, and I will probably watch it several times in the coming weeks.
