There are a few things that contribute to the popularity of this movie.

First and most importantly, it is the courage it took to make this movie. Remember, the script of Brokeback Mountain has been floating around Hollywood for ages, and everyone knows about it, just that none has the skills and courage to produce it. Even when director Ang Lee picked up this script, and turn it into a masterpiece, there are still Christian groups protesting it, imagine what happened when they were producing it! (Good thing the filming took place in Canada)

Second, it is the artistic sense required to make this movie. The kind of care and effort required to create the emotions of this movie is extreme. The audiences almost all feel the great sadness and tragedy presented by the movie, yet they come back over and over gain. Imagine the artistic talent required making your audience feel bad for the majority of the movie, and they would still want to come back again and again to watch this movie!

Finally, this film also demonstrates true talents of Hollywood actors. Almost everyone is sick of Hollywood for filling the movie screen with actors that have pretty faces, but are so shallow that they demonstrate no complex emotion whatsoever. This movie pulled two mainstream actors, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, and allows them to masterfully shine on the movie screen with nothing but their acting skills. Surely this is what the film industry is truly about, not just another rock fest for teenagers.

This is the direction that the movie industry need to strive for, and only with movies like these can we enrich the young minds of society, and give them the correct direction towards life.
