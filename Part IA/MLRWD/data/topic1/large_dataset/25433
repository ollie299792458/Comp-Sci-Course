It is unfortunate that this movie was not given a closer look in the theater.  Thankfully, DVD is a perfect place for fans and newcomers alike to discover Elektra.  The director's cut is a subtle and yet effective recut of Elektra.  I think that the theatrical release was disappointing to some because they were expecting a total action movie - more "four color," and what they got was more of an emotional character study of Elektra.  The director's cut emphasizes this even more.  The commentary is very interesting - it reminded me of the Daredevil commentary.  It seems that directors often do not have the control that we might think they do over the movie, and Elektra was no exception.

I thought this was very well done.  OK, it's no "Spiderman 2" or "X-Men" but it's not a bad film.  The movie looks great - providing a second disc for the extras means the film looks really sharp.  The extras are plentiful.  I will admit I finally stopped watching when I reached the "historical context of the Elektra figure in Greek tragedy" featurette, but they clearly were out to make sure this was really a "Collector's Edition."  I know that not eveyone will agree with me (based on seeing this product tagged with "boring" by others) but I quite enjoyed it.
