I really enjoyed this film.  The acting is amazing, from Streep to Hathaway to the minor, supporting cast.  What is perhaps the most entertaining aspect of this DVD is the special featurettes included.  While I enjoy the film, maybe more than any other during this Oscar season, I enjoyed watching these "behind the scenes" interviews with and about the writers, costume designers, etc.  It is very enlightening.

For those who have heard little of the film (what rock have you been hiding under?), this is a tale of a young college-grad who is searching for an internship and her big break in the world of journalism in New York City - of course.  Wide-eyed and naive on many levels, Andie (Hathaway) stumbles, rather by accident, upon an assistant-to-the-publisher position at the premiere fashion magazine.  Knowing little (or nothing) about fashion, she akwardly fumbles through the first weeks of her internship until she transforms herself by inculturating (some might say "selling out") into the scene.  She rises to the occasion of the daily bootcamp-like challenges of her job, which leads us to a surprising ending when faced with even more success and a blossoming career in the industry.

This is a cute, humorous, entertaining and well-acted film that is absolutely worth watching!
