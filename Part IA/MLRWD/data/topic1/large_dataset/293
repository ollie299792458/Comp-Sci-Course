My wife and I have been fans of the Two Fat ladies since the series appeared on American television in 2003 or 2004. Their unique manner with each other was so charming and genuine we immediately felt we had known them forever. They are the epitome of your two favorite wacky English aunts...that you never knew existed. Some of the dishes they prepare are things I would never eat, but that's beside the point. Whether or not you like their recipes is irrelevant. They boost the confidence of fledgling cooks and breathe new life into the forgotten kitchen. They are sharp, witty, opinionated, and ever so proper. I think I gained a deeper and broader appreciation for all things British by watching these two wonderful women. The box set is so much better than what we were offered by American television. I quickly realized that we had never really experienced the episodes as they were filmed. The American edit is about 20 minutes long, and so much of the good stuff is edited out for commercial insertions. The box set contains the uncut 30 minute versions in all their irreverent glory. This is a must-have for any Two Fat Ladies fan.
