The Family Man (directed by Brett Ratner) is a film of superb quality, acting, and storyline. It centers around a man named Jack Cambell (played by Nicholas Cage), a man who has chosen a path of monetary success instead of marrying his college girlfriend Kate (played by T&eacute;a Leoni). After thirteen years since this decision (during which time he has become the president of a major investment firm), he unknowingly meets an angel (played by Don Cheadle). Jack is given what the angel calls a `glimpse' ----in his case, a chance to see what his life had been like if he had married Kate. During this experience, he finds out what is truly important in life. He finds what he has given up, and how empty his life truly is. And at the end, he finds that it still might not be too late to change his ways.
  As we follow Jack on his adventure, we are treated to excellent cinematography, directing, acting, and a beautiful score composed by Danny Elfman. This is an excellent film that will touch  the entire family.
