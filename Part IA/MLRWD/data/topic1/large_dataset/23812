. . . and if it took place on a secret moonbase it might have been even better!  (Okay, maybe that's pushing it.)

Ray Stevenson of "Punisher: War Zone" and the "The Irishman" along with TV's "Rome" does another fine job in this as the leader of an eclectic mercenary team in Eastern Europe.  He and his men are tasked with taking an engineer to a WWII German outpost for a grand total of [...], a supposedly 48-hour easy in-out job that, of course, turns into something quite different.

The low budget of this film doesn't really show except, perhaps, for the drab colors, but that's not really a big deal, considering everyone is dressed in camouflage and surrounded by sky that is either overcast (in the day) or dark (at night).  And, of course, they're also in a dimly lit concrete bunker the rest of the time.

*** BEGIN POSSIBLE SPOILER ***
The only plot issue is that the events at the outpost could--based on the movie's "science"--happen within seconds, rather than over the course of the night.  If the Nazi killing machines are strictly just that, then why do they take their sweet little time going about their business?  (This is reminscent of the laser tunnel in "Resident Evil," which first sends a single beam down to slice people, then a different beam, then a web of beams.  Was the tunnel designed to kill, or to play with its meat first, then kill?)  Same question for the Nazis in "Outpost."
*** END POSSIBLE SPOILER ***

Good story, good script, good movie.  If you like a well-done horror flick with science and Nazis, then this movie fits the bill.  Just don't expect any face melting a la "Raiders of the Lost Ark."
