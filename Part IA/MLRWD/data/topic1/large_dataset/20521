So here we have what is arguably one of the best from The Marx Brothers in their heyday.  I'll let others address the movie in traditional "reviewer" outlines and just let you know what this film means to me.

As I understand it, Duck Soup wasn't received very well and may have ended up relegated to the same category as many of the other vaudville converts to cinema that are now little more than interesting footnotes in Hollywood history.  The reason that the brothers' shtick, and this movie in particular, transend their peers is their razor sharp, insightful and completely irreverent political and social comentary.

I recall watching these comedies as a kid on Saturday afternoon or late night on local TV and enjoying the shenanigans and the jokes (that I could understand).  But I really had an epiphany one evening at an art house showing of this movie.  Once I got over the pain in my ribs from laughing so hard over things I didn't see as a kid, I realized, like many of my contemporaries, this movie was an hilarious and penetrating anti-war movie.  Very cool.

If you only own one Marx Brothers comedy, I think this would be a great choice, as it happens to be the only one I've gone out of my way to own.
