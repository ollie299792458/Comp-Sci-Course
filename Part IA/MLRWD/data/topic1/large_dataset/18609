This is one of the best box sets I have ever purchased and these films are THE BEST monster movies I have ever seen...maybe even some of the best science fiction I have ever seen.

Gamera is the giant genetically engineered creature (turtle) created by the long lost civilization of Atlantis (or Mu) who has been revived from centuries of hibernation to do what he does best...protect the earth.

His adventures during these films feature good special effects (for a Japanese movie and by that I mean they don't throw away as much money as Americans do on features) and great writing with good characters to make these tales come to life.  Also there is good plot development as it relates to the reasons (science) behind these monsters and all that they do.  This helps the films to be enjoyed because it allows the audience to feel as if all these things could be possible.

The Music of these films is also enjoyable and I would own them if I could find them at a somewhat reasonable price.

A word of caution these films might not be good for a younger audience as they have some scary elements and some gore.  I would recommend that you view them first before allowing your young monster enthusiast to partake of all the "shelly" goodness.

Another note is that ADV Films is no longer in business and therefore these films and this set in particular are becoming harder to find.  Those that are easier to find are going to be priced unreasonably high as some people enjoy ripping people off so beware.  I would not pay more than $50.00 for this set but that is up to you.  Happy hunting!
