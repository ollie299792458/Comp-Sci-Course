One would think, for the 10th anniversary of this movie, the DVD would be a little bit more special, but all you're getting is a digital copy, a newly recorded audio commentary with some of the actors & writers, and a 10-yr retrospective with the director and the two writers (a measly half-hour).  Any shot with the actors in the retrospective all are from when the movie was being made, nothing more current with any of the actors.

Ridiculously stingy DVD extras aside, though, this is still something worth buying if you don't already own the movie.  It's definitely something that will go down amongst Clueless et al. as a great teen movie.  It's a fun, frothy (given credibility by that "based on Will Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew" line but frothy nonetheless) teen movie that doesn't condescend.  The script is just so well written!  The teenagers are written like, well, people I went to school with (which is saying something since I was in high school when this movie came out).  And the subtle jokes that appeared in this movie, well, it says something about the writers that they bothered with subtlety for a teen movie.  It's this earnest writing, rife with references to Shakespeare, that allows this movie to transcend beyond just another teen movie.

The cast is wonderful, and it's amazing to think how many names I can easy recognize - Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Allison Janney, Gabrielle Union, etc.  Oh sure, it may have been the first big movie for many of these names, but they all showed why it was that they went on to have real careers after.

All in all, it's worth buying if you don't own the movie but is not worth buying if you've got a copy hanging around.  The movie itself is what you'll be buying this movie for - the audio commentary with the actors sharing a few Heath Ledger stories is cute and sentimental but not especially special.
