Although there were certain lines here and there that were missing, the core of good stuff that make up the original story is definitely there.
I didn't read this until college when discussing comics with someone who had read more comics than I had.  Since then it is the model of batman I have compared all the movie renditions to.
The inner dialog, the obsessiveness, all things very detailed out and excellent.

Peter Weller was a fantastic pick for old batman, his voice has a great gravelly roughness.
The pick for Carrie was fabulous, her delivery was spot on in my mind, it a had youthful unapologetic ring to it.

They used alot of the cinematic feel of the original book, with the cuts to news coverage and everything.
Since this was part 1 they close with joker whispering 'Batman....darling'.

The extras include a sweet little min-doc on Bob Kane himself and what a larger than life character he was.

If you are a fan of the graphic novel I would higly suggest it.

The only disappointing note to me would be it reduces the possibility of a live action adaption.  (Oh we did that)
