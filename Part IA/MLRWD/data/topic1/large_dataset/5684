Note: The movie gets five stars, this Milestone edition gets three. I REALLY wanted to like this set. I really did. I still can't believe Milestone/Image allowed this to get out the door. The 1929 print is made from the best available 35mm material BUT so much computer noise reduction was used that fast movements appear blurred and jerky. Yes Virginia, there IS such a thing as over-doing the electronic "cleanup". It almost makes me motion sick at times to watch it. And that is sad beyond belief. This is easily the best restoration available of the 1929/1930 by a long shot. But what good is that if you almost need Dramamine to watch it?

Another "almost win" is the 1925 edition on the second disc. It is only available on 16mm reduction prints sold for home viewing so the picture quality is not even close to the 1929 cut. BUT you get more story detail and more effective film editing (especially in the unmasking scene) than the later version. It does tend to drag in spots though. I can understand Milestone not wanting to pour massive amounts of cash into restoring this 1925 cut, but it would have been so worth it since there are already dozens of versions of the 1929 cut available. And to add insult to injury, this version has "speed lines" due to not deinterlacing the video properly. Some pictures are available HERE:

The extras make the set worth buying, but when you have TWO compromised video editions in what should be a "Ultimate Edition" it just makes you sad that Milestone allowed sloppiness to trump quality.
