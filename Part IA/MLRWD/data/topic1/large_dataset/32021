I love this movie. It is one of the best cowboy movies ever and certainly the best of the three starring Glenn Ford that Delmer Daves directed. I like it more than the Russell Crowe version.  For me, monochrome format focuses attention on the dialog and the actors' expressions: There's no spectacular color to distract from these. Glenn Ford is at his quiet, calm, and powerful best in this movie. He's one of my favorite actors. The story line is very believable. It's a study of farm life in Arizona in the latter half of the 19th century and the hardships and desperation faced by farmers in those times.  It's also a study of two personalities: each one hard, determined, and pragmatic. In the end, each ends up respecting the other.  I think the agricultural theme plays a large role in this and it's interesting to watch it a second or third time from that perspective.  And that's what makes the movie a great one: it can be watched on several levels and from several perspectives.  It's also a good shoot-em-up too. Glenn Ford was offered the role of the rancher but asked for the Ben Wade (criminal) role after he read the script.  He's one of the most likable criminals I've seen in a movie.
