Carandiru was a true depcition of prison life in the eyes of a doctor, inmates, and family members.  There isn't much interpretation to this movie other to say it grabs you from the start conveying reasons inmates entered the Carandiru detention center.  The director does an excellent job picking out a powerful person inside the prison to hear and perhaps help these inmates.  With that being said, we get an opportunity to learn why and how these inmates committed there crimes.  I actually expected to see the corrupt nature of prison life in Brazil, but unfortunately that wasn't what this movie was about. This movie was well crafted taking us inside the prison almost forcing the viewer to show sympathy for certain inmates.  Obviously the ending of this film was surprisingly brutal,bloody, and very disturbing.  Yet another great Brazilian film depicting how corrupt law enforcement is operating in Third World Countries. Autobus 187 compliments this movie...however BUS 187 takes place in Rio.  Scene after scene throughout this movie kept me in anticipation of what to come next.  Furthermore I was actually sympathetic and sorrowful for the conditions these prisoners faced.  There is certainly a big comparison between American prison systems and Brazilian prison systems, but nonetheless I enjoyed the movie and It certainly opened my eyes up to corrupt behavior in third world countries.
