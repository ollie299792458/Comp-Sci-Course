This is'nt a horrible film by any means,and it is entertaining.Having a mediocre script,basically onscreen chemestry of Barry Pepper,Vin Diesel,Seth Green and Dennis Hopper make this film work.John Malcovich is usually an interesting guy to see on film,but in this film...he was'nt very exciting as the back stabbing betrayer he was suppose to be.

 It was kinda funny seeing a bunch of city guys(wise guys or not) dropped off out in the sticks.I can kind of identify with that...its quite a thing to be out of your element.After Barry Pepper begging to do a job for his father(Hopper) his good friend&recovering coke addict(Seth Green) doing the courier work screws the pooch.He looses the merchandise in a podunk red neck town in Wyoming.

 Desperate to find what was in the stolen,all of Peppers friends go to Wyoming to sort out the mess they are in.Diesel is obviously there purely for "the muscel" and to get things off to a good start,he beats the begeeses out of the town tuff guy.Sooner of later Pepper's old man finds out what is going on,and now not only is Pepper&his old man in the S$#!?*$! but all his friends as well are in doo-doo over their eye balls,cause now dirty cops are involved.

 Its a decent film,and given what they had to work with,it worked well.I don't know if this is a film to own,but it is entertaing&worth watching at least once or twice.This is probably one of the more recent films that had the fewest lines for Diesel since Private Ryan.Just about anyone can watch this film,it's not an oscar winner by any means,but it's better than most of the other crap that is out there.
