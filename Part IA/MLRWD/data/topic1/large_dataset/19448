I think Harry Potter is a great movie!  It gives me a good idea how life is at Hogwarts... like broom flying, screaming plants, whomping willow, and Malfoy! Malfoy to me seems like [a] mean boy, but I don't know about you?! And Ron for example is just a scaredy cat with a human body, but again I don't know your opinion?! And Hermione she's basically a genius girl whose secret room is the library, but Wow you probably don't understand anything of what I'm saying! And don't forget Harry who I think is a handsome hunk that saves the day all the time! We may have two different ideas. But it's still a good movie! There is terror, like the hideous monster that pops out of the water, the big spider, and the blood painted on the wall!
  But when the movie is about to begin you think
"This movie needs more action."  Soon your wish comes true! But sometimes it's not the scary parts that are the most exciting parts! But if you have not seen this movie before I hope I did not spoil it for you!
The End
