i actually love, love this dvd! i'm actually buying another one for a friend who has been asking me to get her a copy for months now. okay, i am not a healthy person... that's for sure. i don't like working out, i don't eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, i don't make an effort to eat less... i am not just that person. until i started gaining weight... i became desperate! i didn't know what to do. i tried all the different kinds of diets, tried tae bo and enrolling to a gym... but it just didn't work out for me. i am not very good at following routines... i often just break them and never look back. so i browsed around amazon and typed 'weight loss' and found this dvd. all i can say is that dvd inspired me to have a healthy lifestyle. i actually eat less now, and eat healthy because i want to maintain the body i gained from doing yoga. i actually lost about 5 lbs in just two months i really, really love it. and it really got me into yoga. i am actually going to try and explore other yoga dvds all because of this one. i highly recommend it to beginners.
