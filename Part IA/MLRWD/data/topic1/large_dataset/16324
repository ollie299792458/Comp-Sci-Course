I had heard alot about "Near Dark" for quite sometime, but yet I couldn't find the VHS copy in town anywhere for rent. Then the DVD releases in late 2002, and I took a chance by buying it from Future Shop.
For the movie, it deserves 4 & 1/2 stars, in my opinion!
And as for the DVD, the extras are very pleasing.
But supossedly the movie is not presented in it's full uncut version, and it might be a matted/fake widescreen transfer.
I'm very interested to know wheather or not these rumors are true, because basically, I'm stuck with this version ONLY. So, as there is no way in heck to find an old VHS copy to make comparison, could someone help me out by confirming these rumors?
Please click "Yes" or "No" so as that I might one day be able to find out the truth. I'm only interested because I know that Anchor Bay has released some faulty DVDs in the past with either matted/fake widescreen ("The Evil Dead: Book Of The Dead", for instance), or cut versions (such as, "Manhunter").
Thanks!
