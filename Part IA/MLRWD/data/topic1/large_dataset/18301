"Genghis Khan" is a solid movie, the tale of one man's passionate quest to unite the warring 12th/13th century Mongol tribes under one rule, by conquering and assimilating one after the next. Along the way there are kinfolk killings, kidnappings, births of questionable parentage, poisonings, betrayals and epic battle sequences.  The movie blends some historical facts with historical speculation and outright fiction, but the story and the exploits of the main character never get too outlandish to be believable, and in this day and age, that may be its greatest liability.  Interestingly enough, apart from a side story involving an incredibly beautiful jailbait female warrior, some of the stranger  events have an historical basis.

There are a few twists and turns, but the storyline is pretty linear and easy to follow.  If you enjoy the first fifteen minutes, chances are you'll like the whole two hour-plus presentation.  It's a long movie.  I suggest viewing the film with English subtitles and avoiding the English overdub (it's the usual cardboard).

The cinematography is well done, including some large scale battles and a coronation ceremony that contain what look like thousands of people, and these scenes appear to be live shots. Costumes and sets seem authentic.  Despite the widescreen presentation, the movie has a homey feel to it.  You can sense that this was a labor of love.

That being said, the movie may have difficulty finding a large Western audience.  It's not a documentary, but it will probably appeal to history buffs or people interested in early Asian culture.  The action sequences aren't martial arts or full tilt slice and dice, so it may not click with those who are expecting a "Braveheart".

The soundtrack comes off like it was composed for a Western audience and seems rather out of place.

I'd place "Genghis Khan" somewhere between "Braveheart" and "Patton".
