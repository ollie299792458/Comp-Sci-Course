I saw this movie years ago and recently tracked it down again, since I now work in real estate sales.  I'm not sure what David Mamet's experience was working in real estate in the 1970's but the (real life) real estate world of today looks absolutely NOTHING like this!  I think that's the reason us realtors joke about it and find this film so funny is because it's the exact opposite of how real business is done.  The cast is brilliant and despite the profanity, if you can appreciate the dry humor and 'A+' talent, acting like egotistical children then you'll love the interaction.  Anyone who has young kids will appreciate the banter (just watch AFTER your kids have gone to bed).

In reality, this film depicts used car salesman, not realtors, but regardless, it's funny stuff!  No one in today's real estate market, or modern office environment, would EVER get away with the things these guys do and say, which makes it all the more funny.  REALISTICALLY, if you believe this is how the real world is... you'll hate this film!  If you understand it for what it is... pure satire, then you may find this is a classic top 100 film of all time.
