Absolutely classic film.  Hilarious!! totally realistic.  This is what high school is REALLY like.  The jocks are real jocks and the geeks are real geeks - not like todays teen movies where everyone wears designer clothes, their makeup is just right, and they always have the perfect line on the tip of their tongue.  Great soundtrack too!!.  Favorite scene:  Farmer Ted with Jake in the kitchen after the party.  I love this scene cuz Anthony M Hall does such good comedic acting!  especially considering how young he was!  His timing is perfect.  I'll assume you've seen the movie as many times as i have.. but even if you haven't watch especially The actress who plays Ginny.  She really gives an amazing performance when you look closely.  She goes form being the total self involved *itch at the beginning to just totally flipping her lid (after taking the muscle relaxers) during the wedding scene.  John hughes lets the wedding scene go on for quite awhile, actually, and you know it must be cuz 'Ginny's' performance was so hilarious.

Also the scene at the restaurant with the Rice Checks is CLASSIC.  Great movie, great acting, great ending, great everything.

Also, why are people complaining about the ads at the beginning?  they fast forwarded fine for me and i'm using a (notoriously finicky) X-box to play it.
