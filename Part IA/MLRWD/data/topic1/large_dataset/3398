I've been reading some of the reviews listed here and believe that the problem lies in trying to make this movie a sequel to the first three Highlander movies. I don't see this movie that way. The first Highlander movie starring Christopher Lambert was fantastic, even if our Scottish hero did have a French accent. As most will agree, the second and third movies (with the exception of Sean Connery's reincarnation) were chaotic trash and I've decided to mentally remove them from my Highlander experience. For me, after the first movie comes the excellent series with Adrian Paul as a younger McLeod. After the series, Highlander: Endgame worked well as an additional Highlander fix for those of us who miss the series. Granted the movie played more like an extended episode of the series than it did a movie release, but I've seen that happen before. (Star Trek: Insurrection comes to mind.) While I would have liked to have seen more Methos in this movie, my only real beef with the movie was due to a storyline inconsistancy. Throughout the series it was stated that Duncan had never married. In one episode, a gypsy foretold that Duncan would never marry. And yet, here was Duncan's wife from a couple hundred years ago. That blatant a change in the back story caused me to give the movie 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and highly suggest that anyone interested in Highlander should watch them in the order I now place them. First, Highlander the movie, second, Highlander the series and third, Highlander: Endgame. I think you'll find the Highlander experience much more enjoyable this way.
