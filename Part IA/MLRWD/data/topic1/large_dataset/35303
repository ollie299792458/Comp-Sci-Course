Its a nice movie from 1950s lots of flashbacks here looking at the military career during World War II.It is talky and takes itself very seriously.But the last hour of the movie makes it worthwhile.Gregory Peck  is great here as he always is.Jennifer Jones is the one to watch for here quite a scene stealer her role in the end makes the movie suddenly exciting.When her husband tells her he has a child from another woman she gets distraught and unable to control herself.She just run out of the house.Peck follows argues with her to comeback.She agrees annd asks him to go inside and give her some time alone to recover from this shock.When he goes inside he soon hears the Car screeching down the road.His wife has hoodwinked him and fled.She drives recklessly in this emotional upheaval.

Fredric March is good here too.Its quite an intelligent film and also teaches us to do the right thing.Never be swayed by what others say or your own greed.Dialogs are pretty good here.It was a nice movie to see but I do accept I fast forwarded here and their.
