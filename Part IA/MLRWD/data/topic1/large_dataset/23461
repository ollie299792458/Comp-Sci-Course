Let's face it, to the "sophisticated connoisseur" of the Hollywood movie, "Joe Versus the Volcano" is the very epitome of a poorly acted piece of cheese souffleed kitsch.  In fact, this movie completely fails to match favorably with the archetypes of any of the well known classifications of film.
I loved it.  "Joe versus the Volcano" is my all time favorite movie.  
The first thing I would tell potential viewers is to eliminate any expectations and categorizations, and to watch it with a fresh open, alert, mind. 
The standard movie attempts realism in all it does.  "Joe Versus the Volcano" is an allegory (as evident from its opening scene).  Allegories do not deal with real people, but their abstracted archetypes.  Only when you realize that Joe is an everyman will you ever be able to meaningfully talk about the acting in this movie.  
With this in mind, I think the acting is simply sensational.  If the actors were trying to be three-dimensional, living breathing people they would destroy the beautiful mood of the story.  In fact, if you judge someone's acting ability by how believable and real they seem, you will hate this movie because of its seemingly abysmal acting.  The style of acting in this movie is instead magnificently harmonious with the allegorical nature of its story.
Joe Versus the Volcano must be taken on its own terms so suspend your judgement until you understand it and see why so many people really like this film.  
If the reason you liked "the City of Lost Children" or "Amelie" had nothing to do with the fact that they were foreign, if you reveled in the ebullient childishness of "The Neverending Tale" or "The Princess Bride", if you appreciated the thoughtfulness of movies like "the Matrix" or "Fight Club", then you should really like this movie.
