after watching the film for the first five minutes i knew it was one of those films that would travel through life with me. The sound of Diane Lane( fire inc) singing on the stage at the begining of the film is one that i will truly never forget. Towards the end of the concert ellen aim( Diane lane) is kidknapped by a gang of bikers and held hostage. At the concert is one of ellen aims old flames`s sister. She then sends a telegram asking for help and soldier boy arrives and plans to resuce Aim with the help of Amy Madigan and paid by Billy fish (rick moranis). If you like the 50`s era and rock and roll music then this is one film you must have. The feeling of the film is like nothing i`ve seen before or since and i doubt you will be disapointed with this purchase, maybe if the film had big stars at the time then it would have been a box office smash although this is no bad thing.The film is set predominately at night which sets the mood of things but you really need to see the film because words cannot describe what an experience this is
