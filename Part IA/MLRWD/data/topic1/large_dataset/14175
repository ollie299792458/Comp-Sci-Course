What a wonderfully fun movie!

Here we have a typical teen comedy that is perhaps not so typical. Our main lead is a teenage boy who has superhero parents- a Dad with superstrength and a Mom who can fly - unfortunately as he starts superhero high school "Sky High" - a school in the sky - he appears to have no powers at all. And at Sky High, all the kids are divided into heroes or sidekicks depending on their abilities or non-abilities, and so our main lead ends up in sidekick training, desperate to prove he can be a hero.

After seeing this, I felt ready to take on the world, and could not wait to see it again. The DVD is already pre-ordered. As a Disney live action film fan, I have to say I haven't seen many great Disney live action films of late, but Sky High is a return to form. So maybe some of the jokes are a bit of a hit and miss, but when it comes to the superhero cliches, there is an abundance in Sky High that adds to the fun. Mix in a Dawson's Creek type romantic drama and you have the perfect 12-17 year old teen movie, that's just as enjoyable for the rest of the family.

Also, watch out for Danielle Panabaker as the female best friend. If I was a teenager I would absolutely have a crush on her. Already I've ordered more of her DVDs. She's certainly a bright star and I'm looking forward to seeing more of her in the future.

Sky High is super highly recommended.
