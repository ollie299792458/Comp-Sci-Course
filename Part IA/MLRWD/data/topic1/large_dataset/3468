The movie is quite frigthening in some scenes, and it shows the great talent of murnau and max shreck himself, i bought this dvd recently and i enjoyed it, because everytime i play the movie it i find something new, and gives that eerie feeling of the movie not being actually a movie but something else.
The image is ok, for a 1920's film i cant ask for something better, the audio department mostly... sadly, the new audio essay performed by the silent orchestra has to much rythim for the movie and makes it a bothersome most of the times its like hearing to a fairy tale story, i was dissapointed with the new audio essay because it appears that its going sound really great(mainly on the main menu) but i expected a really creepy music to accent the movie but i found most of the time a dumb cheesy interpretation, it has also the original organ soundtrack, but it sounds different from the one that i recalled, besides it sounds repetitive and sometimes boring.
The add ons where great though, it has a good audio commentary, and several images and comments about the making of the film and the locations where it was filmed.
this is one of my favorite movies and the dvd has many good features but its preffer to watch it mute and playing a good instrumental cd orchestration like bach.
