Seeing this film when I was young resulted in a life-long interest in climbing which has deteriorated to just long hiking days now.  I was lucky enough to work in Germany for more than 20 years so the trip to Switzerland was the matter of less than 3 hours on the autobahn.  I used to spend at least a week every year in Zermatt and all the peaks shown so well in the film became like old friends which you could recognize from any angle. One small nit I would pick with the film was the way they kept showing the mountains around Chamonix when all the climbing was supposed to be in Switzerland near Zermatt. I also wonder why they thought they had to change the name on the Monte Rosa hotel and even the name of the Mattertal.  I made only one serious attempt to climb the Matterhorn but was turned back by storms on top.  By the way, the guided fee for that hill is now over $1,200 as of this August.  I used to scan the TV guide each week hoping to see this film being broadcast so I could tape it but never did see it listed until it was shown on one of the HD channels just a few weeks ago from which I then found the CD on Amazon.  The comments about the quality of the recording still do not detract from the merits of the film for me and I'm just glad to have it now.
