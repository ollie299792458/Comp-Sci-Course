What keeps me from giving this DVD/Concert an Excellent are:
1) The pace on PINBALL WIZARD is so frenetic one supposes the band didn't want to be bothered by it anymore.  2) Guest Bryan Adams commits the unpardonable sin of singing BEHIND BLUE EYES while a way-too-generous Daltrey is on backing vocals and guitar.  3) Townshend embraces too-long song intros throughout, which are only occasionally interesting.  4) As regards the extra features, such as backstage footage and rehearsal glimpses, one wishes there were more of them, but what's there favors the guest artist.  Possibly because THE WHO, coming off a tour, didn't need to rehearse for their own sakes.  But having said all that, that was the dross, and the gold of the performances outweigh it.  With Zak Starkey (Ringo's son) on drums, he's given extensive camera time not alloted to the keyboardist, and he seems to fit right in.  But there are extensive instrumental breaks throughout, including shots from a camera mount on Entwistle's bass.  Amazingly, the power and virtuosity of Daltrey's vocals remain unmatched in rock/pop.  One wonders how he still has vocal chords left after all these years.  A real gem is the brilliance and vitality of BARGAIN and the affectionate teasing between Daltrey and Townshend.  Great clarity on visuals and audio throughout. Only wish the guys felt like doing it more often.
