How one reviewer could contend that all Sally Field ever did in the movie is cry and become overly emotional is beyond me.  Their were a lot of tears and screaming on the parts of both the husband and wife, but when your husband has lied to you, tricking you into a move you never wanted to make and then becomes extremely verbally and physically abusive to get you to submit to him against your will and at times even abuses your daughter, you'd cry and get verbally angry too. Sally gave another performance deserving of an accademy award for best actress. The girl who played the couples young daughter did a great job of acting also. The suspense of the movie left me on the edge of my seat, wanting Field and her daughter to be out of Iran and harm's way. The movie definately shows you the nasty side of the militant Moslem religion. In the movie's trailer Field commented on the women she played. She said to the effect that the women was almost to adamently pro American. Almost as if she was blind to the real imperfections of the American system.That comment from Field bothered me. Especially when she had just played the women in the movie and experienced all the deceit and abuse that she went through. When you are going through all that poor women has is going through, it's understandable how one might see America for all its real faults with rose colored glasses.
