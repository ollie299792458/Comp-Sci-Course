"Life without tradition would be as shaky as a fiddler on the  roof," announces the milkman Tevye. It is this battle to preserve his  beloved Jewish traditions that befuddles Tevye, as he faces a changing  world and the daunting prospect of marrying off his strong-willed daughters  with no dowry to offer as inducement. Topol who embraces the character  Tevye like a child to its mother. His monologues with God ("I know we  are the chosen ones, but once in a while can't you choose somebody  else?"). To his exasperated externalized dilemmas ("on the one  hand...but on the other hand"), they provide the comedy relief of this  serious play. From his world-weary fear of change, to his joyous dreams of  plenty, Topol gives an exuberant and memorable performance.  As he marries  off his daughters, Tevye comes to see the traditions he so lovingly  embraces not as a mountain range, immovable and immutable, but as a river,  ever flowing and changing with the landscape. However, even the enlightened  Tevye must draw the line somewhere, and when his third daughter wants to  marry a Russian, one of those who are performing pogroms on his people, he  can no longer go with the flow.
