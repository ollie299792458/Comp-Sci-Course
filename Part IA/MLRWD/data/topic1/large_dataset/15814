Brilliant. Shame shorona has gone but the new girl is holding her own. Similar to columbo you could say, instead of a scruffy, seemingly 'stupid' detective, you get a ultra neat, intelligent obsessive compulsive one - but he always gets his man/woman. Throw a bit of humour in and some good storylines and you have monk. But Then if you are looking at this then you should have seen Series 1+2 so i shouldn't have to explain. :-)

Tony Shalhoub, a seriously underrated actor, would love to see him in a main comedic role. Besides that he is a great actor, i couldn't think of anyone else to play the part.

Series 3 in general, as good as the rest??? i would say yes! Some hardcore sharona fans would disagree as i know there are few boycotting the show due to the way shorona was booted out, but hey it's a great show, and even though i was reluctant at first i'm glad i watched the last few without her.

Was looking forward to an episode with Monks brother in again (one of my favs from season 2), but unfortunately there isn't one, but i have seen that Season 4 Ep 2 is based on his brother again. One obsessive compulsive on screen is funny, put 2 together and it's hilarious!

Enjoy!
