If you've ever wondered what it's like to experience the harrowing, dizzying heights (and pulse-pounding depths) of aerial combat but haven't strapped yourself into a combat aircraft, this is your chance. From WWI through the Kosovo Campaign, this series does just that. With graphics that rival the best of computer flight sims and narration that sets up each engagement, Dogfights takes you on the best of couch-borne joyrides. You'll probably even find yourself telling your workmates about one engagement or two you've seen, because some of them are almost too unbelievable to be true! Ever seen a B-17 -- flying solo on a reconnaissance mission in the Pacific but loaded to the gills with machine guns -- dogfight with a swarm of about 17 Japanese fighters, yet somehow make it through alive? You will in this series. Each show includes a 'You Are There'-style narrative, yet seamlessly includes interviews with some of the pilots involved and presents a brilliant setup of each situation. The shows are so well-done you'll probably find yourself watching them over and over again -- the perfect reason to buy them on DVD.
