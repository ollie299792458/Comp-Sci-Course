After watching the 2012 remake of this film (or rather, re-adaptation from the same story) in theaters and being dissapointed and almost bored to sleep, I felt the itch to watch the Arnie film, which I hadn't watched in years but I remembered as fun.  I wanted to know if watching it again was going to bore me too, since maybe I just liked it out of nostalgia.  Rather than rent it, I bought this Blu Ray on a whim and was absolutely and thoroughly pleased.  Not only this movie holds up wonderfully, being as good as it was back then and several magnitudes better than the new film with the same name, the quality of the Blu Ray transfer is really good.  Granted, I've seen movies with better transfers, but this one is still quite nice.

The special effects of the new film don't have a candle to hold against the ones on this movie.  Even though it's easier now to see rubber and puppets for what they really are than it was back then, they still look spectacular, and much more realistic than the CGI in the new one.  The script is better and more interesting, and the action is far more well realized and engaging.  Also, the classic Arnie quips and catchphrases come back with a vengeance here, and are just as fun to listen to as they always were.

If you think action movies these days are just not as good as they used to, this is the evidence you were looking for.  Don't bother with the new adaptation.  Even if you want to compare them, rather than watch this one and the new one, watch this one twice.  You won't regret it.
