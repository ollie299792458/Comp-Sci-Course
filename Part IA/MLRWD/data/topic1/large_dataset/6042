Buy it.  If you are considering this movie, have specifically come searching for this movie on here just do it.  I had the regular version, had actually completely forgotten about this movie and then for some reason decided to watch it one day and fell in love all over again.  Went online to get more information and found this.  I had it sent to me in Japan and it was the best 50$ I have spent in a while (postage etc).
The movie and extras more than lived up to expectations.  The second disc has a ton of interviews, both from the time of shooting and the 10 year 'reunion'.  Everyone is classically young and somewhat normal at the cusp of some great careers.  They are casual, cocky, tired, nervous, but at the heart of it all entertaining.  The deleted scenes were interesting to see and in my opinion the right ones to cut.  You can see the attempt to build more character development but that would have definitely changed the tone of the movie.
The book is v. interesting and insightful with some great 'essays' written about the movie, the cast, and more importantly the time that that this movie attempted to portray.  It did all the things it was meant to do; remind me of my school days, make me nostalgic for lost youth and wonder where all the friends I had lost touch with ended up, made me want to ride shotgun in my boyfriends sexy muscle car, made me want to smoke that joint.
The movie itself is great, the criterion collection addition to it just makes it something more.
