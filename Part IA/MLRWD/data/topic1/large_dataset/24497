This is what DVD is all about! A movie I have dreamt of seeing for five years has finally arrived. Before, Legend was good but there was something missing. Now, I have to say that it is one of my favorites. I love the fact that the beginning and ending are different from the US release, especially the ending. I love that Lily and Jack's relationship is a lot more innocent. The kiss that had been stuck in the beginning that was actually from the end is now where it should be. But, really, I don't think that I can catalogue all of the differences but I will name a few that I can think of:
1) When Jack teaches Lily how to speak to the bird there are some differences in the way it is played out.
2) Lily is more haughty and plays as kind of spoiled and bratty, which she was supposed to be. Also, she is referred to as the princess instead of lady.
3) Lily's songs. She sings to the unicorn to get it to come to her and she sings to Jack more than once.
4) Longer dance sequence.
5) Darkness tries to get Lily to sit in a chair that has a life of its own instead of trying to get her to eat the food.
6) The entire Meg Mucklebones scene, which some may remember seeing in the US TV version, is all there.
Of course, there are more and some subtle differences, but you'll just have to watch for them yourself. Jerry's score is, in my opinion, better than the TD score because it is a more classical fairytale score. No more Loved By the Sun playing over the ending, which I kind of missed at first. 
The DVD itself is great! The documentary is very cool to watch, and doesn't suffer at all without Tom Cruise. The two 'lost scenes' are great fun, and it's amazing that they would take that much care to piece together the Faerie Dance the way they did. Ridley's commentary is fun and engaging, and I find myself wondering how Gump would have sounded with a German accent.
All in all, one of the best DVDs I've ever purchased!
