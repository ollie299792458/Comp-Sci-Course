Both of these movies occur in small towns with an Aunt Bea, an Andy and Opie (well, Opette in the case of the Vampire).  These are two of my all time favorite Grade B chillers.  The Halloween Party in Return of Dracula is one of the all time goofy greats ranking right up there with the shindig for kids in the Giant Gila Monster and the gangs hideway fest in I Was A Teenage Werewolf.
At this party, a number of ladies leaning heavily toward the back side of middle age have a contest to see who has the best costume.  (Chuckle, chuckle, yuk, yuk).  I guess the movie needed some lighthearted moments since Opie's kitty kat had been killed by Drac and a blind girl at the Church parish house had been a victim of Drac.
As to The Vampire, a doctor had been experimenting with tablets that would unleash the beast in us all. Seems little, sweet Opette accidently gave a bottle of those tablets to her great pop, another doctor instead of aspirin.  The doctor begins to feel something is amiss as his patients begin to die off one by one, a great looking broad to an old spinster.
Well, hero cop, portrayed by Kenneth Tobey traces the evidence and finds out he does not really know what is going on.  But the doctor does so he grabs the beautiful nurse and tries to flee.  Ever ready hero chases him and knocks him into a creek where a uniform cop shoots the stuffings out of the doctor, who after all was a victim of his daughters inability to tell aspirin from a terrible, aggression releasing drug.
