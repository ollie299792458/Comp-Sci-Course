Call it 3 1/2 stars. There was every reason in the world for this movie to turn out to be a stinker, but you know what, it's pretty good. The smartest thing they did with this film is not allowing anyone to talk, and I don't mean that sarcastically, I mean it works. And there is an obvious underlying theme of the development of a human conscience, within certain individuals and groups, that really works surprisingly well. It is understandable that a lot of guys will say this movie is all about a half-naked Raquel and excellent Dino effects,... and that's it. But I would say that there is no way this baby could have held up so well, all this time, with only that going for it. This movie holds up because you care about the characters and their plight. I should add that it is beautifully filmed, a vision of primordial acuity and menace..... I have seen her in 5, maybe 6 other films. I would say that this is easily the best performance I have seen by RW. I thought she really did a great job.... Imagine that,... her finest performance is as a cave-babe,..... and practically all she says is "ah-kee-ta.. ..ah-kee-ta"..... A surprisingly entertaining movie,...... no kidding.
