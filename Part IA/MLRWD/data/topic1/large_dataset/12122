Wow. This movie was bad.  Heinous.  Just awful.  The book was cute, but I could tell from watching the preview this was not the book.  Plus, with the economy like it is, I had a feeling I'd be irritated by the tale of a self-indulgent idiot spending money like a drunken sailor on shore leave.  But I figured at least the clothes will be fun to look at.  I like the outfit worn on the movie poster.

Alas, the clothes weren't even good.  In fact, the costumer seems to have some kind of vendetta against the actress, as she was clad in hideous outfits that seemed designed to make her look chunky and stumpy, neither of which she appears to actually be.

As for the movie itself, there was zero chemistry with her leading man, who came off as a wimpy jackass.  Why would any woman, let alone two, fight for him? Oh right, he's rich. Never mind.

Also, John Goodman must have helped the casting director hide a body.  There is no other explanation for his simply odious presence in this film.  His role as a cartoonish buffoon father was cringe-inducing and his acting is awful.  John Candy's dead and this guy's still walking around? Yeah, life's not fair.

I'm a chick movie connoisseur, and I've enjoyed some pretty crappy movies, but this one takes the cake. It's worse than Legally Blonde 2.  Need I say more?
