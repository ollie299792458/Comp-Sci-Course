I am a true believer in a strong soundtrack...If I was making a movie, a killer soundtrack would be a must.  Tarentino's movies may be "stylish" with "hip" dialogue, but its his "ultra-hip" nack of picking the right songs from his music vault that truely makes his movies what they are.  Same with Guy Richie... In Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, sure he had cool characters and whitty dialogue, but it was his insertion of equally cool songs that brought the movie from average to "cutting-edge cool."  Pete Wingfield's "18 With a bullet" the Castaway's "Liar Liar" and a collection of oddities and favorites from a variety of musical genres brought the picture to a head. In "Snatch" we find a movie that is peculiarly similar to Lock Stock, maybe too much so.  It has the same random characters, and the same way of bringing the different characters in different scenes back into one another.  We have the same whitty razor's edge dialogue...and the same compolation-cool-various music-genre soundtrack throughout the movie as well... Songs like Klint's Diamond fit well...but as a huge fan of both the specials and the stranglers I was really glad to see "Ghost Town' and "Golden Brown" on the soundtrack... he even includes his wife Madonna's bubble-gum-teeny-bop classic "Lucky Star" as well.  It is a good movie, but without the soundtrack...I've seen it before (ie. 70's Blaxploitation cinema like Willie Dynamite et al, and Tarentino's works- esp. Jackie Brown/Pulp Fiction). You dig? PEAAAAACE!
