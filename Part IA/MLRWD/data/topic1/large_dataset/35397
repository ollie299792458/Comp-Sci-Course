You cannot imagine my delight in finding both "Anne of the Thousand Days" and "Mary, Queen of Scots" in a 2 DVD package...and inexpensively priced!!
These were two of my very favorite period movies. Wonderful stories, beautifully filmed and magnificently acted!
Anne is, of course, the second wife of King Henry VIII. Bright, witty, beautiful, and full of spunk, she caught the eye of the King, had a thousand days with him, and met her doom. I have not been able to find a Region 1 DVD of this movie, and it was a pleasure to see it again for the first time in 25 years!
Mary, Queen of Scots, cousin to England's Queen Elizabeth I, was  beautiful, and determined to gain what she considered her rightful title as Queen of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Quite an ambitious undertaking, considering Elizabeth "the Virgin Queen" was not likely to hand the throne over to her. This story includes a fictional emotional meeting between the two queens (which actually never happened) but the movie-makers are entitled to some artistic license. Magnificent Scottish film sites enhance this movies beauty.
