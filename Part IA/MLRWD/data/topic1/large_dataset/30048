Sex and the City is not a masterpiece. It is not the greatest show ever created. It is, however, generally good fun. The characters are a little uneven at times -- Carrie, for instance, seems to grow very little over the course of the show, while Miranda has a very satisfying arc and ends up a nearly completely different person.

I will say that the 6th and final season is *fantastic*, and well worth the build up. Watching the first movie with my wife without having seen any of the series, I thought it was decent. I've heard the second movie is ... not as decent. But I truly believe that if the two-part season finale had been released as a movie, it would have garnered critical acclaim. It's that good.

The actual box set is cute, nothing to gush over. The extras are sparse, but the episodes are all there. If you're looking for something to keep the insane Sex and The City fanatic occupied for years, you're out of luck, but really, it's what I expected.

Don't buy this set expecting a life changing event. But if you want to see a show that generally entertains, occasionally surprises, and always pushes boundaries, it's worth picking up.
