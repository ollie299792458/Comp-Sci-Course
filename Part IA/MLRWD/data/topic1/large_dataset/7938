I have been an avid fan of the Gilmore Girls show since it's first episode, mainly for its general excellence. In my opinion, I feel there's far too much sex and violence in our world and on television, and the networks have the nerve to insult our intelligence by calling it entertainment. The Gilmore Girls is pure entertainment. It deals with relationships and subject matters in a somewhat realistic manner. Not all of their episodes are tied up into neat little packages, nor do they end on a high note. It is also my way of escaping from the sadness and pain I see around me, even if it's just for an hour. I get a generally great feeling after watching this show because it also shows me that humanity, love, kindness and respect is not completely lost.

I read a certain one star review of this show, so I took the time to view other reviews by this 'critic' whom I understand is entitled to his opinion, however, most of his reviews are given one star. I'm sorry to say his review was not helpful at all, and if I were to make a decision based solely on his reviews, I would never purchase anything. He doesn't seem to like anything.

I'm happy to say that the majority of the reviews for this show are very positive and helpful, and the majority rules this time. If you want to view quality television, I highly recommend The Gilmore Girls, and when this box set is released, you will definitely not regret making this purchase.
