I was so impressed with Drew Barrymore, Brittany Murphy and Lorraine Bracco that I decided I had to buy this DVD.  The story is an excellent one, bad girl makes good.  I have not read the book, but it's definitely on my reading list!  Drew Barrymore playes Beverly D'Onofrio, a teenage girl with a flair for writing who, after a night of drunken partying, gets pregnant.  Unfortunately, the father of her baby is not at all someone she ever pictured herself being with.  In the course of one day, she sees all the potential she ever had--college, being a writer, living a normal teenage life, etc--evaporate when she chooses to marry Raymond to placate her distraught parents.  Her parents are less than supportive and each time she makes a bad decision, she pays dearly.  The story flashes back and forth between Beverly's story from the time she got pregnant and present day Beverly riding in the car with her 20 year-old son.  I won't tell you where they are going, it spoils some of the movie.  Inevitably, Raymond lets her and her son down and Beverly is left with making the hardest choice of all--to raise her son alone.  This movie doesn't idealize single parenting, but rather shows how warped a mother-son relationship can be when the mother is but a child herself.  It's at times tender, funny, and heart-breaking.  A definite necessity to everyone's movie colleciton.
