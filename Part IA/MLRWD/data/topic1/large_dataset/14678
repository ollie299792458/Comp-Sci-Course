Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth

****

When it comes to the Hellraiser franchise the first two are considered classics in thier own right. The more you become removed from those movies the louder the voices are that the series has - "jumped the shark." They are mostly right.

Except here.

The people panning this one are off base. Still prevalent are the tie ins and "Hellraiser" elements from the previous two films. We see Pinhead much as we saw Uncle Frank in the first movies; trying to free himself to roam again upon the earth. We find out what happened to the Channard clinic. We even see Kirsty again.

I will confess its a slow buildup. Once we get into the club and Pinhead comes back to life - it gets moving fast.

We don't see Leviathan at all here. We stay in our realm with Pinhead converting new henchmen (and women) for himself.

What I like about this one is that this is really Pinhead and Elliot's story. That Elliot wasn't finished in II and wanted to help put Pinhead back in hell. Proof that even in hell good is not completely vanquished.

A previous reviewer is correct about the religious messages. Pinhead's scene in the church with the priest was ripe with symbolism and irony.

If you are a fan of the first two movies you will probably enjoy this one.  Only the climax with things blowing up gets slightly cheesy. If you look beyond that - there is still a story here.

More Hellraiser films were made later. This is though the last one that truely ties into the original franchise.
