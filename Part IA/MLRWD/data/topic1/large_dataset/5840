I just finished reading some of the reviews and it is clear and easy to see that some of these reviewers have only seen half of the movie, or were not paying any attention while viewing it.  This review will help the people like me who wanted an honest, and accurate review of a movie they may not have seen yet.
  "Natural Born Killers" is the tale of two lovers who ran away from the unfair, un-cairing, un-loving, ways of their home to start a killing spree that started, and ended, in New Mexico.  After making news hedlines, the two find their success a blessing, untill they are caught and locked up, only to later escape with a dumb witted news journlist.
  Although the film is taken from a story witten by Tarintino, many Tarintino fans will find it to be, lets just say, not up to par.  Although the violence is very well portrayed, it lost quite a few points with its awfull music score.
  All in all, "Natural Born Killers" is no more than a one-time watch.
