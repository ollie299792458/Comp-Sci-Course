Given the fact that this is a Disney film don't you think they had the money to do some decent CGI?  Why did they need CGI anyway?  This is a kid's film set in the middle of the desert, with very very little need, if any, for special effects, yet there it is, bad bad CGI!
So bad that it became the focus of the movie, at least for me.
The story, though extremely far-fetched is good, and has a moral.  Although I didn't realize pounding someone's behind was considered moral.  Well, now I know.
Sigourney Weaver was definitely over the top, but very entertaining as usual.
And before I forget, the kid with the super thick glasses, he was a bully that bullied everyone around the whole entire movie until at one point he decided he didn't want to bully the hero of the film around anymore, so now he's good?
Oh, okay.  I see.
I imagine this was a good children's book, and could've been a good movie, if the CGI (did I mention this) wasn't horrendous and unnecessary, and violence weren't portrayed as a favorable attribute, and the lighting and camerawork didn't look like it were done by people that had never seen a movie or television.
