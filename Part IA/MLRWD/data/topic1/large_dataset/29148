I had to watch this movie several times, to re-experience the joy and nuttiness some scenes gave me!
I would agree with the last reviewer who loved the strange humor and excellent acting.  I loved the story and the music that carried it along.  Not true that the Coen Brothers never read the Odyssey...that was a bit of a joke...they said in another interview that that is their favorite book, and they read it quite often.
Loved the characters, but everyone seems to have the impression that it starred Clooney, Turturro, and Goodman, in that order.  They forget Tim Blake Nelson, who had most of lines -- if you don't count Everett's loquacious yammering.  In fact, Blake's character Delmar ("dumber than a bag of hammers") had the best, funniest, and most provocative lines in the movie.  He also had the right accent, something most of the supposedly Mississipian characters did not.  George Cloony's was on and off, mostly off, although the actor is originally from Kentucky. (Blake is from Oklahoma and sounded dead-on just like my southern relatives.)  
The jacket hints that Pete (Turturro) is bad-tempered, but nothing would seem to indicate that he was.  He wasn't as adorable and innocent as Delmar, but he wasn't much brighter. 
This movie sings! :)
