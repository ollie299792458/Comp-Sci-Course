For those of you who do not know yet, the movie "i'Robot" and the short story collection by Issac Asimov from which the movie takes it's name, are not the same story.  Not even close.  The only connection is the Three Laws of Robotics, and a few character names.  This is not a bad thing, however.  Personally I much prefer that the movie only took place in the Asimov universe rather than try to adapt one of, or (worse yet) merge together, Asimov's robot stories.

Many Asimov purists are spitting mad at this film for not being a faithful adaptation of the book.  When you think about it, however, two major issues come up:

1) i'Robot the book is a short story collection, how could you make a normal feature length movie out of such a book, and

2) Most movies (not all though) do no justice to the source material, so isn't it better to have a completely new story that is based in the universe of the original source material than mutilate a beloved story

Either way, i'Robot is a fun, action packed, summer blockbuster by every definition.  The story is more of an extension of the i'Robot universe, which was probably the best way to go with this material.  Overall, I am thoroughly impressed.
