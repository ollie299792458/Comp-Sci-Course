I don't think I'll do the film justice, but here goes: 
The young cast in this film is very talented and give great effort in bringing their characters to life.  They do an especially good job depicting the obstacles of adolescence. The experimenting with drugs and alcohol, friendship and trust, love and sex for the first times in their lives, were protrayed very realistically. Sometimes the dispositions of the characters seemed off beat, but it was an exaggeration needed to impress the gravity of the scene. Kieran Culkin as Tim is passionate in his love of language and words if tragically flawed. The animated intermissions serve as a look into Emile Hirsch's / Francis' head, translating what happens around him into something he can relate to and digest through his imagination and love of comics. Jena Malone has a great performance as Margie and is vaguely reminiscent of Kirsten Dunst in The Virgin Suicides for some reason. As a coming of age movie though, this one is MUCH better. Malone also reminded me of a young Natalie Portman in Beautiful Girls.  She has a 'thing' about her, a hint that says she's destined for greatness. What a talent. Jodie Foster is Jodie Foster. She  and Vincent D'Onofiro do a great job, but the adults in the movie serve mostly as placeholders. 
If you are a fan of bang up performances in coming of ages movies, this one has the potential to replace your current favorite. This movie resonated with me personally because in a offhanded way that WAS me and my friends. We had the same love of comics and disregard for authority. We dreamed big and played hard, but we were always able to keep our grand schemes in check. It did a good job of putting me back in that place, in that time.
