I had a ticket to see Riding Giants at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. I didn't know much about it rather that it was a surf documentary, and when I came out after the screening, I was completely blown away and on an adreniline rush that I haven't experienced in a long time during a film. The history of surfing was a lot more interesting than it seems, and this film truely shows it. It starts with a very neat part cardboard cutout, part still photograph, part animated sequence that tells the origins of surfing from Hawaii dating way back. The brief history then brings us to the history of big wave surfing and the surf ledgends that started the new generation of surfers in the late fifties continuing until now. It shows how these boys were social drop-outs and spent time being together, goofing off, and surfing. It wasn't a sport to impress chicks, it was an act of rebellion and the adventure of pushing the limits. It has original film footage of the pioneers, all the way up through surfing superstar of the now, Laird Hamilton. As I described before about the still photographs and Animation, later on in the film there are still photographs of the famous surfers who have pushed the limits. The effect used on the photograph makes the pictures look 3-dementional, and really adds to the entertainment of the film. The pictures look like they are actually really moving pictures, they are great. I am not a surfer. I am from Salt Lake City and the only thing close to surfing I have done is snowboarding. I didn't know very much about surfing, but this film is great for the biggest die hard fan of surfing and the date he has that only knows what a surf board is because she saw her dads beach boys album cover. It is great entertainment, and worth of buying. A Plus.
