If you have ever listened to the original Orson Welles' infamous radio show of the same name, you will have to watch this movie.  The story begins as a meteor crashes to the earth and puzzles the residents of a California town.  
The incident isn't given much thought, until one night, everything in town turns off.  No electricity, no phones, watches stop.  Gene Barry, the resident scientist from Pacific Tech, is trying to find out what's going on, as masters' student Ann Robinson tries to help.....predictably, they fall in love while chaos ensues all over the planet.  
The aliens are not friendly.  Their technology outdoes anything on earth.  Not even atomic energy seems to stop them.  So, what does?  You'll have to watch this and see.  The movie is somewhere between a really great B movie and an actual heavy duty motion picture event.  The story is entertaining, and the writing is not as corny and stilted as a lot of sci fi movies made in the 50's.  And whoa, those special effects!  Not bad for an old classic!
