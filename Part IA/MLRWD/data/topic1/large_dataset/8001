UPDATE: Well it seems this version is the International version so it's not the real UNCUT Korean version. I still haven't watched the Bluray but  the review on twitchfilm confirms this. I won't be buying this edition, I'll keep watching my uncut copy even if it's not in HD instead. It's a shame and downright unacceptable to release an edited version of this movie on Bluray. Nothing in the original is so hardcore that they can't release it uncut here. The cuts are short, sometimes really short but they do make a difference IMO. I don't understand why Magnolia bought the rights of the International version and not the original, stupid move.

I own a downloaded version of this masterpiece and I was patiently awaiting this Blu-ray to come out but now I'm not sure it's the Uncut version. There are four versions of this film, the one I have runs 144 min. flat, after checking various sites talking about the scenes that were altered or cut the 144 min. cut seems to be the real uncut version (there's also a German version with additional scenes I heard) so if the version on amazon is really only 142 min. long then it's not Uncut. If someone saw the 144 min. version then this one on Blu-Ray please tell us if it is or not a real Uncut edition THANKS
