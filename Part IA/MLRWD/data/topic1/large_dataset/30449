I just purchased this DVD and watched it last night. I haven't examined it for the problems with aspect ratios and full screen being cropped at top and bottom to imitate widescreen, etc. The picture looks fine to me. What struck me was the mislabeling of the contents. On the back of the case, listed among the 'Features' are the following: 1) Commentary by Director Michael Cacoyannis; 2) Alternate Introduction; 3) "Anthony Quinn: Lust for Life" as seen on BIOGRAPHY on the A&E Network; 4) Movietone News Footage; 5) Theatrical Trailers; 6) Behind-the-Scenes Stills Gallery. After I watched the movie I checked out the Special Features and was surprised and dismayed to discover that it only contained the commentary from Michael Cacoyannis - no introduction, no A&E biography of Tony Quinn, not even a theatrical trailer, which is usually what appears on even bare bones DVDs. Obviously something went wrong between preparation and actual release of this DVD. I didn't see that any of the reviewers had commented on this omission so I just thought I would. Outstanding movie though.
