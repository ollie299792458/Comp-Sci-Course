Basic moral of the movie, in the words of one of the main character: God help the Outcasts, for no one else seems to care.
If you love musicals and operettas, you'll love Hunchback. Disney has really outdone itself on  this one. The music is the most powerful you've heard in a long time from  our friends over there in the Disney studios and the animation is flawless.  Both do much justice to the plot, though altered, but we must remember that  this *is* a Disney movie.
Oh, did I forget to mention? This movie is  dark. And when I mean dark, I mean it's *not* for kids. Yes folks, Disney  has managed to produce a movie that is not suitable for children at all.  But teens and adults will love it.
The character that absolutely stole  the show was, without a shadow of a doubt, the evil Judge Claud Frollo,  voiced by Ton Jay. His scenes left me in awe, as Disney presented his  internal battle between preserving the thin line between pureness and sin  superbly, thanks to amazingly symbolic animation and music.
Bottom line?  Better than that Pocahontas swill, almost as good as Lion King and  curiously similar to Beauty and the Beast. Disney will never be able to top  themselves after this one.
