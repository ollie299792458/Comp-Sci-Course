I guess That The People At FOX Who Package These Movies Don't Watch Them//
Vincent Price Who Was Not Only A Wonderful Actor Who Did Comedy(Champagne
For Caesar With Ronald Colman/I have Been Waiting Years For Dragonwyck To
Come Out On A DVD/And Was Shocked To See It Included In A HORROR Package
Because Vincent Price Made Many Horror Movies The People At Fox Who Put
this Package Together Think That Movies Vincent Price Made are All Horror Movies//Well It's Easy To See That They Know Nothing About The Old Great Movies/This Movie Dragonwyck Should Have Been Released As A Single Release//Dragonwyck Was Adapted From A Book By Anya Seton And Has A Wonderful Cast Including The Great Actor Walter Huston and Miss Gene Tierney/They Did A Great Job In Restoration And The Quality Is Tops
Including Closed Caption//The Package Is A Real Buy At This Price//
I Would Have Paid More Just For Dragonwyck//
I Wish They Would Put Out A Package Of George Sanders Old Movies Which
would Include PRIVATE AFFAIRS OF BEL AMI//What a Wonderful Movie//
And How About A Package Of GEORGE ARLISS Movies Including DISRAILI and
The HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD/George Arliss Was One Of The First Actors To Get An Academy Award Oscar/
