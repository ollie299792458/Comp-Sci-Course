This classic movie adapted from the classic tale by Harper Lee does not need anyone to speak for it.  What I will say is this particular packaging of the Movie, was a wonderful bonus, and has increased my appreciation of the movie two fold.  The bonus disc gave me an insight into Gregory Peck , whom I knew little about.  Like wise the interview with Mary Badham (who played Scout), provided me with additional enjoyment.  I watched this over the weekend with my three year old son Jacob, kids today don't go out of their way to watch anything in B&W, but such is the power of this movie, that he sat wide eyed waiting for the final arrival of Boo Radley.  Whom he calls "Boo Wadderwee". I watched the same reaction in him, that I had all those years ago when I first saw Robert Duvall behind that door, the hairs even today, still stand on end! What a marvelous movie what a wonderful story.  Long may it reign.  A great value package.  Also the post card sized movie posters included will look fantastic framed.  I hope everyone enjoys this movie - cause they don't make 'em like this anymore!
