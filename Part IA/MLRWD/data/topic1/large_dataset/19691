I must admit, the first time I saw Dark City, I had to make an effort to like it. I appreciated its wonderful visuals and its oppresive atmosphere, but I came away feeling vaguely dissatisfied for some reason. However, after a little while I found myself wanting to watch it again and again, and every time there was something more to discover about Dark City. It's common to compare this movie to the Matrix, and while I would agree that I liked the Matrix better the first time around, after that first viewing I had very little desire to watch it again. Not so with Dark City; I've seen it 4 or 5 times by now and I still feel like there's more to see. Alex Proyas has created what seems to be a fiction universe with no boundaries; the city of the night seems to go on forever and is constrained only by your imagination.

I must admit, though, that the climax does not really fit the rest of the film. I wish Proyas had found a way to settle things psychologically rather than physically, but that is a small quibble, and the conclusion of the film still takes my breath away.

WARNING!!! Please, for your own sake, fast forward through the voiceover at the beginning of the movie. You can go back and watch it later if you want, but if it's your first time watching it will ruin it for you. Fast forward until you get to the "Dark City" title screen, and watch from there.
