Jason Stevens has lived all his life pampered, with money as available to him as water or air. He believes that his grandfather (Red Stevens) has destroyed his life and has a serious grudge upon him. He makes a disrespectful entrance to Red's funeral and lazily shows up at the reading of the will expecting to get nothing. However, he is presented with a video of Red telling him that he will have to go through a series of {12} "gifts" to get "The Ultimate Gift". With some persuading of his greedy girlfriend, the start of Jason's journey begins, at first toward his only goal-the money.

Jason meets Emily, a leukemia-stricken girl with a big heart and a smart mouth, and slowly becomes friends with her. She intuitively helps him through the increasingly difficult challenges. The "gifts" slowly turn Jason from a pampered snob to a loving philanthropist.

This heart-wrenching movie is our appropriate wake-up call. Too many people in this world need some unraveling of their twisted, money-lusting souls by gifts such as Jason's. It is a wonderful film that the whole family can enjoy, with well-cast actors that make the movie subtle in atmosphere, and humor spread perfectly across the movie(love the part when Gus electrifies him with that cattle stick). This movie can inspire us deeply to look at the world in new way. This movie is OUR "gift"!
