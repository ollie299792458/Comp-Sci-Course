Hearing about a comedy based on the recent Serbian/Bosnian war was intriguing. Having some Croat friends, and hearing the hype about this film enticed me into viewing it.  I was not disappointed.  This film evokes the disparity of the war between these people---people who looked the same, spoke the same language, and had the same human emotions.  These people, thrown into conflict at the whim of their government are thrown into a trench together in the midst of a battle. 
A Serb and a Bosnian soldier eloquently evoke the injustices of the war from both perspectives.  They even bring an aspect of hilarity to the irony of this conflict.  This film is so incredibly well-done it is difficult to review.  
The UN forces are featured as well, and their lack of ability to do anything during this conflict is highlighted.  
While it is a comedy, this film shows the despairity of this war, it's terrifying effect on people who lived for nearly 40 years as friends and neighbors, and the lack of assistance the UN provided for them.  
This is the best film I have seen this year, hands down.  Minimal knowledge of the conflict is recommended, else some of the jokes and important moments may be lost.  Overall, it is an amazing work, to be enjoyed by all.
