Just because a movie is directed by the same guy, doesn't call for comparisons to past works. Yes, it is dark. Yes, it is slow. And if anyone bothered to actually watch the movie and take a moment to stop whining they might realize, that is exactly what Shyamalan intended. I have already reviewed this movie once. After reading other reviews, I decided to watch it again. And again, it didn't disappoint. And again, I watched Sixth Sense. And Again, it did disappoint. 
I keep reading that Unbreakable is not believable. Are these the same individuals who think Sixth Sense is reality? Shyamalan was not trying to create Sixth Sense part 2. 
Then I read that Bruce Willis was boring and acted emotionless. Again, were you watching the same movie? That is his character. 
Fans of Sixth Sense probably will not like this movie, because they will already have preconceived notions about what this movie SHOULD be. While Sixth Sense droned on and the so-obvious ending was a let down, I was relieved to see a thinking-man's movie, Unbreakable.
This movie is only for intellectuals. All the others, please stop complaining and go rent Sixth Sense along with Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion. Those two movies are more on your wavelenght.
