This movie is just plain full of fun!  Eastwood stars as Philo Beddoe, a for money street-fighter who wins this incredibly cute Orangutan that goes everywhere with him.  Philo's buddy, Orville (Geoffrey Lewis), arranges the fights and accompanies him everywhere also.  When Philo and Orville each have a date, they realize Clyde (the orangutan) needs love too, so they take him to a local zoo.  Philo meets up with a couple of lame biker boys in which he "destroys" their bikes after they made a comment about Clyde.  As a person that takes pride in her bike (I've got more money into it than my car), you don't hurt another person's motorcycle!  So Philo has the "gang" chasing him for extra fun!  If you appreciate motorcycles, this movie has some well made older choppers, back when they had to make their own parts instead of buying them out of a catalog.  Beddoe then meets Lynn Halsey-Taylor, a country singer, that he has fallen for and chases her around the country and more entertaining situations occur.

I was watching horror movies this month, in honor of Halloween and saw Devil's Rejects the other day. One of the actors in it, Geoffrey Lewis, also starred in this Clint Eastwood 1978 movie.  This reminded me that I haven't seen this movie in a while and needed a good laugh.  Besides that, my husband, who doesn't really like to sit and watch my beloved films with me, loves any Clint Eastwood movie and it was one we could watch and enjoy together on a Friday night.

This movie is great and takes you back to a time where you could just sit back and enjoy a good movie with popcorn and a beer and not have to be politically correct.  Please buy this and enjoy it.
