Short Circuit is in many ways superior to Short Circuit II.  Short Circuit II is still an excellent story.  What we have here is the perennial (new movie every year with the same theme) affirmation of the sanctity of life movie.  These two movies feature the coming of age for the robot Johnny-Five.  The first movie deals with his awakening and struggle for a place in the human-society where he finds himself.  He must battle the forces deployed by his creator-corporation to return him to the spare parts bin.  It's a nail-biter.  In the second feature he plays out a parody of Pinochio's Troubled Years as he labors in an abandoned warehouse to help "Ben" by day even as the bad-guys are trying to corrupt him to steal a fortune in diamonds by night.  A robot never really sleeps.  There are numerous corruptions for the young would-be citizen Johnny-Five to struggle with.  As we cut to the chase again there is a flight-to-the-death struggle as Johnny-Five hangs by a thread (a crane-cable) losing power to the strains of "Where have all the good men gone ? ... I need a Hero !" ... Can help arrive in time ?  Will family, friends and health-care professionals step up to save the day ?  How ?  Check it out and see !
