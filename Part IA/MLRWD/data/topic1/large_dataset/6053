here are the reasons why i love this movie

1)it has well known actors in it. the actors did a very good job at developing the characters. it was well picked. u can tell the personalities and interaction between the couple. it was also good to see how they were evolving throughout the movie.
2)the setting was brilliant. it could look like a home to live in. unlike the typical horror movie, you actual feel at home.
3)the terror was there and alot of the time it sent chills down my spine. it could have had more and better terror but it did satisfy my taste. im pretty jaded when it comes to slasher or psychological thrillers. its more about suspense and character development rather than body count, blood and gore. it is also not a torture porn like hostel or captivity.
4)the camera work was brilliant. it was simple and none the fancy work like u see in black xmas (remake)or the panic room, it was more ground based. it was more of a realistic sense instead of flying the camera or goin though walls etc.
5)it takes homage to some 70s and 80s slashers like black christmas (original) or texas chainsaw massacre without over doing the homage to those movies or looking cheesy.

overall it was a very good psychological slasher. if ur looking for torture porn or a very blood and gore type of horror movie then skip this movie. but if ur looking for scares or thriller than check this one out.
