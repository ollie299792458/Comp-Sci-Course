I was familiar with the "ZODIAC KILLER" of San Francisco long before this film was released. I LOVE true crime novels and ALWAYS Love a good mystery. Who doesn't? Needless to say that this film was right up my alley. I however, had no idea it was going to be half as engaging, entertaining, suspensful and dramatic as it was. "ZODIAC" in my opinion is the best film of 2007 without question. David Fincher (FIGHT CLUB, PANIC ROOM, SEVEN) directs this dazziling masterpiece that could only be better if it was longer. I only say that because the movie is so fascinating that I ran out after the movie and bought both of Robert Graysmith's books on the subject "ZODIAC" & "ZODIAC UNMASKED". The film is based on BOTH books. Jake Gyllenhaal (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, JARHEAD, DONNIE DARKO) plays Graysmith in the film and is marvelous as the obsessed cartoonist. The film also stars the always magnificent Robert Downey Jr. (IRON MAN 1 & 2, NATURAL BORN KILLERS, CHAPLIN) as Paul Avery a reporter investigating the Zodiac murders for the San Fancisco Chronicle. Mark Ruffalo (ALL THE KINGS MEN, THE AVENGERS, SHUTTER ISLAND) stars as Inspector David Toschi, who follows all the leads to a conclusion he never gets. I couldn't reccomend this movie ENOUGH! A+
