The need for serious film-buffs to own this film is so obvious that I hardly need reiterate it.  Too many have called it the greatest film ever, or nearly so.  Seeing it again, I have to agree that it is a powerful and finely-crafted film, of huge historical importance thanks in part to its many innovations in technique.  While I still squirm at some of its blatant propagandism, I can look past that enough to appreciate the film's excellence.
Anyway, as to this DVD:  the print is pretty good for a silent film, which means that you can make out what's going on about 90% of the time.  Of course, the recent restoration of Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" so completely spoils us now, with its incredible beauty and clarity, that it's hard to settle for anything less!  But this printing of "Battleship Potemkin," from a 1976 Soviet restoration, remains quite respectable.
My main reservation is the music.  Austrian composer Edmund Meisel composed a score specifically for this film at the time of its original release.  Even though the present DVD version is a "restoration," it does not use the original music.  Instead, the score a patchwork of extracts from Shostokovitch's symphonies (the opening scene of waves crashing is the beginning of the 1st movement of the 5th symphony;  the opening of "Odessa Steps" with the ships moving in the harbor is the beginning of the same symphony's Scherzo).  Great music, yes, but often not well-matched to the action.
