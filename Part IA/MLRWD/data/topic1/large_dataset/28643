Joanne Harris, the writer of the novel, Chocolat, is apparently a confectionery genius, for this story leaves a wonderful taste in your mouth.  Although I have not read the novel, the movie is delightfully rich and creamy.  
Vianne (Juliette Binoche) is a "chocolatier extraordinaire," having the best chocolate in all of France and possibly the entire world.  She and daughter, Anouk, set up shop in a small French village rife with religious zealots led by the mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), who is intent on keeping the town chocolate-less.  It is the timeless game of religious piety versus sincere brotherly love as portrayed in the lead characters.  
Vianne seeks to sweeten the lives of the villagers in town with her secret panacea, especially the religious rejects like Armande Voizin (Judi Dench).  She is a crusty old woman, the antipathy of her daughter, forbidden to see her own grandson living in town.  Moreover, there is an abused wife (Lena Olin), who finds refuge from her husband, not in the church, but in the chocolate shop.  And finally, if this is not enough to drive a group of religious fundamentalists insane, there is Roux (Johnny Depp), a member of the River Rats, a nomadic tribe of gypsies, who develops an interest in Vianne.  What will become of this little village?  Will chocolate win out in the end, or will the town remain a traditional vanilla?  
Binoche is sweeter than chocolate in the lead role, and equally impressive is Molina in his role as the mayor.  Judi Dench and Lena Olin put in outstanding performances in their supporting roles as well.
This is a movie with substance, dealing with societal issues; and furthermore, showing the power of human kindness and tolerance for those with differing lifestyles.  This one melts in your mouth, not in your hand.
