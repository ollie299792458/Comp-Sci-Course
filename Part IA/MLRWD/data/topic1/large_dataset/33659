Paul Thomas Anderson's sweeping story of a colorful group of people involved in the 70's porn business is unforgettable. It will stand as one  of the best films of the 1990's. For one thing he shows us that these are  "people" like the rest of us in their hopes, fears, desires,  happiness, and misery. The perfomances are all first rate, but they had a  incredible script to work with including the great dialogue. The film has  artistic integrity while it pulls of the tricky camera shots, lighting and  sound. If you have a home theatre listen carefully to the music at the  party, in the films first half. You will hear "Spill the Wine"  and how it sounds to someone who is under the water in the pool. Very cool.  But more than the technical aspect of this film, is it's story and  development of character that continually changes as the films spins  through the years where it takes a dark turn from free sex 70's to aids  ridden 80's. The DVD is loaded with extra's and commentary from the  director and the actors. Get this disc and remember: "Everyone has at  least one special thing".
