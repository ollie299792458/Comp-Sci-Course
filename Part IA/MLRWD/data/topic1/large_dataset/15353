Some people would have you believe that this is the scariest movie ever made...it's not. That's not to say that there aren't some pretty darn chilling moments though. Anchor Bay has done a really great job on this disc. The widescreen print looks fantastic and the remastered dts/thx likely sounds better than when the film was released in '81. Several trailers are featured on the disc, and I have to say that they nicely put together, they're far creepier than the movie itself. There is a feature length commentary by director John Hough which is self serving at best. He spends the majority of the movie talking about himself, his career, and what Watcher meant to him. Who cares?! When I listen to commentary I want to hear stories from the set, about working with the actors, about the script/story development. Sadly, that's missing from this disc. The crowning glory of the dvd is the chance to finally see the original ending. All I have to say is, they changed it for good reason. The original ending features a giant alien puppet that takes Jan away to an "otherworld" where she rescues Karen. The special effects are mind-bogglingly bad. The reshot "ball of light" ending makes far more sense. Watcher in the Woods is a pretty good movie that's made better by the terrific presentation on this disc.
