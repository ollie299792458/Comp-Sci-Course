Let's be honest here, no matter what horror franchise, the original is, and always will be, the best of the series. There are no ifs ands or buts about it. Yet every once in a while there comes a sequel that is actually worth the money that's spent on it by the company and the public.

For the "Halloween" franchise, that sequel was "Halloween 4".

The execs. in charge of the franchise made a hug mistake in "Halloween 3," making it completely independent of the tale of Michael Myers. This film, however, reunites viewers with their beloved blank-faced, sociopathic trick-or-treater they all know and love in a huge way.

Following the events of "Halloween II," Michael Myers is in a coma, severely burnt from his most recent battle with his former doctor Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance). While being transferred to another hospital, Michael escapes to hunt down his niece Jamie (Danielle Harris) and once again bring terror to the town of Haddonfield.

Honestly, this movie is impeccably made. This is the only sequel that addresses how Michael got another mask. This is also the only sequel that actually instills the feeling of autumn from the very first couple of frames.

The story is not too over done (as it is in the sixth installment) and the plot line is pretty solid for being about a serial killer stalking a little girl. The acting is amazing on all counts. Harris is, believably, one of the greatest child horror movie actors I've ever seen. This makes all preconceived notions about the film fly out the window and lets the audience create their own experience.

When I was younger, Halloween H20 was my favorite installment in the series, but now that I am older I can see the flaws in that film. It was quite the opposite with this movie, where I grew to appreciate it more and more as time went by.

A great movie by itself but an amazing chapter in the mythos of Michael Myers.
