I try to watch every war movie that comes out.  Some of them have been very good, this wasn't in that category.  The implication from watching this movie is that everybody comes back diminished in some form.  They can't function in society and war in general is a bad thing.  The liberal producers who made this movie obviously forgot how this country was formed.  No, war isn't pretty.  How can it be when people get injured and others die?  I almost couldn't watch the whole thing but I kept hoping it would get better (it didn't).  We should never be in favor of a war and most military people would agree with that statement.  Wars are ugly, but occasionally necessary.  I don't support the war in Iraq and never have.  I will, however, support the troops who are fighting there.
  Whether somebody goes in to the military due to economics, a sense of duty, patriotism, or whatever; we should always keep in mind that those who fight for this country have volunteered to fight for us.  Nobody twisted their arm or drafted them.  Without these brave men and women we would be speaking a different language than English by now.  So, I for one think that we should be a little more thoughtful when it comes to putting out a movie about war and it's effects.  I've known many soldiers who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq and the majority of them come back to the US without feeling like outcasts or mentally off-balance.  God Bless Our Soldiers!
