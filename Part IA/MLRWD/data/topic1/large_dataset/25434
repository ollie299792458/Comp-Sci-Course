This movie had an interesting premise and decent special effects, but all was ruined by a ham-fisted screenplay and poor direction.  Jackman was so relentlessly clueless that it was impossible to take him seriously enough for the emotional story to register.  I don't demand that everything be perfectly logical in a movie like this, but there's a difference between the illogic that is the result of a fanciful story and the illogic born of incompetent writing.  The movie lost me near the beginning, when [* mild spoiler *] Jackman's hardships resulted from things like putting everything on the line in big robot fights and then not reading the instruction manual, or looking away from the action when a 2,000 pound bull is charging his robot in the arena. The obstacles put in Jackman's path were so predictable that there are many eye-rolling moments as the story unfolds, and the big finish was simply lacking in imagination or emotional impact. There were mildly entertaining moments, and the main robot character was well done. The young boy did a pretty good job, as did the woman who played Jackman's love interest. All in all, a wasted opportunity to make a much better movie.
