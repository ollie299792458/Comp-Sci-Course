Very nice movie of a true story of a group of four high school boys in a  town that is owned and run exclusively for and by a coal mine.  The major boy's father is a fanatic coal miner in a management role that believes he and his family live for and breathe [literaly] coal dust for the good of the mine.  An older son has football capabilities and is the pride of the father.  There is no purpose to learning anything but mining.

Major character is consummed by science and the possibilities after the Russians launch Sputnik.  It is an endearing story, well done with a low budget.  Laura Dunn [Jusasik Park] is a very supportive and encouraging character [science teacher] that seems to be the only support of these lads' and their adventures and hopes of doing something better than digging coal at 2,000 feet below ground like their dads, uncles, brothers and friends seem doomed to do.

You will be lifted up by this inspirating story.  Great for family get together night.
