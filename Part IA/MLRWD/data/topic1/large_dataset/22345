I have been a Captain America fan for almost five decades, since I first saw him comic books in the mid-1960s.  I was a little uneasy before I saw the film, as some previous attempts to put him on movie screens and TV had been pretty disappointing.  But a great crew and great acting produced a film that was a joy from beginning to end.  The origin was wonderful, and Stanley Tucci did a wonderful job making Professor Erskine into more than just a cardboard character.  Chris Evans was great, and so was the rest of the cast.  Costuming was wonderful, they took what was in the comics and came up with versions that seemed more believable and worked better in real life.  Special effects were also wonderful, especially the way that Steve transformed from scrawny to super soldier.  And the vehicles were very well done, as they worked from many high tech designs the Nazi's had on the drawing boards, but were never able to produce during the real war.  All I can say is thank you, from a fan whose fondest wishes came true.
