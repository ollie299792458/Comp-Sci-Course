Let me just start by saying that I've never read Watchmen and I am not a comic fan in general, but I thought this movie was great.

Before watching it I, of course, checked reviews and saw that there was a great divide between the reviewers. They either hated or loved it. So, obviously, I had my reservations about watching this movie in the first place. But I dragged my husband to the theater anyway. And I am glad I did so.

So many complained about the length of the movie, sex and violence, awful ending. I found none of it. The movie was almost 3 hours long but I never got bored even for a moment. I liked the pacing of the story, flashbacks and flashforwards. It was almost like reading a book and I love reading. Sex and violence? Come on, it was rated R. What did people expect? Ending was also great for me, true to the story and thought-provoking.

However I do understand those who thought the movie was hard to follow and slow. Some people just want to watch movies for instant gratification and can't put any effort into actually thinking about what is going on on the screen. My husband is one of these people, so I am used to it and can understand the frustration.
