In the last 20 or so years Kinsey's work has been the subject of a lot of investigation.

The main cause for concern is Kinsey's documentation of orgasms in very young children. His works include data on more than 400 children, ranging from 5 months old to late teens.

He reported that children under the age of one could achieve orgasm (yes, he used that word) with the assistance of a partner.

Kinsey deduced that these babies were having orgasms because of "violent cries", "sobbing", and an "abundance of tears". This was all reported as if it were fact (never mind the child abuse). Yes, interfering with a child makes the child cry.

And Kinsey's alarming conclusions about these cries being indicative of orgasm are not in any way examined by this film.

Neither is the fact that at best he could have only gleaned this information from pedophiles, many of whom remained active and continued to report back to Kinsey.

It would be best here not to jump to Kinsey's defense, as if he were some wronged hero of sexual truth and liberation. It would be best if a few more people got a grip of themselves and asked, "What exactly was going on when Kinsey reported that hundreds of children and babies were having orgasms with the help of partners?"
