I went in knowing nothing about this film, and reading no reviews. I walked away in awe of this beautiful film!

Quick plot synopsis: Oliver's mother has passed away, so his dad came out to him as being gay. He goes to work playing catch up with everything he's missed, and his son his accepting of his new life in such a sweet and beautiful way that it's believable. It's no mystery that his father passes away (they say it early-on). He meets the beautiful Anna (cast perfectly) and opens up to her and connects his feeling, emotions, and situations with his childhood.

The way the director handles everything is seamless, and it was emotional without being overly dramatic and in-your-face emotional. It was really touching and moving, and he really balances the humor, emotion, and drama. At first you really think it will be depressing and gloomy, because of the first few minutes of the film, knowing that his father has already passed, but then there is hope. And with the help of Oliver's dog, you find a bit of humor in the beginning.

The main theme is about everything in life and the different ways in which things look, feel, and are defined over different times. Oliver is constantly making connections to his past, the past, and history altogether. I think that's what really knocked it out of the park for me--the use of the past to connect with the present and the whole "this was love in (insert year), this is love now." I loved that little touch. This was just a real knockout film for me, and I laughed more through this then I did with the recent "Crazy, Stupid, Love" film. But overall, I have to say that the performances were the best thing about this film--Plummer, McGregor, Laurent, but especially Mary Page Keller as Oliver's mom. Wow! I have no doubt that one of these actors will receive an Oscar nod. I walked away feeling a sense of joy and optimism! This is one of 2011's best films!
