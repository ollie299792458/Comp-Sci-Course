this was a wonderful show that unfortunately didn't find it's audience. Funny, charming, spectacularly original, well written and acted by a marvelous cast - it is gone too soon. It had such an original look to it that I had to have it on DVD. The only drawback is that this DVD only contains the first 8 episodes. The run was interrupted by the WGA strike and a handful of episodes were broadcast after it ended. There may even be a few more unaired - and it would have been better if ALL the episodes shot (even if unaired) had been put on a single DVD. Would have been worth the wait. Just in case, I decided I didn't want to miss a bird in the hand. The show is quirky and may not be for all tastes, but I can almost guarantee that if you watch the first - you'll be hooked. Kudos to all involved in this show and condolences on too short a run. Lee Pace, Anna Friel, Kristen Chenoweth, Swoosie Kurtz (and her eyepatch) and a hysterical Chi McBride - all deserved a far longer run in a witty, wonderful show.
