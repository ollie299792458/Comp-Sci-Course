The Blu-Ray copy of THE PRISONER is, by far, the BEST copy of anything from the late 1960s that I have EVER seen. As one previous reviewer wrote, the series looks as though it was filmed recently. Everything is crisp and sharp, as it should be. For that alone, it was worth the price of the Blu-Ray discs.

THE PRISONER is a show that is eternally timeless. The issues Patrick MacGoohan raised in the show (imprisonment, Big Brother watching you, everyone being a number and not a name) are still controversial today (over 40 years later). The show is also prophetic. It foresaw the cordless telephone (this was in the days when rotary dial phones were still being used), surveillance (a lot of big cities now have cameras all over the place), and unjust imprisonment (can anyone say "Guantanamo Bay"?). It might be nostalgia for some of us who remember that era, but it can be an education for the younger people.

Pick up either a Blu Ray or DVD copy of this show. You will become enthralled by it, of that there is no doubt. IT'S WELL WORTH THE PRICE!
