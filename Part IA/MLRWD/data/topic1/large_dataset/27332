I never got to see it at theaters, until I purchased the DVD and it was well worth every cent I spent on it.
It starts following the tradition of the Heavy Metal movie: a space court filled with hundreds of strange beings judging an inventor for creating such a disastrous creature: Stitch. Stitch is condemned and ordered to be transferred to another planet but he escapes using his mighty powers and great intelligence. Until here, the movie is dark, Stitch is a really mean creature not showing any kind of good feelings towards anybody.
He finally lands in Hawaii where he meets Lilo and becomes her pet (after hiding a couple of his 6 arms to ressemble a dog, a blue one with antennas, but a dog anyway).
Here's where fun starts and never ends until the final credits roll up in the screen. Don't miss Stitch in his Elvis impersonation... Back in the space, the multi-eyed inventor is being tasked with the mission of capturing the evil creature and to bring it back home with the help of an idiot sidekick.
I don't recall laughing so much in a Disney movie for a long time ...
The DVD is filled with extras with an excellent image and audio. Go do yourself and your kids a favor and buy it.
