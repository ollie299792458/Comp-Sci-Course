If you like tension and drama, and enjoy unique, hard-bitten stories, this is the movie for you.


This is one of the most enjoyable international films I've ever scene.  Shortly after The Big One (WW2), desperate men from Germany, France, and Italy are all squashed into a God-forsaken hole of a South American town dead-smack in the middle of nowhere.  Their only ticket out is to jump in with the big, fat, tough, rich Yankees who'll give them a local fortune if they have what it takes to deliver nitro over mountain roads to an oil well fire.


Clouzot's direction is outstanding.  Even in the comfort of your lazy-boy you'll feel like you're hanging on a cliff with your fingertips.  Peter Van Eyck was the driver most interesting to me, because he performed the whole brain-wracking task with a smile on his face and not a care in the world after spending WW2 in a Nazi salt mine.


Criterion Collection version of this movie is much better than the original.  The colored subtitles are a good touch, since much of the dialouge was previously lost due to white-colored English subtitles against black-and-white film, which, duh, camoflauges the words when something on the screen is white.  The widescreen is good, and the film seems a little cleaned up.


Well worth the collection of a series film fan!
