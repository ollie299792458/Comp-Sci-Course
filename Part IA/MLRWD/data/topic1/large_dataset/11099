This collection is the best version of Challes Schultz's Charlie Brown Holidays:  "IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN, CHARLIE BROWN" - - something  is looming in that old pumpkin patch. Will Charlie Brown receive his wishes  from the Great Pumpkin? "A CHARLIE BROWN THANKSGIVING" - -  the  settlers and Native Amercian play mixing with Charlie's dismal outlook on  life. "A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS". - - One year, I recall a  Christmas where the paychecks were cut. IT looked pretty dismal until a few  of us kids went into the woods to fetch a pine tree. In the woods the tree  looked great, full branches, Christmas tree top. But, when we dragged it  into the house, it was too tall. So, we sawed off the base and tried to  make do. Thing was, the base was the part that made the rest of the tree  look full. It was a great family laugh as it is constantly recalled when we  see this Charlie Brown - - How can you celebrate a holiday by forcing your  spirit to elevate above a challenging condition?
