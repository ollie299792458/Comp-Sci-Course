It's hard to go wrong with the six films Preston Sturges did during his peak period from 1940-1947.  SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS is his masterpiece, hitting all its marks with uncanny oddball perfection.  The storyline of a bigtime Hollywood director desiring to make a social commentary with his next serious project, "O Brother Where Art Thou", is at times outrageously funny and repeatedly absurd.  But the strange thing is how throughout the film there are so many poignant moments, done with utmost affection and delight, that its impossible to call this just a comedy.  It's a film full of heart, lovable in its natural lunacy, utterly delightful and endlessly entertaining to watch, galloping ahead with rapid-fire screwball dialogue.  
"This picture is an answer to communists. It shows we're awake and not dunking our heads in the sand like a bunch of ostriches.  I want this picture to be a commentary on modern conditions, stark realism, the problems that confront the average man.  I want to hold a mirror up to life.  I want this to be a picture of dignity, a true canvas of the suffering of humanity!"
"But with a little sex in it?"
