Okay, I am giving this movie 5 stars without having viewed the '25th anniversary edition' as the movie itself is nothing less than a horror / fantasy masterpiece.  It was released in the summer of 1982 when "slasher flicks" were soaking up the screams at the local cinemas.  The genius of Poltergeist was that it managed to cram brilliant acting, awe-inducing visual effects, genuine laughs, gut-wrenching frights, and a truly classic musical score into 115 minutes of celluloid without ever resorting to being vulgar or cheap.  An impossible feat for today's horror movie standards.

I am confused as to why we have not seen any "Special Edition" version of this film.  Based on the information given regarding the 'special features' of this edition, I can totally empathize with any disgruntled fan crying out in frustration over the bare-bones treatment being offered.  Why are the studio(s) involved not putting any heart & soul into releasing a worthwhile "Special Edition" for the fans?  A scarier thought is that we're living in a era when every piece-of-crap film being released on DVD is packed with deleted scenes, 'making of' featurettes, cast & crew interviews, commentaries etc...

So, why not Poltergeist?
