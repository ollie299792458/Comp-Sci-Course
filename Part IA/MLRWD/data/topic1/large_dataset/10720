I have to admit, I haven't yet seen "On Dangerous Ground" or the documentary, but I have watched the other four films.  Based on those alone I'd give this set five stars.  I really enjoyed the odd way "Lady in the Lake" was filmed; I thought "Border Incident" was very powerful; "His Kind of Woman" was a little long but more thought provoking than usual for films of that time period, and even humorous; I thought "The Racket" was engrossing too.  I'm a huge fan of film noir - whether or not these are technically film noir is for someone who's more of an expert than me to decide.  But regardless, these are great films.  Vol. 1 in this series was incredible, Vol. 2 was good too, but so far I think Vol. 3 outshines Vol. 2.  I've read some negative things here about the quality of the transfers, etc.  There are small problems here and there.  But I watched one of these films and "Mission Impossible 2" on the same night - do that, you'll realize how incredibly lucky we are these films are available at all.
