I'm sure that anyone spending the time reading reviews of this Honeymooners Box Set, doesn't need any reassurance as to the show itself.  What more needs to be said about Ralph and the gang?  The great 39 episodes never fail to deliver.  The Honeymooners remain the prime example of television comedy at it's zenith.  The show, while serving as a wonderful time capsule of it's era, is astoundingly fresh, having aged beautifully. *********About the Box Set************As I read other reviews here I realize that there is some confusion regarding this set.  It almost makes me believe that there is another box set floating around.  Anyway, the one I am referring to was just released November 2003...(not sure why even Amazon has it listed as 2000).  I see that others are complaining that the shows are not chronologically placed on the discs, but grouped thematically.  While that would be a little annoying to me as well, such is NOT the case with the set I purchased...all are in the order that they were originally aired with the airdates given.  Another complaint that I've seen posted is in regards to the quality of the transfers themselves.  Once again, I can't imagine that these reviewers are seeing the same Box Set as I am.  I am a rather picky viewer and try to stay informed...I've never seen the show look or sound better.  Glorious Black and White.  (I will attest to the fact that the episode "TV or Not TV" does not look or sound as good as the rest, probably inherant in the source material...not a biggie though).  As far as extras...not much here.  The Anniversary special included here is a shortened version and isn't all that informative or even necessary for that matter.  Yes, it would have been nice to have more extras...interviews, commentary, bio's, etc..., but for the price of this set, you are getting the gold, which is the show itself.  I think CBS/Paramount realized that people are becoming wary of large, expensive box sets, and aren't purchasing them.  Case in point...Fox went all out in their release of Mary Tyler Moore Season One.  Great packaging, loaded with extras, great transfers.  Now they are claiming that it didn't sell enough to warrant their releasing of any further seasons.  So fans are left hanging with a great Box Set of Season One...with no more to come.  Ridiculous!  ( Fans of that show have started a petition...if interested go to mtmshow.com)  ******All in all, since the Honeymooners only had one season filmed, it could have been released with more extras, but with a show of this caliber it certainly stands on it's own merit.  For under $40, to have the complete Honeymooners crisp on clear on DVD...how can you complain?
