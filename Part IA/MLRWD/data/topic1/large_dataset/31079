I had waited a long time for this. What's really good to see is how well the material holds up over time. Just like the classic Bugs Bunny cartoons from the 40's, these work on so many levels. The innuendo, the cultural references, the style...it's all timeless. I've made it my mission to introduce my wife to the series and this was the perfect way (replacing the VHS copies I made from the shows original airing). This series was the perfect example of what to do "right" with an animated series. It's true not all the characters worked well (the one joke Katie Ka-Boom, Favio and Marita) but the show had enough variety to make it interesting. You never knew what you were going to see from show to show. One one episode you may see the Warners at the height of zany, and the next you'd be touched on your heartstrings by the tale of some wrapping paper and it's journey through the world. It's was completely unpredictable and that was refreshing. Most cartoons today are predictable and bland. The unique factor that made Animaniacs work so well was it's ability to take us on strange and wonderful trips. The non-sequiter facet of the humor provided a great springboard for satire and parody. Characters like Chicken Boo are a perfect example of this. I actually owned a rat (white of course) and everyday it tried to escape from its cage, just like Pinky and the Brain. Basically we all wish we had a bit of the Warners in us. This collection, I hope, will be the first in a complete treasury that will continue to bring us to stranger places and beyond.
