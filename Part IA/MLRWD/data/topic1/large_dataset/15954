This box set, which is obviously designed as first in a series, should delight anyone interested in this great comedian.  While many fans quibble over what's included (or what's not), I say the selection is perfect.  You get two undeniable classics (IT'S A GIFT and THE BANK DICK), one almost-classic (the very funny YOU CAN'T CHEAT AN HONEST MAN), a disappointing (but highly watchable) teaming of two comic legends (MY LITTLE CHICKADEE), and a bizarre ensemble piece filled with the anything goes style of early 30s Paramount comedies (INTERNATIONAL HOUSE).  Every one is a diamond, but some have more karats than others.

  I realize it's a marketing scam, but by holding out on the all-time classics, the potential of releasing Fields' lesser known and ensemble work remains more viable.  My suggestions for the next two sets:

MAN ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE, THE OLD FASHIONED WAY, TILLIE AND GUS, HER MAJESTY LOVE and IT'S THE OLD ARMY GAME (a silent blueprint for IT'S A GIFT).

NEVER GIVE A SUCKER AN EVEN BREAK, POPPY, YOU'RE TELLING ME, SIX OF A KIND and SALLY OF THE SAWDUST (a silent version of POPPY directed by D.W. Griffith).

  I'd like to see the Bing Crosby vehicle, MISSISSIPPI, somewhere in there, but you'll just as soon see Disney release SONG OF THE SOUTH.  T'aint gonna happen.

  But let's be thankful for what we have.  This DVD set offers an excellent introduction, as well as a keepsake for the diehard fan.  Let's just hope they release at least another two volumes.  Maybe even iron out the rights to include DAVID COPPERFIELD.

  Now that would be an awesome tribute.
