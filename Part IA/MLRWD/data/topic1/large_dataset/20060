The three disc set has the movie on two discs with the trailer on the second one. The third disc contains a fascinating documentary called Cinerama Adventure. The documentary is worth the price of the set!

  The trailer is not restored, so it is a handy three-panel source to compare with the new, seamless realese.

  How the West Was Won looks fabulous; the lines are indeed gone. The picture is w-i-d-e. So wide, the documentary states, that actors did not look directly at each other during shooting, but off to the side a bit so that they would appear to be facing each other on the Cinerama screen.

  The field of view on How the West Was Won is much greater than, for instance, that of Ben Hur. But the letterboxing on the How the West Was Won DVD is not as severe as it is on the Ben Hur DVD.

  The sound is great, as well. In the documentary we learn that Cinerama music track recordings were done in Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York, of all places, using a who's who of New York City-area orchestra members.

  During each theatrical Cinerama screening a sound engineer mixed the seven tracks on the spot, taking into account the number of people in the house, whether or not they had coats, things like that.

  How the West Was Won--the last true Cinerama film--has been given a restoration worthy of the whole remarkable Cinerama enterprise.
