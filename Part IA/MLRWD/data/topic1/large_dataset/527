I bought this film after returning from the Dakotas. We went on a trip called the Legacy of Survival welcoming the Sioux Natives back to Minnesota after 150 yrs. My husband and I felt Honored to be a part of it all and took as many classes that we could fit in during the three days of festivities. After the welcoming event we were invited to an Intertribal Powwow at Shokopee. While there two Decendents of Charles Eastmen,Ohiyesa,That we were with knew how much I appreciated all that I had learned,the kindness and SPIRIT of the Native Peoples so they suggested I watch the film about their Great Uncle. This film is so well done that it moved not only myself the "White Women" but my Native friends as well. This should be a film that ALL children HAVE to see in High School. I had to be in My 50's before I started learning the truth about what really happened in this Country. The Natives were not the Savages but the "White Man" has truly proven himself over and over again,performing acts of genocide on our or I should say the Native Americans own Land. This film teaches you about all the treaty's that were broken to benifit the "White Man" never once telling the truth or keeping his word. I ask you why is all of this left out of American History Books? You relize why we need and are all trying to do away with Columbus Day. I give this Film 6 stars and will watch it again and again. I also suggest any and all of Charles Eastmen's Books.His writings have a lot to teach. As Linda Hogan the Great Chickasaw Writer said in her book The Women Who Watches Over The World... Charles Eastmen was to her a great hero like Crazy Horse to be respected by her Native Peoples..I am not Native but I have studied about them both and admire them with all my heart,they were Great Men worth admiring.
  Share this film with your Grandchildren it is such an important film for your library as is the book.HO Many Blessings ~~~~
