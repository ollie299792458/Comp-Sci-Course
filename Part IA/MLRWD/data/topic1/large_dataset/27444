This movie is one of my favorites. It demonstrates through the character of Nell the fact that the world is completely ours to make, just as Nell and her family made and lived their own unique world all alone in the isolated cabin in the wilderness. She had her own language, a distorted version of english she learned from her mother who had had a stroke and talked "funny". Some people might not realize the inherent legitimacy of Nell's and her mother's shared language.

So, her mother dies, as does her sister, and she is discovered by the grocery delivery guy who has to ride a bicycle out to the cabin.

At one point Nell is in some type of court that's going to decide what to do with her because officially she doesn't exist and so fourth, she's still learning to speak english, and she starts airing things that she finds wrong with modern american society, and she points out the general lack of eye contact between people. I love that part. She basiclly points out the glaring fact that things are F'd up big time.

I feel that a significant amount of people in the world today have been coerced into the supposition that the world is not ours to make, so this movie I find very refreshing.
