I'll just start off by saying I'm new to Anime and this was suggested to me to start off with and I absolutley love it. I watched the first couple episodes and decided to buy this. It's a great story, you really care about what happens to the character and what goes on with they're quest.So a little background.

The story is revolved around Ed and Alphonse Elric and they're quest to find the Philosopher's Stone. They lost their mother and they tried to bring her back with Alchemy but wound up failing and paid the price for they're mistakes. So now they go around searching for The Philosopher's Stone to fix they're mistakes. It's a interesting story, most of the time on they're search they wind up in different situations and wind up helping the people there with they're Alchemy.

I would consider this more of a Drama more then Action, but that makes it all the better. You care what actually happens with Ed and Al and other people in the series. All the character are pretty unique and funny in their own way. For example, A Major named Armstrong that's extremely buff but he acts very feminine which makes his character pretty funny. The action is pretty cool as well, especially when Alchemy is involved. The show is pretty smart in the way they talk about science and Alchemy I think.

I'm glad I purchased the show, I went through it so fast and had to buy the second season right after. I would suggest this to anyone new to Anime or anyone who likes Anime and has not seen this show. I've talked to a lot of people and this is definitley one of the best Animes out there. I think it's worth the price as well, it comes with 6 pamphlets as well they give you different facts on the characters and different pictures.

Buy this if you want a great and unforgettable story check this out I promise you won't be dissapointed.
