The Coen brothers won me over with the hilarious "O Brother Where Art Thou," so when I saw this film about to be released, I was, shall we say, excited. Add to the mix the always wonderful George Clooney and the marvelous Catherine Zeta-Jones, and you get what promises to be a great ride.
"Intolerable Cruelty" does not disappoint. I came in with high expectations for this film, and I was more than happy with the result. The acting is great. The script is great. The directing is great. It's just a fun, heartwarming movie.
"IC" is filmed with the same muted hues as "O Brother," and the humor is in the same vein, but a little bit more accessible. If you liked "Brother," you'll love this. If you didn't, there's still a chance you'll like it.
Clooney does a great job in his role as Miles; I think he continues to grow as an actor. After the moody "Solaris," it was nice to see him as a romantic, humorous lead. Zeta-Jones, recently of "Chicago" fame, is, if I may quote Clooney's character, "fascinating."
Great job all around to this cast and crew, marvelous film!!
