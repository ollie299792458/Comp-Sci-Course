'The Mexican' has a good mix of comedy, romance, action, adventure, drama and suspense.  Very enjoyable movie.  Julia plays a wonderful quirky, smartypants, sensitive, woman in love.  Brad does very well as a slightly lost, good hearted semi-boyfriend just trying to keep himself alive while hoping that his semi-girlfriend will somehow understand.  James puts in a stellar performance as the guy who is "very sensitive for a cold-blooded killer".  
I recommend giving this movie a shot.  Leave your expectations at the door and just enjoy the show for what it is ... a quirky kinda dark romantic comedy.  It is well done, combining romance, action and emotional impact with comedy.  
There are some very funny scenes, a few somewhat deep scenes that deal with relationship issues and some dramatic scenes that are sad and some that are happy, all of them touching. There are also some subtle jokes, so keep your eyes and ears open!
Admittedly, there was a point where I felt that the movie was going on a bit long, but it quickly became interesting again and I forgot about that.  
When you watch this movie, I recommend taking special note of the three main character's eyes.  The actors very effectively express their character's emotions and thoughts with their eyes.
Enjoy!
