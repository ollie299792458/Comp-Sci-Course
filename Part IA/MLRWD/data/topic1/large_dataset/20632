I didnt get to see the movie at the cinema, however I bought the DVD in December 09 , when I first started playing the movie I wasnt in the mood and didnt initially get what Baz wanted to do with this project and his particular interpretation of the story. After 20 minutes I turned it of (that December night) and revisited the movie again last night. My wife wasnt keen to try and watch it again however I mentioned to her (and reminded myself) dont forget how Baz makes his movies. Afterall his style is unique and sets him apart from many other filmmakers.
I loved Moulin Rouge (infact I've probably watched it more than any movie I've ever seen), so to the review, the love epic that is 'Australia' has it all, a great opening, spectacular scenery, fantastic actors, an enjoyable story line, engaging chemistry between the two leads, and a whole lot more.
The critics were very unkind to this movie, disgraceful infact that it was so pilloried by so many. Why should relationships between people be depicted as perfect in any movie, afterall the notion of a perfect relationship is ridiculous, some gentle escapism, entertainment on a grand scale, love, pathos, action and some emotional spikes
are all aspects of another Baz Luhrmann movie success. I hope he continues to create movies in his style, he doesnt need any tall poppy criticism, just support and love for his craft.
