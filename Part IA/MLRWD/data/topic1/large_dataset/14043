The Nutty Professor was and is Jerry Lewis' finest hour as a film maker.  From the genuinely frightening transformation scene (graced with terrific scary music) to the sublime POV tracking shot as people react to the Professor's new appearance, the "Jer" was truly at the top of his game as director.  It's sad, then, that none of his later films would come close to this level of invention...maybe the pill addiction was taking too great a toll on him.

From a pure laugh out loud standpoint, the remake with Eddie Murphy has this one beat.  But the original has its share of hilarious moments too, most notably in Jerry's failed "pre-formula" attempts to make himself more attractive, including some hilarious sight gags at a gymnasium.

Having seen both versions now, some interesting contrasts do come up.  First, Professor Klump is much funnier as played by Lewis than Murphy, with impeccable comic timing with his many klutzy mishaps.  I italicize funnier, because Murphy turns out to be the better actor with the Klump role, giving the sad sack professor (this time handicapped with obesity) genuine depth and pathos missing from Lewis' interpretation.

Lewis, however, gets the acting chops awards as Buddy Love, the alter ego.  Whereas Murphy's Love comes across as merely a sexually overheated jerk, Lewis brings a genuine sense of menace to the role-as if he could become violent at any moment--in addition to being a womanizer.

In the final analysis, both the Lewis and Murphy versions are well worth watching. In terms of inventive filmmaking and creativity, however, Lewis' take on the Robert Lewis Stevenson classic is the one to buy, as it offers the most rewards for repeat viewings.
