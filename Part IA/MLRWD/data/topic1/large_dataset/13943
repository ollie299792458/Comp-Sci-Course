I'm glad I rented this movie from my local library.  I would have been disappointed if I had purchased it first.

While the locals and costumes were the usual standard for A&E productions, the story itself was by no means good.  It would have been better if there were at least two parts.  I felt cheated.  If you haven't read the book, I don't believe the video would make much sense.

First off, in the book, John did not witness his father's murder.  He was away at school.  Secondly, the movie didn't make good use of the secret meetings between John and Lorna.  In the book their meetings were more intense and romantic. (John knew from their first encounter Lorna was a Doone.)  Finally, the most disappointing part of the movie was Lorna's rescue from the Doones.  In the book, the setting was in a really bad winter (20 or more feet of snow).  Lorna and Gwennie were being starved by Carver to force her to marry him.  John carried Lorna and Gwennie away on a sled in all that snow and cold, not on horseback on a bright sunny day as shown on the video.

I will say that the acting was first rate and the soundtrack was wonderful.  True romantics will enjoy watching it.  However, I would not buy this A&E production.
