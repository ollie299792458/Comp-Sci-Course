Advertised in the 1949 trailer as the next great drama since Gene Tierney's appearance in the movie Laura (1945) it plainly is not. It is an Otto Preminger exploitation attempt on Gene Tierney's and his own directing fame from Laura made 5 years earlier.

The movie has a story deep enough for a 30 minute Hitchcock type murder matinee that bores when stretched to 97 minutes. I am afraid this is another film advertised as Noir that is not. Even with known good actors the program bores. Classic B movie cop scene where she walks into a room and touches a dead body then police jump out of an adjacent room to arrest her though no proof of murder is shown. This is done on what seems to be a low budget film set. None of the sets live up the beauty of the film Laura or any other good film though the movie is sold as a followup to Laura.

An interesting example of showing the climatic scenes without sufficient build. Scary from the prospective of hopeful filmmakers who hope to make great films since "all the elements" seem to be here at least in part but the film is a total bore.

As a person who loves Noir films if I can't be even partially satisfied they have really missed the genre expectations. Unfortunately this film does not reward by giving you something else. I don't believe the positive reviews. They must be people fascinated with Gene Tierney though she can't fix this "party that never happens".
