Stansfield's squad finds the missing narcotics, but they miss finding Mathilda.  With misgivings Leon harbors Mathilda.
Mathilda wants revenge for her four-year-old brother's murder.  Mathilda learns that Leon is a cleaner and convinces Leon to teach her 'cleaning skills'.  Too early Mathilda borrows several handguns and goes after Stansfield at the Federal Building.  Mathilda gets caught ...
French writer/director Luc Besson ("La Femme Nikita") has produced *a masterpiece* set in New York City.  The film's only flaw is a long range sniper's rifle that also shoots paintballs.  Character development for Leon and Mathilda is superb -- Leon is a professional killer but a naive man, while Mathilda is both childish and streetwise.  The cast provide great performances and Eric Serra's score reinforces the film's drama.  Luc Besson and Jean Reno set the standard for this genre with "The Professional".
