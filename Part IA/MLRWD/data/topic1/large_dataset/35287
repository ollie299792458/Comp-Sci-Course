I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I am a fan of both Ed Harris and Vigo Mortensen, so naturally, I had moderately high expectations. While the acting is decent, the story makes no sense and seemingly contradicts itself several times throughout.

I understand that this is supposed to be a "spaghetti western". Even so, the weak plot lines associated with those series of westerns fail to justify the complete lack of a cohesive story in this movie. This may be the fault of the novel this film was adapted from, and if so, why couldn't they modify the screenplay like they do all the time? A majority of the blame I would direct towards Ed Harris, who both starred in and directed. Even the characters contradicted the persona's the film painstakingly develops. There was a general lack of suspense and even the action scenes were not exciting.

In short, a long and boring movie, with a weak plot, that seems to drag on and on.
Ed Harris: I love you buddy, but please, stick to acting.
