I bet your Christmas plans never quite work out right. The Griswalds'
plans never work out either. Clark wants an old-fashioned family
Christmas. Somewhere between Cousin Eddie showing up and the tree
catching fire, everything goes wrong. The Griswalds are just as funny
as they are in the other National Lampoon vacation movies (skip Vegas
Vacation). The best character of all has to be Randy Quaid's 'Cousin Eddie'.
He and Chevy Chase are at their best in this movie. This movie is 
hilarious from start to finish.
This is one of the funniest Christmas movies ever made; actually, it's
probably one of the funniest movies ever made, period. I watch it at
least once or twice a year, and so does everyone else in my family.
Christmas isn't Christmas at my house if nobody quotes Clark or Eddie
at least once. Everyone has at least one favorite line. If you're
starting your collection of Christmas movies, make this one of your
first buys.
