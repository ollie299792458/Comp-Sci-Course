I first saw the trailer for Shaolin Soccer while surfing around the internet, and thought it might be a fun film to watch with the kids-sort of a live action cartoon. When it arrived, I was stunned to see the brilliance with which this film was put together. Yes, it does capture zany cartoon magic I expected, and my kids loved it, but there was so much more there than met the eye.

There are two versions of the film on this DVD. Although it's tempting to watch the "Americanized" version, you'll be doing yourself a grave injustice if you do. The original Chinese version, subtitled, is a far better experience. Yes, my kids prefer the Americanized vesion, since it's dubbed, but the Chinese version is a much more complete and enjoyable film. (It makes me wonder what happened to the original Chinese language versions of other films, like Rumble in the Bronx.) Watching the film the way Stephen Chow intended it makes it clear why it was the biggest film ever outside of the United States.
