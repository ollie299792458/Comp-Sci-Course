Occasionally, there's a book or a film that reduces us to the iteration of the most overused superlatives in the language, that robs us of our wonted articulacy and compels us to elate exclamations of praise.  "Wait Until Dark" is one such masterwork.

Alan Arkin's sinister character, and Audrey Hepburn's unbreakably fragile blind woman, are two of the best performances in cinematic history.  The script is marvellously devoid of tawdriness, of slackness, of shabbiness, and of gratuitous violence (though violence, implicit and explicit, does exist).

The action occurs in a Greenwich Village apartment, for the most part.  Three men, led by the bullying Arkin, are convinced that the Hendrixes (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. and Audrey Hepburn) have come into possession of a doll that has been stuffed with narcotics.  These men (Richard Crenna pretending to be a friend of Audrey's absent husband, Jack Weston impersonating a police sergeant) orchestrate an elaborate charade to distract, and to menace, Suzy Hendrix into revealing the whereabouts of the doll.

Crucial to the plot is a young neighbour of the Hendrixes named Gloria (played by Julie Herron, with sufficient skill as to make us wonder about her other work in films).

Are there flaws?  Very few indeed.  The streets of Greenwich Village are curiously unpopulous at all hours of the day, and Arkin's disguises are superfluous (Audrey's character being blind), except inasmuch as they entertain the audience.

Arkin's casual, almost insouciant, sadism is an exquisite piece of acting (somewhat different from the affable Judge Rifkind of A&E's "100 Centre Street," but no less deserving of acclaim!); and Audrey Hepburn's Suzy is so compelling that we begin to perceive a small injustice in the fact that 1967's Best Actress Oscar went to "the other Hepburn" (for "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner").  Yes, please do see this film!
