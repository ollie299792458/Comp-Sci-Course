The point of this movie is the opposite of what it purports to be.  `Bang Bang You're Dead' was clearly designed to pollute innocent minds.  It pretends to have a morally uplifting message.  But nothing could be further from the truth.  In case you are na√Øve about what is going on in the world; there is a network of criminals who control the media.  This network of criminals is focused on corrupting the minds of innocent children.  They are trying to create chaos in the world.  This movie, among other things, is telling children that one possible reaction to being bullied at school is to kill people.  These criminal filmmakers get away with this type of message by pretending to say, "Killing people is a bad idea."  In reality, the point of the film is to put the idea into the minds of children that killing people is an option.

Putting this type of imagery into the mind of a child is criminal behavior.  "Teachers" who are having their students watch this film should be arrested for child abuse.  Word
