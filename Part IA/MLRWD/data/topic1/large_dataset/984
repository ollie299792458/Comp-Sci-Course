I was only able to see up to Eddie meeting the second person in heaven due to a mal-functioning DVD, however, what I did see had tears flowing down my cheeks, and my heart filled with what really matters in life, and this is our hearts, our motives, our good deeds, and how much they really do matter.

I sat and cried, realizing yet again, that our life is much more than outer striving for things or positions. Our life matters and truly makes a difference when it comes from our hearts, and the difference we make for others - that is all that matters.

The film had superior acting, the directing was impeccable, and the cast were so real in living out the roles they played, they deserve Oscars for their performances. The film did transport me into the reality I watched, and it genuinely had an enormous impact on me. From what I was able to watch - it deserves 10 stars!
