Hitchcock's masterpeice is by far the best mystery film ever made and one of the best movies of all time period. It is superb in every aspect. The score is haunting and suspenseful, one of the best ever recorded. The acting hits dead on. Anthony Perkins is brilliant as Norman Bates; he makes you care about the character and be terrified by him at the same time. His performance brings acting to a whole new level. Janet Leigh is also terrific, as are John Gavin, Vera Miles and the rest of the cast. Joseph Stefano's script is very smart and occasionally witty, and John Russell's cinematography is extraordinary. This film also contains the best story twist ever in a movie, (Marion's death),which is also one of the best deaths on screen ever. All of the great acting, dialogue, and direction lead up to an ending that is still amazing, shocking, and scary 40 years after the film's initial release. The special features are interesting and very insightful. This DVD is an essential addition to any serious movie fan's collection.
