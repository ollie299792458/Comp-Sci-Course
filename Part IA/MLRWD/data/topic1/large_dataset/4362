I have read almost all of Dave Hunt's nonfiction books, and this is one of his most interesting.  This is a fascinating expose of the Catholic Church, especially if you have never read about the differences between Catholocism and Protestantism.  
I wish Dave would write more about Reformed theology; having read nearly all of his nonfiction books, I remained completely unaware that free will was a contentious issue that was used to create and break away the Protestant tradition from Catholocism.  To provide that background, a starting place is Sproul's Willing to Believe: The Controversy over Free Will.  
A book even more focused on issues such as free will in the Protestant/Catholic divide is The Roman Catholic Controversy: Catholics &amp; Protestants -- Do the Differences Still Matter?, by James R. White.  I read Hunt's book and these two books cover to cover.  Don't make the mistake I did and limit yourself to reading books about Christianity by one author, such as Hunt.  
An especially good remedy to break away from the limitation of having just one perspective on Christianity is to read a couple of general histories of Christianity (search on "history of Christianity").  This will provide perspectives and background on the Reformation that you won't get from reading Hunt's book, which only provides a Fundamentalist Prophecy perspective.
Hunt is the voice of scholarly American fundamentalist Protestantism. He is a careful and consistent fundamentalist; he is not vague. He accepts supernaturalism as a starting point, and builds rationally and clearly on that basis, such as accepting the existence of spirit creatures. 
This is a great introduction to Catholic history and doctrine and shows what a tremendous step forward Luther brought, though Protestantism still retains a lot of the Catholic orthodox supernaturalist Literalist reading of the Bible.
