When this movie first came out, I saw it in the theater and it immediately became a favorite.  I was a junior in high school (blush) but even now as an adult and a mom, I still love this movie and that I can share it with my daughters.  It's a timeless story, with wonderful music.  My only concern is that now, as a mother, I notice the scariness of Ursula, the Sea Witch, more than I did as a non-mother.  My 6 yr old immediately decided upon seeing and hearing Ursula that she was bad, and was anxious whenever she came into a scene.  It was a little disconcerting to see her agitated like that, but with some discussion, she's fine.  If you've never seen the movie or your child has never seen it, make sure they're OK during the Ursula scenes.  And be aware that there's a literally explosive death scene near the end, where Ursula is jabbed by a boat's sharp front and she explodes into chum.  I hadn't remembered it being quite that "graphic" and again, had to reassure my 6 yr old that mean old Ursula wasn't going to hurt anyone again.
