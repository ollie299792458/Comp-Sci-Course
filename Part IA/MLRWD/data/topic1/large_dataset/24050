Somewhere in Time is my favorite 'romance genre' film.  It is perfectly cast and superbly acted.  It is not just a 'chick flick' as some others have said.  I say this partly because, although it may be considered overly sappy, this love story is told almost completely from the man's point of view.

IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS FILM -- please beware of SPOILERS WITHOUT WARNING in many of the comments!  (In fact, a few of them tell you practically every plot point and then say they don't want to spoil the ending for you -- but by then they might as well have finished!)  If you read through even the first few pages of comments, there won't be much you don't know by the time you actually view the film. :(

If you've never seen this film, please -- do yourself a favor and go rent it without having read any other comments :)  The collector's edition is worth the extra money.  Included is a very well crafted documentary on the making of the film.

Also -- the film has its own 'fan appreciation society'.  The website is easily found through any search engine... it ends with 'tv' (I'd give the URL but it's against Amazon guidelines).
