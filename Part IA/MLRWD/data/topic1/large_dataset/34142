You gotta love this series, if you watch ANY television at all!  My family has been hooked on "Lost," ever since we discovered the fun of the series when I purchased Season 1 late in 2006.  Even though we have watched most of the shows on television when they were aired ever since, we have still looked forward to the clean, fresh DVD's (commercial free!) to tell the story even better.

Season 5 doesn't disappoint at all, as far as the story line goes.  In some ways, it is the most unpredictable and the most imaginative of all.  And some of those questions that have been nagging us start to get answered.  And despite what the writers may say, I STILL think that they are ALL in purgatory.

However, there are a few things that cause me to lower my rating of this particular purchase.  First, the number of episodes in an otherwise-full season is disappointing.  I feel a little cheated that it stops at 16 (or 17, depending on how you count).  But that's the way it is.

The packaging leaves much to be desired.  First, there is absolutely nothing, in terms of an episode guide in the box ... only numbers and titles.  But most of all, WHY oh WHY did they change the package?  Now I have 4 seasons that match, and a 5th one that does not.  Makes me think that the producers know that there are those of us who are so obsessive that the fail-to-match boxes will lead us to go back out and buy the entire series again, when it is produced in one box after the final season!!

Seems to be a small thing, but it bugs me and I just had to tell about that!  Otherwise ... enjoy this show!
