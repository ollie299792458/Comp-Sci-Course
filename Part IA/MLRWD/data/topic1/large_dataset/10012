I read some of the customer reviews of this movie and had to write my two-cents worth. The reviews only show that the old adage, "In matters of taste, there can be no argument" is all too true. I loved this movie!! It has stayed with me for days and is a work of art, that all involved in making it, can be proud of.  Full of warmth, humor, compassion, intelligence, and wonderful music, it works on many levels to produce a beautiful film. I am amazed at all the subtle details that were put into the film, like little treasures, for the audience. The acting, across the board, is masterful, and all aspects of the film are presented with clarity and loving care.
I'm not a blue grass or country and western music follower, but I loved the music in this film. I hope more movies of this quality are made, and that the director and cast are not put off by those who didnt tune into what they so beautifully did. Believe me, many did and said, "Wow." It made my day and my week. Thanks for a wonderful movie. It is one I will go to when I need to refresh my spirits.
