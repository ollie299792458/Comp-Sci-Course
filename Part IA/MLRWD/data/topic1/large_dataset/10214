First and foremost I have to say that the actors in this movie were definitely above average. And the beginning of the movie was very very good, it brought you in and really sold you the emotions and feelings. The ending however could have been done better. It was very rushed and so unlike the authenticity of the beginning. It made me wonder whether they just went too trigger happy at showing the evil vices of human culture.

The way it was ended made me want to rewrite the script. There wasn't enough build of the relationship between the monster and Beatrice like they led up to in the beginning. Instead they decided to pursue insignificant story lines (like them getting famous) that did not help the movie at all. They could have conveyed the same message they were going for if they had continued in building the relationship, and it would have been much better and less immature.

I did however enjoy the role of the Scientist, and his thought provoking speeches, even though he didn't show up until the end. Hopefully people who watch this can grasp the concepts that he portrayed, because they were all true.

And in the very end where it all blacked out was very typical, trying to hard to make a dramatic farewell. It fit but I wish they had done it a different way.

I liked the movie as it tried to get the viewer to think about the downfalls of society and the evils of human existence and I enjoyed the characters, but in the end it tried to hard. Less is more sometimes.
