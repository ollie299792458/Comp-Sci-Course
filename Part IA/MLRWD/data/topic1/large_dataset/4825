This film is an absolute masterpiece!  There is such depth and affirmation to the teacher and to all those who appear in the film.  It is a common theme - striving to reach underserved or overlooked children - to light the fire of wanting to learn and finding the bright potential in each one. George Lopez is a remarkably adept teacher who doesn't need the latest gadgets to create lessons that connect with each child. Patience, courtesy, a master guide's knowledge of the steps necessary for understanding are his tools, and he is a master craftsman.  It is one human really reaching out and touching the heart of another in ways that will change lives, ways that lift the very spirit of each child. How very many seeds he has sown! What marvels will they reap? What a gift this teacher and all who strive like him are to every student and community!  It reminds you what a difference personal dedication and an inspired noble soul can make in a world all to fascinated by technology and temporal glittery things. Spoken words and questions. Handwritten lessons. Yet they are so profound. This is what education and the vocation of teaching should return to - what we desperately need to hold on to lest we lose our very humanity.
