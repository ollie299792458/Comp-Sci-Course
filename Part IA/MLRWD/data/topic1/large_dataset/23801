First of the Vacation movies is by far the best. Truly original and very funny. I was laughing so hard the first time I saw this I hurt myself. Film chronicles the summer vacation of Clark Griswald and family on their sojourn from Chicago--the Windy City--to WallyWorld, California--a ficticious amusement park, sort of a cross between Disneyland and 6 Flags Magic Mountain (where the park sequences were filmed). The hard working and earnest Clark decides to take his family in the "family truckster" to California, making the pilgrimage to everyone's favorite amusement park, WallyWorld. Every calamity imaginable happens along the way, e.g., wife Bev Dangelo loses her suitcase containing birth control devices, an aunt dies, the aunt's poor dog is left tied to the back of the car, the car is wrecked. However, along the way we get to see Bev Dangelo naked in the shower, Clark's fling with Christie Brinkley, and many historic and amusing sites along the way. John Candy has a great cameo at the end of the film. Film is funny from beginning to end.
