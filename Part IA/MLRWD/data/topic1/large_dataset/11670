I'm writing for two reasons.

The first is that this movie is, I think, in class by itself (or a least a very small class).  It is truly unique and cuts across several genres effectively.  I do understand that not everyone likes or loves it as much as I do, but for those who have not seen it - ignore the negative reviews.  Rent it, buy it, or borrow it from a friend or your library.  My guess is that if you watch the first 15 minutes you'll know if it's your kind of film.

The second reason is to alert potential buyers to one of my favorite features on the Special Edition version (the one with a red stripe at the top of the cover).  The feature is the 'Isolated Music Score with Highlights'.  This is the entire music score (not snippets) at normal volume of the entire film with the scenes from the movie playing at the same time.  Just music and the movie with no dialogue heard.  This is the only film I've ever run across that has this feature, although there are no doubt others.  I couldn't find reference to it in any reviews or descriptions on Amazon or IMD.  Maybe I missed it, but I really wanted folks to know.

I don't if it was a discontinued feature on more recent DVDs, and I hope not.  I also have no idea what the difference is between the Special Edition and the Deluxe addition, and would love to know if the Deluxe is worth purchasing.
