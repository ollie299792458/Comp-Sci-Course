I think the creators of this movie had it clear in their minds they were making an unapologetic "guy film," and therefore the result is an unconfused and satisfying film for guys, in the tradition of James Bond.

The good guy is clearly good (and omnipotent, or nearly so), the bad guys are clearly those who need to be defeated. There is a pretty and buxom young girl (Laura San Giacomo), plenty of guns, and "good" violence, i.e., good triumphing over evil. We guys are not complicated. Give us guns, girls, a good war, and hey, we're satisfied (a cold beer doesn't hurt, either).

The introduction of a new twist on the Western theme by taking it to Australia works well. Giving Quigley's Sharp's rifle star quality, and portraying the Aborigines as noble savages just works. This is a satisfying movie.

Alan Rickman, as arch-meanie Elliot Marston, is very strong in his role as a villain who is not without virtue; he is smart and cunning and also good with a six-gun -- good enough to be second best -- but he is not a depraved psycho. He is a man who is fatally flawed; this adds plausibility to the story.

If you're an RBAM (Red-Blooded American Male), you'll probably like this movie. I recommend it.
