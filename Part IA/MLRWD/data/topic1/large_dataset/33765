I have to admit, some people won't find this movie as funny as I did because you have to be capable of appreciating gay humor to fully appreciate the gags in this movie.

There are a lot of back-stabbing to get ahead references in this movie, it focuses on access to movie star interviews by entertainment critics and the level of debasing some people will stoop to just to get access to a career boosting interview with an up & coming star.

There's also a few references to high-ranking associates stealing the talking points of underlings to get in good with the editor, (boss).

I won't give away the ending as it is predictable, but not nearly as predictable if you assume that the main character swings the way his office staff jokes about him swinging.

A key line for me in this movie is where the main character was put off by a higher ranking associate who was arrogant about comparing their personalities with how they interacted within the office setting: "When you chat up the staff, it's sexual harassment, when I do it, it's considered flirting".
