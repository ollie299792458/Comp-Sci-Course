I have seen each of the main characters shine in comedic roles before, but the script for this film was highly lacking and so were their performances. A couple reviewers said "laughed til I cried" or "hilarious"-- what movie did you watch?  I mean, I am being completely earnest right now when I say those viewers must have been drinking heavily or smoking some really interesting things before watching this. I read mixed reviews beforehand, so I knew it might not be great--but I really wasn't prepared for how much I would actually hate it.

Let me just say, I am not a comedy snob. I laugh at everything. I'm rarely offended. Also, I watch SNL, which is why I love Jason Sudeikis, but this movie just fell short at every angle. What could have been a clever plot that set up loads of hilarious situations was instead boring, slow, and unimaginative. I constantly felt like I was waiting for something funny to happen, but it NEVER did. The lackluster dialogue between actors Wilson and Sudeikis truly let me down the most. Each attempt to be funny morphed into something disgusting(once again, not offended by this, just revealing that you should expect projectile diarrhea.) Only it wasn't funny-gross, it was just sad-gross--like watching Kathy Griffin live life on the D-list...and that analogy directly correlates to the movie, in case you do in fact, watch it.

That's all I'm saying: Drink alcohol in advance, watch a really sad movie first so this one actually seems funny in comparison, or remember Kathy Griffin. D-list. You've been warned.
