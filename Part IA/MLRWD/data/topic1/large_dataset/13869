It's a B&W period piece film made after WWII about WWI (just as M*A*S*H was after Vietnam), but it's based on a 2nd tier of great literature <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400034205">The Razor's Edge</a>.  See also a remake by of all people the former comedian Bill Murray (former as in before his remake) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069HYF">The Razor's Edge</a>.  Some people might regard the acting as a little stuffy, and the kinds of people they are portraying (upper class) as stuffy; look past that.  Also look past the English actors made up to look like Indians (the subcontinent).  This was the kind of film making done in that era.  This contrasts with earlier musicals or even dramas like Bogart's.  It's not a great film, but for its time, it tries to open the eyes of Larry Darrow.  As all the principals who made the film have all passed on, the extra audio track has 2 reviewers comment on the good and bad points of the film as well as some history around the film. It's a good period film in its way, and I have to say that it and a number of other films (e.g., the King Solomon's Mines film to the Indiana Jones films) gave me a finer appreciation not only to the evolution of film making but also acting.
