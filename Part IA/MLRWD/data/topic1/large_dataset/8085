Degeneration is a more or less standalone story set in the universe of the Resident Evil/Biohazard video games (as opposed to the Milla Jovovich films). Series standbys Leon and Claire must escape from an airport that becomes overrun from the walking dead, then investigate the larger conspiracy surrounding the zombie attack. There are some subplots involving expendable army mooks and a highly suspect senator, but this is secondary to the hardcore zombie mayhem, which ranges from the predictable (oh no a zombie ambushed the soldier who just finished shooting up all the zombies) to the awesome (plane crash where the plane releases hordes of the walking dead; a collapsing mad science fortress full of monsters). Fans of the games will enjoy some inside jokes- Claire sets off to battle zombies with an umbrella corporation promotional umbrella, and a frustrated Leon channels many gamers' frustration when he delivers a lecture about the importance of saving ammunition.

The real weak point of this movie is the CG. Structures and machinery look quite good, and the special effects such as smoke and fire are well realized, but the characters look cartoony in a way that doesn't fit the realism of the rest of the film, and their motion is jerky and unrealistic, probably as a result of only partial motion capture. The end result looks less like a movie, and more like a speedrun of an unreleased Resident Evil game, albeit one with a great lighting engine.

PROS
-Above average zombie thriller plot that meshes nicely with the games
-Some good action setpieces
-Stuff that isn't people looks pretty good

CONS
-Wacky looking characters make this film look cheaper than it probably was
-Some voice acting is pretty flat

STUFF TO WATCH FOR
-Everyone bitten by a zombie in this film becomes a zombie themselves. If that's how the T virus works, I'm not sure how I made it through the first 3 games as a human being.
-During the flashback to the events of the early games, Leon and Clare turn in place without moving their legs at all while fighting zombies (like in the games). I don't know if this is intentional.
