I'm a long-time fan of the original Broadway musical, so I kept noticing the differences between the versions.  This does not make the movie any less excellent; its medium is different and some sacrifices have to be made to appeal to a larger audience.  For example, Judge Turpin is shown to be much more openly perverse in the movie rather than the musical, and his piousness is downplayed to make him more of a cheer-when-the-bad-guy-gets-it villain (note that, in the musical, Turpin plays Peeping Tom on his ward even has he's /flagellating himself/ asking for forgiveness from God, making him look more like a tortured soul).  Other than the requisite simplifications to prevent it from taking three hours, the movie stands well on its own with a darker, grittier take; there's definitely more 'dark' than 'comedy' here.  Johnny Depp has been rightfully praised for his performance; his decision to attempt more of a punk rock angle rather than an operatic singer certainly plays to the strengths in his voice and actually strengthens the character as well, given how he manages to spit out lyrics drenched with hate and revenge... musically.
