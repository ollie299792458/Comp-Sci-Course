The movie itself is good, in my opinion.  Some find the story to be uninteresting and obvious, but I think it has a good message about friendship and perseverance.  And, with the exception of one use of the word "cr@p," there is no bad language or any reason at all that my 5 year old can't watch it.  If you or your kids surf, you will enjoy it much more than those who don't.

As far at the Blu Ray is concerned, the movie itself is so stylized to make it look like it was shot by mobile, documentary film makers, that it doesn't look any better in HiDef.  The intentional grain added to the film is just more pronounced, which actually makes it look more artificial than the standard DVD.  Sound is great, however.  The extras are nice.  Pinball game is a little slow, but fun for the young ones.

Final thought:  I had a Samsung BDP-1400, and it locked up while viewing the extra features.  Firmware was up to date, so I'm not sure what that was about.  I ended up trading it in for a Panasonic DMP-BD10AK, and I've had no problems since.
