There seems to be much confusion about this movie. First, Amazon has two sites for this movie (Epoch and Epoch 2000) with totally opposite rankings reviews and obviously equally sales rankings. Let's see the good points stated so far (which I agree with):

-Realism: All the pieces are good...........the ever-present military does what the military usually seems to do: get confused, issue contradictory orders as a result, and get more confused. Governments do what governments do: squabble over who owns something that no human agency could possibly own.

-Humbleness: I found "Epoch" to be a very enjoyable movie where I didn't need to think for a bit. Compare it to "Sphere" and it seems like a sci-fi masterpiece! The story is not the usual large-monster horror film like UFO usually does. It's about an alien artifact that is found in Bhutan. The army is sent to investigate it. Many theories rise up and there are a few neat effects sequences. The movie never tries to rise above its own intelligence. It never once insults the intelligence of the viewer, and it never stretches anything out to a ridiculous length. The special effects are extraordinary, the best UFO has ever done. The story is simple enough, but not stupid. True, when you get right to it, it's another direct-to-video movie. But not once does it try to pretend its anything more. I liked it.

-Originality:
*The plot ties in nicely to some theories of evolution and the development of Earth.
*This movie made me think about the origins of life on earth - it explores the intelligent design but by whom versus darwinian evolution, such speculations set in the context of military conflict over a strange uncontrollable object in Bhutan, on the border of China.

-Acting:
I particularly enjoyed Brian Thompson, who played Captain Towers. Initially a stereotypical Rambo type, he reveals a side unexpected, and he turns into kind of a hero.
(It was already time for him to start playing good guy since his start in an actual Rambo type movie, "Cobra" 20 years ago.)

Those who gave low score to this movie had no point other than their own opinions. Well, if you've watched movies too often -say more than 3 a week- for many years (as many folks have), this movie might not surprise you but I'm doubtful something will. I enjoyed the movie all along and found concrete reasons to appreciate it.

Notes: 1) Reviews are editable and 2) the other reviewers correctly summarized the movie.
