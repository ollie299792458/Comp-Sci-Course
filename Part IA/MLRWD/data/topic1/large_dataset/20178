This is my favorite movie.  I have watched it over and over again and it is the most exciting action drama I have seen.  It is riviting to watch because it is almost too much to beleive as you watch the battle at Rorke's Drift unfold.  They say that sometimes true history is more exciting than fiction.  In the case of the stand by the British against the Zulus, it most assuredly true.
  I am a history instructor and I have written several papers and delivered numerous oral presentations regarding this historical battle.  Producer and star Stanley Baker has done his homework on this subject.  The two hours you will devote to this epic tale will thrill and amaze you.  Why? Because it is almost exactly depicted as it really happened in 1879.
  In a period of about 30 hours on the 23rd and 24th of January 1879, 142 British soldiers held off over 4000 Zulu warriors in a battle for survival than will live forever in the annals of history.  These few British soldiers killed or wounded approximately 2000 Zulus while losing only 17 of their own.  There were eleven Victoria Crosses and three Distiguished Service Crosses awarded for this action.
  The uniforms, weapons, costumes and even the location it was filmed at are true to fact.  The story line follows the actual battle report made by the original participants almost to the letter.  If you want to see a true life action filled history story on film that is actually factually correct, this is the movie.
  Stanley Baker, Michael Caine and Nigel Green are perfectly cast as the main characters in this true story.
