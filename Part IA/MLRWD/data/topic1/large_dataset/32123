Well where do I begin?

I found the plotlines full on! Action and the visuals draw me in and kept me involved. But it's one of those movie you'll have to watch for yourself...

I'm a huge fan of Ninja Scroll and some other Anime movies. When seeing an ad on internet site for this movie. I had to see what it was all about!

It's also reminded me a little of robotech! The whole human getting into the machine and controling it. But this does a lot more with the action!

Well I wasn't disappointed!

The visuals of the film are great!! Well there unbelievable really! If you have a nice Widescreen TV. You won't be left out!

9 - 10 for picture!

Sound

There's 5.1 English Dolby and Japan 5.1 DTS. I was impressed, I did find the bass was pretty heavy with the music but not on the general action scene's. I listened to the whole movie in Japan dts with english subtitles. I thought it was great! 8 - 10

I just hope they make a number 2!
