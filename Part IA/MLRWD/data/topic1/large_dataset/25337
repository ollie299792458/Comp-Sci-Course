I rented this movie just the other day. I figured it'd be a cheesy teen version of Fight Club or something, but mega cheesy nonetheless. I was surprised to find how much I like it, probably due to the fact I practiced the martial art used in the film plus it was based around high school. Also, it was cool to see the flaws in the main characters fighting before he was properly trained and know what he was doing wrong before the movie characters told him.

The love story between the girl and the guy was pretty cheesy to but I braved it because I felt the girl was pretty dang hot.

There actually wasn't that much fighting in my eyes in the movie, but when it came up, it was interesting and very stylishly done. When they fight, the camera seems to go into a sort of first person/slowmo/right in the face view alot which works well. Theres a (cliche in my book) fight when the character fights a large number of people alone that was actually really fun to watch when normally it usually just bores me because there's not enough flair in the filming of it.

The story is pretty cheesy to, but it somehow kept me interested to see the source of the characters anger and the reason his trainer rarely leaves the gym. Other than that, it's definitely nothing to deep.

All in all, the movie has a workable story, superb but rare action scenes, and workable characters.
