When I first saw this version of 'the scottish play' I was expecting a 'movie' movie. As in, scenery, costumes, and one or two special effects. I was also expecting excellent performances from Judy Dench and Ian McKellan. In the first regard, I was very disapointed; in the second, I was not. The acting is very good from all the actors and excellent from Dench and McKellan. However, there are no costume changes (in fact, very few actual costumes). This is supposed to let the audience pay attention to only the actors, which i think would have work had they all been wearing simple black and white. However, Prince Malcon wore one of those awful seventies knit sweaters, and many of the thanes wore what looked like clothes from the victorian era, which was very distracting. There is no scenery just a lot of smoke on the stage. There are almost no props. Later I learned that this movie is based on a stage production. The minimalist effect is interesting (except for the poor costumes), and indeed I enjoyed the movie but was let down because I didn't expect what I got. So if you're looking for a unique film expierience, watch this, but try another version for a traditional movie. Finally, if you enjoy the works of McKellen and Dench do watch it because it's amazing watching them work together esp. since they are so much younger.
