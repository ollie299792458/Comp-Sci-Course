This review is about the cheap, compact packaging (casing) my product is housed in.

I am very dissatisfied with the packaging/casing the DVD's came in as it is not the same plasticized, laminated, Printed, cardboard packaging that this series was originally sold in, nor used in the image description. This item came in a standard sized, black DVD box, you usually find housing a single or double disc set, with a printed sleeve insert.

This is Clearly Not the same image visual Pictured as the Image that Accompanies the described item! Additionally, the 'series 3' background color is clearly different. The original, as pictured when I made the purchase and is still pictured at the writing of this review, is not the same color, of which is 'Pink.' The product background I received is a reddish, magenta. My product also has a black border (which is the plastic dvd box) and the shown image on Amazon is from the original packaging and which appears borderless (only the edges of the box.

This certainly is different from what was ordered. It's kind of like a car. You may have the same high performance engine under the hood but if the exterior is a different shape and color, it's not what you ordered nor wanted.

I will return this in hopes that Amazon will send me the actual item pictured in the accompanying image description.
