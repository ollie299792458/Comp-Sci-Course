Gaiman's novel "Neverwhere" posits "London Below", a land of anachronism, literal intereptations of place names (such as "Knightsbridge" and "Angel Station"), poverty, magic, and adventure.  The result is a madcap mix of a modern city with miedival fairy tales.  Gaiman's evocative writing strongly evokes the small realities of modern life, and constrasts them with a boldly colored fairy tale world.  The result is humor, beautiful visuals, and a greater appreciation of both the fantastic and the mundane.  The novel could be made into an awesome movie or TV series.

Unforunately, this isn't it.  The script is humorless, the costuming is bad, the lighting is worse, and the whole thing just shows a conspicous lack of either money or serious talent.  I could go into details, but there isn't much point.  Basically, this is very good work of amateur theatre.  It doesn't rise to the level of a professional production.  Imagine a local theatre group and you'll be pretty close.

If you liked the novel enough to want to see an amateur production, then you might enjoy this.  Otherwise, I'd look elsewhere.

The novel is awesome, though.
