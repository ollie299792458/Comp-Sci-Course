This is one of those films that excel in subtle ways, in its observations of human nature. Dave Randall (Richard Derr) is masculine in a way no longer seen on the screen, and Barbara Rush is feminine, dainty, so lovely- again, a rarity today. The premise, that earth is definitely, no doubt about it, facing obliteration, and the desperate race to build a spacecraft, a Noah's Ark to safely transport a core group of survivors to another planet, is gripping. All the performances are solid, and the only minus is the visuals, two scenes in all, that are plainly just flat boards with scenery painted on. One is the flooded New York City, and the other, the worse of the two, is the finale, when our intrepid survivors step out onto Zyra, their new planet-home. What do they/we see? A vast one-dimensional painting that would give me pause even if I did survive the destruction of Earth! Now that's one weird planet! But because I love the film and the cast, it gets five stars. Just wish they wouldn't have run out of budget before they assembled a better-looking landscape on Zyra for the big finale. Despite its shortcomings, however, it always makes my eyes water!
