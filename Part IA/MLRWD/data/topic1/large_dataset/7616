I started to watch this movie with my 3-year-old boy and at the first minutes I disappointedly saw that the animation quality was very bad. Two dolphins races and the director probably wants to create a magical beauty show at that scene; but it fails: Dolphins swim like they are jumping on springs. All the underwater world consists of the same few things repeating continuously. All these may be acceptable; but after twentieth minute there is that UGLY MONSTER FISH which is TOO UGLY FOR CHILDREN. It is like a horror film; not an animation for kids. I changed this horrible movie with another dvd immediately.

As for the story, it does not have a lesson to mention. It says follow the dreams verbally; but the ones in the story are not dreams; they are instincts to escape and leave and hallucinations of meaningless dialogues with sea and other creatures.

One of other reviews is signed with the name of the author of the book with the same name probably the base story for the script of this movie. If that is the author than it shows how cheap this book and animation are. If that is not, it means worse.

Other two reviews smell advertorial too much. I don't believe there could be somebody who buys copies of this thing and give to "all friend's children" Even if this is true, I am sure that this person will lose most of his friends soon!
