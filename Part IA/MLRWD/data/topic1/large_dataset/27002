A good addition to any DVD library that traces a (quasi-)historical thread through Western Civilization.  I started out collecting war movies but this has gradually matured into a library of films that string reasonably entertaining/enlightening pearls of Western political evolution. In truth I like movies I can watch attentively the first time, then re-watch downstream while cooking dinner or doing small repairs at the kitchen table. In Cromwell, the speaking voices of Richard Harris and Alec Guinness, even dear old Robert Morley, are wonderfully sonorous -- I don't even need to be eyes-on the screen to be warmed and chilled and floated away by the dialog. Guinness as Charles I has a wit and gravitas that steals every scene he's in. Although I thoroughly detest "top-100" lists of films -- especially since they seem to be venue-sponsored, or -- worse yet -- reflect a directed polling, I would appreciate greater visibility of critical, independent, category-specific library definitions that might, for example, also provides links into critically regarded works of written fiction and non-fiction. This would provide a basis for enhanced, disciminated choice, as well as the product tie-ins that seem so important these days. Having said this, I am disdainful of one-click teasers such as, "Since you liked Cromwell, you might also like Roman Holiday or perhaps Roman Bread." In one sense, this might seem intellectual snobbery, but I still sure do like watching Patton while making steak, salad, and french fries for dinner. "Discipline is pretty poor ...".
