If you have any interest in this besides a casual one, please listen to the Tommy album before seeing this movie.
Seeing the movie first ruins the beauty and subtlety of the album, because Townshend was forced to work out all the details of the story and change things about when switching mediums. 
Anyway, that being said, I truly loved this film. Let people say it was a sell out (which it was not) I dont care I still think Ken Russell did a brilliant job with it. People get too bogged down comparing it to the album. They aren't comparable, in my opinion, so there's no use trying.
The film at times can be a bit strange (Roger running wildly over various backgrounds, Ann-Margaret 'zinging' Roger with her hair and dancing, assumedly to cure his blindness) but you have to keep the time period and notoriously quirky director in mind. Try not to expect anything when going into the film, and please try not to overanalyze it or you'll miss the unique and brilliant nature of the performances and work as a whole. All involved (sans Nicholson's singing debut) do an amazing job. Daltrey does Tommy suprisingly well, he was perfect for the role, and his major songs in the film (I'm Free, See me/Feel me) are just amazing.
While I admit a blind love for anything Who-related, I still think this movie is another show of Townshend's ability to succesfully combine art and popular media. And most of all I think it's an enjoyable film.
If you aren't familiar with the brilliance of The Who, it's worth looking at just for the stellar musical performances of Turner, Clapton, and Elton John.
