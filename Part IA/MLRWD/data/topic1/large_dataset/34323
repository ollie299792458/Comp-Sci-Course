After reading comments regarding, Stark Sands, I rented ths film. I was curious. After viewing it, I was in awe! Not only does, Stark Sands, have the most beautiful physical attributes(gorgeous natural face, muscular legs, arms, and chest), but he has this rare natural acting talent that is amazing, to say the least. Stark Sands is the hottest young actor to debut in a film that actually has the acting chops that equal his beauty sinse Johnny Depp hit the scene 2 decades ago. I am not kidding. Stark is one of those rare actors wose beauty draws you in while his acting seals the deal! This is a star in the making! Now that I have raved about the sexiest lad I have seen in ages, let me get to the rest of this gem of a film: This retro art film is simply amazing! So original, boasting a talented cast such as, Natasha Lyonne, Frances Conroy, and Charles Busch. Oh, Jason Priestly sleep-walks through the film, proving his stardom on 90210 was a fluke. He is nothing to brag about, and has not aged very well. This is a wonderfually quirky film worthy of the critical praise and cult status it has earned. And oh, Stark Sands...What a talent with a beautiful body! Stark is worth the price of admission alone! YUM!
