as a war photogrpaher...one that does not make use of traditional media...i find myself constantly battling with the impossibility of capturing war in its unthinkable simulteneity....how do you express the horror...the beauty(that will always endure..not to sound trite)..the unthinkable.. and most importantly the humane..???

i realized for myself while covering the war in northern uganda that mainstream media will never allow war to be human..never to be something that one can relate to in the west..certainly such an act would change the very face of the world...in its illusion of disconnect....this seems to be beyond what american culture demands from the media..perhaps merely out of inertia...

anyway..turtles can fly will change you...soran ebrahim deserves praise...to capture the sublime..to humanize.. this is the challenge to those of us 'mediating' our fragmented world..to get beyond sheer horror..back to the everyday...to our bare priomordial day-to-day...this is where we can relate...how do you build empathy with 'horror' stories that are so easily categorized in abstract language...the 'other'..that 'thing in the news'....this may sound sick..it is..the point is..we are able to drink coffee with our newspapaer because the stories and images are just that absract..they are no longer with us...this film defeats all of that..i am grateful to soran ebrahim...this is not just a masterpiece..this is inspiration...

....mind you i have neglected to mention the visceral beauty of this film...it will defeat all attempts to push the subject out of mind...too beautiful to stop looking...too important to forget...
