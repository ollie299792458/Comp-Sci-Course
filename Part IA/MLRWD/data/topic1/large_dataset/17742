Having read the reviews posted here, I had to respond.  This movie is one of the worst examples of war movies I have ever seen.  Yes, the tension is seething between the two antagonists, but the sets are cheap, the dialogue laughable, and the acting hilarious.  Jack Palance would do most any movie great credit with his performance, but with the rest of this cast so pathetic, he comes off as completely overacting.  
Everything about this movie is Hollywood garbage.  Defiant, cruel Germans.  Tough, willing Americans.  The tactics are laughable, and the lingo is inaccurate.
Yes there is some gore and this is not a rally-round-the-flag, patriotic entertainer, but this is a script that should have stayed on a stage.  Perhaps the only saving grace is that while they used U.S. tanks to portray the Germans, they at least had the decency to visually modify them to look somewhat like German vehicles.
Also, the DVD has a skip in the final battle, and the final scene is offset on your screen so you can't view it all.
