If you've not seen the movie, and don't want to know what happens, stop reading now.

I really enjoyed watching this movie but I think that the fascinating character of Pei Mei should've been given more depth. I also don't think that the way he died at all made sense to the rest of the movie and I found the manner of death and the fact that he died extraneous.

Uma Thurman is a bad ass as usual but her best scene was the scene where she rips out Elle's other eye and steps on it. That scene *RULED* but the fact that you don't know what happens to her ultimately bothers me. I did like the credits with the cross-out motif. That was creative.

I think that David Carradine, the actor that played Bill, the title character, was boring. I was expecting someone more interesting to play that character. Someone more bad ass like Clint Eastwood or something. I think his death was ironically non-violent and I liked it, it was appropriate.

I rated this movie a 5 because I found it highly entertaining and compared to most other movies that've come out lately, it ROCKED.
