"Les Enfants du paradis [The Children of Paradise]" is an incredible feast of sparkling dialog, interesting and unique characters, and simple truth within a sweet tragicomic fantasy about the world of theater.  The story follows three men and the woman they love. Garance led a hard life when she was orphaned as a child and is kind to all but wise and independent of all attachments. She does not hope for love and is stronger than the men that love her. Baptiste Debureau, an extraordinary mime, is an artistic genius who loves simply and carries his pure-hearted empathy for his fellow humans into all his performances. Frederick Lemaitre is a grand actor with a courageous heart to match his skill on stage. Like Garance, he does not hope to love, but also like her, he falls victim to a bittersweet affection despite himself. My favorite character of all is the thief and murderer Lacenaire, who expresses a fierce admiration for truth and the exquisite ironies of life, despises society, has always known and loved Garance, and maintains a peculiar and noble dignity. Imagine a lucidity that enabled you to fully understand the world and your loved ones and then award yourself the tongue of an angel to express what you felt. That is what you find in Jacques Prevert's screenplay. See it now. Trust me.
