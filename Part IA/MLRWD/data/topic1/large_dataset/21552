Long before I went to the public library and read "The Wages of Fear"-- a fantastic book-- I became intrigued with "Scorcerer".
  It had an edgy soundtrack and an edgy look.  Much of the tension and suspense was understated... and being plugged in to a more international view of the cinema, I loved the grit.
  The characters are rock-hard and chisled tough.  You feel their intensity with a look or a phrase.  The setting is the stuff only B. Traven, and the guys from "Treasure of Sierra Madre" would be proud of... I could see Bogart playing Scanlon,the New York hood, Belmondo, Omar Sharif, and many other fantastic international actors in these parts.
  The way the jungle [stinks] you in might seem, outwardly hokey, but Frankenheimer is masterful at using incliment weather and 3rd world rotting structures (like the rope bridge) to heighten the effect of man versus nature... and man is small in this.
  How greed and ambition overcomes seemingly hopeless odds is amazing.  You root for the main characters, despite the fact that they are seedy criminals.  Amazingly enough... a great sense of humanity is defined, and you are transported into another world.
  "Scorcerer" does not have the aires of "Agguire, Wrath of God" or its presumption.  These men are not fools or blustering dreamers... just desperate souls seeking some sense of practical salvation.
  What a stroke of genius to have "Tangerine Dream" modulate the soundtrack... the mix of electronic moog musak and a dark, hungry jungle are magnetic.
  BUY THIS DVD... they have really cleaned up the negatives and it looks great!
