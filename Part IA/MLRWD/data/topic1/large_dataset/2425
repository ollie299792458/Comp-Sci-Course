Well, having seen most of the movies inspired by Bigfoot, I have to say this one in very sub-par. It starts out with poachers commenting on the size of a dung pile while drinking some cheap beer then getting trashed by big ugly. One guy is torn to shreds, one guy is chased down WHILE CARRYING A LOADED GUN THAT HE NEVER FIRES, and the last escapes. Later he sees the 2nd party of nosey bodies but is tackled by the creature and slammed into a tree before he calls for help. The creature roars in victory then spies the others WHO WERE ABOUT 40-50 FEET AWAY AND DID NOT HEAR ANY OF THIS OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST WHERE IT IS FAIRLY QUIET AND YOU COULD HEAR PETER GRIFFIN FART 2 MILES AWAY. Needless to say, most of the movie is full stupid moves, like when the sister of a missing Ranger goes off on her own to find out what that noise was she heard in the dark AFTER THEY HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY THE CREATURE, what an idiot, bad scenes, like when the idiot girl screams and the hero dude says "Stay here." but they all dispurse into 3 little groups after they hear the creature roar, and the dude that is the fly in the ointment constantly arguing with the hero WHEN HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING FOR THE CREATURE THROUGH A WINDOW BUT TURNS HIS BACK ON THE OPEN WINDOW TIME AFTER TIME AND FINALLY IS SNATCHED BY ONE AND DRAGGED OUTSIDE TO MEET HIS DOOM. The night seen was played out about 15 minutes too long and could have saved me a little grief if it had just got to the point. The scariest part in the movie was expected with the babe of the movie using her digital cam to light her way by taking pictures to see where she was only to  photogragh one of the creatures before her most unwanted doom. The best looking chick in the whole movie and she is ripped to shreds, what a waste. Anyway, when they finally make it to the jeep the next day, thats when it got corny. The CGI creatures were horrible, the others in suits looked more like chimps than bigfoots, bigfeets.....other creatures. Gimme a break. I don't know the plural for bigfoot. All in all, I would not buy this movie, but I would watch it if I had a choice between it or watching "The 700 Club" but I would have to think real hard as to which was the most torture. I gave 2 stars because I have yet to see another movie worse than Battlefield Earth which is the only movie I have given 1 star.
