I succumbed to the positive reviews of these 50-Movie Packs and just got Nightmare Worlds, Drive-In Classics, and this - Chilling Classics. Well, I just finished watching the first disc and I am SO glad I did! I am very happy with the sound and picture quality - it's not perfect, but light-years ahead of some budget DVD's. Though I've only seen four films, one of them was an old grainy B&W voodoo flick, and I understood every word.

This film was called "I Eat Your Flesh", and I liked it due to it's surreal charm (If you like films like Robot Monster and The Creeping Terror, you'll like this too). The 'special effects' are hilarious but it's still a spooky film to see late at night with the lights off. The music really captivated me - it was music you'd expect to hear at an Italian airport in the 1960's.

Another film, "Memorial Valley Massacre", was what you might call "god-awful", but it did have a strange charm to it... I laughed and groaned at a few scenes, but the next day I remembered it rather fondly - it moved along quite well and certainly lived up to it's title... It's set in Memorial Valley and it certainly was a massacre. The best scene is when the 'dog' comes into the teens tent.

I'm certainly going to buy every other 50-movie pack (the ones that aren't filled with overly-edited films, that is) - I'm most looking forward to getting Suspense Classics, Horror Classics, and Martial Arts Classics (the reviews for that one convinced me there's a lot of fun to be had with that set). And for the price, you just cannot get more entertainment anywhere that I know of - thanks Amazon & Mill Creek!!! Keep making more for us fans!
