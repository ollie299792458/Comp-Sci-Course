In generality, teen movies are plagued with bad acting, silly plot lines, and clich&eacute;s upon clich&eacute;s. I will formally rank A Walk to Remember, based on the novel by Nicholas Spark, as one of the better teen movies. The acting is passable, the plot line is touching, and... well, there are still plenty of clich&eacute;s, but this is a teen movie after all.
This movie's greatest asset is the tragic love story between bad-boy Landon (Shane West) and goodie-goodie Jamie (Mandy Moore). Many teen film romances seem contrived and leave me wondering what the two characters ever saw in each other. The love between Landon and Jamie seemed natural and believable, and made the ending all the more poignant. Mandy Moore can actually do a decent acting job, surprisingly enough. 
I still have my usual gripes: The ending is predictable. Many of the transitions seem rushed. On a re-watchability scale, this movie seems like a one-timer and would not be as touching second time around. But still, for those of us who can appreciate some good sap now and again, this is a lovely movie to sit down with a box of tissues by your side.
