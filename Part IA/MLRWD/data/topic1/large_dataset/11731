Gibson's got stamina, an ex-suicidal roman candle vietnam veteran who unleashes all his rage when Pleter Vorstedt said softly to him: "I pulled this mop of bloodsoaked hair to see this woman's face. Your wife, right?" Riggs lets all of hs fury loose on the cougar ants, to avenge the demise of his wife, (similar to Bruce Lee in the Chinese Connection) or angry that they might kill his Dutch sweetheart, such as when he iced that one guy, and said: "Master Race." Gover's married, three kids, worried that Riggs (Gibson) is going to get the two of them smoked like a hookah, but his nervousness gives him that deadly, bad boy angry attitude.  For instance, when he picked up the nailgun and drilled those two South Africans, stops, takes a deep breath, and in a rugged, worn-out tone says: "Nailed 'em both!" Pesci's got an in-your-face, ranting, humorous personality, such as: "Everyone cheats a little bit, look at he Pentagon!" Or when he said: "See these these silk pajamas?  Free!" Murtaugh replied: "It's not free, it's taxes paying for it!" "Oh, come on, it's the same thing, okay, okay?" By the way, is that Home Alone, or moan on the phone?  O'Connor is pure evil, and builds up his anger,  when Riggs is reading his diplomatic liscence, saying: "Ok, you're Vo-Vorsh-enofk, ah, forget it, I'll just call you Adolf. His appearence extremely wicked, and his delivery of his lines and the look in his eyes when he was spin-kicking Riggs in the face on the cruise is 100% demonlike.
