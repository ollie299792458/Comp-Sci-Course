Blu-ray format

I love 'Payback' and it is nice to have both versions on one disc, and no, I don't think two movies on one disc is causing any kind of (significant) quality loss.  Also, compared to the US version, this one has HD audio tracks, which is a nice upgrade.  As far as which version I like better, its hard for me to say, and that really is the point of this release.  It is not some gimmicky 'directors cut' with, like, 3 non-essential scenes plugged back in; you get the theatrical version, which is the one most people know and from what I've read prefer, but you also get the original director's vision.  This film was directed by Brian Helgeland, who was essentially cut out of the final process so that Mel & the studio could make a more audience-friendly (read: mainstream) version for release.  Now, we get to see  what Helgeland wanted to do from the start, which involves color saturation changes (it really does make a difference,) pacing changes and the removal of entire plot pieces and sequences.  It really does make for a different experience, and you may not be "rooting for the bad guy, as the tagline to the theatrical version suggests.  It is also interesting to watch the interviews with Gibson and Helgeland talk about the original production and how they got back together to put out the director's cut of the film, and why they didn't just use this version from the start.

This is a foreign disc (U.K.), but like Warner's other foreign titles, it is region free and plays fine on US players.
