I saw this movie with my mother.  I am 31 and I LOVE movies, specially classics and there aren't that many movies I can see with my mother now-a-days.  I liked Pierce Brosnan alright but hadn't seen him do anything really spectacular.  When I sat down to see this movie I expected to be tired enough after a couple of hours so that I would see it in "installments".  Instead, I found myself not being able to, well, "put the movie down".  I kept putting in video after video because I was so intrigued by what was going on.  Half way through I resented having to pause for a quick bight to eat.  
I didn't really think the subject would make for an interesting movie but it did and I enjoyed every minute of it.  It is a powerful movie that, surprisingly enough, does not contain too much violence, sex, bad language, etc.  I've seen many action and suspense movies and I can honestly say this one IS still quite unique and original and you really can't guess what will happen next.  Since I know nothing about the culture in which the movie is set, I enjoyed it all the more!  I definately recommend it and hey, it's not your typicall GUY movie nor is it your typical CHICK-FLICK either, so you can watch it with your significant other without getting bored!
