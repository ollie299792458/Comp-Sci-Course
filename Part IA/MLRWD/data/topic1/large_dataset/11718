I bought this DVD after reading David Skal's book about stage and film productions of "Dracula", and I have to say, he is overstating the difference in quality between the two versions presented here a little. I would agree with Skal that the Spanish version is actually better, but although it features great acting (especially the actor playing the Renfield-character is bursting with raw energy) and interesting visuals, it still suffers from an editing style which by today's standards is so slow that it sometimes becomes distracting (and I mean not just in comparison with today's action films). Most importantly, the film is worlds away from being scary. I watched with my housemates, and we actually had great fun. Murnau's version, though even older, is far more disturbing than anything you'll get to see here. That general staleness, which I felt although I am used to watching very old films, is the reason why I give this film only four stars.
In short: if you're a collector of vampire films or a person with a knack for the early talkies, you're in luck and definitely should get a copy of this. If you are looking for something scary to add to your horror-collection, go for "Nosferatu", Coppola's Dracula, or the fantastic "LÃ¥t den r&auml;tte komma in".
