First, let me say that the unusual style of the series is at first a little off-putting. Once you fall into the story, however, you don't notice that style as much, and that's really how it SHOULD be - unusual style can't hold my attention for long.

It's Count of Monte Cristo in space, (mostly) from Albert's perspective. We get to experience the Count's revenge through Albert, which adds a bit more suspense, I think. I'd never read the book, but was, like most people, familiar with the story.

The Good: The story, characters and animation are all top drawer. The Count's character design is very attractive, too. I came to care about the characters and feel sorry for them during their inevitable downward spiral, through their poor choices. What's especially good is that the story doesn't "dumb it down" and spell out certain things (such as a character's love for another), but leaves the viewer to decide.

Plus, the climax is one of the best I've ever seen.

The Bad: There is some CG work here which isn't very good at all (robots fighting), and could have been done without. But it's a minor quibble.

The Ugly: None!

NOTE: This is NOT a series for kids. There are issues of sexuality, death, sacrifice, brutal betrayal and a little incest. It's a very adult theme, but very enjoyable.

Also, the box for this first volume is really lovely. It's kind of shiny with golden touches and looks really nice on the shelf!

Overall, this is one of my FAVORITE series, in the top 3, and I've seen a lot of anime. ;)
