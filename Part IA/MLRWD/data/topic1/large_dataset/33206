Overall the movie was pretty good -- I don't feel like I wasted my time or my $.99 (but I would have felt cheated out of $3.99). The plot was different from any I've seen and the acting by most of the characters was fairly good. So why 3 stars?

Let's face it -- you're thinking of renting this movie because you're a fan of Jodie Foster. After all, she can make us identify with anybody from the working-class single mother of a brilliant child to the intuitive and crafty investigator hunting down Hannibal Lecter. If you're after another Jodie Foster masterpiece, move on. Her character wasn't developed enough in The Brave One, and she doesn't pull you into her role like she does in her other movies. She's supposed to be an observant poet/radio show host who reports on the sights and sounds of New York City that go unnoticed by others, but the writers just didn't do Jodie justice in this one. It took me the entire movie to figure out who she was. I certainly hope this is an anomoly for her...
