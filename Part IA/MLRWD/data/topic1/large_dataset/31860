Jennifer, with her Lisa Kudrow"ish" beauty, was great in this movie!  My suite mates and I ( a mixture of lesbians and hetero's)  had a great time with this picture.  Jessica was so cute with her quirks and on going lies!  Helen was fantastic, because these were probably some of the main things that made her fall for Jessica.  (Who COULDN'T fall for Jessica!) This movie was hilarious from the first take!  Watching Jessica and Helen meld their new found discoveries about themselves into their skin was really entertaining.
EVERYONE was rooting for Jessica and Helen to hook up.  The writing hit everyone on every level, because it was not a lesbian or straight thing.  It was about us being women trying to find that person who stimulates us mentally and physically.  We all agreed that the question to be answered was, "Is sex the the innermost part of a true loving relationship; or is it a small component of a huge package?  What are we willing to sacrifice so we can have the person who "get's" us? "
Looking at the ending in a non-bias way, it was good because this was not the type of relationship Helen was looking for.  In hind sight the two women would be much better as friends.  
Now being TOTALLY biased, I wanted the women to stay together because, Jessica is much to beautiful to be straight!  This could have been a schmaltzy "Girl finds her princess and lives happily ever after in rainbow heaven ending" I could really dig!
