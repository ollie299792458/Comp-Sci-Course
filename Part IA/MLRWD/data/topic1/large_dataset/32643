Having been released previously on DVD and the failed HD-DVD format back in 2008, this re-release of the film, now on the Blu-ray format, is a welcomed addition to any Blu-ray HiDef library. A powerful film, Atonement is a complicated and fruitful adaption of Ian McEwan's novel of the same name that Director Joe Wright carried out masterfully. The story focuses on numerous themes (that I will not spoil for anyone who has yet to see this gem) that anyone can relate to, and it serves as a reminder of what power not only the spoken word can have on a person's life, but also the written word as well, as recorded by recent headlines. It offers breathtaking cinematography that could only be improved by the HD transfer of the film and brilliant performances by an incredible cast that no one should miss.  Actors Kiera Knightley, James McAvoy, Saoirse Ronan, and Romola Garai ignite the screen with the emotional depth and characterizations that each bring to their portrayals, with a powerful close of the film with the astonishing and always captivating performance of Vanessa Redgrave. Universal has performed incredible work in the past with their Blu-ray transfers of films like Hellboy 2, Wanted, and the Bourne trilogy, and with a resume like that, we can confidently acknowledge that this film's presentation on Blu-ray will be top notch. Don't miss out on purchasing this product!
