The series MADMEN has captured the culture, color and swaggar of the times of 1960.  Sadly, it captures the essense of how women were undervalued as professionals and too often exploited by the opportunistic and arrogant energies of the then Patriarchial society where men dominated. The series also showed how smoking and drinking alcohol to excess, especially in the workplace was a very real, accepted and working part of society at all levels.  The character development was EXCELLENT and the energies of each individual became real, at least in my mind.  The series also characterized the times where the dollar ruled and Capitalism was more innocent, as the advertising business set the tone for America along with the rise of television and the early stages of media hype.  The politics were also well developed and blended skillfully into the series. Interestingly, the ego's of the key players were colorfully portrayed and the emphasis and swagger of "pecking order and proces" was also well-done relative to the corporate march in America. The romances were sordid and passionate and gave credibility to the timeless human condition of Libedo over Credo.  MADMAN was and is a quintesential classic of American Culture and should be mandatory viewing for students of the so-called American Dream, at least in the developmental stages.  Simply put, MADMEN is a CLASSIC!
