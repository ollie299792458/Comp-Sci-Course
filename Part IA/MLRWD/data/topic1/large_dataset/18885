First the negatives - if they should even count, given the PG-13 rating.  At times the language was strong, but not intentionally non-stop as so many movies seem to provide anymore.  The stripping scenes mentioned in other reviews contain no nudity, and are only suggestive.

The movie does tend to drag just a little at times, and it's fairly easy to guess outcomes of various threads of the plot as it develops, but the exact manner of the final outcome does come as a surprise - and a very nice one, even if a bit unrealistic had the plot been real life.  But then it was a movie, and not held to the standard of completely plausible.  We enjoyed it.

We received this as part of the Amazon Vine Program for review, so there was no cost to us.  If I could somehow know the plot in advance, form an opinion, and then have all memory of the movie taken from my brain with just the impression left, I'd go pay money to rent it and watch it.  It's quirky, and perhaps could be called a caricature of real life, as well as each of the characters being caricatures of more real equivalents in real life.  But the caricature nature of the movie is funny.

With that said, the characterization in the cover review that it is a comedy is - while true - somewhat misleading.  Don't expect to laugh most of the say through.  It's not that kind of comedy.  There are tense moments, sad moments, and lightly repulsive moments.  Yet wrapped together, it really is funny.  Excellent acting by all, and an ending that's worth waiting for even if you do guess it, but still want to see just how it actually unfolds and turns out.  Those who've given away parts of the ending don't do their readers any service.  This is a strong 4-star rating (we only give 5 stars to the very, very top items), worth getting.  Though teens hear and hear about most of the kinds of things said and shown in the movie, I don't recommend you watch this with mid-teens or younger.
