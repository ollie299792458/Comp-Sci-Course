Well done. I personally would like to have seen a bit more of the studio examples at the mixing desk (solo'd mixer channels to reveal the composites of the album like they usually do. There's a little of that but not enough!)

I loved the inclusion of Roy Harper...did they ever pay him appropriately for that song?
I have to say this...While Roger Waters was pretty cool on this program the way he claims "I could have done it better" pertaining to Roy Harpers performance is ridiculous. Harper NAILED that! They wouldnt have kept his version had Waters done or been someohow able to have done better. That was pretty absurd!

I wished they had elaborated on what if anything Syd Barret had to say when he showed up during the sessions. (Showing the picture of him was really the jewel of the piece)

By the way...How does security work for that houseboat studio of Gilmours? Seems like a pirates dream :)

I guess the fact that I wished it hadn't ended so quickly says something. A very worthy purchase.
