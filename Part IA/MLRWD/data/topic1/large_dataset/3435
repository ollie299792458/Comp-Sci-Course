As we are currently in the midst of the football (soccer) world cup (also taking place in South Africa), this film is no doubt timely. It is the story of Nelson Mandela's attempt to unite his country just after the end of apartheid and at the beginning of his presidency. He sees an opportunity to use sports to rally his country behind one common goal: rugby. He recruits the captain of South Africa's rugby team to not only win the world cup competition but unite the color schism  within the country.

I really enjoyed this film however, the characters/story were not as developed as one might have hoped. The story eludes to family troubles for Mandela but does not really develop it. He is seen having an argument with his daughter and is shown to become agitated when asked about his family. As this is a true story, there may not have been a resolution to his family troubles but it left me wondering why Eastwood even bothered including it in the film. The references to it were so cursory that it would seem as though the film would have been fine without it. Likewise, the black population's shift to supporting the South African rugby team seemed too easy-- formerly, blacks would root against them. A black local government even voted to change the name and colors of the team until Mandela stopped them.  It just seemed as though approval of the rugby team seemed to shift over night without any justifiable reason for occurring or at least viewable softening towards them.

The two main actors do a wonderful job in their roles. Damon, who usually comes off as very intelligent in interviews, was able to seem simple yet noble in this role and Freeman, who is no stranger to playing a Black South African (the power of one), gracefully conveys the strength of a man who can forgive despite the immense cruelty.

This film is definitely worth watching. It's an uplifting feel good movie.
