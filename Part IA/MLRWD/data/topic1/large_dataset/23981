I just bought a copy of the Renegade Version, having what I thought was the original cut of the movie in this Special Edition.  I come to find, they're the exact same movies.  At least, in the length of the movie.  The only visual exceptions to either version is the coloration of special effects in the time travel sequences (the renegade version is purple; the special edition is blue) and the color of the Shield (red in the Renegade; blue in the Special).  If anyone thought the Renegade version would give you a completely different story than the original (what I mean by original is a version in the last few years) they're probably the same thing and don't bother buying both.  I've never seen the 1990 original and I hope I never do if it truely is worse.  I was hoping this Director's Cut was going to save the Highlander sequel, but you're better off just skipping the movie entirely and continuing the Highlander saga with Highlander 3: The Final Dimension (the story line of which follows more closely to the original premise).
