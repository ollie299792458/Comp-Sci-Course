Special effects were great for this film.  I'm a big fan of both Predator and Aliens.  My only disapointment was to not have it rated "R".  I mean come on, PG-13? I know it was to just try and sell more tickets to all the under 18 kids.  Please... When were the Predator and Alien movies introduced?  Yes, us the real Fans of the films know the difference between the aliens and the predators.  And we sure as hell weren't watching the Power Rangers or Barney before we went to the theater to get our ticket.  It would have gotten 5 stars but somebody out there was thinking about thier pockets getting full.  They must not care about the fans who helped them get rich in the first place.  But the Director did a great job with what he could do.  But this "Unrated directors cut" is hardly an "R" rated film either.  Just a little trickle of blood added by a computer.  At least this version has alot of special features otherwise I would have just been happy with the theatrical release.  If they do make another AVP movie I hope they realize that they can make thier fans happy by giving them a film that they want, not what will let teenage punks spend thier lunch money on.  But I highly recommend this movie for what it is, a great film.  It's just not a fans choice of film making that's all.
