My poor wife is tired of me watching films about the French Resistance during World War II (or lack there of - Sorrow and the Pity), but I had to see this one. I `snuck watched it' while she was at work. This is an extraordinarily well made and powerful film. True some of the gendre images are a bit stereotyped, giving the resistance a sense of masculinity that the French wished they had - a kind of cinema compensation for having been humiliated by the Nazis. The story is riveting...essentially about how in the end people in the Resistance had to resort to some of the same methods as their oppressors (although not all of them) and that war morally consumes one way or another most of its participants. Simone Signoret - whom I love anyway - cannot understand why Yves Montand would be attracted to an airhead like Marilyn Monroe when Simone was by his sid - Simone was extraordinary and the caveat with Serge Reggiani also a wonderful scene. Anyhow despite being overpacked with symbolism in every scene (see it with the commentary too), this is truly a great one, not a term I would use for many films. The director was a bit over the edge, an `american-phile' who changed his name to Melville in honor of the great American author and who it is said drank Coca Cola till his teeth rooted.
