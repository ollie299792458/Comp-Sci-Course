Started watching this this morning with my toddler. Everyone on the farm... cute cute... pleasant Dudley Moore voice. Whimsical, adorable - but what have we here? cats falling into rushing water? A cat getting its face attacked by a crab? A dog getting dunked by a bear? I go online and watch the outtakes - scenes that were deleted from the US version but shown in Japan. That director threw a cat off a cliff into the rushing water of the ocean. Even if he released the rest of the footage (i.e., the footage that didn't make it into the Japanese version, the takes they didn't use), that would not exonerate him of animal cruelty, because it is in the film plain to see. I guess what's equally disturbing is how so many US audience members exonerate him automatically on the basis that this is a children's film released by Columbia, that it was Dudley Moore's voice, or that the director was a zoologist. All those things can be true, co-existing with the truth that the director put cats and dogs in danger and caused them pain for this film. There is no logical reason why the quality of Dudley Moore's character or Columbia film's judgment or the director's profession would mean that cruelty could not have happened. My logical argument for the fact that there was cruelty in this film is that the original version of the film shows a cat being tossed off a cliff into the ocean, scrambling back up the rocks, and falling back in the ocean as he loses his footing. This was done with no special effects and any animal who had this happen would be frightened for its life, as well as at great risk for injury or death. People may hold various opinions about whether animal cruelty is a problem or not, but it is very clear that instances of violence against animals exist in this film. It is actually amazing that people are still debating the presence of animal cruelty in this film as if it were a question at all.
