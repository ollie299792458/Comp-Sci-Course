I recently bought a Blu-ray player and for quite some time had been disappointed with my $300 purchase. Every Blu-ray disc I purchased was basically just a high-definition DVD and took little to no advantage of the new Blu-ray technology that was supposed to "revolutionize the way we watch movies at home"...then I picked up Sleeping Beauty and my opinion started to change. But while Sleeping Beauty hinted at the possibilities of what Blu-ray can and will do, Pinocchio has set the standard. Not only does this film look fantastic after (what had to be a) spare-no-expense restoration, but the Blu-ray is a completely immersive experience (packed with fantastic bonus features) that is just as much of a work of art as the original. This is especially true when you consider the detailed artistry that went into the fantastic "Disney View" presentation option, which adds new drawings by Disney artists to the left and right sides of the frame to fill the picture size of today's HD TVs.

And, while I've never been a fan of Disney adding new "music videos" to their classic film releases, if these karaoke cover-versions attract a new generation to discover magical films like this one, then so be it.
