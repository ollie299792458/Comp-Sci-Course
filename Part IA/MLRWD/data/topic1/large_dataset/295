The movie is an idealistic and bittersweet allegory for culture in transition and what a modern society should represent.

The Old west is characterized by rugged individualism where power is in the gun. Big business (Cattle Barons) and violent criminals (Lee Marvin) are linked as the bad guys; small business and the common man are victims; and powerful, honest men stand on the sidelines only intervening when in their own self-interest. This is also a time when black men are called "boy" and women are told they should be uneducated, even by "good guy" John Wayne.

In transition, law and order attempts to come through peaceful confrontation, the press and democratic participation. Jimmy Stewart is the agent of change. He educates the masses, including women, preaches equality for all people, and power through the political process. He finds though, that in the period of transition, the gun is still necessary until his utopia is ushered in.

In the idealistic future envisioned in the movie, there is no room for men like John Wayne and Lee Marvin. As such both Lee Marvin and John Wayne's characters disappear and only Jimmy Stewart and Vivian Leigh continue on. The future is bright where women are educated, people are treated equal and big business is brought under the control of the political process and the Law.

In the finale, a very symbolic tribute is maded to the rugged west in the form of boots and spurs, cactus flowers and the absence of a gun belt.

It is a bittersweet farewell to the old west.
