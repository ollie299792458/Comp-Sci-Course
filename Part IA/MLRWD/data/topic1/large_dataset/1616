Originally released in 1974, "The Towering Inferno" stands as one of the best of the 70's disaster films.  This film like many of Allen's others including "The Poseiden Adventure" is jam-packed with special effects and stars including:  Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astare, Susan Blakley, Jennifer Jones, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner and ever O.J. Simpson.

Paul Newman as the architect designs the world's tallest and safest skyscraper.  The developer, William Holden, shaves cost by cheating on the electrical system barely staying within the electrical codes.

The Grand Opening party for the new building with guests such as the Mayor, a Senator and many other important locals becomes a disaster.  Electrical overloads and short circuits cause a fire half way up the building.  Of course the party is on the top floor, approximately 50 stories above the fire.  As the fire spreads, Steve McQueen as the Fire Chief comes to the rescue.  If you want to know how it ends, you'll have to watch it!

I recommend this film to anyone who loves action and suspense.  A 2-disc offering many extras, it is a sure bet for your video collection.
