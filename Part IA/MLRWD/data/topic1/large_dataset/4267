This was a great film but it let itself down with the ending. In truth , Hollywood wrote this ending so that the good old USA trumiphs over evil again (and the box office isn't harmed again). But up until that point ,  this was up their with the best of them as Harrison finds himself aboard a  hijacked Air Force One. The vice president (Glenn Close) finds herself  eventually almost forced to rule that the president is making decisions not  as a leader but as a family man and that as a result of this she MUST take  charge. The film looks as though it may take this view but then about turns  and declares that the Vice President makes a brillant decision by not only  giving in to the terrorists who then reveal that they would not let the  president go anyway and will use him as a political tool. Now at the end of  the film the President escapes and the film in a few scenes shows her as  having solved this crisis - presumably she knew that the president would  become Rambo and save the day. Good movie until this point after that  typical American Schmaltz (but still great fun)
