I would have to say that I was surprised with this film.  Anthony Hopkins give off yet another wonderful performance as Hannibal Lecter (maybe one of the freakiest characters in cinema).  Hopkins and Ed Norton led an amazing cast that included Harvey Keitel, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Emily Watson, and Ralph Fiennes.  Norton, Hopkins and Fiennes had amazing performances.
The movie starts out with Hannibal helping out FBI agent Will Graham (Norton) in solving a case which involves cannibalism.  Soon Norton figures out that its Hannibal, then Will turns around only to get a knife in the liver.  With barely enough strength he picks up arrows and jams it into Hannibal and then shoots him in the shoulders and chest.  A great opening scene, good enough to get anyone interested.  Several years later Graham is visited by Keitel and decides to help the FBI with the current murder case.  From there the movie just takes off.  It might move slow at first but it picks up and turns into an intense thriller.
Brett Ratner proves his directing talent.  This movie will open him up more projects.  He also has the Rush Hour movies working for him.  Overall a great movie, not as good as The Silence of the Lambs but much better than Hannibal.
