I have to admit that I'm as macho as the next guy. I like action movies, sci-fi and comedy. When I first heard of Gilmore Girls I just wrote it off as another show that I would skip. That is until I actually saw an episode. That one episode opened my eyes and forced me to expand my definition of quality television. I have never encounted a show whose dialogue was so SHARP and yet managed to stay so close to how real people would react. The charecters, both main and in the background, are memorable and unique. And I will say to anyone who asks, whoever made the decision to cast the parts of Rory and Lorilei were absolutely brilliant. The chemistry between the two just takes your breath away. It blows my mind that I have to keep reminding myself that they are not mother and daughter in real life. I think what ultimately draws me as a viewer is that way it perfectly mixes sharp dialogue, drama, humor, and most of all the way it shows not just whats going on on the surface of a person but underneath as well. I still proudly call myself a guy. Its just that now guys who are into quality television have Gilmore Girls to add to their list as well
