Friends is one of my favorite shows because it gets better with repeat viewings. A few years ago when this season was on it was obvious that it would wind up being the best season of the show and several years later after repeat viewings that assumption rings true.

At the end of the seventh season, the Friends writers revealed a twist that blew everyone away: Rachel was pregnant. The eighth season is pretty much all about that, but the ways the writers keep this SL from becoming cliched is truly amazing. Although at the time it was frustrating that they just wouldn't put Ross and Rachel back together, watching now it's cool to realize that Ross and Rachel were only a couple for a short period of time and spent the rest of the series apart even though fans wanted them together. The writers did this because it's what kept most people watching.

Not surprisingly, most of the best episodes revolve around the aftermath of Rachel's discovery. I especially like the episode where we get to see the videotape of Ross and Rachel's fateful night. More strong episodes come when Joey ends up falling for Rachel. Even though I didn't want them to get together, it was still great to see Matt LeBlanc do some very good acting. The only thing I didn't like was Mona, but that was probably because the actress had the thankless job of trying to come between Ross and Rachel, a role very similar to that of Julie in Season 2.

Another thing that works about this season is the minimum of big guest stars. The fact that they didn't overdo it makes the few guest spots work very well.

I highly recommend this DVD set. Friends found the perfect balance of drama and comedy once again and almost all of the episodes are fun to watch over and over. This was the year Friends started to get the respect it deserved. It's no surprise it won all those Emmys for this season, so do yourself a favor and get the greatest season of one of the best shows you could ever hope to watch.
