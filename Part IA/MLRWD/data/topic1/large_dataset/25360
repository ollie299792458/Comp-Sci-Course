The split screen technique may not be comfortable for some but it is worth getting into. In love matches the technique follows on from 'sliding doors'. Here it emphasises there are '..two sides to every love story'.

'Conversation(s) with Other Women' is an intriguing title. It has little to do with the plot and suggests so much more to do with the changing roles of men and women. The plot is a common one: Young couple met, fall in love, part and meet by accident a decade to wonder what if...

In "Conversations..." the sexual roles are reversed. A painful film for men to watch and feel. Rather than a woman dumped and still bleeding, here it is the man. More painful for men as men have to suffer cuts in silence and rarely get over it other than by pulling up the emotional drawbridge. Women are liberated to talk with other women.

In 'Conversations...' it is not accidential meeting. The man is trapped. He had to attend. The predatory woman returns to see if her cornered pray is still wounded by her claws. She brilliantly fakes concern for the husband and children she has left at home.

It is unusual for a dialogue to hold an audience's attention. The fact that 'Conversations...' does, is testimony to the quality of the script, acting and editing.
