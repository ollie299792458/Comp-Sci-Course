I must say that I don't understand what was all the fuss about this movie. It's good, but very prone to be catalogued as a cliche. I will not really review this one as much as use it as an example that the academy awards  have sold out (they might have been before, but since I'm contemporary with  the later years I've come to notice now). Of the five movies nominated for  best picture this one deserved it the least, and I'm pretty sure that  saving Private Ryan was second in the ballots, which didn't deserve it  either. It seems that Hollywood thought that life is beautiful should've  been content with winning best foreign film and the thin red line was just  happy to be in such "illustrious" company and had no merits of  its own. Back to Shakespeare, it was a very flawed and disturbing film,  nothing like a real art house production, it was funny at times, tried to  be deep sometimes but never really accomplished anything. The acting was  nice, probably because it was full of many household names was a reason  hollywood liked it, "hey they speak in english accents, it must be  sophisticated", phonies. Well I think I'm reaching a 1000 words.  Shakespeare in love was a nice but very overrated film, trying to fulfil  the art film genre and at the same time aspiring to be main stream. It  didn't accomplish either, so it was stuck with an, I mean 5 or so Academy  Awards.  If you are one of the common, unintelligent viewers who actually  enjoyed this movie, feel free to email me with your opinions (my email says  I bash books, but, as you can see, I do the same to bad movies).
