It's Kind of a Funny Story, based on Ned Vezzini's novel, is a black comedy that surprisingly keeps you entertained, Zach Galifianakis, keeps you wanting more. Mental illness is certainly not a comical thing but people portraying it is. The movie is mainly shot in a mental hospital ward that host an array of characters. When an over stressed sixteen year old, Craig (Kier Gielchrist), feels that he can't cope anymore; he freely checks himself into a mental hospital for depression. He meets Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), a depressed patient (that is hilarious), is the "go- to guy" for the psych ward. He befriends Craig and surprisingly help one another. Noelle (Emma Roberts), plays a depressed teen, who Craig sees a love interest in, and blossoms into a unique relationship. Craig, may be depressed and somewhat suicidal but when he arrives at the hospital and realizes everyone really is "crazy" and  his problems are really not big anymore. Reluctant to stay, now forced to be committed for a five day stay, Craig works through his feelings with the help staff psychiatrist, Dr. Minerva (Viola Davis). Once, the un- cool kid in school, is a now "Cool Craig." Craig, realizes his life is really worth living for.

Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson, Sugar), It's Kind of a Funny Story, gives plenty of animation, retrospect and music as audio components. Boden and Fleck, do a superb job coinciding the music with animation. One scene, when Craig is the vocals on music night. He "rocks- out" Davie Bowie's Under Pressure.  It's kind of a Funny Story, is a whimsical, light- hearted story, that combines humor and seriousness into a unique story.
