Unlike some great movie sequels which brought in a heavy duty director so as to "save" the franchise or get it started again (ala Star Trek: Nemesis) and failed miserably because of a lack of knowlege about the franchise, Bryan Singer does a bang up job using old scores, old Marlon Brando film scenes, and keeps the dream alive about our hero from Krypton. The special effects, especially on HD DVD, are spectacular. One scene showing a crashing plane wherein Kal El attempts to stop the crash in mid-air, you can see the rippling of aluminum on the wings as Superman slows the plane's decent. This along with mind blowing audio on your 5.1 (or more) stereo system brings it right into your living room in a way that brings you into the movie unlike ever before. This is one of many such scenes where the latest tech in movieland is making the unbelievable seemingly realistic--or at least you want it to be real after watching it. The character portrayals by the "new" Superman actor and the rest of the cast were well chosen, and giving Brandon Routh a chance to show his stuff was a match made in heaven when it came to giving him the role. Remember, there was another actor who came out of no where to play the Man of Steel years ago who most of us had never heard of then, and from that point on we were convinced that a "man could fly". For that matter, too, God bless you Christopher Reeve, and we are glad that this dynasty of movies has been resurrected even as a tribute to your characterization of the Last Son of Kryptonn you shared with us so long ago.
