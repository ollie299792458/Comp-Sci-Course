Colm Meaney like you've never seen him before.  If you can imagine the oft-befuddled chief engineer from Star Trek: DS9 as a hard working, tough-loving Irish father, then you must have already seen "The Snapper".  Set in Ireland, the story revolves around a middle to lower class family and the troubles they face when their oldest daughter gets pregnant.
It's humorous, touching, and sensible.  The acting is great, and the family dialogue seems like family interaction.  These lines are the kinds of things that run through everyone's head, whether or not we have the guts to actually say them out loud.  Even with its familiar family settings though, the movie retains its originality, telling a not uncommon story with a very original feel.
Anyone who's not opposed to some foul language will enjoy this movie.  It has a bit of a tendency to lag in the middle, and it doesn't really seem to arrive anywhere when it's finished, but it's well worth the investment of and hour and a half.
