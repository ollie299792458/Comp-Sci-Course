Sure, the movie was not (from what I know) completely accurate in terms of the conditions of Thai prisons.  And I do agree at times the prison seemed so sunny, too friendly, too cheerful, etc to be realistic.  But I think that the plot is that of a tale of friendship as much as it is of serving time in a Thai prison.
Most importantly, I think that anyone who is a first time traveler or planning on backpacking throughout Southeast Asia really should see this film.  Darlene and Alice were typical girls from USA Suburbia.  They had just finished school (like many who are about to do a gap year or some backpacking) and went to Thailand because it was exotic, different, faraway... They really didn't know much about Thai culture before they set out.  
Sadly, they stayed in Thailand for much longer than they had planned to -- locked up in a women's prision (probably Lard Yao), for carrying drugs.  Without devulging the plot, it is fair to say that they were innocent.  
Again, another harsh reminder that if you are heading to Southeast Asia (or really any developing area), you need to be really careful.  Watch this, read Sandra Gregory's "Forget you Had a Daughter," and don't try anything stupid (or don't be coerced, tricked, etc).  Southeast Asia is a wonderful place, and you will have a blast.  Just know that there are consequences if you are caught with anything.
