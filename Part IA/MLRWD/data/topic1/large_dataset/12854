What more could you ask for in a movie?  A well rounded cast that ranges from the obscure to the well recognized and a story that touchs on almost every human emotion.  You have a modern day friendship that transends age and a historical friendship that transends race, one that transends culture (could Ruth and Idgie come from more different back gorunds?) and yet all of these individuals come together to experience the magic of love.  And as an added "bonus", just when you think you have all of the answers and have the plot all figured out there is one last twist that will change your mind.  Being a native Alabamian I am very proud of the book, written by fellow Alabamian Fannie Flagg, that this movie is based on and I hope that somewhere in our state there was a Whistle Stop and a Ruth and Idgie.  One correction is that this movie WAS NOT filmed in Alabama as reported by another reviewer, it was filmed in neighboring Juliette, Georgia and if you go to the Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe website there is the wonderful story of this sleepy little town and how it was reborn through this movie.  If your ever in the area of Juliette stop by sometime and have a plate of fried green tomatoes, they really are wonderful!
