I was pleased to purchase season three and even more pleased to watch all fourteen hours in one sitting (leaving me late for work the next morning.)
The third season is all about growing up. I have read the reviews and I see people are upset by the "dullness" of the season when in reality it is the most exciting.
Season three shows every character growing and rounding out their characteristics and behaviors.
The character Brian begins to take a stand on what is important and though most people do not like him, I admit he and Melanie are my favorites.
Justin also takes a stand and this time he stands up to someone who hurts him. And as he says, "Brian never made me promises, you did." I think people have been forgetting that broken promises can be as heartbreaking as anything else.
Melanie and Lindsay this season take a very interesting turn. Lindsay becomes much more dominant and Melanie seems to have a new respect for her partner that shows in her decision making. 
Onto Ted and Emmit. I adore Ted's character (he is most like the gay men I know, insecure but wonderful.) His dark fall into the world of drugs should be seen as acting gold. And Emmit's support of a lover and his own heartbreak (and career moves) are thrilling. Though he does seem to play the abused housewife.
Michael and Ben. Oh, what to say. This relationship grows the most this season. We see a loving couple grapple with issues from work to home and overcome them all. I adore both characters and this season shows their personalities in sync.
One thing I miss and of course thank you womever for mentioning it... Michael and Brian's friendship has been pushed to just three or four scenes out of the entire season. I am hoping season four will pick their friendship back up.
