After watching this movie in its entirety for the first time and actually giving it some thought, I came to the conclusion that I hated the director for cheap skating us with a short version of what very well could've been a masterpiece in anime.  Though the beginning prelude speaking of the Great Mother has little effect on the movie, I believe that what makes this movie so worthwhile is its skillful animation and the personality of the main characters Tsunami Shijyo and Chen &amp; Huang Long.  Though the movie borrows from Bio Hunter with its idea to have an innocent, pure guy turn into a hideous demon, the movie is unique in the way it unfolds.  The main things that irritated me about the movie were its duration of 45 minutes, its tendency to leave the viewer waiting for something to happen when it simply builds up to an anticlimactic ending, and most importantly, the brevity of the final battle between Tsunami and the brains behind the operation, Mr. Takayami.  Amazon.com's review couldn't have been more accurate when it said the fight was over before it even began.  About two hits were exchanged before Mr. Takayami met his untimely demise.  Other than these shortcomings, "Twilight of the Dark Master" is still an interesting movie that is worth watching so long as the viewer doesn't expect very much out the plot as a whole.
