A charming movie about letting go...Daphne Wilder (Keaton), 60, single, and mother to three successful daughters takes it upon herself to select a mate for her youngest daughter Milly (played to perfection by Moore). By placing a personal ad on the internet and filtering out all the rejects, Daphne has selected an equally successful and gorgeous architect Jason (Tom Hank's greatest discovery Tom Everett Scott), however Milly has chosen Johnny (theatre actor Gabriel Macht), a single father raising a son with love of music and tattoos.
Dismayed that Milly would choose a musician over the perfect architect, Daphne tries to run Milly's life and finally realizes that despite her good intentions she has to let go and let Milly make her own mistakes. Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls) gives a fantastic performance as Daphne's oldest daughter/psychiatrist Maggie. Piper Perabo (Cheaper by the Dozen)  also strikes a cord as the middle daughter Mae, who both try to persuade their mother to let Milly lead her own life. Stephen Collins (7th Heaven) also gives a memorable performance as Johnny's dad Joe, who teaches Daphne a thing or two about love, life, and letting go.
