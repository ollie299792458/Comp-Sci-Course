To Kill a Mockingbird
 To Kill a Mockingbird, starring Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, Brock Peters, Robert Duvall, and James Anderson, and directed by Robert Mulligan, is a pretty faithful adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee, a relative of Robert E. Lee.  It is the story of a wise and kind man, Atticus Finch (Peck) raising  a 10-year-old boy, Jem (Alford) and a 6-year-old girl, Scout (Badham) in a  small Alabama town in 1932, during the Great Depression with their friend  Dill Harris, played by John Megna.  Atticus, a lawyer, defends a black man  named Tom Robinson (Peters), accused of raping a white woman, just  as he defends his children from racism as personified by Bob Ewell  (Anderson) and from fear of the unknown, as personified by their mysterious  neighbor, Boo Radley (Duvall)  I think To Kill a Mockingbird is a great film.  It also  helps me learn what it was like back in the Great Depression.  The theme is  walking in somebody else's shoes, a figure of speech asking for tolerance.  Part of the reason I liked it was because it centered on kids.  The kids  may  have just been spectators in the balcony and victims in the woods, but  I think their body language helped show their feelings.  They looked  unhappy and tired in the balcony and scared in the woods.  I think  the acting was excellent.  The children often seemed natural to me.  I am  glad Gregory Peck earned an Academy Award, as Robert Duvall would in the  future.  I  liked and admired Atticus, especially during his closing  argument.  Boo Radley looked just like I imagined.  James Anderson was good  as a bigot, but I think his role could have been made more subtle.  Brock  Peters impressed me with his emotional acting, but I think his role, too,  could have been written to be more complex.  It's like in a way he was too  perfect.
