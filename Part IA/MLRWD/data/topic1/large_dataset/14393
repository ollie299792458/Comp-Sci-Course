This spectacular DVD release of "Lawrence of Arabia" is the first edition to do true justice to this masterpiece of the cinema. Not only do we get the fully restored Director's Cut, complete with the full orchestral introduction &amp; entre'act, letterboxed to view the full magnificence of the picture, the sound has been remastered wonderfully, &amp; the picture itself is sharp, vivid &amp; alive.
David Lean's remarkable film gamble starred two complete unknowns, Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, &amp; Omar Sharif as Ali. His gamble payed off big; O'Toole inhabits the role of Lawrence so completely that he even resembles the "real" Lawrence quite closely. Sharif's Ali is introduced in one of cinema's most famous scenes, an endless long shot across the desert.
There are many fine reviews of this film, most of which are much better than I can write. This collection though, is worth mentioning. The additional features are excellent, although sometimes redundant; the archival "shorts" that were used as advertising in 1960/1 are extensively recycled through the hour long documentary on the restoration of "Lawrence of Arabia" Still, they are fun to watch. The documentary itself is quite good and very informative.
This film is one of the greatest ever made. This edition is the best yet. No home that owns a DVD player should be without "Lawrence of Arabia"!
