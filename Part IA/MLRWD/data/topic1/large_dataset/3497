I was very excited to rent this film based on it's concept. The first 30 minutes or so is an excellent and fairly believable setup. I hope the following isnt a spoiler, but as you can guess from the cover of the DVD, three people are stuck on a ski lift hundreds of feet in the air.

The moment the film turns stupid however, is when they start throwing their winter clothes at the bypassing vehicle to get its attention. They could have thrown their skis or trecking polls... but no, they throw their gloves.

After an hour or so of sitting up there one of the guys gets this great idea to jump down. Naturally he breaks his legs and doesnt bleed out... which I found hilarious and medically impossible. The shock alone and normal bloodloss from a break that severe would have you dead before the wolves would come. (never mind the freezing temps, and how blood loss would cause your body temp and blood pressure to drop quickly)

I guess you could say I was bored after that... the constant screaming and crying was best watched with the mute button on.

I figure the movie is good for a date nght or cheap thrill, when you hope to console your scared girly by putting an arm around her. Thats why I suppose I give it two stars... as for the rest of it, it didnt hold my attention.
