What can I say about 'Hocus Pocus'? Only that it has been a movie that I watch not only every October, but every other time of the year when I'm feeling sad, happy, or just really nostalgic. And I don't know what's taken me so long to get the DVD, because for the past 10 years or so I've been watching the old VHS tape that I recorded from 1998 (which I will still keep of course because it has the old Disney Channel commercials- oh, sweet nostalgia), but I guess better late then never. And although I don't know what person in their right mind could not like this movie, I know that there are some people out there who pick on it because it was a box office flop with a campy/corny atmosphere making it incapable of being a quality movie. And the critic ridicule is completely justified because all of those things are true. But the fact of the matter is...I DON'T CARE! And neither should anyone else. I will defend this movie till the bitter end because it was a viable part of my childhood, and reminds me of a time when life wasn't quite so complicated, and I still believed in magic, and Halloween was one of the best times of the year. So if you haven't seen this movie, (But honestly, who hasn't seen this movie by now? The 20th anniversary (2013) is just around the corner for crying out loud...)DO NOT listen to the critics! Watch it because it is a fun Halloween movie that will entertain you for about 90 min or so and may just take you back to your own childhood memories of Halloween. Like I said, I don't like this movie, I love it.
P.S The order came on the estimated delivery date. Good job Amazon!
