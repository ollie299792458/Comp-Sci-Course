Ghost in the Shell's success has always been a bit of a fluke, as it was to be Appleseed that was Shirow's magnum opus.  I really wanted to like Solid State Society, I really did, but just found it to be very lacking.

The first season of Stand Alone was amazing, as it managed to capture some of the feel of the comic: counter terrorist ops fighting terrorists and drinkin a cold one afterwards.  Second season was passable, grasping at straws to develop characters meant to be nothing more than a talking head or plot device, plus the inclusion of a Mary Sue villain.

Still, I'd hoped that all the money that the GitS property has made studio IG over the years could've produced something better than what was essentially an almost two hour episode of Stand Alone with at most three minutes of amazing action animation.

Had they simply retold the classic Puppet Master story from the comic using the Stand Alone characters, it could've been a much better movie.  The further GitS breaks from the original source material (specifically the original comic run), generally the weaker it becomes.  I can't help but think that by borrowing more heavily from Man Machine Interface (particularly the whole rogue Motoko and Motoko's split consciousness bit), Solid State Society lost the potential to be an action packed thriller to wrap up the series in a hail of gun-fire and car chases.  It all felt rather unsatisfying.

After the unyieldingly convoluted, pandering, and nearly unreadable debacle that was Man Machine Interface, I hope, as a Shirow fan, that the Ghost in the Shell franchise can be laid to rest with some of its dignity in tact; a solemn procession that should not end with a 21 gun salute, but rather a crudely drawn Batou going colon "d" while firing a miniature shoulder mounted rocket into the air.
