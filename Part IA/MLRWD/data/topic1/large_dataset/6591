Okay, I admit it.  I saw this in the theaters (more than once, a lot more than once).  I own it on video.  And now I own it on DVD.
I'm amazed but two things-- how much it annoys me, and how much it continues to move me.  The first time I saw it, I started crying at the end of the Third Act.  And  each time I saw it, it got worse until I reached the point of crying during  the overture.  So yes, it does pack an emotional wallop.
But, there are  still some things that annoy me.  First, the whole thing has been recorded  under pitch.  The film, the video, the DVD are all under pitch throughout.  Was that a mistake, or a conscious effort to stretch the time a little?  Second, everyone complains about Domingo being too old (perhaps following  the lead of Maltin).  Domingo's age has never bothered me.  Stratas' vocal  age does.  I keep hoping as I watch it that she won't sound so tired and  inappropriate at the end of Act I, but she does.  I just tell myself that  she will sound better later on.  (And singing to the wine goblets in Sempre  Libera always strikes me as funny:  will she break them with her high  notes?)
And why bother cutting the doctor scene from the beginning of Act  3?
I might seem to have a lot of complaints, but the complaints never  explain why I feel compelled to watch this again and again.  For that, the  director and singers receive some credit, but the real credit is owed to  Verdi.
Buy this, watch it, then watch it again.
