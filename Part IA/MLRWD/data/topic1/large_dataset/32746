I could call myself an amateur music historian. I prefer to think of myself as a music history nut. No study of modern music history would be complete without viewing this video. It tells how Tom Dowd, the lead audio engineer at Atlantic Records, helped create his sound. Interviews with Dowd help music history students and rock music history lovers understand what a profound influence audio engineers have had on the sounds we all enjoy.
  Tom explains, mostly in layman's terms, how he created the sounds that went onto the records and how the artists were "discovered" by Atlantic, Stax, and other record producers. Many stars in the business are interviewed, from Ray Charles, to the Allman Brothers, showing how Dowd helped them create the sound they were looking for without him being too overbearing on sensitive artists' creativity.  In doing so, Dowd was as much a A&R man and a publicist as he was an audio engineer. He was nothing short of a genius and this video tells his story as well as the story of music creation during early rock'n'roll better than any of the books I've read.
  More than this, the video tells how Dowd, Atlantic, and Stax were foremost in breaking down the walls of segregation in the south through music and helped bring soul music to the masses.  I highly recommend this video to anyone who loves rock music and would like to know more about it's history.
