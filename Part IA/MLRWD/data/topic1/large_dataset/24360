Oh my darling, Oh my darling, Oh my darling Clementine!

This Western will make you cry! Real Men Cry Tears! The singing alone will make you homesick for the OLD WILD WEST once again!

Flee the cities of the 21st century! Flee the traffic snarls! Flee the office building! Flee technology!!

Go back, young man! Go back to that OLD WILD WEST once again!

Ride your bay back into time, back to Arizona Territory, and into that bronco-busting gambling girly time of THE O.K. CORRAL!

Feel the desert breeze! Drink in the cold well water! Be dazzled by the gold-dust! Stare in wonder at the arriving GIRL IN TOWN! Be amazed!

Romance, another shot of whiskey, church hymns, foot-stomping barn-dance, etiquette and protocol, yes-mam and yes-sir, and all things wonderful, now passed into history yonder!

Ohhhh, you'll cry all right, mister. This one will take your soul to the altar! Weep for the time you SHOULD have lived in -- the good ol' 19th century!

Ohhhh, my darling, Ohhhh, my darling, Ohhhh my darling, CLEMENTINE!!!!
