At the outset I want to say that prior to getting this dvd collection, I was not a fan of the show.  Due in large part to the media, I did not think this was going to be good.  Quite simply, I thought that the show simply took easy shots at the party in power.  But as the 2008 Presidential campaigning started and I saw this set at a reasonable price on Amazon (I bought it used), I, a fan of comedy, decided to give this a shot.  And I must say that I have rarely been this pleasantly surprised.  Sure, I think that if you look at the show as a whole, they probably do take more shots at the Republicans, but it is nowhere near as skewered as some would have you believe.  And particularly this set of dvds, which pokes even fun at both sides for the 2004 Presidential election.

I hope that the powers that be at Comedy Central give us "Indecision 2008" on dvd at the end of this year (we all know they have plenty of material already, and we all know this Presidential election is going to give us a lot more comedy between now and November 2008).

Sincerely,
A Former Non-Fan

PS - THIS is what the Colbert Report dvd SHOULD have been like!
