Sequels and trilogies can be a minefield.  Some franchises can maintain or build momentum with a strong sophomore effort, but few can carry that a step further.  All too often, the third flick simply can't carry the weight of the first two and collapses under the weight of expectations.  The Bourne Ultimatum is the third flick in the Jason Bourne series starring Matt Damon as the amnesia-prone CIA killing machine.  And unlike so many others, Ultimatum is a third effort that continues the tense, edge-of-your-seat, action-packed prescedent created by the first two movies.

Ultimatum picks the story up right where Supremacy left off.  I won't delve into the plot as not to spoil anything, but this movie delivers it all - a rare feat for a third chapter in a franchise.  Chalk full of action - the chase scenes - both on-foot and in vehicles - are intense.  The fight scenes are frentic.  And the locations are exotic and beautiful.

If you enjoyed Identity and Supremacy, you certainly won't be disappointed by Ultimatum.
