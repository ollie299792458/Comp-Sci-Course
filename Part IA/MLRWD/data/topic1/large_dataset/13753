This movie wasn't good, nor was it bad. I actually had no idea how many stars to give it so I rated it somewhere in the middle. This movie is only watchable because I've never seen a movie like it. It wasn't exactly offensive or shocking to me, except the scenes where a grown man has sex with a child. What bothered me throughout the movie is how in the sex scenes, each girl is completely emotionless like nothing is even happening. Not a sound, not a movement, no facial expression....you can say "blah blah shes desensitized to the situation and cold inside", but come on, so unrealistic. And it was painful to watch a CLEARLY 30-something year old actress (the obese black one) try to act 12 years old. I enjoyed the scenes where the hitman kills that abortionist, it seemed really believable to me how freaked out he was....good acting in that scene. I REALLY disliked that little black girl in the beginning and ending of the film...yeah, shes cute, but can she talk anymore robotic? Like she is reading from cue cards, and why can't she keep her weird tongue in her mouth while she talks? It's creepy. This movie isn't very interesting or filled with much emotion, but I wanted to see what would happen next. I would recommend seeing it only because I'm sure you've never seen a movie like it.
