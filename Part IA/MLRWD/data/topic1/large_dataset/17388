If ever you wanted an excuse to *not* travel abroad, see TransSiberian!

One of the year's best performances by Emily Mortimer (Jessie) highlight this high suspense thriller set mostly in the snowy backdrop of Siberia.

Woody Harrelson does a fine job of playing opposite Mortimer as her clueless husband and the audience is placed in his role throughout.

Kate Mara and Eduardo Noriega also deliver good performances as the "strange" couple that join Harrelson and Mortimer on their journey from Beijing to Moscow.

This film starts out real slow, about 50 minutes before we begin to experience some suspense but it keeps you gripped throughout.

Although I recommend this film, I feel the script was difficult to understand as far as Mortimer's motive for silence even in the presence of what would almost certainly be the death of one of her travel companions as well as of her husband and herself. I found myself screaming at the screen for her to talk.

The film's ending left her motive(s) ambiguous toward her husband as well as 1 of her travel companions. We really don't know if she is having some kind of religious guilt or fear of loosing her husband. Finally, we have no real motive, other than her possibly relieving her conscience, for her action in the next to last scene.

The audience is left, kind of like her husband, with a woman of mystery. I will lower this to 3 stars but still recommend it for those of you who like suspenseful thrillers. I welcome further discussion as to what you think we are suppose to take from this woman's behavior.
