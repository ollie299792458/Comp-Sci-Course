People dislike this movie because they don't get it.  "Constantine" is not a horror film.  To the contrary: part of what makes the movie captivating is the main character's jaded, unimpressed, business-as-usual approach to battling demons.  We also get a frisky Gabriel and a droll Satan.  I loved the originality. The movie is a character study, an exploration of good and evil, a tale of redemption, and a bunch of fun. I don't believe in Catholicism or Hell, but I appreciated the fact that the movie had a point-of-view on these issues, and I enjoyed watching the characters struggle within its framework. Keanu is well-cast and delivers a spot-on performance as a cynical, reluctant hero.  His restraint is a necessary balance to the extravagance of some of the other characters, notably the fabulous Tilda Swinton. Keanu-bashing is a tired old sport for lemming-minded critics.  I enjoyed Keanu's performance in this movie as much as I liked him in "Hardball."  Redemption movies don't work unless the actor is credible when he behaves badly, and credible when he reaches for something better within himself.  Not every actor can do this.  Keanu can.  I liked this movie because of his performance, not in spite of it.  I welcome a sequel.
