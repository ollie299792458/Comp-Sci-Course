This film has a relaxing quality about it that just soothes the soul. The cast is very good together as well, and the film really does have a nice ensemble quality even if Liv takes up the majority of screen time. I bought the DVD after watching on IFC, and the television version has english subtitles when Italian is being spoken. The DVD does not, as many others have mentioned. This is very annoying, because you do lose some sub-plot information by not knowing what is being said between characters speaking Italian.

I would have loved to have seen a director's cut with commentary. Anyway, regardless, this is a great film for any time you want to really escape for a couple of hours. The film is such that after you've watched it, you feel as if you've become one of the summer house guests. I think I read another review somewhere that was critical of the fact that this area of Italy is shown as being "old country" and that these areas are much more urbanized than portrayed. However, I think this is actually being addressed in the film when they show the television station/towers being built and comment on it.

All in all, I do love this film. I love watching it, I love watching certain scenes, and it's very, very relaxing!
