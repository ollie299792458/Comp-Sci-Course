To me, the film's most compelling theme is how Almasy's personal determination to keep his promise to the injured Kathryn has tragic political implications, notably for his partner Maddox and for the spy/thief David Caravaggio.  Moving deftly back and forth in time, the narrative pulls a whole group of interesting characters into the web of "the English patient," tracing cause and effect through episodes of love, danger, and death.  The performances are exceptional, with Ralph Fiennes at his brooding, intense best and the beautiful Juliette Binoche full of spunky life but also vulnerable angst.  My only complaint concerns how Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) seems on the verge of confronting/killing Almasy (Fiennes) several times in a rather unconnected manner.  It provides opportunities to drive forward the plot in the past but seems a little incoherent in terms of the "present" plotline.  Only in his one major--and quite harrowing--flashback sequence does Caravaggio really come to life for me.  But that's a minor quibble in the face of such a brilliantly developed film.  The cinematography is gorgeous, and the romantic score by Gabriel Yared adds a great deal of poignancy, particularly at the very end when we finally understand the full significance of the film's opening image.  I love, too, the final contrasting cuts between Amashy's doomed flight and Hannah's sunlit trip toward an unknown future.  It's the yin and yang of past and present, destruction and possibility.  Two types of viewers should avoid this film: philistines who identify with rather than laugh at Elaine and simple-minded cultural conservatives (who apparently miss the fact that illicit passion leads to dire consequences in this film).
