I was in my local Target Store this past Monday and I came across a copy of Some Kind of Wonderful on DVD FOR $8.99AU
I was in my early teens when this movie was released back in 1987. I remember enjoying the movie and every time I see the 3 lead actors in other productions I think back and remember that he or she were in "Some Kind of Wonderful"
At first I could not remember much about the movie as I had not seen it for over 19 years.
Last night I sat down to view the 80's teen film. I can not tell you how wonderful this movie is. The story line is Typical and Predictable. However as other reviews have mention it is the lead actors that pull of this production.
Watching this gem of a movie took me back to my teen years and remembering why I first feel in love with this production.
This is far the best of John Hughes movies of the 80's. Outstanding even Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club.
If you can only have one of John Hughes movies from the 80's, Some Kind of Wonderful would be it.
With a wonderful cast and soundtrack at a great price you can not go wrong.

NOTE For Parents: This movie has Course Language which is what gives the movie its rating.
