As someone who is new to working out I found this to be an excellent video.

The workouts are broken up into 2 20 minute sessions (or 2 31 minutes which include warm up and cool down).

For Beginners:

I found the moves easy to pick up, taking me only about 3 times to start really getting the routines down.

She divides the 20 minute workout into several blocks.  After each one she slows you down to a march and takes you through some breathing.  This really helped me out!  It gave me a chance to catch my breath.  I've done workouts before that never let up and I find myself just shutting down before i could finish.  That is not the case here!

I also found her to be very motivating and upbeat.  Every time she says: "You're not going to quit on me now, Of Course You're Not!" I always keep pushing.  She constantly talks to you, and everything she says still feels just as motivating on workout 20 as it did on number 1.

The time really goes by fast.  Even when I first started and I didn't think I could get through a whole workout (oh no!).  Before you know it you're done.

Since I still consider myself a beginner I can't really say what someone more advanced would be looking for in a workout.  I feel that intermediate level people might still find this fun.  I do think that people more advanced may not get the challenge out this workout that they would probably want.

All in all, I highly recommend this.
