Once again Stanley has the last laugh.  People balk at the "slow, fragmented, boring, trite construction of the plot and dialog".  Well, folks, that's the point.  Always experimenting with new ways to construct a  film (don't forget that the "two film" construction of Full Metal  Jacket was reviled when it was released only to be praised later) he has  given us this time a picture of ourselves in our daily trite, fragmented  and ,dare I say, occasionally complex lives.  Our dreams, and dreams are a  central focus of this film, impact our conscience and sub-conscience with  every bit of force as "real" events. It can be said that our  dreams help create our waking life and our waking life creates our dreams.  So once again, Stanley merely holds up the mirror and we often do not like  what we see.
By taking us on a journey through the intertwined dream/real  lives of Dr. Bill and Alice, Stanley has given us a precious gift though  which to view our own lives. All of the poeple in the film play day-to-day  roles that are, in many ways, at odds with who they really are.  The  incongruity between the inner self and what other people see helps to set  both Bill and Alice on their respective journeys of self discovery.  But  who's journey of self discovery are we watching at any given time? Ah...one  of the secrets of Eyes Wide Shut that will only be given up with  time.
Mysterious?...yes. Frustrating at times?...you bet. Richly  rewarding if given the time?...absolutely.
Watch for colors, double  characters, self warning, clues as to whether scenes are "real"  or "dream".  
One important thing to point out. In the scene  where the note is passed to Dr. Bill through the gate of the Orgy house, he  looks up at a security camera.  The camera is pointed at US..."stop  this line of inquiry or there will be grave consequences for you and your  family".  Indeed.
