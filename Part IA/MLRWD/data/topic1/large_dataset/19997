I watched this movie earlier tonight. It's definitely not a great horror movie, but there was enough to keep me watching and it had a few moments that really made me jump.

The house was really creepy. I would love to live in a big old house like that.

I didn't have any problems at all with the acting or dialogue. After all, you don't sit down to watch a movie like this expecting Academy Award winning performances.

The biggest problem, for me, is that it tries to incorporate too many horror genres into one. Is it a supernatural horror movie like "Poltergeist"? Is it a haunted house movie like "Amityville Horror"? Is it a slasher movie like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"? Or is it zombie movie like "Night of the Living Dead"? Apparently, it's all of the above. As a result, there was nothing really original, and it was confusing as to which direction this was going. I think it would have been better if they just focused on one theme.

One thing that was truly horrific was Denise Crosby's haircut.
