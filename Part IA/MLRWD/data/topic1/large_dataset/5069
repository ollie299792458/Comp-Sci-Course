I dont have many words for this review. It wont be necessary for me to get into the plot and story line, because im sure you have a general idea by now, after reading these reviews, what "Johnny Belinda" is about. The only thing i can best express is the power of certain films such as this, through my current emotions and feelings. I shed allot of tears during this great and powerful film... the acting was superior, along with the direction and cinematography. Jane Wyman's performance as the deaf girl was quite heavy, to watch her transform from a sad soul, to a happy and caring woman, (with the help of Lew Ayers, the doctor) was uplifting. The fathers performance was top notch as well... all the cast was superb. This is an example of film making done solely for the viewer, for the love of the art form itself, and for the desire to make powerful movies which resonate within us for decades...

I am only 41, so i didnt grow up watching most of the early films like this, my memories are of "Cool Hand Luke" and "The longest yard", etc, etc.. but i do remember being engrossed by many old black and whites when they came on TV. I have stopped looking for films that move me from films that are made nowadays. I am very clear that the real treasures come from decades way before our present time. Dont get me wrong, there are some classics made presently... but even those as brilliant as they are dont have the same affect on me as the great black and whites of the 40's, 50's and 60's.

These film classics reach into my heart and soul and are often medicine for the pain and madness that surrounds the human family today, and we all need to feel that there is still hope..

Peace
