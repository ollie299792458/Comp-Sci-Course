According to my opinion this movie is a cult classic. The atmosphere and humour contained within is such an addiction. I truly rate this movie as being ranked in the top 100 best movies of all time. When I first watched it I was immediatly absorbed in to it completly that I viewed it on repeated occasions. After that it changed my entire perspective on movies.

Oliver Stone is a director to be reckoned with. His distinctive style of directing is in a class of its own. No other director can match up to his calibre. His previous movies suc as 'jfk' and 'natural born killers' received much critisism and box office success. However this venture was in a different category. He has managed to make a brilliant adaptation of John Ridley's novel 'straw dogs'. It stays loyal to the novel as well. The transition of the novel to the screen has resulted in a spectacular outcome. For Oliver Stone this movie probably did not require as much effort on his part due to the simplicity of the plot itself, but still the movie is high on quality.

The main character is suffering from a case of bad luck syndrome. The movie presents this from a humourous perspective. Bobby's character has negative as well as positive shades. The movie totally relies on his presence to progress through all the segmants. The theme is in the same vain as 'body heat', 'the hot spot', and 'red rock west'. Many situations will seem reminiscent from those movies. This is a symbolic movie and many metephors are present in the scenes.
In regards to the plot, substance is low. However the cinematography, close up camera angles really add to the movies quality. At certain points the movie will feel like a comedy drama with elements of seriousness. The close up frames captures the human feelings of the characters at those moments.
The cinematography is truly the highlight of the movie as well as the scenes between Billy Bob and Sean Penn. The chemistry in the interactions betwen the two make history. The pace of the movie is slow but the viewer's curiousity for the character makes one watch on in eagerness. Maybe a ten to fifteen minute edit would enhance it overall.

Ennio Morricone's background score injects life and a certain atmosphere in to the movie. The combination of western sounds with his italian style of music is a treat to listen to. The music compliments to the atmosphere of the movie and to the feeling of the lanscape of Arizona.

This is the perfect getaway movie if you enjoyed 'Thelma and Louise'
