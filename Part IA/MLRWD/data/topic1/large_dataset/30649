I know from the subject some of you are thinking, Why the hell is he talking about Dan O'Bannons The Return of the Living Dead, I'm not so take a 20mg Valium and relax.
Dawn of the Dead (2004) Marks the Return of the Living Dead to the Horror genre. This Re-envisioning of George A. Romero's 1978 Cult Classic is much different than the original. The Concept of Flesh Eating Zombies and survivor's holed up in a shopping mall stays the same, But everything that made the original great is changed to update the film for todays action Driven Audiences.
Dawn 2004, is not the cheesy remake some would make it out to be, However, it moves with the pace of a High budget Action film that audiences are sure to like. The Often Morbid humor and deliberate offensiveness helps progress the film to heights not acheived in horror in quite sometime.
Do yourself a Favor, if you like your horror with a little gore, a little sarcasm, and lots of zombies. Dawn of the Dead 2004 is the film for you.
Remember the unrated cut has 9 minutes of never before seen footage.
