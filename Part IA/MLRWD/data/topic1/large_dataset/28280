I've heard some pronounce the word "evolution" as if it were "evil-lution", and here's a movie that makes it evil indeed -- most delightfully so. Don't look for "hard science" here; the "science" is as spoofy as anything else about the film. But this is about the most fun I've seen in a science fiction / comedy movie in a long time. What a fortuitous film for several of its performers. David Duchovny needed to show that there's life after X-Files, and he does so with flying colors. Julianne Moore needed to bounce back from her doomed attempt to make HANNIBAL work -- an all to easy to scapegoat role. Both she and Jodie Foster are capable actresses, but just weren't born to play the same character. Julianne Moore needed a recovery from being left in that unfair lurch (after all who's to say that Jodie Foster could have done any better if she'd been the one to go second in that role). And in EVOLUTION, Julianne delivers along with the rest of the cast. Even Sean William Scott, so unenviably typecast as an idiot, gets to put something of a variant twist on that persona and get the last laugh this time. Too many movies today try to juggle action, human drama and (sometimes) comedy, and as often as not those disparate elements stumble over one another rather than meshing. But here's a delightful relief from all that. Even if comedy reigns supreme in EVOLUTION, the characters are memorable and likeable, and interesting plot twists leave it by no means short on action as well in this seamless whole.
