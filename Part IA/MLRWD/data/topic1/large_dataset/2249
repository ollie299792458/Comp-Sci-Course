Other reviewers have called this a "Must See" Documentary, and that cannot be over-stated!  The public truly must become aware of and informed about what is being done, behind our backs, to the food we eat to sustain our lives.  This film exposes the greed and the frightening prospects of corporations gaining patents on the essential elements of life for power and profit, and that while being dismissive of the dangers they manage to circumvent any oversight as to safety of the products they unleash on a public which is largely unaware.  This documentary is interesting and absorbing but it is also an important wake-up call for people to become informed about this issue so that some sanity can be regained over our lives, our democracy, our agriculture, our food industry.  The recomendations in the last section of the film about supporting local sustainable agriculture are an important step to regaining control by "voting" with our food decisions and purchases.  The DVD also has very interesting and informative extra interviews.
