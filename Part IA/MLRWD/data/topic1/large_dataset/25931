Technology is starting to get it right.  My taste in film runs the gamut from the sublime (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041KKY9W">A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop [Blu-ray</a>])(see my review) to the pure escapist <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HHX9OQ">Girls Guns & G-Strings</a> and I try to stay away from American cinema simply because it is old.

I do however appreciate what I perceive to be classic cinema i.e.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWONB2">Casablanca [Blu-ray</a>]or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC7PQ2">Touch Of Evil (50th Anniversary Edition)</a> and that appreciation is now hieghtened by the advent of blu ray.  The quality of this film is outstanding.

I am also totally satisfied by the outstanding service provided by Amazon.  The deliveries always arrive when promised and rarely if the ordered item is unavailable they will let you know promptly and give you the option of cancelling or continuing with the order.
