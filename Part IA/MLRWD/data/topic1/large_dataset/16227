Peter Gabriel always manages to find new ways to present himself and his music.  The "Growing Up Live" DVD is no exception.  This show is a refreshing blend of sight and sound that manages to put a new spin on the concert experience.  Gabriel chose not to lumber around the concert circut in 2002/03 armed with pyrotechnics, lasers, and mammoth video screens commonly found on most concert tours.  Instead, he chose to present both music and visuals in a striking, yet simple way.

You are not bombarded with effects here, but they do make an appearance when called for and the result is seemless.  Nothing appears forced or silly.  The unique mix of images that accompany "The Barry Williams Show" fit the song's subject matter perfectly.  The simple motif of a boat moving around the stage for "Mercy Street" enhances the loneliness noted in the lyrics.  And Gabriel's ability to sing "Downside Up" from his postion on stage during that song is quite an impressive feat for a gentleman of 50+ years!

Yet, Gabriel also manages to show he doesn't necessarily need massive props or effects to do what he does.  The stellar performances of "Here Comes The Flood" and "Father, Son" that bookend this concert show him to still be a talented singer and outstanding songwriter.  Many of today's performers fall flat without lavish production or dressed up instrumentation.  However, Gabriel does not and produces his most impressive performances as a result.

Technically, the DVD enhances all of these qualities and builds on them.  The picture is flawless digital perfection and the DTS soundtrack is stunning to hear (if you have the equipment capable for it).  And if your curious as to how on earth this was all put together, there is an excellent documentary on creating the stage show.

"Growing Up Live" is an outstanding concert packed with truly original ideas, both visually and musically.  It is a unique presentation for a truly unique artist.
