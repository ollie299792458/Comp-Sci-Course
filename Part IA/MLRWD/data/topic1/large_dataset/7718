I liked (four stars) all other seasons of Criminal Minds; however, I could only give three stars on this one.  Shows/cases were interesting, but when talking about crime shows (such as CSI, Law&Order, etc...) they are always interesting.  So, question is the storyline and casting.  I believe getting rid of JJ was a mistake.  She brought normalcy and realism to the show.  While other profilers/agents could be replaced (such was the case in NCIS and not to forget Gideon from this show), JJ was different.  And the new girl was useless.  On top of that, I believe JJ was fan favorite.  Also, storyline was weak.  They tried to give each character a story of their own, but failed. Especially, I found Prentiss' sub-story to be ridiculus and uninteresting.  Her story ran through three plus episodes and I fast-forwarded good 25% of her story (I didn't miss anything).  For other characters, their stories were irrelevant and unnoticeable.  However, if you stick to each case per episode, then the show is worth watching, but definitely NOT WORTH Buying.
