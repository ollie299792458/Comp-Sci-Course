Cowboy Bebop is an action flic set in a futuristic time in both space and planet side about a group of bounty hunters that just never seem to get the big score. 
The graphics are mostly standard anime drawn, but in space  they added some computer graphics. Now some don't like this, but I have to  say that it was done very well, and never detracted form the scene. If  anything, I feel it added to it as it was never overdone.
I also enjoyed  the well-done combat sequences, be they either martial arts or the  gunfights.  I also liked the added comic tones in some of these fights.  They were well drawn and fluid, and were fully detailed, not like the  annoying 'still frame of combat with sound tactic' I have seen is some of  late.
Lastly, the icing on the cake was the music. Each piece fit the  scene perfectly, only made it better.
The fifth episode also added some  insight and detail to the characters, and really hooked you to go right out  and get the next set, which I plan to do as soon as I am done with this  review. :)
