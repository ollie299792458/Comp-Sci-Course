I have owned the MGM DVD of "The Birdcage" since 1998.  I decided to watch it today and, after all this time,  I STILL love it!  The film boasts quality comedic characterizations, tight editing, vibrant wonderful color and music that captures not only the tropical flavors of the Florida coast, but accents the hilarious gems of irony that run throughout the whole film.

Sure, there are a few minor missteps in scripting and line delivery. But, it's ENTERTAINMENT . . . NOT a socio-political treatise on the evolving state of the human condition.  Those who try to find profound philosophy in fanciful farce will only meet up with disappointment. Those who feel compelled to (or rather obsessed with) making "play-by-play," nitpicking value comparisons of this remake to the original "La Cage Aux Folles" should lighten up.  You might as well compare Little Women to Desperate Housewives . . . they just aren't meant to be mentioned in the same breath!

I have watched the original AND the remake, and I can appreciate the merits and weaknesses of both.  Each film expresses its own unique flavor and personality--playing off of and satirizing the popular contemporary cultural and historical context in which each was created . . . THAT is the attitude one should take when watching either of the films.

Aside from that, I wonder if there is any way for MGM (or another production company) to produce an anniversary / collectors edition of The Birdcage? Hmmmm, perhaps they could include new special features such as:

*Movie Commentary--Maybe an audio conversation with the directors, cast key crewmembers as they watch the film (With Robins Williams/Nathan Lane in the "dish" mix, it could really be a funny, unique feature).

*Special Documentary--"Uncaging the Birdcage"--look at what effect The Birdcage has had on film and society.  How life/film has changed since the time The Birdcage was released. (maybe include interviews with film critics, social commentarists, reactions of old & young audience/film-goers)

*Cast, Crew interviews--about the production, their own process of characterization, technical effects, etc.

*Outtakes/Deleted Scenes--we've heard there are SO MANY hilarious ones. We are dying to see what they are!

*Where Are They Now?--Bios of Cast, Crew, Director

*Trivia Game--Which happened in which film?  (La Cage Aux Folles vs. The Birdcage)

"The Birdcage" earned more than $124 million in its theatrical release domestically, and over $61 million overseas. Not only is it a popular mainstay on various TV channels throughout the year (which means it must get a consistently good audience rating), but there is now widespread public acceptance of similar content in both film and TV.

I am sure if whoever has the DVD copyright decides to make an anniversary / collector's edition of "The Birdcage", there will be many of us out here who would LOVE to buy it and recommend it.

In the meantime, don't hold your breath. If you're thinking about getting The Birdcage now, then hop to it already. :)  Buy it, then kick back with some popcorn & a couple of margaritas.  Watch it, laugh at it, dance to it, and THOROUGHLY enjoy it.  I certainly did!
