I admire Jason Segel for writing, starring in, playing the piano and singing in this movie. But unfortunately, except for the hilarious Russell Brand in his supporting role as a self-absorbed star, this movie just isn't very funny.

There is a lot of full frontal male nudity. And lots of sex. I know fourth- and fifth-graders think genitals and sex are just plain funny without any other jokes or plot. But this movie is rated R, for adults, and I'm an adult, and frankly, merely showing me somebody's hoo hoo isn't enough to make me laugh.

So I was bored during this movie, and it was actually kind of a downer. I'm a huge fan of Judd Apatow and crew - - but Judd Apatow is merely one producer here, and this is not a great example of a typical funny, sharp, insightful, sweet and meaningful Apatow movie. Watching it, we just kind of suffer along with this depressed shlub (Segel) and then it is over. With one last glimpse of his hoo hoo.

If you want a hilarious and worthwhile Apatow movie, please try 40 Year Old Virgin or Pineapple Express or Superbad.
