After watching the second die hard before this one I felt nothing could beat that die hard in the series. Boy was I wrong. The first Die Hard in my opinion takes the cake for the best in the series. The second one had a great storyline and lots of action but this one kept you on the edge of your seat all the way through. Bruce Willis delivers another masterpiece here and I would put this in his top 3 movies of all time acting in. The movie does a great job developing in the first half hour and then the rest of the movie was nonstop action. This movie takes extreme to its finest. Another great part about this movie is some of the catch lines in the movie. Like Yippe Kia blank. Lots of funny lines by Bruce Willis as the movie goes on so you have a bit of comedy and action to along with it. Most of the time you have a feeling of what the end is going to be like but with this movie I had no idea what was going to happen. Overall a great movie and one you must pick up if you have the chance.
