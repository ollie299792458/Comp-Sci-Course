It is possibly Shakespeare's best comedy and played by 2 of the finest thespians in our lifetime. Taylor and Burton were born to play these roles. You should have no problem with the old English.

This film demonstrates the difference between actors memorizing the lines and delivering them adequately enough, and actors who live and breath and own the part.

I personally consider it his best comedy. Light in spirit, it makes a great introduction to the bard for teenagers.

This battle of the sexes is something we can all relate to.The plot is mainly between Kate, the oldest daughter of a wealthy merchant, and Petruchio a man who must marry a wealthy wife.

Kate is too honest (or maybe too stubborn) to play the little games her 'perfect' sister is so adept and has no intention of marrying anyone.

Petruchio (Burton) cannot take no for an answer. He must wed a wealthy wife or his impoverished household will starve.

Taylor can absolutely play the shrew, yet can make us sympathize with this least favorite daughter. Burton, sexy as always, classicly trained, was made to play Shakespeare - he also plays a drunk very well. Maybe it is the accent, but I could sit listen to him even if he just read the dictionary!

It's a great work, get a bowl of popcorn and enjoy.
