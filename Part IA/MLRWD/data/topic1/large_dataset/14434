This is a good, solid work-out. I have enjoyed Keli Roberts since the early 90's. It is fun and encouraging to see Keli still enjoying what she does, and being good at it! This is a pretty hard work out, and if you do all five 10-minute segments in a row, you will have worked every single muscle in your body. You will have that great feeling of accomplishment when you are done. You can also mix and match, or just do a few 10-minute segments at a time. This is great for me who easily gets bored. I can do a new work-out every time I use this dvd if I want to, or just pick a few and do it with another work-out dvd. The pace is pretty fast, and I would not suggest it for true beginners. I would list it as intermediate.

Keli's arm sculpture segment is great and I also enjoy the bootcamp inspired segment. It will kick your butt!!! I only gave it a 4 out of 5 becuase I did not sweat as much as I do with some other work-out dvds. That is my star gage, a lot of sweat...5 stars, a little sweat ...3 stars...and so on!!! Kelis instructions are clear and her kickboxing segment really tones your legs. Enjoy it!
