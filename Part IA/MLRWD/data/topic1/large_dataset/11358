You saw that title jump off the shelf and you said "ooohh". Sorry, no nastiness in that vein. Rats. But what you get is the story of a poor soul tormented by the twin afflictions of Tourette's and OCD(they do stem from the same brain problem evidently) who is trying to get over his divorce. It's alternately comic and tragic as we watch Mark lurch from healing to dementia when he meets Charlotte, a fellow OCD sufferer who coaxes Mark into a self-help group composed of other OCD patients. A real knockout performance by Michael Sheen worthy of higher accolades, but hey, he ain't Tom Hanks and the studio doesn't have enough juice for a big run so this little film will undeservedly go ignored.

What I find hard to believe is why his doctor doesn't notice the nature of his illness and is trying to work the depression angle. I guess perhaps the setting of the film is 1980s? Only then could a doctor not notice obvious obsessive-compulsive symptoms-no one could watch a man have tics and fits plus compulsion and try to throw Paxil at it and send him on his way without nailing the problem now that these diseases are better understood. So, I guess we needed some sort of deux ex machina(an unrealistically oblivious psychiatrist) to move the plot along to have Charlotte be the person who understands him and tries to save him. Well and good; the performances are well worth the mild disbelief.
