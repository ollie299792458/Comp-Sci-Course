Gary Oldman gives a tour de force performance as Ludwig Van Beethoven. The story centers around the search of the "Immortal Beloved". There were three letters Ludwig wrote, yet not mailed, that put his heart down on paper. Who was she? There is your search.
To see Ludwig place his head on the piano to hear the notes of "Adagio Sostenuto" or "Moonlight Serenade" is beyond beautiful. Bearing in mind that Ludwig can't hear, he has to "feel" the vibrations emanting from the piano. Gary Oldman simply at his his finest, as he is really playing Beethoven!
I have seen Amadeus, and it ranks as of my all time faves.....but to see the maestro Beethoven suffer, and be glorified thru his music is as close to perfection as one can ask.
I can only ask. If you were given a GREAT gift like Beethoven was....yet could not hear the notes you were composing......how would you react? After watching Gary Oldman, I can envision the great maestro himself nodding in agreement. 
If you don't see this movie, you are denying one of the greatest performances by an all star cast. See this movie, see Ludwig as he was, and see the women who loved him through his difficulties.
