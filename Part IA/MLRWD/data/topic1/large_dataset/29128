this blu-ray presents the original film in its entirety in 1080p and looks absolutely INCREDIBLE.
this is the BEST version of the original film on any disc.
this film has received 2 releases in the UK, and neither one is as good as this gray area release from Forgotten Films.
btw: the original black and white film was created in 4:3 and was NOT meant to be shown in widescreen.
in other words, the 4:3 presentation is the CORRECT original aspect ratio of the 1968 film.
If Forgotten Films can release other public domain titles on blu-ray in this quality it will be wonderful.
they have done an incredible job with this blu-ray
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
EDIT: when I originally wrote this review I didn't realize that there are in fact about 10 seconds of missing dialogue from
a scene during which Barbara unbuttons her shirt. There is a tiny bit of missing footage at this moment.
It's of little consequence imo, and the disc remains the best version of NOTD available.
I can understand people not wanting a version that is 100% complete, but nobody should be avoid this
release because of this minor issue.
