I REMEMBER THIS WHEN IT FIRST AIRED IN THE LATE 70'S.  FIRST, LET ME SAY FOR THE ELVIS NEWCOMER, THIS FILM IS FINE AS AN INTRO, BUT HONESTLY I WOULD SUGGEST 'THIS IS ELVIS' THE DOCUMENTARY WHICH HAS THE REAL ELVIS IN IT.

I LIKE KURT RUSSEL, BUT HE IS OVERDOING IT IN HIS MUSICAL PORTION AND A BIT OVERLY DRAMATIC.

THE MUSIC, WELL SOME GOOD SOME BAD.  RONNIE MCDOWELL DOES NOT SOUND LIKE ELVIS TO ME, EXCEPT JUST A FEW SONGS.  EVERYONE KEEPS REPEATING THAT LINE THAT RONNIE IS THE CLOSEST TO ELVIS VOICE, BUT THAT IS JUST A CIRCULATED RUMOR.  CHECK OUT 'JIMMY ELLIS'  AKA 'ORION,'  THIS GUY IS  WAY BETTER THAN MCDOWELL.

THE MOVIE ADDS A LITERARY LICENSE WHERE ELVIS WOULD BE TALKING TO HIS SHADOW OF ALL THINGS, SOMEHOW CORRELATING TO HIS STILL BORNE TWIN.  I COULD DO WITHOUT THAT GARBAGE.

ANYWAY, I CAN NO LONGER WATCH THIS MOVIE.  ELVIS RE-ENACTORS, IMPERSONATORS, AND VOCALISTS ARE ALL VERY ANNOYING AND FALL SHORT, VERY SHORT AND ALL HAVE THAT SAME PHONEY SOUND AND ACTING IMPERSONATION.

STICK WITH THE REAL THING.  THESE MOVIES, INCLUDING THE MOST STUPID ONE, 'ELVIS AND THE BEAUTY QUEEN,' ARE ALMOST EMBARASSING.
