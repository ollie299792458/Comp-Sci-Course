First a few updates on the product description... it is not 1 disc they are 5 running for over 14 hours (I saw a review complaining about this being 1 disc running 98 minutes).
Now, I believe there is no need to remind that house is probably the best show on TV. I own seasons 1-6 and all of them are great. House is the kind of person you "hate to love", but cant help it. His sarcasm and genius are just great. But if there are any doubts, just research about the many nominations, and awards Hugh Laurie and the rest of the team has earned for the show.
About the Blu-ray them selves. They look AWESOME.I own Lie to me* season 1 on blu-ray, there was not much difference between it and my House DVDs (upscaled by my PS3). But House season 6 looks just great. It truly allows you to experience HD as the episodes are in 1080P. Besides the great looks, they include some really cool extras... Ever wondered about all those I-have-never-heard-before-diseases that are mentioned throughout the series? Well wonder no more (lol). One of the bonus features of the BD is that episodes have a PIP feature that explains the diseases mentioned, as they are being presented on the show.
To make it short the show gets a 100. The package gets a 98. (I will not hide the fact that getting discs 1-4 out of the box is not what we are used to with other DVD an Blu-ray packages, so kind of complicated).
Must have!
