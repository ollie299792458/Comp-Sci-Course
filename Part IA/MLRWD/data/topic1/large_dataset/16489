LOST has to be one of my all time favorite television shows. So much so that even though I live in New Zealand I had to order this magnificent collectors set.

Now season 3 & season 4 are region coded but all the other seasons (1,2,5 and 6) are region free. The bonus disc that is only available with this set is region free as well!

Without giving to much away I have viewed the bonus disc and it has some very interesting interviews with the cast (after the show had finished) along with a feature with Michael Giacchino composing the final episode. It also features some behind the scenes features and deleted scenes that were missed off previous seasons.

The design of the actual set is very nice. One of the most surprising things is that they have added textures over the set to make it feel like rock/stone.

I would recommend this set to any huge LOST fan even if you do have to buy season 3 and 4 separately. In New Zealand it still works out cheaper than buying all of the seasons separately on Blu-ray and what's also great is that season 6 doesn't even come out over here until October :-D
