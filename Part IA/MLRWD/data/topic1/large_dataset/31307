I've seen essentially three versions of Hairspray:

Version M:  Ten years ago, and heard it through a 4" TV speaker.

Version P:  The play in Manhattan, in August 2002.

Version S:  Shortly after the play, the movie again, but this time through a 200-watt (RMS) two-speaker sound system.

Conclusions:

(1)  The movie and play are both excellent, but except for the names of the characters quite different.  I recommend seeing both.  Put simply (very simply), the focus of the movie is on the teenager, Tracy, while the focus of the play is on Tracy's mother.  What both the movie and play have in common is that at the end the focus-of-the movie/play goes through an adventure after which she emerges feeling significantly better about herself (dare I say that "her self esteem improves?).

(2)  I actually enjoyed Version S better than Version M, probably due primarily to the significantly better sound.

(3)  I was 16 in June 1962 when the movie takes place, so I remember the time, and the movie captures both teen values and their relationship with their parents that I remember.

(4)  When Seaweed's younger sister says to Tracy with unqualified joy, "You're my favorite dancer!" she succinctly captures the powerful (and almost certainly unintended effect) that TV had on integration.
