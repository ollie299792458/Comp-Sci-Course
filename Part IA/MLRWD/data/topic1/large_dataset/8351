The plot concerns two Hussars in Napol&eacute;on Bonaparte's army. One is an extremely honorable fellow, the other is a despicable Gascon. Feraud, the Gascon, becomes offended when d'Hubert, the honorable fellow, places him under arrest (for dueling!) in the company of a woman. Feraud's displeasure leads him to duel d'Hubert many times, from before Napol&eacute;on becomes emperor, to after "the Ogre's" exile. But encounter after encounter proves inconclusive, as Feraud will only be satisfied by d'Hubert's death.

This film, said to be "a true story", was actually based upon a story by Joseph Conrad called "The Duel". However, "The Duel" was inspired by true events. The movie is almost entirely faithful to the book, except for the fact that Feraud is a delusional fruitcake in the book, whereas he is a bloodthirsty maniac in the film.

Over all, in the film and book alike, Feraud is a metaphor for Bonaparte, while d'Hubert is a metaphor for the rest of Europe. Feraud continues to pursue d'Hubert in duels, which are symbolic of wars. Inaccurate,  as, Russia and Spain excluded, Bonaparte fought all of his wars defensively, and his attackers were often encouraged and funded by Britain. But, as the saying goes, "History is written by the victors". Aside from all that, Feraud excellently embodies all of Napol&eacute;on's negative traits: pertinacity, egotism and delusion.

Down to the basics: The movie is incredibly accurate as far as the period goes. The costumes, the hair styles...and especially the duels. You will simply never see more realistic swordplay in a movie. In addition, the plot is superb, the acting realistic and the ending fantastic. If you enjoy the Napoleonic period, duels, beautiful camera work or simply a great story then this film is something I recommend.
