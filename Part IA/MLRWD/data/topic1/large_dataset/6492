I can honestly say that this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Of course, I first saw it (and its sequels) at a young age but they're classics already to me and others as well. If for some reason you're not  familiar with the plot by now, a handful of teens are being stalked by a  supernatural killer, (Freddy). They each are having the problem but don't  even know just how bad yet because the killer comes in their nightmares!  Each is horrified by their dreams and they come to find out they're all  having the same dream about the same guy. In this movie, the first  installment of the series, Freddy Krueger is much more hidden and darker,  and ultimately scarier. He truely enjoys scaring these kids to death and  then brutally killing them. Yet despite all this, he's almost a heroic  figure and definitely larger than life. He would soon develop some  excellent one-liners in the sequels which I also recommend (esp. part 3).  If you're going to watch an 80's slasher film, be sure to watch one with  style!
