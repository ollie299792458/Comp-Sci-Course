My expectations were a bit dashed towards the beginning of this film, since the exposition was a bit stale. Rich, wonderful guy and his rich, wonderful wife and their rich, not-so-wonderful tragedy, yadda, yadda- we've seen it all before. The cinematography is a bit flat and overlit. However, after the slowish start this movie puts the pedal to the metal. Michael Keaton does obsession well, and his descent into madness as he scans the airwaves for messages from his dead wife is well rendered. The conceit of the story lends itself very well to some truly disturbing imagery, and as befits a story of this type the malevolent force he encounters is never truly explained. There are some real scares in this film, as well as some seriously disturbing imagery (and sounds). Some have said this was merely an American ripoff of Japanese Horror, but while it obviously takes inspiration from the new wave of Asian horror cinema, it packs an emotional punch those movies can't muster. The fact that the film follows a more American approach of narrative logic gives it a leg up on some of those over-rated films. The way the film progresses from New Agey sentimentalism to nihilistic terror is startling to behold. Just when you think this film will be another Sixth Sense weepfest, it kicks you in the groin. Repeatedly. If you liked the American version of the Ring (which I loved), you'll find this makes a wonderful companion to your psychic horror collection.

Don't believe the criticism of this movie- this is a very powerful and satisfying psychological horror film. There's a plethora of interesting extras as well, including a documentary on the study of Electronic Voice Phenomena.
