It's a shame that Brandon Lee wasn't able to experience true fame; this movie would've brought it to him. Throughout the entire movie there's a confusing mix of feelings - wanting to see him obtain revenge, wishing their was some justification for the wrongs done to him, and wondering what mysterious turn the plot will take next. The movie has excellent fighting sequences and wonderful directing. The way Brandon Lee could present himself as such an enraged person, the way he would talk to his victims before exacting his revenge upon them, how he didn't hesitate to do what was necessary, and how after the horrible events that took place a year before he was resurrected, he could still find redemption in his past-life memories. He even managed to twist in a moderate amount of comedy with his angry side, which is in my mind, true talent as an actor. I never knew he was Bruce Lee's son until several years after I saw the film, and even then I found out he had been killed during the making of it. Splicing the morbid atmosphere with a suspenseful rage-filled main character, out to bring justice to his killers, "The Crow" brings a touch of numerous emotions with every scene.
Brandon Lee; may he rest in peace, and never be forgotten.
