In the bonus material on the DVD there is an interview with the director of this production of "Rigoletto", who noticed that his goal was to make totally different approach to "Rigoletto". He mentioned that he was looking for something new, that nobody's ever seen before...and so he came up with the idea to stage the spectacle which I would rate "R", not recommended for the people under 18. What a disgusting, especially the first scene in Duke's palace. If the director thinks that this is the correct way to interpret Rigoletto, he is mistaken. "Rigoletto" has way much more dimensions.
Besides the horrible staging I rate this DVD with 3 stars because of pretty strong cast. Excelent singing from Duke, Rigoletto and Gilda. Being tenor I personally appreciate Marcelo Alvarez. He is really good. Especially his aria "Parmi" is brilliant. So finally, I don't think that this is must have DVD. You just listen to it once and put on the shelf, or even try to sell it (as I did). If one wants to get an idea how powerfull Rigoletto really is, one should buy the movie with Pavarotti or buy CD with Kraus, Scotto and Bastianini.
