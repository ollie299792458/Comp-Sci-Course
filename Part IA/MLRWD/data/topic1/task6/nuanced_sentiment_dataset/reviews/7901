As a parent that has watched Toy Story about 50 times and enjoyed it every time, I was pretty shocked when I went to preview this movie in the theater.  
After the first 20 minutes, I had my answer, not only was this  "No Toy Story", it wasn't even funny.
I did later see the whole  movie in the theater and came away with the same opinion.
How ironic that  I would rent Bug's Life on 4/21, the day after the Columbine shootings.  This movie has no less than a dozen references to "killing" and  "death".  How do the ants resolve conflict?  By fighting of  course.  Go get some warriors!  It's payback time!
I did finally watch  this with my 4 year old, stopping every 5 minutes to remind him that  "it's just a movie" and "the hoppers are the bad guys and  good guys always win."
I have a totally different view of this movie  from a Home Theater-buff standpoint.  By god, this is my new demo disk!  The first 20 minutes, up until the first departure of the hoppers is  awesome.
Every moment that Kevin Spacey's character is on the screen is  priceless.
I too found it difficult to choose between the standard and  letterbox versions.  I usually choose letterbox to see the  "whole" movie but having Hopper's ugly mug filling my 51"  screen was quite impressive.
If I sound prudish, so be it, but someone  needs to start questioning the amount of violence in a "kid's"  movie.
