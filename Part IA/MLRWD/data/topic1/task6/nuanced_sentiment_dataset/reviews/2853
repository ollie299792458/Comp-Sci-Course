It's a shame, however logical the choice might be, that the almost unrecognizable first season of Newhart is the one that Fox decided to test the waters with. Honestly, they may have been better served releasing seasons 3-8 and then doling out 1 and 2 for the completists (like myself).

I watched Newhart religiously in the mid/late 80s, but missed the first few seasons when it originally aired. When one of the cable networks aired the series in reruns about 10 years ago or so, it was jarring to see how different the first season was from the rest. The visual style, the absence of many familiar recurring characters, and the abominable original version of Kirk all made me wonder if I was watching the same show that I remembered so fondly.

So much changed once they got to the second season episodes. The visual style changed, the cast was tweaked, and the "Wacky Vermont Ensemble" that became the show's lifeblood started coming to life. THAT was when the show took its first steps towards "classic" territory. The first season is like a 24-episode screen test or demo reel compared to the rest of the series.

I did purchase the first season out of a need for completion, as well as to add my bucks to the cause of hopefully showing the manufacturers that later seasons of this landmark show need to be released (along with the rest of original Bob Newhart Show). The discs and packaging are fine, and the picture and sound are good, especially considering the source material. However, I will probably never watch this season more than one time.

I really hope to own the rest of this series in the future. Is it so wrong to want Edwin Newman calling Dick Loudon a "weenie" in my collection for posterity?
