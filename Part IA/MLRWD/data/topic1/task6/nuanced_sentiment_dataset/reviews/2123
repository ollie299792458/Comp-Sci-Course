The sequel to 1999's insanely popular "Analyze This" gets off to a good start. That is if you think watching Robert Deniro singing show tunes is the epitome of funny. Heck, I do and I have to admit, I couldn't stop laughing during the first 30 minutes or so.
Jelly's return was welcome but the film goes downhill from there. The undeniable chemistry between Crystal and Deniro is still there but the premise has become somewhat cliched. Or maybe what seemed fresh the first time seems rehashed the second time? The dialogue is somewhat stilted and lacks the sharp, snappy one-liners from the first film...and it seems they took a lot of what worked the first time and just said "Heck, we had a hit then, let's just milk the premise." There's also too much of an emphasis on gunplay and violence.
If you couldn't get enough of "Analyze That", you might want to check this out. If you are expecting anything fresh or inspired, look elsewhere. But Deniro somehow manages to be funny despite himself (and the film).
