I have seen both versions of this movie.  I strongly feel the rated, version of this movie that went to the studio is a far better movie.  This movie tends to drag on, and the scene are often longer than they need to be.  This movie is longer than the studio version, and often the jokes drag onto the rythym is thrown off.

Overall still a good, funny movie, of a really nice guy who just happens to be a virgin at the age of 40.  I loved this movie brough up many of the issues we all have in dating in the modern world.  I would recommend this movie for a more mature audience for the language.  This movie is  charming, ackward, and shows the good guy gets the girl in the end.

This version of this movie isn't my favorite.  Jokes and scenes run on just a little too long.  Sometimes there are reasons why scenes are edited out, or scaled back before they are shown in the theatre.  I wished that many of the scenes would have been place in the DVD bonus section instead being directly added to this film.  The film is still watchable, it just seems slower paced, and not quite as funny as the original.
