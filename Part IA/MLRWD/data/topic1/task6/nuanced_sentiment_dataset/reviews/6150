Bones is a show that is inches away from perfect.  Its character design, story telling, and humorous dialogue easily carry the show through each episode: right into a train wreck.

The idea is simple: take the Odd Couple and have them solve crimes.  While that may be simplifying things to their basest roots, the show does add in their own touch to the mix.  Booth and Brennan are experts in their respective fields: Booth is a former Army Ranger turned FBI agent, and Brennan is a brilliant criminal anthropologist at the top of her field.  The catch is that neither of these two people knows a thing about their partner's field, leading to awkward, and often humorous situations often involving Brennan eagerly asking for a gun or Booth using the most basic of terms in the midst of deep scientific conversation.

The actors do a great job and perform excellently with the mix of drama and comedy that comes in every episode.  The episode writing is always interesting, offering a good range of murders to solve, and often has the two main characters drawing themselves into the crime.

Doesn't sound so bad, does it?  So where does the train wreck start?  Any time there is any emotional dialogue the show falls apart so quickly it can nearly ruin a perfectly good episode.  The emotional dialogue might as well be written by George Lucas: it's that bad.

Overall, Bones is a drama that's so close to being great that it's frustrating.  Not every episode has the accursed emotional dialogue, and the ones that do usually only have 2 minutes of it.  Hopefully with Season 2 the producers will see the light and hire some dialogue specialists.  If it happens, there's no doubt the next season will get 5 stars.
