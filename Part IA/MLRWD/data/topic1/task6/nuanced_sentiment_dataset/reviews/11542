Overall I found Vertical Limit to be a pretty entertaining movie.  It delivers enjoyable action and a decent story that are worth seeing.  I'll leave the details of the story to editorial coverage, but will comment that one of the most frustrating parts of the movie was the enormous plot hole at the end.
If you want to be critical of the film, then the special effects and climbing definitely don't stand up.  I'm sure many of the climbing accidents depicting in the film have actually occurred (in some form), but not all in one expedition.  :)  Also, some of the more "dramatic" climbing action is clearly shot in a studio.  In several of the film's scenes you'll find that things just don't look right.
The extras on the DVD are mediocre.  Naturally there is a bunch of information about how the movie was made, much of it focussing on how the cast went through real climbing training.  I was excited to find a piece by National Geographic on the DVD, but that piece turned out to be a short segment that basically served as an advertisement for the real thing.
All criticism aside, I did enjoy watching the film...  suspending all disbelief once in a while isn't such a bad thing.
