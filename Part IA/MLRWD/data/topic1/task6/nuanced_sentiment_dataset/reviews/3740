This movie definitely depicts the life of Katy Perry and her rising fame with fun clips and cool scenes but fails to deliver a real meaning and glorious emotional feel. It's like your watching a movie for little kids except it's about a 28 year old woman singing about "Peacocks" and her "Teenage Dreams". Music/Tour documentaries are for Justin Bieber not Katy Perry. Can't stand this movie can't stand her. Not to mention that this movie failed to do good in any countries, but too bad for her. Seems her stunt to gain in cash didn't work because her fan base isn't big enough for that. As far as my personal opinion of Katy I think she is a cool and fun WOMAN, but is way too cheery, sweet, and bubble gum pop. Her music feels so fake, and her vocal talent and Musical talent isn't necessarily the best. She did not help produce, direct, or manage anything for this movie, which really shows the work she put in? RIGHT? She has done good for her self, but I feel when her next album comes out she wont be so happy? Perfume?Movie?ReRelease?Soda?Chips?VideoGames? It seems shell do anything to be in the spotlight but lacks that mature and true feeling to her. She does not have the presence of a legend but just another singer, a bad one that is.
Sorry for all my blabbering, I know this is a review of her movie not herself but I feel I need to include it as well so yes that's it!
Thank you!
