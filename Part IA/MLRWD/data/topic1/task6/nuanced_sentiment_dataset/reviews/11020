....Those are the words of a whiny, obnoxious brat on any given family road trip, but on this road trip, "The Final Destination" limps along on three flat tires and out of gas. Really it's just "Final Destination" 4, but they added a The in front of the title to set it apart from the original 3, for which the original 3 must be grateful. Actually they should have stopped at #2 with it's appocalyptic highway crash from hell(the first premonition) and the hilariously gruesome finale with a dismembered barbequed leg complete with tennis shoe landing on a family picnic table. Number 3 was ok with its rollercoaster disaster and there were some imaginative "deaths"-the nail gun scene was perfectly timed for suspense.  The first movie was very good and while some may argue it was the best, I still prefer #2 as the best of the bunch.

Now comes the latest in the franchise and "The Final Destination" fails on all counts-The characters and the actors playing them are boring-the "deaths" are surprisingly tame and even lame. The budget on this installment must have been pretty small because most of the gore is missing which is unusual since this series usually is pretty graphic with its guts and gore. Maybe most of the budget was consumed by the 3-D effects but you know they also squandered this too when the best 3-D effect is a popped champagne cork. And wearing those crappy cardboard glasses is no joy either.

So as far as I'm concerned, I'll take the whiny, obnoxious brat-anyone else can have the movie. Nah, not really, I'll avoid both.
