The main reason I watched this movie was because Aaron Paul was in it. If you dont know, Paul is the co-star of what is undeniabley the best tv show in the history of television. However he was completely under-utilized in this film. It seemed he really only had a few lines and a little expansion on his character, simply for an opportunity for him to act, could have added a lot to the movie. The second reason I watched this film was because I am a fan of the original, which I watched after Quentin Tarantino listed it in his top 20 grindhouse films list. If you are a Tarantino fan you know that the bulk of Tarantino films are homages to 70s grindhouse films and it is cool to watch the movies that influenced him. The original wont let you down in this area. My problem with the remake was that it left out all of the scenes that made the original a good film. The most recognizable being that the remake contained no chainsaw, easily the most memorable part of the original. Instead we get a scene with a microwave, which was decent, but I couldnt help feeling completely let down by the fact that there was NO chainsaw anywhere. Also, in the remake, Krugers son does not die. I kept waiting for him to blow his own brains out and it never happened. FAIL!!! That was the most interesting scene of the original by far. Also missing was the absurd comedy provided by the police officers, who in the original hitched a ride on in the back of a truck transporting chickens. There was no comedic relief at all in this one. So basically every aspect of the orginal that made it unique was removed. Instead you have an average horror movie that doesnt really provide anything that makes it worth stomaching the rape scene.
