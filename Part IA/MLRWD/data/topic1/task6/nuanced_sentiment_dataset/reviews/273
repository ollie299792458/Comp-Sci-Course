I am not sure that I can add much more than has already been said other than to note that a classic turn in the career of Yes was seriously botched on the video production end.

Just what, exactly, was on the minds of those responsible for producing this?  Why make the decision to chop up each song with a fade out, then a fade in with title?  It ruins this DVD as a "concert" experience and takes away any sense of fluidity.

What is the deal with the cheesy strobe slow mo effects?  Any mid-level portable video camera has this effect and it is stupid and annoying.  Yet the director here felt it necessary to use it quite often, like a child with a new toy at Christmas.  It's like people who put exclamation points after every sentence!  And put more and more of them!!!!!! Like their writing is going to get more exciting through them!!!!!!!!!!

And the graphics????  The people hanging off cliffs superimposed during the performance of "Awaken" ruined the atmosphere of the piece entirely.  Perhaps they got a director who felt nobody was excited enough with Yes music unless he found whatever imagery he could to "spice" it up.  The only other option I could see was that the director and/or producer was so full of himself that he had to say, "Look at me!!!!!!!!!!!  Look what I can do!!!!!!!!!!!!"  I would much rather watch Yes, thank you.

For those people who bought this as their only Yes concert DVD, please don't be discouraged.  I think Yes learned the lesson with "Yes: Symphonic Live".  They added a feature which allows you to either turn on or off the graphics, a wonderful idea since there just may be someone who really does enjoy the visuals.  Plus, there are no annoying video effects.

My solution to this one was to take the two "Keys to Ascension" CDs, which include all of this material, and use mixing software to reconstruct the concert and burn it onto two CDs.  This was an amazing concert! (Ok, so I did need ONE exclamation point)
