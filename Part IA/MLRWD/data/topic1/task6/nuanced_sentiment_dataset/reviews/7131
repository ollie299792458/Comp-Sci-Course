Although the film is a good one, I had to write this bad review, not for the film, but for the DVD arrangement on this Collector Edition.  The first disk is two sided and has part 1 of the movie on side 1 and part 2 on the other side.  The second disk contains the special features.  Whatever moron decided this was a good idea has no clue about collectors and what they look for.  This should have been put on three disks or at least put the special features on the B side, so the movie could be watched without having to manually remove the disk from the player and turn it over.  I have a multi-disk player so I can just put them in the player and select which movie I want to see, sort of like a juke box, but with this DVD's arrangement, that isn't possible.  Out of over 400 DVD's this is the only one that does such a thing (other than having a full screen on one side a widescreen on the other, that's Ok).  The problem isn't the kind of thing one can return it for, so this one will go in the reject pile while I look for a better version (probably not available).
