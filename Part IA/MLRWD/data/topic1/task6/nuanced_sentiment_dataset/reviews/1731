All my life the name 'Zorba the Greek' has been a recognized name, but I have never heard much about the contents except that Zorba is an example of someone who embraced life and didn't take things lying down.  Since I recently saw 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' at my sister's house, I felt as though I had a clue now as to what that philosophy represents (MBFGW is a wonderful movie).  If there is a Greek in the movie who has any inclination to embrace life, it is only Zorba and none of the others.  The towns people are uptight, hypocritical and malicious.  The monks are fools who are tricked over nothing.  Zorba is celebrated for using his boss's money to pay for prostitution and carousing when he goes to town for materials.  Women looking for anything uplifting in how they are portrayed will look in vain.

I have lived with people who disassociate life from responsibility, and the experience wears thin very quickly.  Zorba himself seems to be compensating for a life that is basically empty and devoid of purpose or meaning. That leads to the message of "eat drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die".  Rather than having multiple layers, this movie comes across rather flat.
