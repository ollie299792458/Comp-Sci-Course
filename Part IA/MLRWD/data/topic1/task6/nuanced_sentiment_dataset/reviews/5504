Kenneth Branagh never ceases to amaze me or disappoint me when this great Shakesperean actor/director takes one of The Bard's plays and works his magic and whimsy and brings Shakespeare anew to the big screen.HENRY V,HAMLET,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and now LOVE"S LABOUR'S LOST each lovingly and differently interpreted so that the general public may approach Shakespeare in a way that hitherto they may have not.I am such a person.I confess that I have not been a fan of Shakespeare as usually seen in Shakespeare Festivals,Broadway and regional theatres.For me,I have no affinity nor find it interesting;AHHHHH,but thank you Kenneth Branagh for trusting your own sensibilities to continue to reinterpret these masterfully written plays so that certain of us may find Shakespeare more to our tastes.I make no apologies for what some may consider my low-brow approach to Shakespeare via Branagh;IT WORKS FOR ME and I love every last delicious minute of it!
The story to LLL is quite simple: four chums have sworn off women and frivolity for a three year period in order to pursue knowledge and enlightenment.When four gorgeous maidens arrive from France,though, the four chums find it harder and harder to keep their vows.Branagh sets this farce in 1939 Europe just before France is invaded.He styles it with the look and extravagant grandeur of a Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers musical with dancing and singing to the melodies of the times from Cole Porter and Irving Berlin and voila...with sharp editing,lighting and dazzling camera work,Branagh transform this Shakespeare play into a WW2 movie musical spectacle.He obviously researched the times well,for the look of Branagh's film is totally faithful to the time period including authentically recreated newsreels and swirling newspaper flashes.It is delightful from the opening scenes of the four chums taking their united vows to the semi-sweet conclusion of the end of the War.Adrian Lester is to be especially commended for his performance.I had seen him live on stage in London in the musical COMPANY and the man can sing and dance!!! The others at times seem obviously out of their elements as singers and dancers,but that is why it IS so good.This is a group of actors first and foremost who happen to be able to sing and dance;not a group of singers and dancers who can't act! BRILLIANT KENNETH.I LOVE ALL YOUR WORK.
As usual,Branagh has Patrick Doyle do his soundtrack.This pairing always works and pleases.Very highly recommended.
