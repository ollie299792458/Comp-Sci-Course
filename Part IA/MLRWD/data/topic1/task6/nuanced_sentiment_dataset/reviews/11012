I was expecting a very overblown performance out of Jack Black. He is kind of the Chris Farley of this generation, however, he managed to reign in his schtick a bit and came up with a pretty decent act.

The most shocking thing about the movie was the initial caveman setting and expecting grunts and unintelligible words, maybe with captions. However, the moment the cast started speaking, it was apparent this was not going to be either historically accurate, or even a far stretch in that direction.

What really makes this movie is the dialogue, which is far out of the historical setting. And, going from cavemen to bible history within a long hike shows that this is strictly for laughs, and not any sort of technical accuracy.

Oliver Platt is outrageous as the high priest of Sodom and Xander Berkley is great as the king. David Cross is unrecognizable with his beard, and the one I most easily recognized was Horatio Sanz. I'm glad to see him working.

Olivia Wilde is absolutely hot here, as well as Jack's love interest.

I watched the unrated version and the only place I saw a big shocker was the bear dung scene. If you've seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about.

Overall, this was a fun movie I could see watching again, just to catch more of the goofy dialogue. Recommended.
