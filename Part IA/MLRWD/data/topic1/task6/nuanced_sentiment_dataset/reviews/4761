This movie was a full rip-off of A Nightmare On Elm Street with a touch of the legend of the Blair Witch.  The scariest part about it was that it took 3 people to write it and 1 to "come up with" the story.  
Take Freddy Krueger and make him a woman, make it so that it's not just falling asleep that leaves you vulnerable but the night itself, throw in the exact same scenes and situations from the Nightmare series and you have Darkness Falls.
It's not like we expect to see great writing or performances in a horror flick so I won't even bother discussing that- but at LEAST give us a new storyline.  I'll hand it to Stan Winston for doing his usual amazing job with the creature design...and the sound effects definately made the "scary" parts fly...but if you want to see the GOOD version of this film, just throw in A Nightmare On Elm Street.
Maybe if these writers can get together again, the three of them can write one about a boy who drowns in a lake and comes back wearing a hockey mask...or something original like that.
