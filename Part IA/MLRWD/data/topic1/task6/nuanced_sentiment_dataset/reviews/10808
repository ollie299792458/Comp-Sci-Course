Dismal, appalling, woeful, weak, pathetic are all words that could be used to describe this pitiful excuse for a movie. I cannot believe I made it to the end of this unjustifiably lengthy ordeal without either falling asleep or turning it off. I guess I just wanted to see where Omar Sharif fitted into it, after all he is on the cover. Finally in the last 15 minutes or so of this abomination he does turn up, but even he cannot coax it back from the depths of mediocrity. He must be getting desperate for roles in his later years, otherwise why would he sign on after reading such a pantomime script. I'm sure the only reason that he got featured on the cover art was in the hope that his presence might shift a few more copies. This was obviously made to cash in on the success of Dan Brown's novels and their movie adaptions and while National Treasure got away with it by virtue of a decent budget, actors and storyline this can boast none of those redeeming features. The female lead is not even remotely believable as the bimbo Archeologist and the majority of the remaining cast are more wooden than the ark. The villains of the piece are about as menacing as my dead Grandmother and there are such obvious set flaws that even a child would spot them. How about the perfectly preserved town hidden beneath layers of easilly shovelled lava that looks just like sand. A place buried so deep that shafts of sunlight can beam in from every angle. There are of course the brave knights who wander the desert in blazing heat and swim vast stormy oceans in full chain mail and armour with swords at their side. Instead of our intrepid Templars it is the viewer who is left with that sinking feeling. I must admit that I have never read the book as many other reviewers here seem to have done, but it would have to be better than this. I give it one star for Mr Sharif. Do not waste 170 minutes of your life on this turkey.
