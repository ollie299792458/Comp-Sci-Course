Dear deity, this has to be one of THE WORST movies I have ever subjected myself to. Flushing that six dollars down the nearest toilet would have been a much more earnest use for it, and saved me a lot of wasted time. This film has nothing compared to Men in Black II; it's corny, awful, and nothing more than slapstick trash. I watched the original MiB after seeing this, and was amazed by how good MiB was. It was a story with humor elements. MiB 2 is attempted humor with a few story elements tossed in at random. The animated short before it is also enough to make you want to leave before the film even starts, be warned. Smith and Jones return with venerable acting skill as J & K, but with a script that would have been BETTER if it was written by a handicapped 11-year-old with cerebral palsy, they couldn't do much. The plot is anemic, the gags are forced, and 90 minutes of wishing I would spontaneously combust is something I urge you to save yourself. Go watch the original again, and please, pretend the sequel never happened.
