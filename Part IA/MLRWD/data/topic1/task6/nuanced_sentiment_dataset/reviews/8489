This movie could have been pretty good but....some of the footage and scenes were shot with cameras with poor quality which made alot of parts blurred and showed alot of static, you don't get the great consistant blu ray quality picture like the more popular movies such as Battleship,Final Destination 5,or Snow White and The Huntsman. Some parts were crystal clear but most were not, really takes away from the clarity of the movie. The movie really could have been good, there were a few really awesome scary parts was really disappointed in the crappy cams that were used thru out the movie, should have rented this before purchasing it, this is the worst movie I have purchased to buy this year. 2 out of a 5 star rating.
They really screwed this movie up. Thier comparing it to the Paranormal Activity movies P Activty 3 is much better than Apartment 143. Do not buy this movie until you rent it, there is a strong chance that you might really not like it. The way the footage is shot was not an issue nor with the moving documentary style type movie the issue for me was the quality of the picture.
If they would have used the camera that shot the footage in excellent picture quality it would have got at least 4 stars.
