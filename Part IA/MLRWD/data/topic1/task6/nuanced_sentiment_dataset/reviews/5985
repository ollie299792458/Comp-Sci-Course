I must say that this was quite a messy and rushed movie that had so much potential but was thrown out as a mass produced commercial film whose only goal was to make money off of comic-book/movie geeks and unsuspecting western/action patrons with just enough curiosity to gander at a comic to film product that may satisfy their hunger for the next great western.  Unfortunately, all the pretty "bells and whistles" spent in effects and on the horrible Megan Fox could not save this poor excuse of a comic book adaptation. Even the great John Malkovich was sucked into Fox's talentless vacuum by portraying an unconvincing villain that is as intimidating as my next door neighbor's toy poodle.  With all this said, Josh Brolin was one of the redeeming qualities in the film that made it watchable and entertaining.  When I say "entertaining" I mean in a "MST-3000" meaning where you sit around with friends and make fun of it while intoxicated on your choice of poison. I believe Brolin knew what he was getting into and said to himself, "Screw it!  Im going to have fun with the role while I'm getting paid millions for this turd!!". And it really shows in his performance. This is the beauty of the film if you choose to acknowledge it or not. So, if you watch this film with no preconceived notions of a comic book geek or a western/action fanatic you will enjoy the "not to be taken seriously" JONAH HEX.  BTW, don't forget the alcohol!!!!!!
