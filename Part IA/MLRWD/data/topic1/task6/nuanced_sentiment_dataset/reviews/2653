The Easter Beagle has some enjoyable moments and my young daughter laughed through much of it. Unfortunately the bar was set quite high when Charles Schulz wrote 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' and 'It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown'. These remain timeless classics and most of the other Charlie Brown specials (except 'A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving') simply do not match the excellence.
Some of the themes of the classics are used again here. The hope of the Easter Beagle arriving is reminiscent of the Great Pumpkin. The crass commercialization of Christmas in the department store, of course, looks back to the Christmas special.
My only real complaint is that there is no discussion of the real meaning of Easter.
That was the central theme of the Christmas special and was boldly answered by Linus reciting from the Bible. The Easter Beagle focuses on Peppermint Patty trying to show Marcie about Easter by coloring eggs while Linus is telling everyone not to bother because the Easter Beagle will take care of it. I came away disappointed.
