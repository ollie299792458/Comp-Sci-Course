Berlinger's first fictional foray into cinema is not as disappointing as some reviews would lead one to believe--but it is definately a far cry from the original.  The key device is an exploitation of our habits of seeing: That what we see on the screen is "real."  Over and again, the film comments on itself by showing the viewer that what they see is not what they get (e.g., lost time in discovered footage is miraculously recovered when played in reverse, cuing the late eighties obsession with "backward masking").  The schemes and shooting techniques are original and clever, and often highly entertaining.  The problem with this movie is the "Hollywood" problem--pre-screenings probably de-railed the original scripting time and time again until Artisan was comfortable with the product.  The end result is a smartly conceived sequal with poor delivery.  The films saving grace is the gothed-out Director, who is nothing short of mesmerizing.  Fans of Berlinger's past work will recognize his genius, but also his failure.  For film buffs and fans of mediocre horror only.
