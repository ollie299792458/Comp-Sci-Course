Of course I love the series and I'm happy to finally have it on DVD. But just so you're not disappointed, be forewarned that the quality of these discs is poor. (And I bought mine new from Amazon, so I know it's not a bootleg.) There are jumps and skips in the visual, sometimes the the soundtrack is out of synch, and the sound quality varies from ok to poor, especially on the "flip" side. It sounds like one of my speaker wires is loose, but they're fine because everything else I play on my DVD sounds great. I compare this to Quantum Leap (also double-sided) and it's hard to believe they're both produced by Universal.

I find it ironic that the studios wage war against bootleggers, yet they take forever to release old shows, then force us to pay full price for poor quality releases like this. Seems like a better way to build our loyalty  would be to 1) release shows in a timely manner and 2) make sure that the authentic studio releases are of higher quality than a pirated one. Sadly, this one is bootleg quality. (But better than nothing)
