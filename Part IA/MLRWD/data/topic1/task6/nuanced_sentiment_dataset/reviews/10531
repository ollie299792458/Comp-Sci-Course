"There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation.

Thats one firearm for every twelve people on the planet.

The only question is:How do we arm the other 11?"

 Yuri Orlov(Nicholas cage)

 "Lord of WAR"

 A well intended semi-biophic designed to highlight the massive firearm trade business behind war.Nicholas Cage is given his best role in a long time as Yuri Orlov,an interesting performance as we are allowed relate to someone who makes his living from the deaths of others.Cage makes the most of his role,juggling business savvy confidence effectively with an underlying vulnerability.Someone who feels that hes essentially out of his debt.In the end we see a man who knows hes untouchable,but has lost everything that means anything to him.

 The rest of the cast offer some delicious performances ,thanks to a script that offers surprisingly rich characters.Jared Leto is perhaps the most memorable as Orlovs troubled brother,the self proclaimed "f**k up" of the family.Ethan Hawke also appears as a narcotics officer in a brilliantly played small role.

The cinematography is to be admired,despite the fact that alot of it is hit or miss.Consider a hokey yet inventive opening bullet POV sequence and an exciting plane landing on the Sahara Desert.Both great in different ways.

Pic is never as powerful as it wants to be though,and perhaps the 1st person narrative is the cause of this,making the film feel more like an illustrated lecture at times.This dvd is certainly a must for Nicholas Cage fans and those looking for a fresh indifferent perspective on war.just dont expect it to be as effective as it could of been.
