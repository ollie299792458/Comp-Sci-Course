I bought this movie as a gift for my nephew and prescreened it- thankfully. I was expecting cheesy action flick- but this went beyond to some pretty graphic sex scenes and language. I didn't really like the plot- Arnold vs. Satan? And Arnold wins? Not so believable.

I bought this partly because there was big too do about it when I went to a catholic college. Nobody mentioned the graphic nature- it was all- wow- have you seen End of Days? Hmmm, must have missed something. These are the people who wouldn't see Dogma becaue the church forbid it. Seems a little silly to me.

I think it could have been good- or a least better. The theology is pretty weak. I like to think of Satan as subtle. Not flamboyantly blowing up buildings and having group sex with half of New York. Really, besides the girl, Satan is the most interesting and human person in this film- at least there are a few paradoxes.

Oh, and dragging a baby girl through a hospital so dark it looks like a funeral home, covering her with snake blood (in the hospital) then having the nurse and doctor adopt her when the parents die is a pretty thin plot line. Since this "chosen one" apparantly has no intuition to tell her that she is being raised by people preparing her for organized rape, she is really lucky to have Arnold to save her. In such a dark and graphic world, kinda makes you wonder what he was saving her for.
