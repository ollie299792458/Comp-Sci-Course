I saw this movie when I was little. I guess during a free trial of HBO or something that we were getting at the time.
Anyway the animation and music blew me away at the time and as a little kid I thought the plot was pretty cool too.
For years I wondered what movie it was that I saw cause I thought it was so amazing and my parents would not let me watch it after like maybe half way into the film but they inevitably fell asleep on the couch and I turned it back on anyway.

So for almost 20 years vague memories of this film stayed in my head with me not knowing the specific movie until I looked up a list of all the released animated movies on Wikipedia and tracked it down, it was nice to finally be able to see the full movie.

The plot may have been a little weak but the film more than makes up for that with the excellent animation, music and pure nostalgic value that is priceless to me in a way.

It's also surprising that they were able to get away with a film like this back in 1983, I don't think this film would have gotten a pg rating today simply for the club scene of the movie. To hell with the censors tho !!
