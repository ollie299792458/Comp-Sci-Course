All college movies begin and end with a little film called National Lampoon's Animal House. A foray into movies for the first time for National Lampoon, having succeeded on radio and as a magazine, this raucous classic has everything you'd want in a comedy: memorable characters & quotes, partying, a great soundtrack, and a group of unknowns that became stars overnight.

 The basic plot: freshmen Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst) and Larry Kroger (Tom Hulce) are rejected from the preppy Omega fraternity and head to the Delta house, where Kent's older brother Fred went. Delta turns out to be the party frat, aka 'animal house,' at Faber College, and Dean Wormer (John Vernon) wants them shut down and puts them on double secret probation. But Delta won't die, so one toga party, road trip, horse killing, food fight, and parade destruction later, the Deltas beat the rules.

 Saying Animal House always brings to mind John Belushi as Bluto Blutarsky, the 7-year Delta member whose grade point average is 0.0 and who gives fine advice like, "Start drinking heavily." Bluto is the best character hands down, and his speech to get the Deltas back up when they're down is classic, yelling, "Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!"

 So if you haven't see Animal House, you basically haven't lived. See it now, then watch it again. GATOR!
