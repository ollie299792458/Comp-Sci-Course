The imagery and soundtrack of this DVD are wonderful.
However, in the early '80s Superman The Movie was broadcast for television here in Australia and was about 177 minutes long. This is nearly three hours. The two "deleted" scenes found in the "Special Edition" were actually included in the television broadcast. These two deleted scenes I refer to as the "Feed the babies Otis" scene and the scene when Lex is playing piano while singing "You must have been a beautiful baby" as Otis lowers Miss Tessmocker who is to be the next meal for the "babies". Superman saves her of course.
Much of the humour in the relationship between Lex, Otis and Miss Tessmocker is lost because the DVD is missing so many shots/scenes.
The only scene I noticed on the DVD that was not in the '80s television broadcast is a short scene where we see some people looking at the lastest news reports on some TVs in a shop window.
...
All in all, I have to say that I expected more footage, and not less, in a so-called "Special Edition" version of Supmerman and I was most disappointed. I feel as though I have been short-changed. The DVD has lost some of the humour that was in the three hour version and for me is not quite the real thing. :o/
Thank you.
