In many Histories of the So-called "Dark Ages"(and some one points out in this and says "the So-called Dark Ages".)usually Revisionist(i.e. Secular,or RadicalProtestant/AntiRome Propaganda.)History portrays The Dark Ages as though Man were/was Savages(Are they not now Still?)However,what The History Channel did in this was not your typical Hand-me down history but within a short time frame compiled a Compact Yet Fair and Balanced history,It Portrays The Church as the Only Light during The Dark ages and The Black Plague and points out the many Contributions The Catholic Church made both as Peace Makers and as Pillars of Education and hope for People who were not Crusaders or Warriors or Knights but stuck in the middle of the War,Charlemagne's Role and his Contributions,although there is one Islamic Scholar who may have taken a subtle jab with some words and what seem like Two Liberals who also can't help it,The Catholic Church is not Slammed which makes me happy.The Visigoths,Barbarians are all covered.The Benedictine/St Benedict is Rightfully given credit despite some negative words about some who were Volunteered into the Monasteries,the Monasteries,Bede and Other Famous Catholics are given credit.It is not an End-all Documentary of course,and it Neither portrays the Barbarian Muslims neither in a positive or negative light(Political Correctness? because despite some of their positive Contributions,they were the Biggest threats right after the Barbarians,Ironically in today's day still a Threat.)So I give Five Stars for the Information and credit where Credit is due,Three stars because it should have been more in depth and include Much More Information regarding The Barbarians,their Conversions and so forth,Finally Rome's Fall is Accounted to Mismanagement,while that may be true I also credit it to Rome's Once Immoral Role In History Prior to Constantine(Excluding some reformers like Augustus.)All in All a Fair look at this Neglected but often Re-told(erroneously)points in time.
