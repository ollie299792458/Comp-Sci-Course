These episodes are rated TV-MA. That rating is a quandary for me, because if they changed so as to be rated suitable for 11 year olds, that's who I might think would appreciate them but the content is judged to be intended for 17 year olds and older but I wouldn't think even very many 17 year olds would find the stories and characters that engaging.

I didn't even care for the music. I can tell a lot went into the making of these episodes technically as the extra with the interview with the director further suggests. But the characters seemed annoying and to lack development. The stories seemed to go nowhere. That something is happening special after 12,000 years, that aliens dominate, somehow it didn't seem impressive. How could such major events lead to such dippy characters?

But what I would recommend these episodes for is for the changing blocks of colors. Seriously, especially on a bigger screen TV, turn off the sound and just treat it essentially as a light show. Viewed in that way, they seemed better than "Witchblade" and maybe even "Spirited Away" (if those were also viewed with the sound off). After watching the Aquarion episodes in that way, you might even decide to turn the sound up and get used to the shows as intended. I haven't yet.
