I'm sorry to say that the bizarre antics of the Disney production staff have continued. You have two ways of watching this new 2005 version. 1.) You may watch it with the sides chopped off ( Formatted for your screen. Who's screen? Not mine, I own an HD widescreen monitor.) but the movie is unedited, (although it's a grainy, jittery copy); or 2.) You may watch it in a beautiful new anamorphic widescreen print with the very meaningful song, "The Love Is Gone", ripped completely out of the film. Needless to say, I'm a little upset. This is one of my favorite movies. I watch it EVERY year at Christmas. Now it appears I'll have to watch chapters 1-4 in widescreen, switch over to fullscreen for chapter 5, then finish the film by going back to the widescreen version for chapters 6-End. Disney, if you're listening, WHEN WILL IT END? I can put up with the hands and feet being chopped off of people in Pollyanna and Old Yeller, but this release of The Muppet Christmas Carol earns you a new  low. I am utterly disgusted.
