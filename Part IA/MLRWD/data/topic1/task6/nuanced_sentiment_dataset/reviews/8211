John Carpenter is one of those filmmakers whose work is always worth watching, even when it isn't at its peak (such as with "Vampires" and "Ghosts of Mars"), because it's as fun to figure out why the movies don't work as it is to figure why they do when they do (for examples of John Carpenter that really works, see "Halloween" and "The Thing").  "The Fog" is like most of Carpenter's work; it's somewhere in the middle of great and mediocre, with great individual scenes but a lack of overall cohesion.
The first encounter with the ghost ship and the fog is one of the scarier scenes I can think of in all of cinema.  Sadly, there is nothing else anywhere in the movie that gets even close to that scene.  What's left is merely competent fright-flick stuff, with generally good performances and a creepy score (by Carpenter himself).
The DVD is a pretty good one.  The video transfer is probably as good as it could be, and makes a good showcase for the fabulous fog effects devised by the crew, and for the excellent cinematography by Dean Cundey.  The half-hour documentary on the making of the film is admirable for its honesty (Carpenter speaks refreshingly about how he felt the first cut of the film sucked, necessitating extensive reshoots).
This is defintely worth watching if you are into horror movies; less serious fans of the genre should probably rent before buying.
