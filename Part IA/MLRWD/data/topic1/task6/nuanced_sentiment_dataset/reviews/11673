There are quite a few good films which are dramas or comedies with good entertainment/artistic merit that also have a strong political message - among these is Oliver Stone's "Born on the Fourth of July"  There are also good films which are documentaries, whose primary goal is to argue for a political view point - among these is "Martial Law 9/11: Rise of the Police State."

But when a film tries to be some combination of the two, the result is seldom pretty.  And "A Day Without a Mexican" is no exception.

When I rented this DVD at my local video store, I wasn't expecting a great film like one of Oliver Stone's.  I was expecting a fun cheesy comedy that would of course have an underlying political message as its subtext - that Hispanics are vital to the society and economy of the U.S. in general and California in particular.

But instead of just letting the film take a natural flow and counting on the viewers being intelligent enough to deduce the message for themselves, the film makers went out of their way to beat people over the head with each point.  And just in case they didn't make everything painfully obvious enough, they paused the film every 10-15 minutes superimposed text across the screen with their commentary (using a stupid "typing" sound effect) - usually to point out obvious facts like "Nicaragua and El Salvador aren't part of Mexico."  If the director feels the need to offer a play by play commentary, then that's what the DVD commentary tracks are for!

All in all, this film gets a big thumbs down.  It was a good concept, and if done right it could have joined the ranks of other great cult-classic cheesy comedies.  But the film failed miserably.  Only giving it two stars because it had some half-way decent music.  I just pity the musicians whose reputations may now be ruined by having been associated with such a lousy film!
