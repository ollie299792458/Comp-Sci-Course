... I don't know what to say. I must not be the only one around noticing that America takes everything and makes it their own, am I? And now they've taken Godzilla. ....
Okay, first of all, putting the debate over whether or not the movie is Godzilla aside, this movie sucks. Period. An  unthrilling, boring monster movie, about a stupid looking monster that  attacks New York to lay its eggs. Boring to the end, it even rips off  Jurassic Park with its bland ending involving tons of little  Godzillas.
Now, another thing, this movie is definately NOT Godzilla. It  has absolutely nothing to do with Godzilla.  For some reason, all of a  sudden Japan is totally weeded out of the thing, and Godzilla this time  around attacks (surprise) America. He doesn't look like Godzilla, or act  like Godzilla (he lays eggs?), and he is computer animated, not a big guy  in a suit. The guy-in-the-suit thing looks more real (no, I'm serious!),  plus it was funner. The charm of Godzilla is gone with this lame movie. I  own every Godzilla movie, some dubbed, some subtitled, and some in pure  Japanese, but I don't own this. It is not a Godzilla movie. Period.
P.S.  I was outraged to discover that Dean Devline (who wrote Independence Day  too, proving how horrible he is) and his gang asked Toho to not make  Godzilla movies anymore. Is that the stupidest thing ever or what? And even  worse: They might be making a sequel to this, ruining the Godzilla trend  even more. Come on people, it's going to be more of the same. This is  pathetic
