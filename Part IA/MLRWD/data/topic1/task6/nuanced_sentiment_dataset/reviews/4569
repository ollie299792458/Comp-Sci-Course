Let's face it, I didn't go in expecting to watch an Academy award nominee... I just wanted to take in an enjoyable summertime movie.  I was very disappointed.
How do I begin?  This movie lacked the charisma, humor, and great timing of the first.  All the funniest moments were already seen in the trailers (sounds like any movie made by any ex-SNL cast member).  I also got the feeling that there were several special effects/monsters injected that were simple contraptions to tie together a very weak plot.  There was also a very poor chemistry between J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) -- this was one of those movies that I kept thinking, "Even I could have written this one better!"
All things considered, I'm sure it will be a big blockbuster hit, and I'm sure all the 12-year old boys will "ooh" and "aah" over the large assortment of big, silver weapons and aliens in this movie.  However, it doesn't go on my "recommend to others" list, and it dang sure won't go on my "Gotta get the DVD when it comes out" list.
