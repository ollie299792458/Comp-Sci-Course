"Halloween II" picks up directly at the end of the original  film, and sends survivor Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to the hospital  to nurse her wounds.  Unfortunately for her and most of the cast, Micheal  Myers follows.  Donald Pleasence and Nancy Stephens also reprise their  roles as well.Directed by Rick Rosenthal and scripted by John Carpenter and  Debra Hill, "Halloween II" is a very respectable sequel.  There  is a lot more blood and gore in this one (which came in the  post-"Friday the 13th" era), but unlike some of the later  sequels, this one still has that "Halloween" feel about it.  The  finale is also very tense and wraps up the story pretty well -- you could  view the original and this one without any of the other sequels and have a  complete story.The DVD is presented in 2.35:1 ratio and does not contain  any extras aside from some brief production notes.  But the movie is good,  and its a bargain price, so pick it up and make it a "Halloween"  night.
