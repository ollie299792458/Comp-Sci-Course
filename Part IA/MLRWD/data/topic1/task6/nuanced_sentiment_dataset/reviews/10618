I won't go in to great detail about the plot and merits of this film as others have done an exceptional job doing so. My contribution is around the odd and rampant woman-bashing in the film. I can deal with the gratuitous T&A (even if it is a bit silly when it's thrown in as if we're all 13 year old boys or as though this is a "Porky's" flick) but the constant use of "b*tch", "wh*re", "sl*t" and the like was more than a tad over the top. In fact, in one scene, as the heroes cross a bridge in the desert, there is a sign leaning against the bridge that reads simply, "b*tch*--ya know, just 'cause, I guess. I'm not particularly sensitive, if at all, and deal well with blue humour or things that cross a line for satire or irony's sake, say, but, honestly, the woman-bashing/misogyny is pretty pervasive in this movie and it started to grate on my nerves after say, oh, the 15th time I heard a woman degraded with the "b" word.

Ok, apart from that large bit of aforementioned patheticness, as far as B-grade vampire flicks go, this one is pretty standard. The story line is standard ("I must kill the vampire that infected me before I 'turn'!"), the vampire back story is standard (some blah blah about Romanian soldiers from yesteryear who made a pact with a demon for immortality or something blahdy blah like that), the blood and gore scenes: Standard. The acting was actually quite decent. So if it's a Sunday afternoon and you're in the mood for some B-grade vampire fare that isn't gonna necessarily "wow" you with its cleverness but won't bore you with bad cinematography, bad acting, or a particularly terrible script, well you can't get much more average and "meh" than this film.
