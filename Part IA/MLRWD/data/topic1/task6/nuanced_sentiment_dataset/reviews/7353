Search the best movies of the 30's and see what what this trash is up against. Gone with the wind, the great dictator (40), all quiet on the western front, mr. smith goes to washington, king kong..... and then this.

7/8th of the movie has a no conflict, ordinary, depressing life sort of "Our Townish" feel. The power of the actors is evident and when the baby gets deathly ill on new years night the movie is on track for greatness. If the writers killed the baby, this movie could have been great. But no. Just like the biplane flying from the Rocky Mts at 12K feet to New York on one tank of gas with "serum" to cure the baby crashed, so did the movie.  A happy ending with the baby saved and the spineless main characther instantly going from a crying blathering idiot to a "Thanks boss for the 5,000k to save my baby and thanks for making me junior partner.... now F-U.  Your company sucks and there's going to be some changes around here and if you don't like it......Here's my baby, he can say MAMA!"

However, this movie does have one of the best examples of 1930's black stereotyping. The family goes through two houskeepers that just didn't fit.  Guess which 'race' the third was?  Guess how she worked out?  Guess which food she used as a metaphore when consoling the wife? (nope... the other one.)  Guess which food she cooks for the family on new years eve? (even after she's let go due to finances) *ring... who could that be? Oh, it's our former housekeeper! She's got nothing better to do at 11:00 new years eve but come by and share some stereotypical food she cooked for us! yay!

Finally:  Sound transfer aweful. Don't buy it.
