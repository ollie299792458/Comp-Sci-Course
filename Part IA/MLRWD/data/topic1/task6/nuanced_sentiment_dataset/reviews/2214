The first thing I noticed? PG-13?? NO WAY! Definitely NOT for YOUNG TEENS!!! There are a lot of sexual situations (basically having sex with whoever is behind the next door, including multiple partners, is highly glamorized, including the "deleted scenes".) This is soft porn folks with a very misleading PG-13 rating. Now for the rest of the story: I love extreme sports, action flicks and Vin Diesel but was very disappointed in this movie.  Diesel is great as the main character; he's ultra cool (as always) and adds some charming humor at times.  (The few short appearances of his Pontiac GTO is pretty awesome)  There are enjoyable, PHENOMENAL stunt sequences, altho some of the situations are RIDICULOUSLY unbelievable.  A couple of times, the action sequences go on for SOOOO LONGGGGG, you find yourself just "zoning out", getting bored and tapping your fingers waiting on something more than just slow motion explosions and gun blasts.  Add all of that in with the overall "darkness" of this film, with the headbanging music, moshing, drug abuse, etc. and it totalled out to be a major disappointment to me.
