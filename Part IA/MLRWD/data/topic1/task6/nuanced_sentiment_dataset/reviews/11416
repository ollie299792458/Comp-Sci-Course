Outstanding we have Gundam on Blu-Ray,
Well not exactly this is a new Gundam OVA and it is released on Blu-Ray and it has an Outstanding Story line, well thought out characters and very cool mecha designs. However with all of the great things going for this series it still is a Bandai America Crap release. Meaning Instead of giving the Gundam fans here in the US and the rest of North America the same quality as our Japanese counterparts they give us a sub par release. It may even be priced the same ( although reality is the Japanese version which is in the same Blu-Ray region is about $20.00 more) but there are jumps in quality in comparison between the 2 releases mostly in the accuracy of the colors ( meaning that the colors on a vibrant or high end HD set will appear washed out if you set your TV to a SD or darker setting it isn't as noticeable on The US release). Now that being said the quality of this Blu-Ray VS the other 2 Blu-Ray offerings ( Escaflownea & Eureka Seven ) does use a higher bit rate to remove pixelation but fails in color accuracy. In the Japanese version the colors do not looked as washed out as they do in the US release in fact the few defects that are in the US Release are no where to found in the Japanese Release. Now this is a better Blu-ray release then Bandai's other Blu-ray to the US market but there is still a lot of room for improvement.

Note my review here is a comparison between the Blu-ray release in the US and in the Japanese market if you want a really thorough review of just the US Blu-Ray edition I would suggest you check out [...] review.
