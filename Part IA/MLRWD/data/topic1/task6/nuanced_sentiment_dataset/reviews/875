This is a political drama. The story is that four rather religious Muslims guys who go from Britain to Pakistan for one guys wedding. Once there they decide to go to Afghanistan just after the war starts. Then they just happen to drive faraway in the wrong direction to a Taliban stronghold where they just stay long enough to be captured by the Northern Alliance. If this all sounds unbelievable too you, don't worry it sounds unbelievable to me as well. They were lucky that soon they were turned over to the U.S. military otherwise they would have been killed by the Northern Alliance. They are then imprisoned and eventually sent to Guantanamo. We then are shown details of what it was like for them in jail which is shown to being a tough jail which is the main theme of the movie. After awhile they are released.

The acting is good. Many of the characters were interesting.
There were several scenes that were good and being a traveller who goes frequently to third world, I found I could relate to many scenes.

The filming is good.
