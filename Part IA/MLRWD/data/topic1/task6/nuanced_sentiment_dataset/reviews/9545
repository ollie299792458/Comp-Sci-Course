As the wife of a huge fan of zombies in any genre and a horror fan herself, we were both severely disappointed by this movie.  The acting is completely absent, I've seen better delivery by kindergartners.  The plot made little to no sense and the special effects would only pass muster at a church spook trail at night.  One scene that included "brains" on the ground had us both wondering, "Was that canned cherries?"

There is a huge bounce in the timeline that made no sense, three groups of characters that made you cheer for the zombies, and a setting that was bland and uninteresting.  You lose characters who they go back to at the end for no apparent reason.  A lot of "What?" moments throughout.  The writing lacked a basic knowledge of what people would do in a situation like this, going from one extreme to the other.

I'm am just very glad that we did not pay much for this movie.  It makes "Diary of the Dead" look like it should be an Oscar winner.  I would greatly encourage you not to bother with this wanna be zombie movie.  As a person that has no experience making a movie, I could do better with a $500 budget and a camcorder.
