What gets me the most is the great reviews this pile of junk gets, this is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. Wasting about 1 hour just to introduce us to the bland characters, who are free loving hippies sailing on some yacht near the Turkish islands of Yalepha, we learn to not care about them at all. Once they land on the island, the suspense should begin but all we are shown is vignettes that are typical, the "sex starved guy", the "screaming girl", etc, etc. This was boring as heck and once the crazy monster, played by some half bald idiot in bad make-up comes on the scream, I had to laugh. The supposedly "wicked scene" was nothing but a plastic baby being devoured by the monster, yeah, that's really gruesome! Of course, the end is also typical, instead of attempting to kill the monster, he comes to the survivors of the slaughter and gets a small spike in his head, why didn't they just shoot him in the first place instead of dragging this worthless film over any longer? Grade F.
