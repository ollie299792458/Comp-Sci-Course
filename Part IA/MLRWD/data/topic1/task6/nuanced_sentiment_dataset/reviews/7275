This was a slow moving and boring movie.

It doesn't really have strong characters or character growth.  As a wrestler it doesn't help you appreciate, learn, or understand the sport.  It's not like Rocky where you learn a central key ingredient of determination, sorrow, guts, giving it your all, suffering, love, etc.

Instead the wrestler in this movie win a match then it cuts to a scene where he's like "can I watch tv?"  Gimme a break, what kind of LAME character development is that. The scene cuts are bad, the music is bad, the actors can't capture the fighting human spirit.  They even have the actor who played Paulie in Rocky, BUT that doesn't help bring or capture ANY of the fighting spirit from that movie.

Jut alame movie with very little comedy, action, or characters so I have NO IDEA why or what the purpose of this movie is.  It isn't good entertainment, and it doesn't teach much about life through it's character development, and it doesn't teach about wrestling.  So it's just a HORRIBLE movie watch at your own risk.
