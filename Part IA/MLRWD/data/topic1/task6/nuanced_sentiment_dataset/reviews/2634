CONTAINS SPOILERS !!! "Moral ambiguity" is a phase often associated with the films of Alfred Hitchcock. But it takes this low budget, far from Hitchcock level film to actually achieve a level of moral uncertainty. Jody Foster plays a too smart for her own good teen who has hidden her poet father's death  and continues to live on her own. She is set upon by her prejudiced  virago of a landlady (Alexis Smith), and the landlady's pedophile son (Martin Sheen). We casually learn over the course of the film that the young girl has poisoned her birth mother.( This fact will play significantly into the movie's final scene.) She is befriended by a local policeman (Mort Shuman of 'Jacques Brel' fame), and his amateur magician nephew (Scott Jacoby). (The uncertain age of this nephew is part of the film's ambiguity. His sexual relationship with the Foster character may be as illegal as what Sheen wants to do ! -The brief nude sequence with Foster, obviously cut from television showings of the film, is seriously disturbing on many levels.)
The source of the film is a novel, but much of the structure seems oddly stage bound. Mostly filmed on a single set, the living room, dining room and kitchen of an old house, it plays out like one of those old-fashioned stage thrillers.
Foster and Jacoby are simply too likable for all of their wild behavior. They are lost or trapped in a world of teenage logic.
One looks in vain for a "no animals were harmed" (although one assumes that none were) notice at the end of the film because of a really awful sequence where Sheen tortures and kills a Hamster.
