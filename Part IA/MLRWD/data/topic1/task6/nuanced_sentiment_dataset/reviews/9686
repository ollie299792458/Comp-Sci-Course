Three ghosts discussing one evening in their past lives five or six times, over and over, makes for a strange play... almost impossibly cheesy. And the acting of Bohr and his wife is so stilted (not bad but stilted) that I barely kept from laughing.

However the play is insightful and interesting. It helps teach quantum mechanics, and also helps us to wonder about the relationship between scientific investigation, personal ambition, political realities, and morality.

The physicists wax philosophical through the second half of the play treating us to metaphors for self-understanding (a la quantum mechanics) and even the unconscious (a la quantum mechanics)... in a funny and insightful way.  I was even forced to be invested in the characters despite the fact that "Bohr's" shoulders never move from the first moment to the final scene, he's a statue from shoulder up ((perhaps this was true to life?)).

So, its good watching.

But, on the other other hand, its not good thinking. I also couldn't help but feel the physicist's urgent need for a philosopher in the room--someone to introduce them to the invisible.
