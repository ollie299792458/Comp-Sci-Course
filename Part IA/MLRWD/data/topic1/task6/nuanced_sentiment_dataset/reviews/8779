Baseball is such a great American game and this movie really takes an interesting look at a behind the scenes scenario revolving around Billy Beane's Oakland Athletics during the 2002 season.

Brad Pitt, like all his movies, does a fantastic job in Money Ball.  He is funny, intense, and charismatic throughout the entire movie.  He really does a great job at depicting Billy Beane the general manager for a big league club, and Billy Beane the person.  He displays his renagade approach to dealing with authority and the adverse situation he was forced into.  Jonah Hill plays Peter Brand, Beane's right hand man and Yale economist who is good with numbers, especially pertaining to baseball statistics.  This is definitely the best role I have seen him in.

Basically, Pitts character and Jonah Hills character team up to find players who are cheap and who score runs.  The upcoming season features a roster where all the A's players leave to big market clubs and Beane has a small budget to work with.  Brand's keen mathmatical mind is what they rely on to choose their players.  They both team up to accomplish the ultimate goal: to win the World Series.

Obviously, most baseball fans know what happened on the field.  But this movies takes a different approach and examines what went on behind the closed doors.  It was fabulously acted and featured a great cast who all do an excellent job at telling this true story.  It is an inspirational movie with funny parts and rather dismal and serious scenes.  This movies has it all and is a must own for any sports fan or fan of sports movies.  In my opinion, this is right up there with "For the Love of the Game" and "The Rookie."  Definitely check out this truly original and classic film.
