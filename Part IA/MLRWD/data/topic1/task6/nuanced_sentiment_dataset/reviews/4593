Angels and Demons had a great cast.  It tryed so hard not to be like the book that maybe they should have changed the name of the film. Tom Hanks does a fine job reprising his role as Robert Langdon, but it would have been nice if the film version would have stuck to the story by Dan Brown wrote and not try to re-write a best seller for a screen play.  It cuts inportant parts completely out to the film the head of Cern a very important character is not even mentioned, therefore requiring the Vatican to be the ones to contact Robert Langdon which is ironic at best.  I for one can not understand why Hollywood thinks itself a better story teller than the writter they took the title from and but placed the guts of a Ford in the body of a Ferrari and want us to believe it will still do 0-60 in less than 5 seconds as it sputter for air just after the engine is turned over.  Don't get me wrong the actors and actreses do their best with what they are given but it is a poor attempt to tell what was an exciting tale in the book.
