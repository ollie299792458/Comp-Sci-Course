Yes, you are all correct, this film pales in comparison to the utter classics which are Superman and Superman II.  Still Superman III is definately worth watching.  The look and feel of the movie are still very Superman-like (as opposed to Superman IV where the effects are beyond cheesy and cheap-- it looked like they used cardboard cut-outs to make Supes fly in IV).  Admittedly, Richard Pryor is painful to watch in this film, however there are some really neat scenes which make this film exciting and worth watching, most notably the scene where Superman battles Clark Kent. Its a weird premise, but a thrill to watch.  It's a very exciting and well-executed fight which alone makes the film worth it.  Also Supes confrontation with the super-computer/cyborg at the finale is the stuff of little kid's nightmares (that's how it was for me when I first watched this as a young child).  Also we get to see more of Smallville and Lana Lang.  All in all, this is not up to par with the first two films, but is not nearly and horrible as the fourth and has enough redeeming features to make it worth your while, as long as you filter out Richard Pryor's unwanted presence in this film.
