Such a great action movie. When I was young I watched Arnold and movies like The Rock. Now I desire to see movies where bullies and tyrants are put in their place. Because I'm older and I have run into more than a few. Great film. Very relevant to our modern times. I challenge you to take this film too seriously and not ask too many questions and to revel in the cathartic joy. I remember when being a Democrat wasn't as much of a joke. When it really was about the working people and personal liberties still mattered. Now it is all about money and power and the race for more of both amongst the people that already have them. No one cares anymore about honesty or fairness or morals. People lie in their jobs to keep them because those in power know that telling the truth will take too much time and won't make them as much money or protect themselves as much. This movie is completely out of date in a good way. It isn't the look of the cars. It is the idea that any of the little people without the power should deserve any of it at all, even under the circumstances of unfit leadership.
