I have always enjoyed stand-up. I'm a part of the Comedy Club at college for a reason. I have heard my share of comics, yet none could make me laugh as hard as I did when I first saw this performance. Though definitely not for the kiddies, Robin Williams delivers one of the best performances I've seen, &amp; I'm STILL laughing! Laugh as he does Bill Gates ("Monopoly's just a game, Senator, I'm trying to control the world!"), corrects the judges in the Winter Olympics ("They said that marjuana is a performance enhancing drug. Marjuana enhances many things: colors, tastes, sensations, but you are certainly not empowered!"), &amp; talks about security on the West Coast ("One hummer, 2 national guardsmen on both sides of the Golden Gates Bridge. Problem is, the hummer &amp; national guardsmen are in jungle camoflague. For those of you who have never been to Cali, the bridge is bright orange!")
I wiped tears from my eyes during the talks about animals ("Is it me, or are cat's drag queens?"), weather ("This winter, the temperatures were like, 80, 20, 30, 50! It was weather by sible, it was weird!"), absurd battles between celebs ("Even Kilegal is like, 'What the **** are you people doing? Why don't you get Hannible Lecture &amp; I &amp; Chef, just kick out the jams!'") &amp; of course, who could forget...MICHAEL JACKSON! ("You're not a freak, you're just surgically enhanced &amp; you've spent more money than the Vatican!")
So put the popcorn &amp; soda down, otherwise you'll choke, &amp; laugh the night away with Robin Williams. Definitely worth it!
