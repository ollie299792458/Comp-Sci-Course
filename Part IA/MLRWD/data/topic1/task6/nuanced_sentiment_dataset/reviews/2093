Having not read the book I can't say how well they did in comparison, however I do have to agree that it felt very underdeveloped despite my ignorance to the original story. It had such potential to be great but ended up mediocre. I'm not sure if Edward S. is a bad actor or badly directed. I'm leaning towards the latter since he did manage to pull it off at times. The wierd "eye widening" that happened oftem didn't seem genuine and when he made his way to the fallen Saphira after the final battle I almost laughed at the way he "struggled" to reach her. It would have been better if he'd crawled a foot or two, then dragged himself to his feet then hurried as much as his battered body would allow until he collapsed at her side. Typed out is sounds just as lame as what actually happened but in the mind it looks better than both.

Plus, what was with the funky editing? Are we telling a story or a series of scenes? It got better as it went along but at the beginning it was a bit painful.

And fianlly, the final battle. Was there actually a battle or just a dragon burning everything in site? As it was told in the movie, I fail to see how having a dragon on their side made any real difference. Where's the give and take? Where's the back and forth betwen the bad guy getting ahead and the good guys getting their shot. Where's the sudden burst of inspiration that leads to an unexpected twist that finales in a win for the good guys?

Maybe I expect too much after LOTR. As my sister said, this was no Helm's Deep. A poor man's Helm's Deep.

I don't feel the original writing was that bad. I get the feeling there was more to the battle but we didn't get to see it.

There's forshadowing and then there's just giving away the end.

That said, Eraon was entertaining to watch,as I said, if you've never read the book , which I haven't.

Once again. Lots of potential but very underdeveloped plot and characterwise.
