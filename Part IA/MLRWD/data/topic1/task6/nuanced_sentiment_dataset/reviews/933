I bought this movie because I was intrigued by the storyline and I wanted to watch Anne Brochet. I was slightly disappointed by the movie, but Brochet did a very fine job(I only wish that she had a bigger part here). I think the biggest drawback of the movie is that the conversations (or the lack of it) between the two main characters did not live up to its astoundingly clever opening plot. I can accept their first two meetings being cut short because of the circumstances of their meeting, but the subsequent ones continued to be terse and abrupt. There's just not enough material to support the improbable premise. The director scramble to prop up the main storyline with subplots and characters (William's secretary, his last girlfriend, the real shrink). While they're all quite interesting and fit well into the plot, but I thought it was really the last straw when Ana's husband showed up at William's office. Overall, Sadrine and Fabrice did a good job in the title roles (especially the latter), but the storyline and the relationship between Ana and William could have been developed better.
