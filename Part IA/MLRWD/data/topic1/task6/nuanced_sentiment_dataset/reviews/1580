Even though this documentary shows the cold truth about the struggles of eating disorders, they focus only on the drama (to sell more) and not in hope and success.

When my therapist recommended Renfrew for my treatment this summer, I told him there was no way I would go there. This documentary scared the hell out of me and I thought it wouldn't work. But he convinced me to give it a chance, for this documentary does not portray the goodness of the treatment. And he was right. The program does work. It might take more time for some people , but it works. While I was there, I also learned that they had follow this girl for the documentary, but they didn't put her on it... she did overcome her eating disorder. And I could tell you a whole lot more success stories.

This dvd is good for educating parents and friends of people with eating disorder so they can understand them better. But never for someone with an eating disorder because it may be triggering for them (believe me... I know).

Anyways... I'm all better now. Not that the struggle is over (it takes some time), but I'm a lot stronger and determined. We can beat this!!
