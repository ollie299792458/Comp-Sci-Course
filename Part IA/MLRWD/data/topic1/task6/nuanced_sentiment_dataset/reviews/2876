I thought the film was fine.  It parades itself as being a black and white film but though the final print was in black and white the film was actually shot in color and converted -- I am not sure one can even buy black and white film anymore.  In any event the tonal palette is more gray and white than black and white, but this appears to have been the director's artistic choice.  If anyone is interested in seeing what a real black and white film can be like go watch the Ghost and Mrs. Muir -- even on a standard DVD it sparkles and shines.  In any event my biggest complaint is the blu ray DVD authoring.  Like so many blu ray disks it has too many previews at the beginning and the content owner makes it difficult to skip them.  How many times do I need to be subjected to the same stupid previews?  And as with so many blu ray disks it was authored without the ability to resume playback.  This means that everytime one stops the film to answer the phone, feed the kid or take a whiz the film starts over -- over with the same stupid previews that are hard to bypass.  I think that many studios must hate their customers to provide products that just don't work well in the home environnment.  In summary I give the film a 4 but the blu ray disk a 2 accounting for my overall score of 3.
