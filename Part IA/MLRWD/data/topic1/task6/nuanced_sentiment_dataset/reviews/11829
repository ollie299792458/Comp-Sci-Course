I think this movie is too fragmented and interrupted for someone who (like me) is a complete neophyte to the Evangelion TV series. It seems to be an ambitious summary, made by cutting/pasting small and sparse fragments of relevant chapters or events of the long series into the much more limited movie time frame.  I haven't seen the series, but just judging this movie on its own, it is way too fragmented and over-compressed.  It gave me an impression of too many omissions of important developments, and I found it somewhat frustrating to try to follow.  Obviously the makers assumed the viewers would know some things about Evangelion that I didn't know at all.  Some examples of the weak points I found: at some times the movie suddenly starts explaining (e.g. resolving) some issues as if it was perfectly clear to the viewer that those were pending issues in the plot, when I didn't even had a clue about the existence of those issues in the movie.  Also some characters are just shown in one scene, and in the next their true nature is suddenly revealed, with no development in between.  On the good side, I was particularly impressed with the musical fragments in the movie, absolutely beautiful, particularly the Bach one.  If I ever have the opportunity, I'll try to watch the first chapters of the series to get into it, instead of (or before) trying to follow this movie. I would recommend the same to anyone that is not initiated in the series.
