I have inadvertently become an Evan Rachel Wood fan. I have seen her in "Thirteen", "Pretty Persuasion", and now "King of California". Her performances in all three films are well beyond girls of her age. Michael Douglas is in the same form that made "Romancing the Stone" such a hit. He does not disappoint here, either.

What do you do, when you are a girl who has had to work two jobs, fit only for girls of that tender age of sixteen, just to pay the bills left behind by a) A mother who is an anal "hand-model" that deserts her family because b) Your father is a mental case just released from a sanitarium, and will now live with you? Well, that question is answered in this somewhat dark comedy. The histories of both Charlie (Michael Douglas), and Miranda (Evan Rachel Wood), his daughter, are shown in "flashback" fashion throughout the film, so you pretty much know what drives Charlie to do some of the things he does, and how Miranda has had to cope with two dysfunctional parents.

The center of Charlie's seeming delusion is what drives this film, and with it, the method of Charlie's madness. All of the weird things Miranda had to deal with as a child, and now young adult, become clear, as she comes to the realization of how much her father REALLY loved her.

Evan Rachel Wood just keeps getting better at her craft. I can't wait to see what she does next! Here is an actor to look out for! Michael Douglas, well, he's a chip off the old block, alright! His father Kirk would be proud! I've seen him in just about everything except Science Fiction, and he is an extremely competent actor. These two mesh well together, in this film.

Here is an Independent Film that comes across as a film with a much larger budget. The acting is superb, and the ending is DEFINITELY worth the wait! This is a good one!
