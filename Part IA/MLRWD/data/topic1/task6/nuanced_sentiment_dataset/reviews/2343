I love this movie. It has everything. There's tons of gore, knockout gut- wrenching zombie mutilatiation, demonic- evil sprit possesion material to go around and come back for seconds. I watched it twice when I rented it. I advise you DON"T LISTEN TO THE RATING AMAZON.COM GAVE THIS MOVIE&gt; IT IS NOT NC-17! IT"S NOT EVEN RATED. Movies like this shouldn't be rated because they are so outrageously violent and gory that in the end, it doesn't matter what it's rated because it's just a horror movie and succeeds as just that. It was released in 1981, but don't be fooled. You'd never guess it was made 20+ years ago. It is a classic in the horror world. The filming is great. If you watch this and THE SIXTH SENSE and you'll see some strong resemblences between the two and the way they were filmed. The fact that this movie doesn't have much of a plot doesn't affect the quality of the movie. This movie is awesome. Rent it or buy it today if you are true to the horror genre.
(This movie contains strong gore violence, brief breast exposure(nudity), and very mild language. Not suitable for those under the age of twelve.)
