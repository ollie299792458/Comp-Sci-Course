The above title really says most of what you need to know.  Sci-fi dude (think "Commander Shepard" from Mass Effect here) gets stranded in 8th century Norway, attacked by the requisite Vikings, and fights the Big Scary Monster for them.  Think "Beowulf" meets "Aliens" meets "Predator" meets "Dances With Wolves" and you've got a real good grasp of the film.

A bit predictable in lots of places, and a bit cheesy in others.  Some uneven handling of plot events; not sure if this was an editing problem or a script problem, but these situations could have been improved with a very few scenes / exchanges.

However, as an sci-fi / monster action flick, more than acceptable overall.  Reasonably enjoyable with a couple of wince moments.  Some portions are done quite well.  The backstory for the monster is decent enough.  Effects are good.  Chances for a sequel are not promising...

Three stars plus.  Worth the VOD rental.  Would watch again; I'll pick it up as a purchase if it's ever "REALLY" cheap...
