I love Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series of books. They are fun, exciting, sexy, and a little dangerous. Maybe a lot dangerous. I like the HBO series True Blood as well. Naturally, they have made some changes that we will like or not like in the TV series. For example, keeping Lafayette alive in the series although he dies early in the book series. I like it.

In this second season, I'm really disappointed in the concentration on the maenad. I like the actress, and she is perfect for the part. However, this story is terribly over-emphasized, which detracts from the rest of the stories. I think it should have been shorter as it was in the book. It was gross. I count on Sookie books and TV to be mysteries that happen to be a little different, funny and sexy with a little vampire/werewolf lore. Guilty pleasures. The maenad story was tedious after a few episodes. I found myself longing for that story to be over. Of course, if I got to see an episode weekly, it might not seem as tedious or gross. I have to borrow the DVDs in the complete set and watch it all in a week before turning it back in to the library. :)

Still, I'll be loyal to Sookie TV and books till the end. The characters are well drawn, and the actors are well cast. Everyone's acting is great except for Bill, who also has the worse attempt at a genteel Southern accent that I have heard. I have to give him credit for trying 1) to portray a complicated vampire, and 2) to attempt the 19th century Southern genteel accent.

If I had my wish, there would be more emphasis on Sookie, Bill, Pam, Sam, Eric and maybe Alcide. There are spotlights on Tara, Jason, Lafayette, and others at times, but the core characters are mentioned above.
