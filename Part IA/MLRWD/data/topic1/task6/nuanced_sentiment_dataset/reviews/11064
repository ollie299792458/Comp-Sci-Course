Oh boy, if you want the ultimate, most painful episode of MST with Joel, you should choose this one!  "Manos" garners the distinction of being the ONLY film that the Mads ever apologized for showing, and that says a lot...
Plot (ha ha)--an incredibly stupid (and lost) man and his family are traveling to Valley Loogie (really Valley Lodge, but watch the movie).  Along the way, they end up on this barren dirt road and find themselves at this creepy house that wasn't there when they passed by the same clump of sand a few minutes before.  Depsite this bizarre happenstance, our idiot main character Mike decides that this place is better than any Holiday Inn and enlists the help of the freakish Torgo in removing the bags from the car.  Torgo weakly insists "The Master won't approve," but our intrepid moron completely ignores the refusal and invites himself and his family to spend the night.  What follows is a goof in a black robe with huge red hands sewn on, a WWF-style "models in nightgowns" wrestling, and the family being assumed into the 'Manos' cult family.  
Sound ridiculous?  IT IS, and to watch this movie any other way would be unimaginably evil.  While you can indeed find "Manos" unMistied, I don't know why you'd: a) spend the cash, or b) want to.  Is it really a coincidence that Hal Warren (Mike in the film) was the writer, director, and a fertilizer salesman???
Joel and the 'Bots rip on this like no other, and you'll get to see Mike Nelson before he became the captain on the SOL (watch the end segment with Torgo's Pizza Delivery).  I loved the Invention Exchange in this episode, and you get the bonus fun of the short "Hired, Part 2" (Electric Boogaloo) at the opening of the video.
Worth every dollar and ounce of pain for a devoted Mistie!
