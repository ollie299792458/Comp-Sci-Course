My son loves the study of weather, so I thought this would a great movie for us to watch. It's not. It has very little to do with the weather.
A TV weather man living in Chicago. He tries out for the position at a national morning show and gets the job with no meteorology degree. He wants to have his family love him and wants a 'traditional' family. The family, separated, does seem ready and willing to make changes, but he chooses not to make the changes and/or sacrifices it takes to do that in his own life. The saying, "if you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten," comes to mind here.
In the end his father, who appeared to have a much higher standard, dies. He (Weather Man) moves to New York. His now ex-wife with her new husband and children stay in Chicago... the end.
Throw in numerous expletives, and a one night stand breast exposed sex scene (supposed to be funny???), and children being preyed upon sexually, That's what The Weather Man is.
I was disappointed. It's not a family movie at all. It is rated R but makes most rated R movies look very tame.
