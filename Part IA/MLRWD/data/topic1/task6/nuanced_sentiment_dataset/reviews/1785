I enjoyed this movie and it will become a movie that I will actually rewatch. On AOTS I heard it referred to as "The Neverending Story" for girls. That was actually a very good comparison. You have a young girl with problems in the normal world finding herself trapped in a surreal alternate world on a quest to stop the spreading darkness from destroying the world of light.

The special effects are strange. There not the cutting edge effects one is used to. The effects are very stylized and interesting. The effects are part of the story; the stoey is not an excused to have cool special effects like many movies.

You can definitely feel Neil Gaiman's presence in this movie, buit it is the Neil Gaiman of "Stardust," "Anansi Boys," and "Neverwhere" not the Neil Gaiman of "Sandman" or "American Gods." This is a lighter entry.

This movie hits a strange audience. It is a little old for most children yet a little light hearted for most adults. Despite this I did enjoy it and think it is an excellent movie that you could sit down and be able to watch with the whole family.
