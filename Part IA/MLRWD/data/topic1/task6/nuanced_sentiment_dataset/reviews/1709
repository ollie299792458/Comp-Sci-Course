One of the greatest movies you've never seen.  It suffered from incredibly bad marketing (and an incredibly challenging film to market).  This film is much more about faith, love, and redemption, than it is about sex and violence. (but be warned, sex and violence are present in large measure)

This is an actors movie, and it delivers some of the most mesmerizing performances I've ever seen.

Samuel Jackson: Possibly his most intense role ever, certainly his most intense since Pulp Fiction. He is at his most tortured, most complex best. As a bonus, he learned how to play blues guitar for this film, and is surprisingly good.

Christina Ricci:  A career performance.  One of the darkest, most disturbing female leads ever.  The fact that she wasn't nominated for an Oscar, Golden Globe, People's Choice, etc is a damned crime. This is up there with "All About Eve", "Monster", and "Thelma And Louise".  She is incendiary, bold, honest, fearless, raw, etc, etc.

Justin Timberlake is surprisingly effective as a young soldier who is shattered and broken.

S. Epatha Merkerson is her usual brilliant self in an unfortunately small role.

Craig Brewer's writing and direction is occasionally uneven, but it delivers so many phenomenal scenes makes it easy to forgive.

Overall, for a small, overlooked film, I cannot recommend this strongly enough.  It is brilliant, eminently re-watchable, and one of those rare films that make you re-think the possibilities of cinema.
