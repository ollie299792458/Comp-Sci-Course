I really liked this  movie! I can see it over and over again and I always laught.
Well I'm not a good movie reviewer, but this one is by far the best Tarantino's movie.
There are so many reasons that make this movie a masterpeace that I can't tell them all as I don't want to write a 4 page review.

So I resume all in this: I'm sorry if there are famous that already said that, but I like this def. A picture is a masterpeace because you can see it over and over again and there is always something that appear to be new, fresh, you don't get tired in front of it as you always can be looking at details that makes it unique. The same happens in music with Mozart or Bach etc...

You see this movie over and over again and there is always something new that you show or notice about it. I think this movie can pass generation over generation and always will cause an effect to it's public. Maybe we can show things that even Tarantino never got in mind as the creator of this masterpeace.

just in case: Sorry about my english
