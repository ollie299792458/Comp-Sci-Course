This is a pretty weak entry in the pod people series, in every way inferior to Philip Kaufmann's brilliant 1978 "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." The premise is essentially the same, with aliens coming to earth and inhabiting the bodies of existing beings here. This time, however, the story revolves around a teenage girl, her brother, her step-mother and her father, who is doing some testing at a military base. There is the clich&eacute;d "You're not my real mother" bickering between the girl, played by the luscious Gabrielle Anwar, and the stepmother (Meg Tilley), as well as the clich&eacute;d tension between the girl and her father, who just doesn't understand what its like to be a teenager. Blah. I'm not certain why the producers wanted to make another body snatching alien movie, but wouldn't one assume they would at least want to surpass the first two? Otherwise, why even make the movie? Even so, it is worth watching if for no other reason than to see Gabrielle Anwar in all her splendor. That, and if you have not seen the first two, this one would be okay.
