I hadn't paid attention and so was pleasantly surprised when watching the extra afterward in which Kirk mentions wanting to make the movie because he loved the book Brave Cowboy, written by Edward Abbey.  If you know and love Edward Abbey, the whole story clicks into his perspective.  Even so, the spine of the story is rather clunky and under motivated, with preposterous situations.  Abbey was digging deeper into the basic point than anyone else, and focused on that rather than on the overall demands of storytelling.  Yet that in itself adds magically to the charm of this movie, which deconstructs the assumptions of modern sensibilities, showing how they don't fit so well with anyone determined to be free.  There were other naturalists and environmentalists before Abbey, but none so militant.  Lots of funny, brainy, engaging aspects throughout the story.

Kirk Douglas hired Dalton Trumbo to write the screenplay, and insisted that Trumbo be openly credited, which Douglas says broke the blacklist.  Kirk was a real humanist, and you can see in this movie, among his favorites, how closely he identifies with the central character.  Fine acting in all the supporting roles too, with early performances by a number of later familiar faces.
