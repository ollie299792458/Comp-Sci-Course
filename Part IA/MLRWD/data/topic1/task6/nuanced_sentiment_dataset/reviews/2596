The newest animated Disney flick "Sinbad" is another sweet and fun film for younger viewers to enjoy and makes for a pleasant escape from the excessively cold and violent movies of around the same time span. 
The story is of an exiled sailor who steals treasures from the sea but one day he is framed for stealing the world's most sacred treasure Book of Peace from and is now on a quest to recover and return the Book of Peace from the Goddess of discord Erris (Michelle Pfieffer). Proteus, the prince of the village, and an old childhood friend of Sinbad (they grew apart over the years), is risking being put to death for setting Sinbad free and now sinbad must recover the Book of Peace from Erris at the edge of the world before the tenth day or else Proteus will be given the guillotine. 
Sinbad however, steers in a different direction for the fun and sun of Fiji but a young and attractive woman named Marina, bride of the prince Proteus, sneaks along and is determined to make sure that Sinbad and his crew stay on course on their mission to recover the Book of Peace and save Proteus' life. 
This movie has beautiful animated landscape scenery and is a lot of fun to watch. Unfortunately, it is also very predictable and does not cover any new grounds at all. 
The main villain Erris, is NOT the attractive babe that this movie portrays her as. She, according to legend, was a very hideous monster and became very angry and evil due to her ugliness. That's why she is the Goddess of Discord. 
"Sinbad" is a fun and charming movie and worth checking out but just a rule of thumb, don't expect anything that will leave you floored with awe, or leave behind any lasting impression. Still a decent movie, without being amazing.
