I received the DVD set of Shogun for Christmas.  A nice present since I've wanted to see it again ever since it first aired.

However, like a previous reviewer, I found it frustrating that almost 1/3 of the original mini-series is missing, and I think that the description of it on several sites as the "complete" mini-series is at best misleading and at worst in contravention of trading standards.  Some of the most memorable parts of the original are entirely absent, including the demonstration of the the Musket Regiment in action, and Mariko's group's attempt to fight their way out of Osaka Castle before she threatens to commit seppuku, as well as more homely sequences such as Blackthorne teaching Mariko and Toranaga to dive head first from the galley.

A previous reviewer notes the lack of action sequences, and this is part of the reason...several have been cut out.

The same reviewer mentions that Blackthorne lapses into "thee" and "thou" speech inappropriately.  Again, that's explained in a cut section: when Blackthorne and Mariko speak in "normal" speech they're supposed to be speaking Portuguese, but they both also speak Latin, and use that as a private tongue since some samurai who've had contact with Portuguese sailors speak their language, whereas only the priests speak Latin.

Overall, good, but I would have given it 5 stars if it really had been the complete mini-series.  Two more disks would have covered it, so why wasn't it issued complete?
