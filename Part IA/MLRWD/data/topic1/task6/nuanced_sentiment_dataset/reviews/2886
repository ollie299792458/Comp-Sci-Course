So FINALLY we get the epic Truth or Dare on Blu-ray after 21 years, and the quality of this HD transfer is so GORGEOUS!!  Madge looks stunning from every angle.  This film really depicted Madonna when she was at the top of her career, she was totally untouchable.

From the rain of Japan, through threats of arrest for 'public indecency' in Toronto Canada, this documentary follows Madonna on her 1990 'Blond Ambition' concert tour. I love how it was filmed in black and white, but with the concert pieces in blazing color.  It's truly an intimate look at the work of the mastermind marketing diva/music performer she is.  Highlights include the touching prayer circles with the dancers before each performance, a fun game of Truth or Dare involving a bottle of Evian, and funny bed games with the dance troupe. I laughed, I cried, I have always thoroughly enjoyed this film!

I gave this release 4 out of 5 stars because I am disappointed that there is no bonus material included here.  I own this film on Laserdisc, DVD and VHS, and at least the VHS version has two bonus live performances from the Blond Ambition Tour (Like A Prayer and Hanky Panky).  I find it very strange they couldn't put those extra performances on this Blu-ray edition considering how far technology has come and there is no shortage of space on the disc.

Record labels love to complain about the status of the industry and how people aren't buying as much as they used to, but if they would wake up and make the item at hand more enticing, then people would for sure part with their hard earned money a lot easier.

If you want to see the REAL DEAL queen of pop work the stage and camera, pick up this documentary.  It's a real show & tell unlike any other :)
