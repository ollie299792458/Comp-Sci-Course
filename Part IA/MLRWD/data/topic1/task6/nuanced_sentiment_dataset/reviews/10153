...I've seen yet, but it's in the top 10. This was a real letdown. Not only is the story unlogical (why would this woman want to return to this town, even if she inherited her father's house? why would she insist on going to see a football match after just being raped?), but some of the actors are simply too poor to watch. Kate Bosworth must be one of the worst actresses I've ever seen on screen, and apart from playing the character implausible, there is absolutely no chemistry between her and James Marsden, who doesn't really play any better. (not one moment did I believe those two could be a married couple). The only convincing parts are played by James Woods and Alexander Skarsgard (although I have to say I saw him in better roles before ("Om Sara", or even in "true blood" he is way better), and I wonder if he accepts roles like this one or the one in the upcoming "Battleship" just for money's sake).The movie itself is far from any real logic, and the scenes seem randomly thrown together to end in a way over the top showdown.
