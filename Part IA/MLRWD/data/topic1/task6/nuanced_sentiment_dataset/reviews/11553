This film was released in 1976. When it came out, most mainstream journalists thought they were merely watching a satiric & comedic farce. But now 31 years later, they (and we) know that what we were watching then was a  warning from Paddy Chayefsky (screen writer) and Sidney Lumet (director). Sadly, it was a warning that was largely ignored.

Every time I see the scenes of "The Howard Beale Show," I can't help but think that, back then, such antics were considered unthinkable. When actress Faye Dunaway enthusiastically talks about the concept of "reality-based television," such concepts were unheard of back then.

But now...

Just watch this film and then turn the TV onto Fox News. Just watch this film and think about the "reality TV" shows that proliferate all over the dial. And please listen to Ned Beaty's speech on "the shape of things today" and how "There is no America! There is no Democracy. There is only IBM, ITT and AT&T..." Then you'll begin to understand that this film isn't just about the death of network news as we knew it then, it's about the birth of the Corporate States of America that we know now.

This film is a classic.
