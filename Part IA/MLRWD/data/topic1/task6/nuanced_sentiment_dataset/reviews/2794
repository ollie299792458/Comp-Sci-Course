I just got done seeing the film, so I'm not reviewing the trailer.  This is not a good movie.  As others have stated, the acting, besides Blalock and Van Dien, is wooden and amateurish, and the writing will make you cringe.

It's also quite boring, all told.  It might make a mediocre one hour Stargate SG1 episode but there's not enough here to carry a 3 hour film (maybe it just felt like 3 hours).

They claimed when they were making this movie it would be much truer to the book.  Apparently, Heinlein was not a Libertarian and an Atheist, but a Republican and a Christian.  I definitely felt like there was some sort of hidden Jesus agenda here.

About the only good thing is we get to see the powered armor exoskeletons finally, after all these years.  No, that part was not cribbed from Power Rangers, that was actually in the original book first published in 1959.  Unfortunately, we only get to see the suits for a short bit.  But, they were cool, for 2 minutes.

Speaking of the original novel, you're better off spending your time reading that, than watching this.  You're already at the worlds largest bookstore, might as well go order it.
