I recently came across this movie at a flea market, and said "Wow, I remember this". I had a copy when it 1st came out on VHS, but I wasn't as impressed back then because I was a kid and I was such a Batman fanatic that anything that didn't have a big budget and Michael Keaton and Tim Burton's name attached I didn't want to be bothered with (not to mention I had never read a Punisher comicbook). But having watched the movie again almost 20 years later (and since gathered a nice Punisher graphic novel collection) I can say this movie has gotten maybe the worse bum wrap ever. If your a Punisher fan of the graphic novels, especially Garth Ennis fans, you will fall in love with this version of the Punisher. Everything that was wrong with the 2004 movie was done right in Dolph Lundgren's version, he even plays a much better Punisher than Thomas Jane. And the story is right out of a Garth Ennis story, it even made me think that is where he gets his inspiration for his stories. The movie reminded me of "Up is Down and Black is White" and "In The Beginning" graphic novels. Believe me this story is a true interpretation of The Punisher. And even though he doesn't have the skull  T-shirt they made it so you can forgive them for it 20 minutes into the movie. This movie should easily be a cult classic and should be re-released, it really is ashame that it has such an undeserved bad reputation that it does. And until Punisher:War Zone comes out, this movie stands as the definitive Punisher movie.
