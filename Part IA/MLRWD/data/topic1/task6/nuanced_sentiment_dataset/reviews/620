I have been a die hard fan of the classic for a long time (ever since I saw it during its broadcast debut on NBC in 1981).  However, I say, without shame, that I like this reimaging.  I say reimaging rather than remake because it was intended to be a different movie than the original.  I love the fact that they spent more time on young Michael, and the actor that portrayed him did a wonderful job.  There was a creepy yet sympathetic element to his performance, not unlike Sissy Spacek's role in Carrie.  The casting of the giant Tyler Mane was also a good move.  He towered over everyone and the scenes in the institution with the orange mask were chilling.  Alot of people missed the point of some of the plot changes, but, to me, that is what made the movie good.

I will say if you go into this movie expecting a classic on par with John Carpenter's film, you may be disappointed.  If you go into this movie with an open mind, you may enjoy it more.  Do not go into it ready to pick out the differences, if so you will miss the point of the film entirely.  It is more brutal and has more nudity and profanity than the original,so be prepared for that.

The bottom line is that I liked it.  It is not John Carpenter's Halloween, it's Rob Zombie's Halloween.  If you want to see the classic, then watch the original.  If you want to see a reimaging, then watch the new version.  The choice is yours.
