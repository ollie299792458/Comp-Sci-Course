Man on Wire was an enthralling documentary that sucked my in from the start.  I am too young to remember the event when it actually happened, but the video made me feel as though I lived through it.  The photography was breathtaking.  Having climbed to the top of Notre Dame and studied the gargoyles, it was mesmorizing to see the photos of him "suspended in air" next to them.  How he was able to plan and execute his Twin Towers spectacle was fascinating.

I also think this video in a post 9/11 world was, in a way, an inadvertant tribute to the Twin Towers.  It made me sad to watch the footage and think that those towers are no longer there.  It made me mad to think how he was able to plan this complex stunt without being caught by any security at the Towers.  Which brings me to my criticism:  I think it was a glaring omission to not include in this documentary Petit's feelings about the fall of the towers.  This man dreamed of walking between the towers before they even were built - to not include his commentary on their destruction left me wanting more.

Overall, however, this movie mesmorized me and I highly recommend it to everyone!
