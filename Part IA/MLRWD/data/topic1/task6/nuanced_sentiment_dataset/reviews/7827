"Out Of Reach" was a decent Steven Seagal effort. The plot was: William Lansing's pen pal gets kidnapped by an illegal human trafficking ring. Matt Schulze a.k.a "Chupa" from "Blade II" plays the very creepy villain Faisal. Also, in this film was Robbie Gee a.k.a "Kahn" from "Underworld".

The sword fight finale between Lansing and Faisal was short, but sweet. This scene was reminiscent of "Marked For Death" when Seagal fights the second & final "Screwface" at the end. Ahh nostalgia ...

My favorite part is right before the sword fight when Seagal says "This my favorite moment in life" and Faisal goes "what's that?" then Seagal says "When the predator becomes the prey."

Seagal deserves credit for tackling a real life issue in the world. Unfortunately, human trafficking takes place today. Seagal did this film 5 years before Liam Neeson's "Taken".

The voice dubbing that people criticize is only obvious in 3 scenes. The 3 voice-overs don't take anything away from the film. The voice dubbing was not as diabolical as "Attack Force" or "A Dangerous Man". The dubbing was done when the girl was reading the letter and when Seagal is thinking on the computer. The only obvious one was during the shoot out at the brothel. Steven Seagal voiced the majority of the lines himself (probably 90%).

The shoot out at the brothel was fan-F'n-tastic. Seagal was shooting at Robbie Gee and his cronies. Seagal turned that place into the "Bordello of Blood" better than "Tales From The Crypt"!!!

Overall, I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars. You have to admire the noble task that  William Lansing embarked on. There is right and wrong in the world. Lansing was a hero. Seagal kills the villain Faisal with a "Samurai Showdown" move.
