This was definetly my least favorite of all the Halloween movies.
The only good thing about it was that Jamie Lee Curtis returned.
I didn't like the fact that they totally disregarded the last two movies. Although Jamie Lee does talk about how she faked her own death, she never mentions the fact that she has a daughter (who appeared in Halloween 4 & 5.)I was also bothered by the fact that the movie was not set in Haddonfield, it just wasn't the same. It was like taking Jason out of Camp Crystal Lake. The movie almost seemed like an excuse to find roles for the up-and comer teens which where very hot at the moment. I also had a serious problem with the guy they cast as Michael Myers. Gimme a break! First of all, he was way to short, he walked like a duck, and YOU COULD SEE HIS BIG BLUE EYES! Michael's eye are supposed to be black! Also,the mask was totally wrong. The scariest mask they used was in The Curse Of Michael Myers. The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was the fact that they did keep it going by making another movie. If I wasn't a die hard Halloween fan, I probably would have enjoyed this movie alot more, but there was just too many things wrong about it. I didn't fit in with any of the other movies in the series. They should have gone back to the end of Halloween 5 and started again.
