some people like english dub because they don't want to read. if that's you ok fine buy this(also this release has inferior picture quality--see below) i personally hate english dubs.
where are the extras????
looking at the technical details will tell you that there is no option for the original language track(best in my opinion) with options for subtitles.(just the attrocious dub track) this release doesn't appear to be anamorphic ("anamorphic" yields a better picture for widescreen capable tv's). that's too bad since the U.S. has never had a proper release of this title. but i'm writing to tell all who care that there is a better release WITH the original cantonese track and optional english subtitles. that dvd is also 1:78 WIDESCREEN ANAMORPHIC VIDEO. includes interviews with the director,trailers,deleted scene,and other EXTRAS! that is why  this release deserves a low rating(i usually don't review movies but these awful U.S. releases are [upsetting] me...). So if you want the superior version i recommend searching [elsewhere] for it...
