The author of "I Know What You Did Last Summer", the great Lois Duncan, deserves a huge apology for how dumb this was. Duncan's novel was based on suspense. The movie was based on gore.  The movie barely follows  the book. In the book, the story starts at that year later, keeping the  reader hanging, trying to figure out what they did. Of course, some books  and movies should have that sort of epilogue, but not this. It should have  been shown to the crowd through flashbacks. But that is the least of this.  The acting is terrible, and the pace is lost from the beginning to the end.  The climax was NOT thrilling, and the murder scenes were just stupid.  Hewitt played the character of Julie so terribly. You could tell she was  about to giggle, like she does every other second of her day. Gellar was  just terrible, as was Prinze and Phillipe. The four of them were terrible  actors, and the movie was so lame. I mean, that whole scene with the body  and crabs in Julie's trunk was done up so terribly, and when she returned  to find that--oh my!--the corpse AND crabs were gone, I wondered,  "Well, how the hell did the killer do that so quickly?" Anyhow,  this movie doesn't deserve any of the hype it gets. It's absolutely  horrible.
