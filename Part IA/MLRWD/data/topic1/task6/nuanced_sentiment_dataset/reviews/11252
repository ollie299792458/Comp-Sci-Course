Hey!X-Files Phans
  This 2 disk set is a re-release of 8 major X-Files TV shows including the feature ''Pilot'' from 1993. "Bad Blood'' is as Gillian Anderson says  "My favorite X-File Episode'' Is also included in this new package.
  Peter Boyle !(Before his major TV Role in ''Everybody Loves Raymond'') guest stars in the *EP "Clyde Bruckman's final Repose". This is also a great stand alone *EP.
 One of the first ''Chris Owens'' *EP's includes Cher's old hit's that fit the subject well with a slight cameo of Cher' near the ending and it also makes reference to one of her movies. The rest are scary as well as funny.
  Remember that all these *Ep's we have seen before on TV and in the series packaged version it's just a re-packaged with new 2008 intro's.
  Enjoy yourself if your new to the X Files or as well as an older fan who saw them when you were much younger and who didn't buy all the '1 thru 9 season' packaged DVD sets.

Talking about their new upcoming Movie titled "I want to Believe". Playing in Theatre's July 25th'08. This movie is like  ''A long X Files TV Show'' Only it's really scary. More of an X-File that director/writer Chris Carter invisioned his creation to be.

 ''Happy 1013!'' For all you new X-Files Fans! (*EP=Epsiode)
