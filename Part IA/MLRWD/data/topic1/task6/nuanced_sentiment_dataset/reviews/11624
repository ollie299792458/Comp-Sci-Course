It's not that scary but exciting, a typical thriller. I don't know either why it's called Gothika, but the movie itself is far from as bad as some people said. I got it on DVD and did enjoy watching it, I have seen better but it's defenitely not bad and it makes you thinking while watching it how to put the peaces together. 3/5
