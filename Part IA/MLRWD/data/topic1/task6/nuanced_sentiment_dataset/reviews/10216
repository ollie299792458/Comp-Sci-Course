For those of you out there who have been seeking a film adaption of horror author H.P. Lovecraft's work that does not do a disservice to the inexplicably effective power of the original story, then this might satisfy  you. An amalgamtion of "The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"'s plot  with visual references from "The Shadow over Innsmouth", Roger  Corman manages to weave it all into a symphony of mood and building fear.  Its not "bethoven's fifth" mind you, but its well sustained and  acted by its key players: Vincent Price (as the villainous sorcere Joseph  Curwen) and Debrah Page (as his confused and stricken wife). Sadly, the  supporting players (including the antiquated Lon Chaney Jr. - looking quite  dessicated in his old age), are not nearly so effective. The make-up and  effects are never quite convincing, but having sad as much they are used  rarely, and always to maximum effect considering. All in all, a happy  surprise for those Lovecraft admires amongst us who have suffered through  the likes of "The Lurking Fear", and "The Unnameable."  Ugh.  A few other films I'd recommend for the Lovecraft enthusiasts:  "The Resurrected", another adaption of "The Case..."  with Chris Sarandon putting in a terrific performance as Curwen; "Cast  a Deadly Spell"; an amusing romp through an alternate 40s-universe  full of murder, mystery, magic, demons and a detective named Harry  Lovecraft (just don't take it too seriously-its also quite hard to find);  and finally, "From Beyond", a thoroughly ridiculous yet enjoyable  tale of inter-dimensional mayhem. Other films, such as "John  Carpenter's 'The Thing'", "The Last Wave", and "The  Haunting" possess a distinctly Lovecraft feel without being adapted  from one of the writer's stories.
