Ghostbusters has always been one of my favorite movies.  As a kid, I watched it for the ghosts (especially Slimer, but then, he's every kid's favorite).  I didn't get the sexual references back then of course, but I still knew a funny movie when I saw one.  I wouldn't recommend this movie for every kid -- know your child.  If they're afraid of, say, the wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz, the ghost in the library scene will probably scare them, as well as some of the other scenes.  This is a funny, funny movie, but if you don't think your children can handle some of the scary scenes, wait until they're older.
The DVD edition is much better than the old VHS I had, which was actually taped off of cable and not the highest quality.  The sound and picture has been cleaned up and is now of high quality (although alot of the special effects are still incredibly cheesy) and the director commentary and deleted scenes are great.  I always love hearing the memories of the directors and writers when DVDs are released with this -- it makes things much more personal, and some of the stories make you laugh almost as much as the movie itself.
In summary, this is probably one of the best, if not the best, movie to come out of the 80's.  A classic, which everyone should watch at some point.  I'd rate this 10 stars if I could.  "Let's run some red lights!"
