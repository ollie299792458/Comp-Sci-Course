I loved this film. Jamie Foxx is outstanding in his performance as a homeless mentally ill talented violinist/cellist who battles internal demons on a daily basis. His portrayal of Nathaniel Ayers, Jr. brings his character to life. You feel Ayers' pain and his joy. Foxx is able to embody both the mind of a genius and the mind of a greatly mentally disturbed man.

Robert Downey, Jr. is equally outstanding as the Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez who wants to save Ayers from his demons. His friendship with Ayers is totally believable. Lopez is proud when Ayers makes a small step for change in his life.

And there are a number of great scenes in the film. The one that stands out of the most is the the scene in which Lopez convinces Ayers to go to a rehearsal for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. At the last minute, Ayers refuses to go because he can't take his shopping cart, which contains all of his worldly possessions. Lopez later is forced to compromise with Ayers. He and Ayers race down the streets of LA with Ayers' prized shopping cart so that Ayers can attend the rehearsal. This scene was so sweet and touching.

You also feel Lopez's frustrations when he realizes that he must accept Ayers for who he is-- a mentally ill genius. I loved the settings of the film--skid row and the LA Times newsroom. Their sharp contrast showed the differences between Ayers and Lopez. However, despite these differences, they were able to bond as two men.

This is a film that you should add to your "must see" list.
