I found the movie predictable and dry and felt that it was entirely misrepresented (Fiennes on the DVD pointing a gun). Mild mannered is an understatement for Fiennes, whom as an experienced diplomat appears quite naive to everything around him and only finds out the story from "friends" self motivated confessions. The only thing Fiennes does is run aroud and slightly raise his voice. It was also by far one of the weakest love stories I have ever seen. Tessa Quayle (Rachel Weisz), Fiennes wife is so engrossed in her "cause" that she has to go out of her way throughout the movie to remind the audience that she actually has a relationship. Her character fails to convince me that she even cares about her husband or their expected child; more likely that she used him to get a foot into Africa so that she could join some generic cause that makes her feel important; she is like one of those idiots from college who just wants to hug African children and mouth off to corporate figures without any training or experience with the "really real world". Every scene between Fiennes and Weisz is excruciating to watch; like a loveless marriage that neither wants to make an effort to end. The whole plot can be pieced together after 20 min into the movie. I like Fiennes as an actor and I can only look to Meirelles for making an unconvincing love story that lasts about 45 minutes too long. The end of the movie brought relief that it was over and I felt as if I've wasted 129 minutes. The movie was anticlimactic and the characters seemed to risk their lives for no reason as evident in the last scene. You are left at the end of the movie with a feeling that if these to characters never existed it would make no difference. If you are looking for action or a moving love story look elsewhere, Fiennes and Weisz had no chemistry. I had all I could do not to turn the movie off.
