I will start by saying that one of my guilty pleasure is a good Giallo, and "The House with Laughing Windows" is a good example of a well made giallo.

It is not your everyday giallo, that stick exactly to the genere rules, but it got some very good mood and it is very frightning experience.

It is not a gory giallo, but more psychological and athmospheric movie. The music score is fantastic and go along with the movie wounderfully.

I like the first scene when the partagonist is arriving to the shore with a boat and a car is waiting on the shore. This scene is so captivating going along with hunting music.

During watching it It reminds me Dario Argento "Deep Red". I must say that both movies gave me the shivers.

After watching "The House with Laughing Windows" you will surly going to have a very disturbing and frighting experience, and the movie theme will stay in your mind for long time.

If a good giallo is your cup of tea, then you cannot miss this one, it is a must!!
