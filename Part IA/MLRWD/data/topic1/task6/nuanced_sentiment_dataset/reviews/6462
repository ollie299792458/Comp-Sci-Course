I thought this film might be worth watching if only for the special effects. Wrong. It was truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Totally illogical, gory enough to be nauseating, with characters so poorly drawn, you don't even flinch when they die. Brrrrrr... 
Sebastian (played by Bacon) is the principal scientist (and lunatic-at-large) in a vital, underground, top-secret government project to render living beings invisible.  
Sebastian is arrogant & immature, with a serious God-complex. He's also a playboy, a foolish risk-taker and an animal abuser. This guy just seems to get off on pain, even his own. 
Linda (Elisabeth Shue) is supposedly a gifted scientist as well. But her role is more that of a flirty, contemptuous teenager juggling boyfriends (Bacon-Ex & Brolin-current) & tossing verbal barbs with Bacon. 
You'll see a lot of blood & guts and a lot of death - via slaughter by the genius-gone-madman (invisibility produces insanity, don't ya know.) Also, graphic anatomy shots as Bacon's organs, muscles, & flesh disintegrate, then attempt to regrow. 
Don't waste your time or money. The effects just couldn't save this one.
