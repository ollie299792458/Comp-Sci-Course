I'd seen this film before, in a lesser unrestored edition, and wasn't that impressed. Sure there's some over-the-top moments worth a chuckle or two, but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull. Hardly the unintentional laugh riot it's reputed to be.

Thanks to Mike Nelson's biting commentary, however, now the film really is funny. Damn funny. Which is why I demand we pass legislation, the sooner the better, requiring Mike Nelson commentaries on every major DVD release from here on out. He may be Hollywood's last best hope, the only man who can save excrement like Mission Impossible 3 and Lady in the Water from heading straight to the bargain racks.

(Okay, maybe I'm overrating Mike's abilities just a bit - nothing short of an Old Testament-style miracle could scrape the stink off of Lady in the Water - but if Lucas gave him a crack at Episodes 1-3, I think we'd be looking at pure marketing gold. C'mon Lucas, you know you can't resist any excuse to re-release yet another DVD version of your little sci-fi sextology. Give the man a call.)
