The original double LP of "Tommy" by The Who blew me away! It was the first real rock album I'd ever listened to and it changed my life! When the film came out, I was one of the first in line to see it - boy, what a disappointment!! I agree, a film version of a rock and roll opera needs to be outrageous - but at what price? The music was absolutely butchered for this movie! Oliver Reed and Jack Nicholson singing? Please - pass me the earplugs! Tina Turner and Elton John stand out as the two saving graces of this movie - their performances and singing electrify! And I must credit Ann Margret for her nerve in rolling around in baked beans and chocolate (that scene is endlessly watchable). But director Ken Russell really should have preserved the integrity of the story by putting the music first - get some actors who can sing! There are a handful of scenes that work ("Cousin Kevin", "Acid Queen", "Sally Simpson", "Pinball Wizard"), but the rest should be dumped in the garbage! Anyone who has only seen this film version of 'Tommy' should buy the original rock opera to find out what an 'amazing journey' it was meant to be!
