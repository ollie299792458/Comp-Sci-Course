When I first opened the package I popped the DVDs into my computer I was pretty taken aback by the overly compressed video and treble heavy, scratchy audio. I went through all fours discs and was prepared to open up amazon and give it a one star scathing review. I had bought the package for The 39 Steps and wanted to watch that first though. I had seen a restored version on TCM years ago and expected to get something similar to that. I thought maybe I could make a bit of an improvement with some modifications, so I opened the DVD in a program called VLC. I used a deinterlacing mode called Yadif(2x) and the result was amazing. Well maybe amazing is too strong of a word, but it seemed to stop all the digital block artifacts during motion and without any discern-able loss is detail. It seems like a contradiction but it made everything both smoother and crisper. As for the sound I used the VLC equalizer to cut off some of the treble response but I couldn't do anything about all the scratchy noises. The next day I watched The Man Who New Too Much on the SDTV in the basement and as expected the visual quality was okay. So to conclude, watch it on an old SDTV or with filters on a computer. Totally unwatchable on a large screen HDTV with surround sound.
