I always had a soft side for wandering swordsmen in anime. Probably because I'm privileged to learn the very same martial art that has entertained all of us Ninja Scrollers. The artwork might seem to be in a dated style and quite simple compared to the CG infused eye candy found in Ghost In the Shell, etc. But that doesn't take anything away from the detail and the originality Yoshiaki Kawajiri has shown us in Ninja Scroll. What's timeless is the way he combined over the top action with surprising moments of earthiness recognizable to a trained martial artist who views this film. This is exemplified in the duel against Utsutsu Mujuro, where every masterful stroke was in accordance to the real art of ancient Japanese swordsmanship while at the same time manage to keep you on your seat with it's furious presentation.
However there is a minor detail I just have to mention. Seeing how the title of the film is Ninja Scroll, there's very little evidence that suggests that Jubei himself is a Ninja. I guess it would be fair to say he's a wave man, Ronin, seeing how he fights with the Katana and has an impeccable sense of honor as opposed to the Ninja who fights with the Ninja-To and has little honor. Just thought I mention that because I wouldn't want people to have a confused idea about the Japanese culture.
