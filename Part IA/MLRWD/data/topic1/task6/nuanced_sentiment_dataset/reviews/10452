Hey~

I watch a lot of films, especially Kung Fu Chinese Jet Li types. I love these types of movies. But this film was not that great. THere should be no five stars here... why? Not very cohesive, in the middle of the movie on, it gets lost for like a half an hour..you literally don't know what going on, and where the Army is at. The whole movie they talk about taking Nanking, and then "presto" it's taken over, and the only way you knew Nanking was won and was taken over, is because there is some random conversation about it after the fact...though near the end, there seems to have a coming together, but it was profound or anything. It seems like the theme of the movie was its okay to kill as long as it is for the betterment of mankind. And keep your promises..but all throughout, Too much blood, super violent- almost strangely out of context....kind of like, "hey, war is bloody." and I, the viewer is like, yep, I get that. I didnt watch this movie to see a thousand guys get their necks slashed... Jet li kind of sold out here...no serious action scenes up close, or great acting. The war actions were not that great...It was just mediocre, to below mediocre. The costumes were nice.

I cannot say how much I do like "these sort of films", but the quality was loose, vague, and didn't ever draw me in. The brotherhood concept lacked much. It never felt authentic, and the concept of the film was based on this to the very bloody end. Watch Hero again, even if you've seen it a thousand times...it'll still be better the 1001st time than this film. I wouldn't waste your money, but don't take my word for it. Spend the money for yourself to see what I mean...or save two hours of your life, and go for a walk outside. See the birds chirp and flowers. Its spring.
