This is a well done animated movie with two of my favorite actors, Christopher Judge and Peter Woodward.

While I enjoyed the quality of the animation, the writing and story line were a bit weak and most likely created for kids. Not quite in the same league as Ghost in the Shell or Vexille, but close. Lots of action and gore, which will please some.

My experience with it started out badly, as the disc cover was stuck to the paper outer cover, which I had to rip open to get the case free. From then on, it was the usual battle with plastic wrap and security sticker, but that is the case with all DVDs.

There were some sections in which the characters were drawn differently, and that was in some of the flashbacks, which may have been from the previous movie (this is a sequel). It was a little odd, but did not detract too much, although I wonder if it was worth the cost saving of re-animating those  scenes.

Nothing new, inspirational, or particularly noteworthy, but an okay diversion. Not something I would watch over again, but I don't feel like I wasted my time with it.
