I got the blu-ray version in the mail a few days ago. Played part of it last night. Verdict is in. This transfer is awful, should get the death penalty. Grainy picture. awful transfer. I say there are video artifacts in this picture. I am surprised George Lucas would have anything to do with this miserable transfer. There are blue halos around the lightposts, can you believe it. Amazon should not allow this transfer to sold. That is how awful this transfer is. Please do not waste your money on this. You will regret it. I promise.  Now there are folks who are not too bright. I am only writing about the TRANSFER of film to blu-ray. NOT THE MOVIE. OKAY. I LOVED THE MOVIE. When it came out in theatre I think I saw it about 7 times, loved the movie and soundtrack. So please do not confuse rating of transfer to blu-rau to my 5 star rating of movie. Having said this I know some of you out there will say how come I gave the movie 1 star. I did not give the movie 1 star. I GAVE THE TRANSFER 1 STAR. GET IT. I HOPE SO. BUT, too many of you have had your brains turn to mush by watching too much Jerry Springer and will not be able to make sense of what I just wrote.
