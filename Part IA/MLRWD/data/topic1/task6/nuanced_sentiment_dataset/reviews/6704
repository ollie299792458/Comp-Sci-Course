Perhaps I simply don't appreciate Thomas Hardy's plotlines, but as a fan of 19th century classic British literature productions I find Hardy's "Mayor of Casterbridge" bleak without break and lacking sophistication in character that so defines Austen, Gaskell, Dickens and Carroll.

It could be that the A&E production and screenplay written by Ted Whitehead failed to capture the essence of Hardy's words. However, the bottom line is that this adaptation is oddly paced, and largely overacted. Jodhi May, who was outstanding in Daniel Deronda just previous to this production, was miss cast as Elizabeth-Jane. Her heaving breath, hunched shoulders, and facial expressions are overly dramatic and irritate throughout. One scene that did show how good it might have been, takes place in Part I between Henchard and Donald Farfrae when Henchard confides the haunting truth of his sin against his wife and child. Unfortunately in the end, there just isn't enough good to make this production compelling enough beyond filler until something better arrives.
