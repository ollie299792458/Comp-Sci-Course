Bad, big bad...bad beyond all words.
But a total kick in the unintentional ... when it comes to seeing a movie self distruct before your eyes. The movie Cecil B. De Mille probably watched just before filming the 10 Commandments....(Oh Moses, Moses, Moses!)
Lionel Barrymore's cantakerous attitude....
Gregory Peck chuffing up his crop to be as freakin nasty as he can be....NOT!
Jennifer Jones......how many words can summon the idea of MISCAST! Actually its not her fault. A benzedrine addled Selznick was convinced he could carry her as a Mexican Scarlet O'Hara. Can you see the puppet strings? Hello....Eliza Dolittle!
Lillian Gish who is the ONLY remotely sympathetic character. Her death scene will ellicit chuckles if not guffaws! HELLO....MR VIDOR what where you thinking???!!!!
Like I said...bad, bad, bad, but a guilty pleasure none the less.
Watch it with a good eye for Selznick's ironfisted promotion of JJ....also remembering that this production team brought you Gone With The Wind. One of my all time favorite movies.
Can you say MAJOR STUMBLE!
