I usually don't like Luke Wilson's acting style.  He's usually one-note and that Texas drawl of his puts me to sleep.  That being said, I thought he was absolutely fantastic in this movie.  Here, he inhabits a character that embodies his strenghts as an actor.  Henry Poole is an angry and depressed individual who knows that his time on this earth is short and Wilson really shines in this role.  Being agnostic, I was wary that this film would try to push the agenda of religion upon me, yet I felt that this is the kind of movie that can appeal to believers and non-believers alike.  Instead, it's about what one believes.  The character of Esperanza believes that there is the face of Jesus on Henry's wall.  Henry sticks to his guns and thinks it's a bad stucco job.  Never does the movie try to sway you in either direction which was quite refreshing.  However, I wished this movie could have pulled back on the melodrama and the obvious pulling of the heartstrings.  These moments were the only times that I felt manipulated by the film.  Overall, good movie to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, after church for those who do believe of course.
