This is one of those shows that demonstrate what the serial can aspire to be and makes everything on network television look like a waste of your time and an insult to basic intelligence.

This crime drama is set in Baltimore and centers on a detail of cops who are trying to collect enough evidence against a drug ring that recently rose to power by tapping their phones (hence the name.) Even though there's a large cast of well-developed, returning characters, each season contains a story arc that stands on its own. While the overall tone is gritty and tragic, it has some laugh-out-loud moments and a lot of profanity (a LOT of profanity and crude humor, if you're concerned about that kind of thing.)

The packaging is nice and compact, so it'll fit in your DVD shelf without displacing a lot of other DVDs. The flip-out DVD folders containing each season are prone to tear at the corners and due to the dark color the tears are fairly noticeable. That's my only negative criticism of the packaging, I think the graphic art is top-notch.
