The third and final installment of the Matrix trilogy is here, and the series doesn't end with the bang that most fans had been hoping for.  Granted, the effects are impressive.  The fight scenes, though far fewer in this film, are well done and loaded with adrenaline.  Neo's and Smith's evolving powers are used to their fullest in the final battle.  And the battle in Zion is equally impressive, with thousands of Zionites in battle robots fending off an attack by a horde of Sentinel robots.  Unfortunately, as impressive as these things are, they have all been seen before.  And therein lies the glaring fault with Revolutions - it's all been done before.  In the previous films, the storyline was as engrossing as the effects, and the result was a series that continually fresh and groundbreaking.  Revolutions serves up great effects, but lacks the storyline needed to make it a complete movie.  The few twists that do show up in the movie are mostly predictable, especially if you have been paying attention to the previews.
Despite the storyline problems, Revolutions is entertaining enough for a matinee ticket or a video rental.
