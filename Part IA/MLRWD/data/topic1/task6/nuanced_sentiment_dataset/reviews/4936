I found the extras on this disc to be really well organized and super interesting.  Granted, I was a bit disappointed that Besson is nowhere to be seen - but it's pretty well known that he doesn't do DVD EVER.  He's one of those director's who prefers to let the work speak for itself.  (Although he does have some very cool books on his movies - hard to find though.)  But without him, I found the stuff here really great.  I really liked the Digital Element featurette with all the people from Digital Domain (they also did Titanic and Dante's Peak)which showed how most of the New York action was shot in London but then composited against a giant New York city model in California.  The Alien Element had so much material that it was divided into four separated featurettes - Mangalores, Mondoshawans, Picasso, Strikers -- and showed each of the creature being tested, built and so on.  It's really cool to see the Mondos actually getting in and out of those suits before shooting.  (The Strikers by the way were cut from the movie, but we get some rare footage of them on the set - the airport.)  I guess the featurette I loved the most was The Diva - starring the French actress Maiwenn - she is totally gorgeous and shares lots of very intimate stories about the making of the film.  The Fashion Element has a pretty fun interview with Jean Paul Gaultier about the costumes.  And if you're into production design, then The Visual Element goes to Paris to meet the two comic book artists Moebius and Mezieres who kind of got the whole stylistic thing rolling in Besson's head.  I really liked the way the features were divided up into categories and how there were additional menus of extra screen tests available behind each one.  This movie was produced well before the advent of DVD, so I know it's hard to dig some of this stuff up.  All in all, if you love this movie, you'll really like the docs about how it was made.
