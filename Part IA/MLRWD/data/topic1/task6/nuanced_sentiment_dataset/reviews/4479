This movie was decent overall. It was capably acted, especially by Spader, whose ability to really breathe life into his characters shines through as usual. I could not help but feel sympathy for the hopelessly depressed and drugged central character. Marissa Tomei is also featured, acting well and looking very lovely without being sickeningly pretty, and coming off as both intelligent and caring in her part as psychologist to the battered protagonist. Three cheers for casting a competent and compelling actress in the lead female role. Keanu Reeves is satisfactorily creepy in his role as the killer (no spoilers, I promise, the viewer knows who the killer is from the beginning). The plot was a bit typical to the serial killer suspense genre, but nonetheless entertaining, and I did not lose interest at any point during the movie. Suspense was built up nicely and there was a pleasant element of continuity to the plot which made it quite easy to follow. There are a lot of flashbacks, which are a bit more drawn out than they need to be, but three more cheers for building up a background to this story. Technical aspects of the DVD were all satisfactory to me. In conclusion, this film was basically average but I give it four stars because when I ask myself, "Did I have a good time watching this movie?" my answer is, "Yes."
