I still recall my first couple viewings of La Dolce Vita. I was always unsure exactly what I thought of this peek into the lives of the rich and beautiful... and why anyone would want to make a movie about it (at the time this film was produced). But Fellini was all about examining life, and he didn't consider class in the process.

When I finally bought "Vita", in an effort to put together a decent collection of Italian films, I watched it as an examination of life... nothing more or less. Watching in the manner in which Fellini went on record to explain what motivated him to produce films helped. I actually laugh at scenes I had little reaction to before, and I find myself nodding or shaking my head --knowingly-- at others.

More than a film about the rich and beautiful, this is a film about the things with which we want to and/or fill our lives. Because the film has no clear narrative (and life doesn't pass with carefully planned narrative), the audience is bombarded with the unquenchable "want/desire" of the protagonist and his crowd. Every once in while we're reminded of the way the other half lives, and what they deem important. With each "reminder", I find "The Sweet/Good Life" makes my skin crawl just a little more. And I consider how so much of modern society is more like the haves than the have nots.

If you aren't familiar with this cinematic gem, there has been a lot of debate regarding religious under/overtones and numerology in the film. Those debates don't interest me much.

Finally, the digital transfer of "Dolce" is gorgeous. I've read about the version with the subtitles on the actual picture. The version I have doesn't suffer from any of that. I'm looking forward to future viewings/examinations AND the revelations about my life I'll realize through them.
