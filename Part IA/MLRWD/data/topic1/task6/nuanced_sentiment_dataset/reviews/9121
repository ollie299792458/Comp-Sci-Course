The year was 1988. Reagan was still in office. Mass consumerism and greed were now the fashionable way of life for most Americans.  Was there a reason behind this?  What was making our country become a cesspool of apathetic, materialistic slobs?  If you have seen the sci-fi cult-classic They Live you may already have a theory.

John Carpenter, the writer/director of cult hits such as Halloween and Escape from New York decided to give us a possible answer with his visionary tale about a nameless nomadic construction worker, played by former wrestling star Roddy Piper, who stumbles upon a special pair of sunglasses which reveal high-society and dirty politicians as aliens who are controlling the human population through subliminal messages written on nearly every form of media.  For example, the sunglasses reveal money to actually say "This is your god", and a billboard advertisement telling people to "get married and procreate".

Now the film itself is quite hokey in a campy sort of way in terms.  The fight scenes are cheesy and drawn out far too long.  The script has some great one liners, for example the often imitated classic line "I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubble gum."  And the acting from Piper is downright laughable at times.  But these things don't take away from the satirical, yet eerie, conspiracy theory that Carpenter is nearly force-feeding down the viewers throat.

Thus, They Live has a great balance of social satire, chills, and comic relief to keep an audience tuned-in for it's brief 95 minute run.

There have also been rumors flying around about the possibility of a remake in the works under the umbrella of producers Marc Abraham and Eric Newman(2004's Dawn of the Dead, Slither)
