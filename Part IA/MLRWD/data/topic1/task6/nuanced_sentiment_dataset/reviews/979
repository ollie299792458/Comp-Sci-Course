Saw this movie originaly in theaters and I remember leaving not knowing if I had liked it or not.  The `real life yet cartoony' feel to the character's animation threw me off after being use to Disney's many reformed animals but it grew on me.

The story line was rather lacking.  I find myself wanting to watch the movie more for the music and dance than for the story itself.  I like to listen to music or have a movie playing in the background while I'm playing video games and this quickly became a `background movie' that I'd listen to or turn and watch for my few favorite dances while I'm playing or cleaning.

The music was well done.  They seamlessly meshed many different songs that still sounded great.  The singers' voices (except Mumble's) are amazing.  I often find myself singing along during the movie or carrying the songs around in my head during the work day.

The characters are believable.  Mumble is not `strong' in character as many protagonists are however I wouldn't be surprised to meet him down the street (provided he was human).  I love the interaction of Ramon and his crew.

The animation is amazing.  Characters and items have a `weight' (they do not float) they are detailed down to the feathers.  Everything moves.  The `background' penguins all have a personality of their own, singing moving or dancing.  The "real" film of people is seamless with the animation.  Overall the animation is very believable, I was impressed with the amount of detail they put into it.

For kids this is a great movie.  Singing and dancing penguins what more do you want!  I would suggest this to anyone who has kids under High School.

For adults it's a bit of a drag.  the only real drive to watch this is the music and the dance.
