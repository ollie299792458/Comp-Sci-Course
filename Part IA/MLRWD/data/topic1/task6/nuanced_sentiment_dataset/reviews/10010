Well, what can I say?  If you have been reading the other reviews, you know of the films major problem: the nudity.  Normally, I would not complain, but this is MALE nudity.  And as a male, it scared me.  Ok, now lets start the review.
The movie spoofs Scream, I Know, and the Matrix, and a couple more.  This is where the meat of the comedy is derived from.  Sure, there are a few "non-spoof " jokes, but they are not that funny.  Except for the Ms. Mann scene, which was creepy, in a creepy sense.  There are plenty of laugh-out-loud jokes, with a few snicker ones.  So, if it is so funny, why am I giving it 3 stars?
First off, you can only watch a few times a year, as the gags quickly become old.  Second, the DVD.  While the picture and sound are very good, where are the extras?  The DVD extras are 6 deleted scenes, a 7 minute "documentary", and a trailor.  While this is a lot for some people, I was expecting at least a commentrary track.  Oh well.  This is stil a very funny movie, even if you can only watch it a few times a year.
Also, for those of you out there who think I am low-brow, let me say I enjoy a wide amount of movies, from this, to The Insider.
