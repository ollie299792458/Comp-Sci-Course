I love the rotoscoping.  That aside, this movie could have been so much more.  Having not read PKD's book, I don't know whether the author or the director is to blame for the plot, or lack thereof.  Before viewing, I had two impressions of the movie.  One was a main character with a dual personality (a'la Fight Club), thus creating dramatic tension as the protaganist battles with himself.  Secondly, I was expecting intelligent, perhaps philosophical exchange between the Substance D users.  Neither happened.  Keanu's character, Fred, loafs around with stoners who act like idiots, then reports back to base and watches surveillance tapes of himself and the stoners acting like idiots.  I never once got a true sense of his supposed 'dual personality' except that he does poorly on some psychological exams and he acts confused sometimes.  Secondly, what I meant about the dialogue is the SD users talk like hippies on a bad acid trip; they use big words but say nothing interesting.  The SD users come across as unconvincing caricatures of addicts.  Without the visuals, this would have been a two star film.
