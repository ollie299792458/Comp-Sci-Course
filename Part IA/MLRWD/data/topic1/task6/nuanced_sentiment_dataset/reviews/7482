All of the title cards issued on the following DVD are recreated and

are NOT ORIGINAL (except for one exception):

Walt Disney Treasures - Mickey Mouse in Black and White

The titles for the 1928-1929 cartoons should read:

Celebrity Productions, Inc.

Present A

Mickey Mouse

Sound Cartoon

Celebrity Productions, Inc. has been changed to "Disney Cartoons"

On the Columbia Shorts:

The original Columbia logo has been removed from all

these cartoons as well as the music that went with it.

If you have the old laser disk set you will notice that

the music is intact on those but the Columbia logo is also

missing.

On the title card itself: Columbia Pictures has been added

but you can tell the cards are redrawn because of the words

on the bottom of the title card ...which are not the words that were

originally on the title card.

The only original title card  is that at the end of the Columbia

Mickey Mouse cartoons - which for some reason whoever

was responsible for this DVD did not have drawned.

The United Artists cartoons are all missing:

Joseph M. Schenck

Presents A

from the title card and have therefore been

redrawn or modified..
