Although CGI effects have done wonders for the film industry and have expanded the filmaker's ability to tell vast stories (Titanic is a good example), they have virtually ruined the horror movie business. Case in point is House on Haunted Hill: what begins as a genuinely scary film (the camcorder sequence, roaming the lower depths of the burned-out asylum) degrades into a typical "Hollywood" ending, complete with utterly ridiculous CG monster. All one has to do is watch either of the modern Mummy films to learn the shortcomings of CGI - overly lit, comic-looking monsters that aren't really "there."
What ever happened to presence? Give me a hokey-looking rubber-suited ghoul over an overly-lit CG Pokeman any day. Blair Witch worked so well because of what we couldn't see. CG monsters such as the "evil" at the end of HoHH seem created to appease the masses of moviegoers that demand finality in the form of big explosions and the hero's witticism ("time to chill out, baby"). Even Harryhausen's stop-motion creatures seemed more real.
And why, for God's sake, does the film turn into a music video about halfway through, with the (what was it.. Rob Zombie?) heavy metal track. 
All in all, this seems like a film that at one point had a vision (perhaps that of the director or screenwriter), but succumbed to the pressures of the studio executives. It's a shame, because HoHH has some of the best imagery I've seen in a horror film, but shifts gears into a different type of movie halfway through. What a pity that the art of film has generally become one of lowest-common denominator.
