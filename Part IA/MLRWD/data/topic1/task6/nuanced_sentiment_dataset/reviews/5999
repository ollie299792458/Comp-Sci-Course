...Is the utter state of mental arrest the viewing public is experiencing. I have to assume that all those who gave this movie more than 1 star are either being facetious or are simply morally/intellectually dead. I was paid to see this film (local newspaper), so unfortunately I couldn't walk out. Let me explain something about film. Simply becuase the film accomplishes it's goal, that does not mean it's a good film. If a movie is nothing more than watching grass grow for three hours, it is not a success because it set out to bore us and it did. If a film is nothing but a dark screen and the sound of an ambulance siren, the filmmaker who set out to annoy us does not have a success on his hands. You get the point.
Tom Green set out to offend and disgust us. I have to assume this because nobody with a cerebral cortex or ... to see this movie should find any of this funny, and Tom Green (and the now fired studio exec who okayed this project) must have known that. Yes, Mr. Green, we are offended (those of us with the aforementioned brain functions). Congrats. Although you are clearly a sociopath and your capacity for humor is on par with Dr. Mengalie, you have a devoted group of morons behind you who think being offended is funny.
Also, thank you to the reviewer from the New York Times who applauded Green's use of his first amendment rights. Perhaps, thanks to Tom Green, art will be reinterpreted and garbage like this will put inbred troglodytes like Tom Green on the rack.
