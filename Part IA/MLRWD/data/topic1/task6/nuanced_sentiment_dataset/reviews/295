I distinctly remember watching the first episode of Witch Hunter Robin online, and being quite intrigued by the basic story and the show's industrial neo-gothic aesthetics. Having finally watched the whole series, however, I have to say that I'm sorely disappointed. There's so much potential here, but I can't help feeling that the show makes at best a half-hearted attempt to develop it.

Characters? Robin herself is great. She's endearingly shy and sweet, quietly funny, and frequently badass, and is the only reason I gave this series three stars instead of two. Unfortunately, all of the good characterization seems to have been spent on Robin, because pretty much everyone else gets boring fast, particularly Mr. Grimly Brooding Amon. (To paraphrase a KotOR2 line, the whole sardonically cryptic routine isn't impressive; it's just melodramatic and annoying.) There's just not a lot of development here. Everyone but Robin is to a greater or lesser extent forgettable.

Plot? Meh. Again, lots of potential, but sadly little development. I just finished watching the show, and I really don't know much more about Robin, the witches, the STN-J, the Factory, or Solomon than I did in episode one. I can't stand it when a series that raises so many interesting questions plays coy like this and leaves them largely unanswered. Very disappointing.
