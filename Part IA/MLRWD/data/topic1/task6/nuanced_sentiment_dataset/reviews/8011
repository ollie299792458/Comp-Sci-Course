This movie is a bit of a mixed bag, especially the first half. While I respect the film for using history and giving background into a lot of different people, the narrator could get tedious. Especially the translation of the Japanese sailors/leaders. Just subtitle the dialogue and tell us about the people! The film chose to translate and talk about the individuals which was more annoying than informative. The music score is a bit much to take as well. When the choir is well placed, the music is effective but often it just interrupts the acting. This is a film that doesn't let the actors act until the second half of the movie. All of sudden, all the main players are introduced, the narrator shuts up and Cagney is allowed to give a subtle, nuanced performance. Perhaps a little too subtle. My reading indicates that Halsey was a fighter, sort of the Patton of the Pacific. He didn't want to fall back, always on the attack and quite fierce. As we all know, that character is fully in Cagney's wheelhouse and I think he is a little TOO restrained. Criticism aside, the film is well researched and when Cagney is permitted to perform, he's wonderful.
