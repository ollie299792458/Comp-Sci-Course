I'm not usually that critical of Adam Sandler movies.  You know what you're getting, and what you usually get is reasonably amusing, somewhat crude, and oddly sweet.  Just Go With It made me almost laugh once, cringe repeatedly, and wonder what is wrong with the people who put this movie together.

Sandler plays a plastic surgeon who pretends to be married to get laid.  He meets Palmer, who is attractive but not as hot as the movie makes her out to be, not very smart, and for some reason attracted to Adam Sandler.  Aniston plays Sandler's assistant, a single mother with two children, who gets roped into pretending to be Sandler's soon to be ex-wife.

The biggest problem with this movie is that Sandler's character was completely unlikeable.  The guy was a huge scumbag, actually.  The way he treated women was horrible, but the way he treated the kids was often worse.  He was supposed to have an underlying heart of gold, but it didn't really come through.  The scene in which he taught the boy to swim was nice, but it came shortly after a scene in which he shoved the girl down into mud.  It was hard to see what any woman saw in him, aside from his ability to pay for things.  Aniston was fine, though at times her attempts at comedy seemed to involve her channeling the ghost of Walter Matthau in terms of phrasing and timing.  The movie had a great many scenes where it seemed like the cast was making it up as they went along, and it was more awkward than funny.  Add to that repeated gratuitous shots of Brooklyn Decker's body, which just made me feel embarrassed for her, because seemed so much like she was just in the movie to provide a pretty backdrop.  The plot holes aren't even worth mentioning, though this was another movie where you were amazed and frustrated by the characters' inability to lie with a modicum of intelligence. I saw this movie for free, and I still feel like I should be somehow reimbursed for the way it wasted my time.
