So bad it goes beyond bad to that special hell of movies where the director finds a way to inflict crap at a whole new level.  
This is ubercrap taken above the level that most stupid directors can only dream about.
The possibility of a normal human watching the entire movie without some sort of massive hemorrhage is very slim since the brain would be acting in the best interest of the human.
If you inflicted this movie on someone who had just regained their sight, they would be praying for a quick and merciful return to the former state of blindness.
The music in the movie is so bad that many people, who were though deaf, cried out in pain.  Not hearing, but feeling the sonic defecation as it de fouled the very molecules air around them.
If you have a enemy in your life, send them this movie.  After they see this your enemy will know you are without mercy.  They will fear you.
A bag of wet rocks shows more range and depth of acting skill that Seann William Scott.  His acting is so bad it makes you question not only the existence of a god, but any reason for anything in life at all.
I truly belive that when CUT was called, he would stand stone still and drool, waiting for commands from the director. Amused by things with lots of bright colors and balls of tinfoil.
The screenwriter has all the skill that only some grade 3 children have. Only those children in a very short bus.
I notice the DVD comes with a directors commentary.  I can only assume that it contains the unintelligent yelps and screams of the director as hurls his tattered notes at the microphone and removes his eyes after seeing what he has done.  
Chow Yun-Fat looks as if doing this movie was as much fun as a man who is striped naked in public and has his manhood laughed at by passing crowds.
The story you ask?  It has Nazis stealing the youthful power of monks to become all powerful! 
Even retarded people would think this movie was stupid.
