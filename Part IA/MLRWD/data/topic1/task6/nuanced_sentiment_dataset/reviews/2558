1.  Make the movie make SOME sort of sense!  As well make the ENDING make sense!  However, if you cannot do either, then make a sequel.
2.  Make sure the Antagonist ISN'T some cute, adorable forest creature... Ok, so it  worked for Strays...
3.  Please, MAKE SURE THE ACTORS CAN ACT!
4.  Please realise that not EVERY horror movie has to star dumb blondes.
5.  Don't defy logic.
6.  Do away with the skeptics who refuse to believe  what's happening despite the glaring proof.
Lets see how the Birds  stacked up... It doesn't follow rule one (Though I have heard there is a  sequel) because it never explains anything.
As for Rule two... I made an  exception for Strays, I can for this.
Does it follow rule three?  If you  think not having a clue what you're suposed to pretend you're doing  constitutes "Good acting"... Lets not forget how either they  overdo, or have a complete lack of any emotion...
As for #4, Hitchcock  apparently didn't realise since the main character just HAPPENS to be a  ditzy blond.
It definately breaks rule 5.  We have birds breaking through  wooden doors, coming down chimneys IN FLOCKS, nearly killing  people...
And it breaks rule six.  "Sure, These attacks are only  being reported constantly on the radio, but I still refuse to believe  them!"
See it once, you'll like it, though you'll find it laughable.
