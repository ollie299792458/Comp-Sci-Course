I watched Finger Of God with my weekly Bible Study.  I found it interesting, but the problem arises when you stop yourself and think what proof does he give.  You see, for a long time people have fallen to tricks and deception of false teachers.  One only has to do a little searching on google to find information of false faith healers and such.  What the person who made this video should have done was show some proof.  No, I'm not asking God to work in my box of understanding, but the video should have done more to show some form of proof.  People who accept outlandish events with not trying to understand if this is really from God or not, set themselves up to accept lies and deception.  Many known false teacher have done acts that look like a miracles only to deceive many who don't question.  This video in and of it's self doesn't project any one false teachers, but sets up the viewer to want to see miracles in their life and fellowship.  Though I do believe in miracles, the ones presented in the beginning of this video show no point for them.  Why give a person a gold tooth, or gold dust?  Nowhere in the the Bible is such an event, and there is no real reason for the event to happen.  What it does do is set the viewer up to want these event in their life with no proof that these events are actually from God.  As the video continues it does get better. As a chance to view other groups of Christians around the world who have nothing and rely on God for healing and to meet their needs.  I found this later part to be the best part of the video. Very touching to say the least.  Anyhow,  If you buy or watch this view, ask yourself through out the video, is this the type of events we see in the bible?  I have a hard time thinking the first part comes anywhere close to biblical, but the last part as almost coming right off the pages of the Bible.  People in need relying on God to heal and provide.
