Buying the Blues Brother Movie is the thing. It is a classic and was an immediate classic even when it first came out. How many other films capture this number of star entertainers (Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Jim Brown, Howlin' Wolf, etc...) and tie it all together into an amzing story with non stop action and deadpan humor - the elegant restaurant scene with Jake and Elwood making a spectacle of themselves, or the Blues Brothers playing the gig at a rural Country & Western Bar and playing "Rawhide" would be enough to want to see this film. And these are just a few classic moments.
truly, it was fortunate and perhaps brilliant that John Landis and the creators of this film gave the production the green light to film while all of these legendary were still alive and had plenty of kick left in them to show the audience what real rhythm & blues and soul music were like by the people who created it. And then there are Belushi and Akroyd at the top of their comical genius, before Belushi went over the deep end with drugs and Akroyd swallowed beluga whale.
And then there are the chase scenes. Just buy it and enjoy.
