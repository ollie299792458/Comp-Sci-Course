Hollywood seems to be churning out formulaic, star ridden, mega budget blockbusters that please the crowds, rake in the profits while getting taken to the cleaners by the critics. Disaster movies have seemed the be  the "craze" over recent years, the majority high in effects but lacking in  solid characters and storylines - the best example being "Armageddon" of  the "meteor hits earth/end of the world" genre...a typically average money  spinner which the public lapped up. Despite this, it is refreshing once and  a while to see an intelligent, emotional "disaster" vehicle come along in  the name of the cerebral Deep Impact.
Deep Impact, while a blockbuster in  it's own right, is deeper, thought provoking and in many ways more intense  than Armageddon ever will be. Director Mimi Leder doesn't brush the special  effects aside, but merely emphasises its effects on the diverse selection  of characters dealing with the potential end of the world. Much more of an  emotional roller coaster ride, rather than an explosive one - but effects  fans are definitely not left out...and neither are the stars - Robert Duvall,  Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood and Morgan Freeman lead the major roles, while an  impressive supporting cast keeps things interesting that includes  established actors Maximilian Schell, Vanessa Redgrave and the ing&eacute;nue  Leelee Sobieski.
Overall, Deep Impact offers something much more than  your average run-of-the-mill disaster epic, yet still keeps you on the edge  of your seat.
