The horror genre is the one unique area of filmmaking where filmmakers do not want or even need a good reason to crank out endless exploitative sequels to successful franchise originals. This prequel is no exception. If the intent was to give the viewer insight as to how Leatherface and the family became so stupendously sadistic, the film clearly has nothing new to say. Young photogenic lambs of slaughter are sent into harm's way with assembly line results. The death scenes are sufficiently grisly to please gorehounds and there is yet another twisted dinner scene for diehard fans of the series. Great screen villians should be perversely fascinating, richly complex, and deliciously maniacal. I simply found Leatherface's family, particularly the bad 'cop' Hoyt, to be grating and persistently annoying. 'The Beginning' isn't really frightening. All the jumps and jolts come just when they're expected. This latest installment is not any worse than previous attempts to cash in on the original's tremendous cult following, but there is nothing here that merits serious consideration by casual filmgoers. If you love this series, there is no reason to think you won't love this one too. I just wish Leatherface's chainsaw would FINALLY run out of gas. God knows this series did long ago.

Fans: Check it out! Non-fans: You better leave this one on the rental shelf!
