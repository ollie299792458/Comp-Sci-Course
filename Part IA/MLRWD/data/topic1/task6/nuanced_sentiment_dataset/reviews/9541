As a result of one of those compromises that make up just about every marriage, I was recently required to watch this romantic comedy. I usually avoid this type of movie like the plague, though I'll freely admit there are a few that I've actually enjoyed over the years. The Holiday, my friends, is not one of them.

This movie is bad even by "chick flick" standards. None of the characters are believable, the vast majority of their dialogue would never in a million years be uttered by sane human beings, and the whole storyline is both utterly unbelievable and utterly predictable. So many romantic comedy clich&eacute;s are trotted out that if you threw in some juvenile humor you'd have a parody to rival "Date Movie". The acting is as bad as the story. Cameron Diaz, in particular, takes bad acting to a whole new level, and don't even get me started on Jack Black. I went into this movie thinking "sure it's a chick flick, but at least Hugh Grant's not in it. Besides, it's got Jack Black. How bad can it be?" Black's character and performance are so lukewarm that God help me I might have preferred Hugh Grant.

I was going to write off my reaction to the Holiday as the typical male response to the genre, but my wife hated it too, and she loves romantic comedies. File this movie under "Avoid at all costs".

PS - My wife's side of the deal was to watch the latest Bond movie (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MNP2KI">Casino Royale (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>) with me, and we were unimpressed by that one as well. Sometimes you just can't win.
