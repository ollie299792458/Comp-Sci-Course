Batman and Robin was a bad film from start to finish. George Clooney as Batman was a big mistake. Whenever he talked in the film, he did his usual ''bouncy head'' style of acting. In the film while Clooney did this, it was a bit tiresome. Actually Keaton will be the one and only true Batman. Arnold was horrible as MR. FREEZE. His ''ice''jokes throughout the film were a bit annoying. Plus, Arnold was too buff to be Mr.Freeze. Chris O'donnell was okay as Robin, just a bit whiny. Batman and Robin bickered throughout the film as an ''old'' married couple.Uma Thurman and Alicia Silverstone offered nothing to the film, just playing the usual female roles. Joel Schumarcher made Bane a brainless nitwit as opposed to the comics. Michael Gough as Alfred was a blessing, he saved the film. I loved his ''emotional'' scenes with Bruce WAYNE in the film. The film had too many subplots and cheesy special effects. Maybe if Burton would've have stayed with the Batman franchise, the last 2 sequels would've been better.Everyone knows that after Batman Returns it was downhill from there.
