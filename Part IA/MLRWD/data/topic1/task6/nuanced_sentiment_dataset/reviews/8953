This is NOT a review or rating of the movie itself (there are plenty of other good reviews here) but rather a comment / complaint on an admittedly small but misleading detail in Amazon's description of this item.

If you look at this item's picture (at the top of this web page) you see a `bullet hole' at the end of the gun's barrel.  That hole is NOT part of the picture, it is an actual jagged hole in a clear plastic sleve that slides over the DVD case (the glass cracks are also printed on that sleve).

If you are a collecter of this (Dirty Harry) series and have other movies with that bullet hole sleeve you should be aware that this movie ordered from Amazon will NOT have that sleeve even though it is shown in Amazon's picture.  C'mon Amazon, pay attention to the details.  Either furnish the DVD case WITH the sleeve or correct the picture.

(Note: I already had this movie WITH the sleve from an earlier retail purchase and recently ordered 2 other Dirty Harry movies, Magnum Force & Sudden Impact, from Amazon which lacked the sleves.  I'm assuming that that Amazon's stock of ALL this series movies is also lacking.)
