This isn't so much a review because in order to place one, you should have seen it. Well, my girlfriend and I watched about an hour before calling it quits. The story had a working plot which remained predictable for the first 45 minutes. After that, it goes into dark and unnecessary morbid twists that no contorsionist should ever attempt. It is more than I can say for the savvy director and the crappy writers who decided that showing everything involved with rape can be a twist of strong directing. Verging on the unknown...Umm, mr. director, you may have forgotten one simple detail...there are women out there who don't want to pay the price of the ticket to watch a horrific re-enactment of a rapist doing what they have experienced. Way to bring in the audience and isolate those who have gone through that. Bravo I say. If you were planning to give some sort of message that Karma comes back to haunt you if you lie or cheat. Or that this is how it feels to go through such horror: you should have left that for the self help section at Borders, Barnes and Noble, etc. People came to spend (in this case a dire gamble) to watch a good movie, to be entertained. Not mortified with garbage.

I will never trust small ticket movies until I see the reviews myself.

Good day and don't watch this ever in your lifetime. Saw II is playing next door and the horror is at least fun.
