With the goatee and poofy hair, Pacino kept reminding me of Wolfman Jack in 88 Minutes. And you know what, I'd much rather have seen him in a biopic about the howling 70's deejay than in this stinker! The story of the college professor who moonlights as a forensics expert for the FBI is so stupid and every cliche-ridden twist so lame that it's impossible to muster any interest in the crime. I guess the whole thing is so preposterous it might be enjoyable on some so-bad-it's-good level like an Ed Wood film, but there are too many death threat cell phone calls that remind the viewer exactly how much more of this terrible movie is left to endure and they get in the way of any fun. I mean, it takes the wind out of your sails when the killer says there's still 75 more minutes or 55 more minutes left to go--it's like clockwatching at a job you don't like! It's terrible and one of the hands down WORST movies of 2008 and of Pacino's legendary career.This movie is really bad. I am a big fan of Al Pacino, what was he thinking when he took this part. Pacino has now been in two of the worst movies I have seen, the other being "GILI". This thriller just didn't pass the smell test, it stunk. I don't recommend it at all!!.I'd have given it zero stars if I could! D
