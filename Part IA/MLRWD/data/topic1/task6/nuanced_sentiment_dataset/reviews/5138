I didn't see this at the theater.  I waited for the DVD to come out because of the reviews it got.  I didn't want to carry any of that over to my viewing on DVD but couldn't help it.

This movie is way to long and boring to be much use to anyone.

Most annoying problems.

1. If you're going to have one set of people.. please have them all use the same sort of accent.  The many different accents was distracting and made the movie cartoonish.

2. If Alexander was bi-sexual, fine.  Let's not spend extra time on an already long and boring movie for loving gazes to his many love interests.  If you have to do it, at least make it interesting.

3. The battle scenes were horrible.  Blurry and muddled.  There was no battle plan for the filming and at no point during the movied did I actually care what was going on.  Just another battle.  blah blah.

4. The rousing (sarcastic) speech by the leader of whatever group it is, riding up and down the front battleline supposedly rousing the troops.. how many times is this going to be shown?  If you have to do it, it better be a good one.  This one roused me to go to the bathroom during it.

5. Long.  It's just too long and not interesting enough to keep you satisfied.  I actually came away from this movie not knowing that much about Alexander.  Anything I learned pretty much was what Anthony Hopkins told us.. and that was very boring as well.

It's just not interesting.  I had hoped for more from the telling of the story of one of the greatest conquerors of all time.
