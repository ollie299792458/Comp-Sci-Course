"Strangers On A Train" should be rated as Hitchcock's absolute best.
To begin with, it features a perfect performance by Robert Walker, an actor who would be dead within a year after making this great  movie.
Walker had previously played some wonderful roles, but he  astounded the world with his acting ability once "Strangers On A  Train" was released.
Aside from Walker's amazing performance,  "Strangers On A Train" is full of half-hidden meanings which  relate to the dual personality each of us possesses.
Hitchcock was a true  genius, who not only understood both the dark and the bright sides of the  human psyche, but who also knew how to depict that understanding by way of  film.
I have watched "Strangers On A Train" a dozen or more  times, and never tire of watching it yet again, each time finding something  new that I had not noticed the time I watched it before.
But, the main  reason I watch this film so often is to enjoy the exceptional , perfect  performance by Robert Walker.  Walker was only in his 30s when he died.  He was a tragic figure in real life.  He died much too soon, and we are  very fortunate to be able to observe his wonderful talent, preserved in  this movie, almost fifty years after his passing.
