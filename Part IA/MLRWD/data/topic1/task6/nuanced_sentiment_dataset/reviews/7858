Can you imagine a film getting any better whether it is the women,the villians,the locations or even the plot this one has got it all.One might think it is outdated now but then look again this film is the stepping stone to any action movie that is to be made in the coming years.
Sean Connery stamps his signature yet again as James Bond 007 in the fourth instalment of the Bond franchise.Director Terence Young makes it more tounge and cheek than any other Bond movie.There is no raw filth or even gore but the story is so perfect that it makes you forget about its tiny if at all faults.
There are some memorable moments in this film like the opening jet pack sequence,gunfight at Largo's house during a blackout and the final underwater battle.Simply breathtaking and proof of quality film making which today is seriously considered by Jerry Bruckhiemer/Joel Silver and Steven Speilberg.
Adding to the movie's good points is also John Barry's superb score which to this day haunts me as it is quite memorable.I also took a great liking to the leading ladies because they can not get any sexier to me.
The plot revolves around Blofeld's organisation hijacking nuclear warheads and demanding a ransom.The beautiful location of the Bahamas a used extensivley where Bond tries to unravel the doomsday plot.
