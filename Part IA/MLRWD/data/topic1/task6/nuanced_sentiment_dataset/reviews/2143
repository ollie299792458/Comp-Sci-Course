Let me begin by saying Jackass: The Movie was exactly what I'd expected it to be.  If you have ever seen the television program, then you probably expected the same thing I did: 3 unedited 'episodes' of Jackass pasted together, which is essentially what this film is, aside from far greater production values.
  Now let me say what most of America's youth does not want to hear: This movie is not for children.  In fact, to be quite honest, as I sat horrified, (but laughing) at sick, twisted stunt after sick, twisted stunt, all I could think about was that that this movie should have recieved an 'NC-17' rating instead of just an 'R.'  Not necessarily just because of the strong nudity, violence, and language, but because of the fact that there are too many children in America who will see this film unable to comprehend the border line between reality and entertainment.  I don't want to see a kid hurt himself or others, but I also don't want to see a teen walk into a hardware store and defecate into one of the display toilets.
  Still, as stupid, and as pointless as this movie is, it's entertaining, even more so than the television show.  So if you have a strong stomach, rent it.
  DVD extras include two music videos, a 'making of', promo spots, and about a half hours worth of deleted stunts.
