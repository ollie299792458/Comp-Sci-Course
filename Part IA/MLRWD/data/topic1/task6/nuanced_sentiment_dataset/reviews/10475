I guess it's a bad sign if while watching this film, all I could think about was what was wrong about it.  I'm not going to list all of them here, but a few really stick out: 1) the stupid accents for the dreadlocked Valley people, whatever their made-up names were, 2) the dreadlocks, 3) the obviously fake blue contact lenses that Camilla Belle had to wear - they couldn't find an actress with blue eyes if it's so central to the plot? 4) Duh'bleh's (lead) father leaves at the beginning of the film to "save his people," but everyone thinks he's abandoned his tribe.  It's never explained what exactly he was doing aside from leaving and why he left - HUGE plot hole.  Makes absolutely no sense other than it sets up a total BS reason for the main characters to have a way to communicate with everyone else. 5) the story in general is absurd, but everyone knows that.

What I did like was the special effects, especially the mammoths.  Mammoths are great.  I know these types of movies (on weird origins of civilization) are Emmerich's thing, but 10,000 BC is no Stargate.  It's no Day After Tomorrow either.  Worth a rent, but that's it.  Unless you really love mammoths.
