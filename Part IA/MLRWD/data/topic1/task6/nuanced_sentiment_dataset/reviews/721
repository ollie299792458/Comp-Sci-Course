First off I just want to say that Scary Movie 3 is not a horrible movie, I thought there were several great laughs in the movie, but there are lots of parts in the movie that could have been better.  There are a few things that might have contributed to the problems with the movie:1.  The Wayans Brothers didn't have anything to do with this sequel. 2.  The PG-13 rating versus the previous R ratings.  I dont think that a movie has to be R rated to be good but, this movie's problem was that they were trying to make the same kind of gross out jokes and sexual jokes, while trying to maintain a PG-13 rating to make the movie more accessible to teenagers.3.  They had good potential some funny movie references but they didn't seem to know what to do with it.  4.  It seems like the film makers decided to try and fit as many celebrities in the movie as possible, and then figure out how they would fit in the "story" later.  Leslie Nielson and Ja Rule were paired together and had absolutely nothing to contribute to this movie.5.  There is one scene that is probably the most unfunny scene in the movie for there reason that it is just creepy and gross.  In my opinion the joke is in bad taste and should have been left on the cutting room floor.  Im not going to pick on the plot of the movie, because there isn't one but thats not the point of this type of movie. We don't go to these movies for the plot.  Its just meant to be fun and silly.In conclusion, I just want to say that this movie is not as good as the first two but, there are many parts in the movie that will probably make you laugh but don't expect to keep laughing throughout the entire movie.  If you are usually a fan of these types of movies I say go see it, otherwise wait for video.
