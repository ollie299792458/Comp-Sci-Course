The last scene is great. Bogart gives one of his best bad guy performances, one of grim humor--his rat is haughty and actually sadistic, taking pleasure in being merciless. Cagney's character in this movie is really amazingly dumb, a bonehead, an unbelievable doofus who goes to prison for bootlegging and doesn't even know what he's doing. Cagney, who individualized each of his characters, plays this one as a humorless, noble, but not very bright guy. He's compelling when the character hits the skids and becomes a boozer. Cagney would have been great in "The Iceman Cometh." This has some of the urban shimmer of another, but much greater late 1930s Cagney gangster picture, "Angels with Dirty Faces"--and is one a relatively few Cagney movies where he plays a gangster. The tired air of this one might have made people think that every one of his flicks was a thug pix. It would be great to see other Cagney pictures of the era on DVD--"The Fighting 69th," and the under-rated comedies "The Bride Came C.O.D." and "The Strawberry Blonde." This one is worth seeing, but it's a triumph of good actors and direction over a bad script.
