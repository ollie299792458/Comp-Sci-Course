Gounod's Faust has always been a dilemma for me.  Some of the most sumptuous, melodious music ever written, saddled with a sappy Catholic morality play, so bizarre compared to Goethe's Faust or Boito's faithful Mefistofele.  And now, (or at least 2004 when this was broadcast,) an answer to the dilemma - Faust totally reimagined by the Royal Opera Covent Garden to be dark, brooding, blurring definitions of heaven, hell and reality on earth, giving the tale a grit that is like the 19th Century answer to Lez Miz, only with better music. I mean, the Skater's waltz to a Cabaret striptease?  Now we're talking.  There is one delightful and thoughtful surprise after another.
Then top that off with a supreme cast that seems to have been inspired to even greater heights by the production.  Terfel as the Devil - a focus for genuine evil here, no cartoon character, no urbane Devil out of Bernard Shaw.  Not that he doesn't have charm, but pure evil.  What happens to Valentin is particulary striking (no spoilers here,) but he can't say he wasn't warned.  Alagna brings a passionate ferocity and athleticism as well as hitting all the notes (musical and emotional - from the dying old man to the exuberance of youth, to the depravity of the drug addicted.  And finally Gheorgiu - How I loved to hear recordings of Joan Sutherland doing this role, thankful that I didn't have to look at her.  And now Gheorgiu, singing full out with total gorgeous beauty, in her voice and in her appearance.  It just doesn't get any better than that.
I'll just add that with singing actresses like Gheorgiu, Garanca, Netrebko and Dessay, I wonder that opera audiences aren't growing in leaps and bounds.  There are miracles out there folks, and we get to bring them right into our homes.
