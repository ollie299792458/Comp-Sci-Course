I just can't understand why this gets a 2.5 star rating! Personally, I loved this movie. The reason is probably due to the absence of Michael Myers, but I really don't mind. This movie is an odd gem that should be seen. The only problem I have with it (hence the 4-star rating) is the sex and nudity. There was a particularly graphic sex scene, so anyone who is offended by that sort of thing shouldn't watch this. There is only one scene, and it's not particularly important to the movie. It was completely unneccisary, and it could have been rated R without it. There was some cheesy gore, and it's all pretty over the top. It's not really bloody, but it is kind of graphic. For example: a man stick his thumb and forefinger into a man's eyes, all the way to his skull. I know this sounds grotesque, but it's so cheesy, that I didn't get queesy.

  Overall, I think the plot was great. It was highly original and entertaining. There has never been anything like it, and there never will be. The "Silver Shamrock" song will stick in your head for days, as it is played about every five minutes (no joke). For people with anxiety, I do not recommend this movie. The soundtrack is repetitive in an eerie sort of way. You don't really get bored of it, because it simulates the monotonous feelings you get in your nightmares. In fact, the music is one of the best parts about this movie. I really liked this movie. I can't understand why it's so under-rated.
