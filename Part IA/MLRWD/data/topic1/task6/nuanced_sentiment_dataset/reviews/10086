Rodney Dangerfield is a rude, overbearing rusty comic powerhouse, his first appearance in the movie is simply hilarious, the jokes just start and never end!: from "wo, what a ugly hat, last time I had a hat like this, I got a bowl of soup... to Ted Knight: "Oh it looks good on you though" he rolls his eyes, and Knight leaves the shop putting the hat back on the shelf to "Hey everyone, were all going to get laid!" the crowd on the deck cheer and appaulse!.  Rodney and Ted are perfect working with each other. this is probably the most influence National Lampoon style movie ever, this movie was different from Animal House with the destruction scenes added to it because of Dangerfield performance. Chevy Chase and Bill Murray seem to be introuced to the movie screen from this movie, and finally they were out the SNL skit and finally got into movies, I loved Bill Murray underground comic performance as a slobby grasskeeper called Carl trying to dispose a gopher out of the golf field! Chevy played an overrated playboy, but looks as if he don't want to do with a woman, that was makes it funny and innovated. people should see this movie more time.  It haves a enlightable and enjoyable look to it. buy this movie on DVD format or VHS. thanks!
