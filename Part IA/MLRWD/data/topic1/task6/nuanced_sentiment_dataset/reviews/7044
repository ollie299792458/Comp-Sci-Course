My son and I just re-watched Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.  We had seen it in the theater over the summer and I had forgotten just how disappointing this movie was.  There were many, many important details that were left out from the book and an entirely new scene was inserted that made absolutely no sense.  This movie should've been split into two like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows will be.  Since we are supposed to be getting clues as to Voldemort's past, the first and most important clue was left out of the movie!  The scene that is missing is how Tom Riddle Sr. met Voldemort's mother and how Voldemort ended up in the orphanage in the first place, and also how Voldemort came to be in the possession of the first horcrux.

The scene that really outraged me was the Christmas scene at the Weasley House.  If the writers of the script had been paying attention to "A History of Hogwarts" they would have known that the Weasley's house could not be destroyed like that because it is protected with charms just like Hogwarts is.  In addition, since the characters use the Weasley's house as a safe haven in both book 6 and 7, this scene is utterly ridiculous.  There is, however, a nice moment between Dumbledore and Harry in which Dumbledore realizes that Harry is actually the 8th Horcrux.

I also disliked how the director leached the color out of nearly every scene.  The Harry Potter movies have always been a visual feast, rich with color and detail, but as the story has grown darker, so have the movies - literally.  I miss the splendid colors of the first four movies.

I bought this movie in Blue Ray to complete our set, but it will probably be the Harry Potter movie I will be the least likely to re-watch.
