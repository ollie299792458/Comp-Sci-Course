There is no doubt, that on March 24, 2002, justice was served when The Best Actor Academy Award was given to one the greatest actors of his generation, for what very well be his best performance since Malcolm X (the movie he should have won Best Actor for in 1992)  I'm of course talking about the brilliant Mr. Denzel Washington.  Everyone is talking about him playing against type in this one, but I see this as a classic Denzel performance, with all the elements we love about him, just more colorful.  You can tell he's having fun playing that part when you watch the movie.  Let's not forget the Oscar worthy performance from Ethan Hawke, who held his own playing the perfect opposite of Denzel's savage Alonzo Harris.  And of course there is the brilliant directing of Pittsburgh native Antoine Fuqua.  This has to be his best film to date.  Let's also not forget the compelling screenplay by David Ayer, and the rest of the cast, including Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.  bottom line, Training Day is a must see.  Especially if you're a Denzel fan.  And if your not, after this, you'll become one.
