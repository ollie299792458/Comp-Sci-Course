I love the Boondock Saints.  I've seen the first one probably 100 times, own 2 DVD copies of it, 1 Blu Ray copy of it, and can pretty much recite every line of the movie given the opportunity.  I'm not saying that to say I have a bias but rather because Saints II manages to get a weird backlash from the first film's fans and I don't think it's warranted.

Saints II is definitely not like the first one.  But it's also not so far off from the first one that it shouldn't be sharing its name.  It came 10 years after the first film debuted and I believe that it does a great job of finding the "sweet spot" between what needs to be in a sequel and what can make it its own story.  It also does something you don't see in many sequels, especially ones appearing a decade later: it welcomes back the main cast.

It has also caught flack for being "racist", "anti-gay", and a whole host of misnomers.  This is the way the east coast is.  I don't think it even crossed anyone from the coast's mind.

All in all, this is a great followup to the first one.  It has humor, action, and fun, referring back to the "magic formula" that made the first one a cult classic.
