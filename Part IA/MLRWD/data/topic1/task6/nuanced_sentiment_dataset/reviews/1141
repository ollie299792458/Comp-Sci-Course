I am now thinking of avoiding Bollywoods that cross the cultural divide and have Bollywoods with American/ British actors etc.
To give it its due this movie is better in being in India and Salman Khan emotes his socks off and mostly saves the movie.
The few musical numbers are OK but nothing special and the music, for me, unmemorable.
The American heroine goes from overacting 'Bitch' to someone who just doesnt seem to fit the Bollywoods. These crosses of culture (as with Mistress of Spices and the dreadful Bollywood Queen) make the Westerners look wooden and with limited acting range when put next to the Indian actors.
Even the beauty of Western actors fades next to some of the naturally striking (and non-Barbie doll) men and women.
I now see the point of the long Indian movies as they take time to develop characters and you end up caring more (than in this movie) who gets the girl or lives to save the day.
Unless you are starting with the idea of Bollywood and havent been won by that industry yet, I'd go for the real thing.
