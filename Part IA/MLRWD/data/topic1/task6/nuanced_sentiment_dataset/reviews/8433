Boring.  Mind-numbingly boring.  I forced myself to watch every single one of these boring productions because I was given this as a gift.  I couldn't stand it.  In most of the stories, nothing happens.  There were a couple I could kind of stand to watch, but relatively speaking they were about as good as the worst episodes of a good series.  Seriously, don't waste your time and money on this.  I don't even want my copy anymore and I doubt anybody else does either so I don't even bother trying to sell it; I'd feel terrible taking somebody's money and giving them this in return.  Even if you don't believe me, there is so much else out there to purchase & watch -- why gamble on this?

Some of you may expect me to actually outline why it was boring & why I hated it so much.  Well, you're out of luck.  It was so boring that attempting to rehash any events from it for the sake of in-depth critique would probably put me into a coma.  It's not worth the words.  I would much rather make these vague, but accurate, derogatory statements because it is a kind of catharsis for me -- and because I wanted to be a voice of reason in this sea of apologetic reviews.

Seriously, guys, your idea of a bad rating for this is 3 stars?  3 stars means you may not love it..you may not want to marry it...you may not want to have its children...but you at least wouldn't make fun of it the next day with your friends...you kinda liked it.  This set is a 1-star at best.
