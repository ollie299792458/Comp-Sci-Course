Ok, in terms of how this movie stacks up against all other movies, it gets a middling grade, hence the 3 stars. As a fluffy, vicarious fun experience, it gets 5 stars. As far as the plot goes, it's every 12 year old girls dream. Become a princess, get in line to be queen, have to marry because of tradition, throw that radition out the window, and end up with that guy you hated at the beginning, but have since discovered is your true match. Ok, it sounds incredibly cliched and it is, but it's enjoyable. Anne Hathaway is perfectly charming as Mia. I like that even though she's been a princess for a few years that she still has the flaws that she had at the beginning of the first movie and that she doesn't just accept the tradition, but tries to get around it and won't marry one man just to have the crown. Julie Andrews is simply wonderful, but that's to be expected. Her duet with Raven while kind of not cool is still likely to have Andrews fan happy to see her singing again. Hector Elizondo is good as everyone's favorite bodyguard and fans of the Clarisse/Joseph romance will leave the theater happy. I wasn't all that thrilled to hear that Robert Carmine(Michael for PD 1) wasn't returning, but there are two guys involved with Mia in this one. Chris Pine is the guy after the thrine that Mia should hate, but doesn't. He's ok, nothing special. Mia's almost husband is played by Callum Blue and even though the movie makes him a fuddy-duddy I still preferred him to the other guy. Anyways, it's good clean fun and if they do make another one, I imagine that there'll be a lot of happy fans.
