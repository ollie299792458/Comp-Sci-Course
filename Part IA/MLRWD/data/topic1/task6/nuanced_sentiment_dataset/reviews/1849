After reading To Serve Them All My Days perhaps 20 years after its publication, I was convinced that I wanted to work with helping students as a volunteer, even if an opening as a teacher was not available--the book is that inspiring.  It is rivetting reading.
The DVD is beautifully produced, accurately preserving the main lines of the plot.  The film-characters fit the book-characters down to the ground--especially the headmaster (who, two decades later, portrays Lionell Hardcastle's father in As Time Goes By, looking hardly a year older).
The author, as I recall, reflects the popular politcal sympathy of his era (the very early 1970's), which may help account for the book's well-deserved success upon its publication. However, his hero's timeless advice to question popular academic culture (in the novel conservative) thus becomes unintentionally ironic--given today's much more liberal-leaning academic philosophy.

To Serve Them All My Days is Goodbye Mr. Chips (the plot of which it generally parallels) for the more community-and-politically involved--and is all the better for being so, regardless of one's political persuasion.  I do hope, now that it is available on DVD, that public broadcasting stations will begin showing it again.  It is truly a marvelous film.
