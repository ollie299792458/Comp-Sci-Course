Four out of the five movies nominated for the Best Picture Oscar of 1998 deserved to be there, in my opinion. Take out 'The Thin Red Line' and add  in 'The Truman Show', and the Academy would have actually gotten the top  lineup right.
'The Truman Show' is an exceptional movie, partly because  it could have gone so wrong. The premise could easily come across as some  episode off of "The Twilight Zone", and "everybody"  knows that Jim Carrey in the lead role makes this a comedy. Well, it didn't  turn out that way.
Jim Carrey, in this movie, shows (once again) that he  can do some excellent dramatic acting. His character has traces of Jim's  wacko roles from the earlier movies that so many viewers define him by, but  this works. Truman Burbank has been raised in a totally unnatural  environment, and Jim Carrey shows the damage that this has caused in the  character. He is like a bomb which can go off at any second, and which does  go off during the course of the movie.
Similarly, the rest of the movie  succeeds by walking just at the edge of ludicrousness. The very careful  handling of the story by director Peter Weir, and the restrained  performance of Ed Harris and the rest of the cast keeps us at the very edge  of our suspension of disbelief. The story is bizarre, but just within the  realm of possibility for your mind to accept. The result is like an episode  of "The Prisoner", directed by Frank Kapra.
