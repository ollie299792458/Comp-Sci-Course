At a recent preview screening, Mr. Soderbergh got up to introduce the film and talked about wanting to recreate the feel of a 1940s Warner Bros. movie as directed by Michael Curtiz (it was double-featured with Casablanca)--but with a modern freedom to depict strong language, sexuality and extreme situations. This made me start worrying even before the movie began: sometimes those limitations work to a filmmaker's advantage, forcing creative solutions by which to still get the story told. In the end, I felt that Soderbergh's fascination with the style of those 1940s films had overwhelmed his storytelling skills, because none of what I saw really felt all that important.

Now don't get me wrong--I admire the fact that Soderbergh keeps trying new things, that he's constantly reaching and stretching, trying to grow artistically in every direction.  That's a big part of why I think he's one of our best filmmakers right now; but it's axiomatic that every once in a while, one of his experiments won't work ("Bubble," anyone?).  Because the danger is that sometimes the work will feel as if it was for Soderbergh's benefit more than his audience's, and I'm afraid that that's what happened here.

Cate Blanchett (who was born to be photographed in black-and-white) gives a great performance, but her final revelation wasn't quite as awful as I'd thought it would be, which made the whole thing feel underwhelming. George Clooney is the new William Holden, and that's a good thing, but he and Blanchett needed a better story, better told, to work with, and they just didn't get it. A real disappointment: lots of craft, but not much heart. Or rather, it seemed that all the heart got poured into the craft, not into the storytelling. Too bad; it's a Soderbergh film, and I had gone in with high expectations.
