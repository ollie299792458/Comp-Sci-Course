This movie is outstanding and should be in everyone's collection.  It is a fun thrilling, touching ride.  Make sure you've eaten before seeing though :) My family and I have watched this several times already and only owned it a week.

The BAD - SONY. Can't believe with all this technology you have resorted to ONLY including YOUR proprietary digital copy for PSP ONLY!! Even the other companies provide PC AND MAC versions of their digital copies (Win media / quicktime), 2 rivals. There's a reason you lack in your product offering and its because you ALWAYS do this. You separate yourself so far from everyone else to win the FORMAT war, that most of the time you LOSE.
Include your PSP format, I get that, but give us something else to use for our kids for travel! I suggest you release a free digital copy in another format for those who can show proof of purchase. I will be writing your company.  This product would be 5 stars no doubt if they would have provided the standard digital formats EVERYONE else does, but plus their PSP format.

I want to recommend this movie, but I am so mad to give Sony any more money because of things like this with them....
