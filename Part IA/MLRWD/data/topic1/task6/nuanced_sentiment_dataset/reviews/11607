Typical monster in the house premise with a group of British soldiers circling the wagons inside an isolated country house with werewolves knocking off characters one by one. As has been mentioned, special affects and costuming are not exactly top-of-the-line and there are plenty of plot holes and lapses in logic but the actors are comitted and generate a sense of urgency and fear with the ever dependable Sean Pertwee playing the likeable, grunt, 'one of the guys' Sergeant and Kevin McKidd as the uber talented and resourceful soldier you know right away is going to survive all this.
I can see why there are such harsh negative reviews. When you read comments like 'DOG SOLDIERS is one of the greatest horror films of all time,' and 'Up there with the classic horror movies,' you can only be setup for a letdown. It's a solid action/horror flick, and being those are few and far between, worth the viewing. But it's nowhere near the second coming of 'Alien' by far, although it steals liberally from it, 'Southern Comfort,' 'Goldilocks and the Three Bears,' and other horror/action flicks. It's a B-movie that owes much of its success to pacing, acting and ambience if not outright terror.
So if you're a horror/action fan, put it in your Netflicks bay and enjoy a fast paced, action filled werewolf film. You could do worse.
