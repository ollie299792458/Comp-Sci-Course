This is a bad movie, but it's good-bad, and a lot of fun.  If you enjoy poverty-row horror flicks or are a big Lugosi fan, this is for you.  The  basic plot: Bela Lugosi plays a mad scientist (is there any other kind?)  who, in addition to his day job in product development for a cosmetics  company, breeds giant killer bats.  He uses the bats to avenge himself for  various wrongs.  The usual dopey horror-flick characters are in there, too.  The usual sort of murderous mayhem ensues.
This is a Producers Releasing  Corporation film -- the bottom of the barrel as far as poverty row goes.  The film, however, is fun in a very cheesy sort of way.  The director (Jean  Yarbrough) went on to direct some "Addams Family" episodes.
If  you enjoyed "The Corpse Vanishes" (1942) or "Scared to  Death" (1946), you will enjoy this one too.  Those titles are  available on DVD with "The Devil Bat" in double features, for  those of you who like your cheesy horror flicks by the pound.
I would  also recommend this if you want to invite friends over to give a film the  "Mystery Science Theater" treatment
