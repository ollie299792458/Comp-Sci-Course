I rented this Blu-Ray release because it had been quite some time since I saw Payback (I own it on VHS, but that's collecting dust somewhere in storage by now). Long story short, if you watch the extras (as I did just to figure out what the heck happened to the movie) then you'll learn that this movie has changed hands many times over and apparently this is what the Director had originally intended.

Personally, I like the original version much more than whatever this mish mashed remix edition amounts to as it equated to a much fuller story. I know it was more over the top but the movie itself was over the top to begin with so why not at least be consistent in that regard instead of trying to get serious at the end. I won't ruin it for anyone..suffice to say that if you are looking for the Payback you saw in theaters, this is not it. It is something much different and I didn't enjoy it at all.

Side Note: It's apparent after viewing this film why the studio didn't like the direction this film was headed.  They were right to step in and rehash the content.  Where is the theatrical release?  I'm glad I didn't buy this one.  For those of you who have only seen the "Director's Cut", try to track down the real deal.
