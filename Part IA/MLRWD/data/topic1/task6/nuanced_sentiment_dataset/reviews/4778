In a nutshell--don't waste your precious time.  There's plenty of interesting imagery in this movie but little else.  More like watching a very long video game.  The film goes from super fast anime style action with editing so rapid that you can't even be sure of what you are seeing(complete with speed lines flowing from the fast moving characters) to long meaningless speeches where characters face off verbally in cavernous rooms.  There are robot armies that look as though they were borrowed from the George Pal Puppetoon screwball armies.  The symbol used by the one faction calling themselves "neo-sapiens" is a cross between a swastika and a 45 RPM record spindle adapter.  The one army uses Nazi style helmets and uniforms.  There's a touch of Jesus and the three wise men imagery tossed in, as well.  It's a hodge podge of images combined to trigger various emotions within you but when you actually examine the story, you realize there's nothing to examine but a collection of interesting pictures.
