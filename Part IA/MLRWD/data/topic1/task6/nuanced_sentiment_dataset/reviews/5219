Reviews abound on the quality of the storyline, the cast and the acting, the filming, how viewers who "don't like Westerns" or "can't sit still through a long movie" regard this as a masterpiece.  They are correct-no better film's ever been made, in my opinion.

The Blu-Ray presentation of the film is very nice, with good color and excellent sound, both improved over the DVD release.  A common complaint on other Amazon reviews has been the cropping of the original film dimensions to fit a 16:9 screen--a process that does end up costing some of the original film (mostly on the bottom of the screen).  The trade-off is that all of the screen real-estate on your beautiful, expensive plasma or LCD is filled--no black bars, no stretched faces.  For me, it's a worthwhile tradeoff.  It's really not noticeable to me, and if you are engrossed in the story and the scenery, you won't notice much either.

If you're a lucky owner of a good TV and a Blu-Ray player, this all-time classic Western belongs in your library.  Highly recommended.
