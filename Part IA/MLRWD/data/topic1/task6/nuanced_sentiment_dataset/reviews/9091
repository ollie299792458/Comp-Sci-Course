Yes, it's true.  I'm conflicted.  I can't decide.  Me, the guy with an opinion about everything.  Me, the guy who never met an issue he couldn't be self-righteously correct about.  The guy who derides political moderates as wishy-washy sheep holding their fingers up to the winds of public opinion.  The guy who... well, you get the picture.
I can't decide whether to like this movie or not.
Granted, parts of it are very, VERY funny.  I particularly like the sound of the aliens -- had I seen this in the theater instead of at home, I suspect the ride from the movie house would have been filled with the sounds of me and my friends trying to imitate the brash, nasal "Wah, wah, wah" of the Martian ambassador.  I laughed everytime I heard the aliens broadcast to fleeing humans, "Don't run!  We are your friends," (all while blasting away at their "friends") or "We come in peace," just before new carnage begins.
This is a strange, twisted movie, like every other Tim Burton movie.  It is worth a look.  You may love it, as many of the other reviewers (and certain warped cousins of mine) did.  You may hate it and shut it off halfway through.
Or you may be like me, and not know what to think.  But like me, you'll be glad you saw it once.
Or not.
