I'm only on the last disk of the second box right now, but as much as I like to say I'm disapointed, I'm not. Well, maybe a little bit.

I'm kind of irked that Carson Comedy Classics showed the complete Columbo Sketch - but they edited it on the DVD set. Same with an earlier Carson DVD set (Vols 1 - 14), where they edited President Carson doing his comedy routine.

In spite of being a rip-off, its still a good set to own. It's more of a "Best of Carson," showing major highlights from particular episodes. As one disgruntled buyer noted, the edits are wierd. Some episodes are under 25 minutes, while a few go about 40. Some highlights that could only be found on Carson's Comedy Classics are on this set, but if they're still showing Comedy Classics in your area - save your money - unless you actually like to have the collection of monologues and trust me - not that much reycled material. I've only watched about 6 disks at this point.

The Good:

- We get the complete Robert Blake interview, where Johnny takes his pants off and burps. Carson Comedy classics only showed a brief clip.

- We get good highlights of what Carson's show was like in the early 1970's. I wasn't born til 76, so I'm used more of late 1980's Johnny.

- Not that much recycled material. Some of these highlights were seen on Carson Comedy Classics, like some of the Aunt Blabby's, but still even in the truncated form - most of its orginial highlights.

The Bad:

- The Columbo sketch from 1975 has a few minutes cut from it, I guess to fit the 30-minute limit that the DVD set didn't ahear to.

- We get some musical numbers, but then in some cases the producers of this set thought that was the highlight of said person and then we flash to the next guest.

- Some of these clip-shows end during the interview. Wierd editing.

- There was a famous scene where Doc played with one of the guests, that was shown on the old Anniversary show clips - but they edit that moment out, but leave the guest's solo in - though and leave in Carson thanking Doc and the guest for the musical spot that was removed.

Again - for the $80.00 - it was worth a clip show when you're a 34 year old kid like me that never saw the classic monologues.
