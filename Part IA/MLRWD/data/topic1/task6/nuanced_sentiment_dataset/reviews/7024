The Final Countdown has gone down in history as one of those cult-fav sci-fi movies. It was certainly one of my favorites when I was growing up and over time I haven't lost any love for it. After years of, and then some more months, waiting for Pacific Family Entertainment to release, what they call, the DVD, I am utterly furious as to the result. Let me fill all of you in on a little secret.

PFE is releasing it again... only this time, supposedly, the video quality is going to be improved, however it will not be 16x9 enhanced. The sound might be remixed, but lets face it folks... it will probably be the same horrible quality as was before. We might be given the gift of chapter selection, but who knows.

Their last release of The Final Countdown DVD was ranked one of, if not the worst DVDs ever manufactuered by a company. They charged $... a pop and it should have only been worth about $... Now they are re-releasing it again at probably about $... a pop. So beware.
One suggestion I am making to those who have already bought the last release... Call them up and demand an exchange! I'm going to! You have every right to do so because PFE promised us a decent product yet never delivered on their promise. Well now it's time for them to pay up. You can find their phone number on their web-site. Just do a search for Pacific Family Entertainment. It'll be there.
