Never thought i d watch a jlo flick, let alone review it, but did Ralph Fiennes think he would ever star in such a piece of postmodern meta trash? But some schizoid part of him took over, and possed me too! Lol, i started expecting a really bad, bland, corny, formulaic, sentimentalist movie, but man this is the pits. It's as if everyone from the cameraman, to the actors and screenwriters, to the grip boy are giving it their absolutely bestest best of making this as unimaginative and lowest of the lowest denominator as possible. It's as if each sentence is aimed at being the most predegisted, consumerist, banal item that could be. Intentionally! It's like they wrote, and re-wrote, and shot and reshot up until they managed to make sure no iota of anything resembling creative thought made it into the final product. JLo actually gets bad shots where she looks atrocious, deformed, Faines in this film is so out of his element it becomes ironic.  The pair are so mismatched the you can feel the feel the tension of the dissonance in your gut, and makes you criiingeee. This one and the one with Jane Fonda embarrasing hereself which i also watched recently have really defied my expectations...i feel in a nitchean beyond good and evil...
