Love this movie, although I wondered why the Rabbite family was changed to the Curley family. Then again, the original author, Roddy Doyle, was involved in writing this screenplay, so I'm fine with the name changes.

What I really want to do is ping on the many reviewers who spoil the plot by revealing how Sharon's pregnancy occurred. Yes, the old guy who is the father of one of Sharon's friends did brag about it, but the movie does not intend for the viewer to know for sure that he is the culprit; he might have been just making an empty boast. Instead, the viewer has, or should have, Sharon's perspective. At the beginning, her da' asks who the father is. Sharon first says, truthfully, "I don't know." Since this sounds shocking, she quickly changes her story to "I'm not tellin'."

The point is that she herself does not know who the father is. She can't remember. In order to make the revelation, near the end, of how the pregnancy occurred actually matter to the viewer, the viewer must remain in doubt throughout much of the movie: 'Does she really know and is not telling? But wait - didn't she first say she didn't know? Is the old guy really the father? Was he just falsely bragging and has now gotten in trouble for it? If he is the baby's father, how could Sharon not remember him?'

This is the mindset the viewer should be allowed to have while seeing the movie for the first time. Reviewers should not be spelling out Sharon's secret, which is unknown - even to herself - for much of the movie.
