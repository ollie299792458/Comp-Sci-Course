Long Way Round and Race to Dakar had a certain vibe. I was *so* looking forward to seeing that vibe again in Long Way Down. It was mostly there, but there were three major detractors:

1. Less focus on food and eating and what they were really thinking and doing, and what Claudio was doing, and their arguments, etc. (those appear to have been edited out or not filmed).
2. Ewan was all clean-shaven the whole time and more self- and power-conscious. I hope he can get back to how he was before, guess that's not probably possible. I missed his self-immolation in the trip from the first one.
3. Eve: I agree with an earlier poster that as a woman I am not criticising based on gender, but sorry, Eve just was not helpful on the trip. She was boring, it looked like she didn't even try to pick up her own bike when she fell over (many times). I concur with the earlier poster that Eve should not have inserted herself (for pretty much obviously selfish reasons). I was glad also that she wasn't there long. Charley was really nice and well-behaved about that whole thing. But Olly didn't drag things down by insisting on coming along, so he was out of the issue. Plus, Ewan and Charley are funny and interesting. When Eve was there, I found her quite dull, not being a guy who appreciates a cute face or whatever. I got tired of Ewan saying how great she was when she obviously wasn't, and I hope that Ewan and Eve can do their own trips separately from the "Long Way" series in future. Sorry to feel this way, as I'm all about girl power, but sheesh. I didn't sign on to see a girly girl with only a husband to recommend her get coddled along with the guys. Eve probably had a great time, and I'm glad Ewan liked having her there, but I found her to be a drag.

Apart from these negative observations, I loved how the team went through Africa. I felt like getting more involved in HIV/AIDS volunteering. I think they are great and overall this was a great show.
