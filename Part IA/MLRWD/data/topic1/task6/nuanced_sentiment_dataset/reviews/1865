There is some truly spectacular cinematography in this film, however as in many Argento films we are ultimately left with a lot of style and very little substance. The body count become laughably excessive by the end of the film and most plot logic is muddied by the carnage. The strength of this film however, lies in Argento's ability to force the viewer to be an accomplice in these murders. Gloved hands reach from below the frame, hand-held cameras follow screaming girls and of course a painfully long voyurestic tracking shot preceeds gruesome murders--all forcing the viewer to experience these deaths as if they were the killer. This unnerving technique forces us to address why we are interested in watching the film, and what effect this violent media might have upon us. I find the catchy disco soundtrack makes the joy-killing almost unbearably perverse at times. The DVD presentation is good, however I am VERY DISAPPOINTED that there were no subtitles for the film, forcing me to watch an absolutely atrocious dubbing.
