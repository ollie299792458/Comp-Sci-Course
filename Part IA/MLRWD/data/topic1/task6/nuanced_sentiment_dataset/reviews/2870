Just watched the Blu-ray edition of My Fair Lady on a 60" HDTV.  It looked horrible.  Out of focus around the edges, with a disturbing color shift.  I then watched part of the film on a twelve-foot wide screen, with a HD video projector providing the image--the same disappointing result--even worse with the larger image.  This is an extremely poor transfer of Warner's crown jewel.  IT IS SO SAD THAT THE RIGHTS BELONG TO CBS, WHO OBVIOUSLY DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE TRANSFER OF THIS GREAT FILM.  If Warner Brothers did the transfer to Blu-ray, "My Fair Lady" would most likely have looked as great as their other recent outstanding work such as "Casablanca", "The Wizard of Oz", or "Gone With the Wind".  Twentieth Century Fox did a fantastic job with their Blu-ray edition of "The Sound of Music".  I was expecting "My Fair Lady" to look as good as "The Sound of Music". This was a huge disappointment.  I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANY OTHER CBS/PARAMOUNT TITLES IN THE FUTURE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TITLE! (PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE FILM TRANSFER, AND NOT THE MOVIE).  THE MOVIE DESERVES FIVE STARS!!!
