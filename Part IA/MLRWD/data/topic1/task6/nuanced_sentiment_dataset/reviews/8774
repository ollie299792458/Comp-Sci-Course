Everyone has a complaint about this or that, but let's face it. They weren't out to recreate the original Mummy (with Karloff), but to put new faces into it. Brandon Frasier is great in this film with the right amount  of sarcasm that makes you laugh without getting on your nerves. The detail  put into the characters interaction is what helps makes this film  delightful. The special effects are good, but are definately outshined by  the acting. It's one of those movies you through on while you do something  else simply because you wouldn't mind hanging out with the characters if  they existed in real life. The humour is genuine and not forced, it has the  right amount of thrills. With the Indy series nearly dead (rumours abound  of a fourth, but only rumours), I wouldn't mind them taking Brandon  Frasiers character to fill his shoes. The era of the time, with all it's  mystic and prim and properness just lends well into the mysteries of the  unknown. Heck, Tommy Lee Jones went from the fugitive to US Marshalls, so  let them do it here. And all around great fun film. People's  disappointments with it stem from it possible being TOO much fun with out  being more seriousness. But nothing is forced and the humour level is  perfect.Not to mention the DVD itself is chockful of goodies like  commentaries, histories, mini-games, etc. Great attention to detail for DVD  extra's.
