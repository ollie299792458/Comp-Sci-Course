While many critics had utter distaste for "The Astronaut's Wife," I happened to enjoy this horror/sci-fi film very much.  It's a lot of fun, and it has eerie cinematography that really draws the viewer  into the film.  But the real thing that makes this not-so-original flick  worth while to watch is the superb acting from Johnny Depp ("Sleepy  Hollow," "Edward Scissor Hands") and the stunning,  absolutely magnificent Charlize Theron ("Devil's Advocate,"  "2 Days in the Valley").  Both these actors are very talented and  perhaps at the top of their generation.  Joe Morton (veteran co-star of  "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and "Speed") also has a  small role here, which makes it all the better.  
The film is about an  astronaut's wife (Theron) who finds out that her husband (Depp) has come  back from space and has been posessed by some alien force.  He now has  plans on Earth for world domination after he impregnates his wife with his  alien children.  This is where Morton comes in as he desperately tries to  tell the astronaut's wife what is happening.  The story moves along at a  brisk, yet somewhat predictable pace, and it's really only the ending that  proves to have any jolt of suspense and breathless unpredictability.  Overall, if you enjoy this type of genre, "The Astronaut's Wife"  is well worth your time and money to see.
