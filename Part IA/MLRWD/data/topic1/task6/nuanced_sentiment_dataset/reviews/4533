Wow, I had low expectations for this film knowing that a remake of an iconic
movie is a tough task, but this really missed the mark.  While Dudley Moore
was funny and charming, I found Russel Brand just a cheap knock off.  It was
like watching a stand up comic do a bad imitation for almost 2 hours!  Sadly,
while I usually love Helen Mirren, I really missed crotchety old Hobson. Now we
come to Greta Gerwig, who was perfectly fine but really not special in her role
as Arthur's first real love.  I just didn't buy the chemistry.  Then Jennifer
Garner...UGH...why they changed the role of Susan so drastically I will never know.
She was sweet and unassuming in the original, and that worked with her overprotective
father.  In this new version, she was just a witch.  I thought the whole thing was
a disaster and while I laughed out loud during the original, this one had me watching
the clock in hopes that an end was in sight.  Sorry, Arthur...this one should have been
lost in New York City!
