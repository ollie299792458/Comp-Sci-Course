It's hard to know where to begin with this cliched, badly contrived movie.  The storyline in itself should have been warning enough- a desperate overprotective mother (Keaton) puts out an ad for a boyfriend for her daughter,(Moore) without her knowledge because she wants her to get married.  Predeicatbly, 2 men then enter Moore's life- an oaf of an arictect who responded to the ad, and a guitarist with a lovable son who is generally intersted in Moore and doesn't know of any ad. (5 guesses who Moore ends up with...)
This movie was a ridculous, with a cliched, bad romance, awful, sterotypical full-out there gags for laughs (think cakes falling on innocent passerby's heads,and bad sex jokes/gags such as Keaton watching porn) and truly annoying, awful unlikable characters.  Honestly this was the first movie where I hated Keaton's character- or for that matter every single character.  Not only was Keaton's character rude and obnoxious and irrating, but Moore's character spent the majority of the movie either acting like a passive, submissive, misguided baby, or a whiny, irrational teenager who saw fit to burst up at her mother or go into sulky, fits every 10 min of the film in a completly unrealistic manner.  And while Moore's character was a self-proclamed feminists, there are few feminists I know who get exteremly intimate with two men, and then wonder why they're not too happy about it.
Einstein once said that "Two things are infinate.  The world and human stupidty and I'm not sure about the former."  This movie shows exactly why.
