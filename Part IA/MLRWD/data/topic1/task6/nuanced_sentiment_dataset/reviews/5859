It is hard not to read the entire script of this film in your head after watching the first 5 minutes.  A hero firefighter struggles for life in an devastating fire.  Flashback to his first day as a rookie.  Cut to the fire engulfs him...flashback to him picking up his future wife while shopping in uniform...repeat formula...get the idea?

Director Russell seeks to humanize Joaquin Phoenix's firefighter and does an effective job despite total reliance on obvious formula.  We see early on Phoenix's pal die in a fire, and how the station reacts.  Travolta is station chief and we can easily picture how he would react to a dire ending, of the film's protaganist.  There is one simple scene, when fate unfold for a particular character.  Phoenix's simple reaction is crushing...you will know the scene when you see it.

That is the underlying theme.  All of the men are heroes, and their job goes on even if they fall.  A very patriotic post 911 film.  All in all, maybe the best treatment of this subject in a long while.
