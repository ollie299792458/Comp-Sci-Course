We are relative newcomers to the Baby Einstein revolution. My twins were 15 months before we bought their first one - Baby Beethoven. We just recently purchased Baby Neptune and Baby Galileo.
This is a fine DVD with wonderful music, but it just doesn't hold the attention of my boys the way Baby Beethoven does. I begin to wonder if kids don't just attach to the first Baby Einstein video/DVD they get and that's always their favorite...
This is a bit shorter, and my kids seem to especially like the scenes in Beethoven with the kinetic toys, which are not as evident here.
Always keep in mind as parents watching the Baby Einstein series that the images are for the KIDS and not the parents - yes, I find them a tad boring, but the boys love them, and that's what is important!
I like the special features on this DVD, including the "discovery cards" and the cd-ROM coloring book. These are nice extras.
All in all, a fine video - and as I said, not my kids' favorite, but not the one they're most familiar with, either.
