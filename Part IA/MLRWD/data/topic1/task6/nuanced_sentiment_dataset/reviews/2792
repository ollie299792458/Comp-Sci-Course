I would have only given this movie half a star if I could, and that is because I can use the DVD case for my other CDs.
The movie is so irritatingly silly, that I couldn't bring myself to see it again.
Now, I should tell you that, I am a Sherlock Holmes fan and have read all of the stories and have all of the box collections by Jeremy Brett, and that is why when I chanced upon this one I didn't hesitate to buy it.
What a mistake I made.
The movie does its best to portray a man that is as far as possible from Sherlock Holmes, and yet they call him Sherlock Holmes!
From the very first moment that you meat "Holmes" when he is "trying to find the correct note with his violin that would irritate the flies", which is simply against the very simple fact that "Sherlock Holmes never knows anything or does anything, which is not directly connected with his line of work", to the moment that he fails at every step to clearly see the thing that is really going on (this by the way could be related to the incredibly dull plot of the story, but it does little to improve the character of the great detective), we see a figure which is anyone but Sherlock Holmes.
The above description would suffice to realize how Watson may be presented. Yes the local buffoon.
All this is simply against every intellectually interesting point that attracts the reader to Sherlock Holmes.
And at the end, to magnify that which is already a disaster, the plot of the story takes away the only possible surprising feature of the story, (which is one of the intriguing aspects of Doyle's genius in creating each of Holmes' stories), when they reveal to us plainly, what the one, Professor Moriarty, is planning to do, in his own words.
In sum, I wonder if this movie even deserves the half star that I had considered for it, because not only the movie was a complete disaster, it inflicted upon a unique figure in the history of literature such a stain that takes away the shine of even that half star.
