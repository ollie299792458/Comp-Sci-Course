"Damn cripples, probably going to end up on welfare. If it were up to me, I'd electrocute them all."

Busey must be a really great actor, if he can make the guy who said this not seem like the worst person in the film. I've never heard a more terrifying "ta-daa!"

Now to the plot holes of this movie. First, how does this kid sneak away from home to the abandoned bridge on an unreasonably loud power wheel chair? Since when could werewolfs use base ball bats? How are we supposed to emphazie with a character who forgets his dead best friend so quickly? (He's only sad for one scene) How can a drunk, a cripple and a bookworm explain a dead naked priest with two missing eyes in their house? Even if their parents who are coming back the next day will understand, Busey will fry.

One thing is for certain, Busey should not be around children, not even in acting roles. How much of an alcoholic do you think that kid is going to be when he grows up? I love this movie.
