I just got through watching this rental about 5 minutes ago...
I'm really,REALLY glad that I didn't pay full price to see this at the movies.
 I loved Jackass when it was on MTV..... but the movie just didn't make me laugh nearly as hard;in fact I kinda felt sorry for Knoxville and the gang.I feel like everyone was trying so hard to be explicit,that they forgot about being funny.In several skits you can almost tell that they are forcing themselves to laugh alot at stuff that's only mildly amusing.
 However there were some funny parts,all be it far and few inbetween:the night pandas skit,Wee Man in the cone,the golfers
and of course hearing Bam's dad cuss during the fireworks!By the way there SHOULD have been ALOT more Wee Man,and ALOT less of that one guy dancing as the male stripper.I can't think of his name,but he's my least favorite of the Jackass crew.Seeing that skit one time...maybe...would be funny...kinda...... BUT SIX TIMES!?Have the fast forward button on your remote handy.
 Some of the stunts were a little too hardcore for me A.K.A papercuts,baby croc clamping on a nipple,syringe to the back of the head,and shark stuck to arm.Also you can only think it's funny so many times to see someone throw up...then it just gets old.Lastly,I like nudity in my movies....FEMALE NUDITY! Why was there so much male nudity??Sorry but I don't,nor would I ever want to see THAT much of a Jackass.They could've at least hired a couple babes to take off their tops and even things out!It's almost like some of these guys are bisexual or something...
 Even with the "bonus footage" this DVD is not that great.Save your money and buy seasons 1 and 2 on DVD.They're alot funnier.
