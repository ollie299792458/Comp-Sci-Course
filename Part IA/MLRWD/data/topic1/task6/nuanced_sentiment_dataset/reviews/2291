A co-worker and myself were recently discussing our admiration for Star Trek. While I favor the original series and Next Gen, I gave up halfway through DS9 and only watched a handful of Voyager eps. I didn't even bother with Enterprise, as I felt the franchise had run out of gas and despite it's claim for fresh ideas, was recycling older plots and characters. He told me that he felt Enterprise fell short, but as a Trek Devotee, he stuck with it till the end. I am attempting to do the same with Heroes. I am halfway through season 3, but man, it's getting tough.
The first season was terrific. Fresh, inventive, action filled, and exciting. The second season had its moments, and the characters were at least interesting. Season 3 is, so far, horrendous. As stated in previous reviews, characters allegiances getting switched, frantic and illogical pacing, ideas dropping in from nowhere, simply because the writes deem so. It's like bad high school improv.  Cast members increasingly becoming unlikeable and it's a struggle to get through. I recently purchased season 4 because I want to see it through to the end. Which means I'll have to watch season 3 all the way through. Oh well. Could be worse. I could be throwing away my time on America's Got Talentless Morons.  John, I feel your pain.
