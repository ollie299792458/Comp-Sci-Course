I don't have proof, but I believe this movie inspired Stan Lee and whoever else to create The Fantastic 4 comic book. Let's compare and contrast. First off there are four astronauts. Three men and one woman. Second the leader of the expedtion is played by Gerald Mohr who eventually went on to provide the voice of Reed Richards/Mr Fantastic in the original Hanna-Barbera Fantastic 4 cartoon series. Then there's the somewhat friendly low brow comic book reading character named Sammy. Probably the best live action portrayal of Ben Grimm with out even knowing there would be a Ben Grimm/Thing. The female which coincidentally happens to be the love interest of the First character is not exactly the Sue Storm/Invisible girl type, but she is a confident intelligent woman. The only real difference is the fourth person. Instead of the elderly doctor/ scientist they opted for a young teenager. Johnny Storm/Torch. I basically like the movie as a fun weekend rainy day film, but if anything was in need of some colorization it's the overly drab reddish brown tint used when outside on the surface of the planet. I can accept the intended glowy effect, but the creatures and main characters should have been given separate colors so it would make for a nice contrast and much more palatable for the eye. Who knows maybe Legend Films may see this review and attept the idea.
