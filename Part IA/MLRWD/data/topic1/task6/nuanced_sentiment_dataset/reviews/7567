I haven't connected with any particular music artist in a long time, but I did here. Most artists always seem too manufactured, and not necessarily dishonest, but not true to themselves. It's all about the industry, the money, doing what is popular. Likewise, a lot of the music coming out these days is massively manufactured.  Where's the conviction and the personality!?  It is very difficult in this day and age to do what is right and not what is popular; to stand up for yourself in the face of massive media scrutiny; and to not back down in the face of overwhelming pressure from the right-wing masses. The Dixie Chicks faced all of this, and they came out stronger, more unified and better artists. I'm now a huge fan.

After watching this DVD, I found myself emailing all of my friends and family members and telling them that if they wanted to be inspired - to rent or buy this DVD. Picking it up was the greatest thing I ever did. Whether you love them or hate them, even the haters have to admit that they are amazing artists, strong people, funny women, dedicated mothers and bonded friends. I was definitely rooting for them in the end! The final scenes will find you in tears, cheering all the while. Too bad the DVD came out before the Grammys...what a great capper that would have been!

Watching this DVD also made their last album that much better. You got to see the stories behind the songs. So, if you loved the album, definitely check out the DVD.
