I love Jack the Ripper tales, and was really anticipating this movie.  As the credits began to roll, however, I felt extremely unsatisfied.  
The atmosphere is good as is the direction, Depp and Graham (who I wanted to see more of) were both convincing, but the problems here lies within the script.  I recently read the review of the Last Castle, and people said the same thing.  Why is Hollywood rushing these movies when they obviously are not ready?
Anyway, Depp's character gets high and has visions.  This was not the type of movie I was expecting.  I wanted to see a real detective investigate the scenes more and describe the criminal.  Jack the Ripper was never truly identified, but this movie offers its own conclusion.  A strange conclusion, but one nonetheless.  I would have preferred an even darker movie, with more of a foreboding atmosphere.  Also, it would have creepier if a killer was never truly seen or identified. Depp's final scene is laughable and DOES NOT belong in a movie like this.  I want more of a creepy murder mystery than an awkward love story!!!
I've heard comments about how Heather Graham is the prettiest prostitute and it's true--all of her friends are ugly yet they're getting the men.
