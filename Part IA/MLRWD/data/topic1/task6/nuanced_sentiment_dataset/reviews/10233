Often lauded as a 'film noir' classic it is not without good reason that Sunset Boulevard sits high within the list of greatest films ever made. An epic portrayl of the shallow fickleness that is Hollywood, it was (and still is) a cutting blow delivered by director, Billy Wilder to the world in which he operated.

The story of tragic diva, Norma Desmond's desperate attempt to cling to the life of adoration and fame that she once knew by believing in a world that still needed her, brutally depicted the truth of the 'monsters' that were being created by the 'Hollywood Machine'in the late forties.

The critique of the film's story line is supported by stunning cinematography, amazing lighting and some the greatest one liners ever commited to celuiod. Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is breathtakingly portrayed and still classed as a defining performance. Supporting cast and an amazing score go on to prove that while the special effects of today's digital age can make the unreal become true, a truely talented director, crew and cast can still make the real become untrue.

It is Desmond's desperation to believe that after twenty years her 'people' were still waiting in the dark and the pathetic way she desired struggling writer, Joe Gillis to 'love and need her'that gives a still relevantly stark insight as to how the wonder of the silver screen has a fatal side effect; an almost psychopathical requirement to be wanted.

Strangely enough though, even after fifty plus years there is still not a film that matches Sunset Boulevard for the bitter and unflattering truth that it portrays of the self obsessed world that is Hollywood. Perhaps not as many directors are as brave as Wilder to 'bite the hand that feeds them'
