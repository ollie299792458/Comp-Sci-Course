I watched this movie and was enthralled, but there was one part where I was thinking "hmmm, the main character should have stayed and asked a few more questions there..."  Well, I watched the deleted scenes afterwards and was horified to find that the climax of the movie had been stripped out of the version I saw.  One of the extra scenes wasn't even included in the deleted scenes section.  I felt ripped off!

Apparently upon an audience screening the director decided to take it out because they were "catatonic" after the movie ended, and I guess he wanted the happy ending to come quicker.  Thats complete BS.

This is a perfect example of art being sacrificed for temporary popularity.  I want to see this movie released in full the way it was meant to be seen, not some version tailored for mass consumption.  I'm even more dissapointed to see that a "directors cut" or criterion collection is not available for this movie right now.  I really hope that one comes out which stitches those scenes back in the movie, otherwise I can't allow this movie into my collection.  Those extra scenes fill the holes currently present in the movie, and make a good movie into a brilliant movie.
