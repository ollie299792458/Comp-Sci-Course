I rented this movie, watched it, laughed hysterically, and immediately went on Amazon to purchase it, as in while the credits were rolling. Bill Nighy is superb as always, he really nails physical comedy and wit with perfect subtlety. Emily Blunt is also awesome, as usual, creating depth and dimension in a character that could come off as one-note if left in the wrong hands. Rupert Grint is trying to have a career after Harry Potter, and more power to him. Yes, he is a little shaky and new, but it works for his character and there are some real gemstone one-liners that he delivers hilariously. Oh, and Rupert Everett, though his role is somewhat small and shallow, is as charming as ever. This film does not take itself too seriously, nor should it, as it is an awesome dark(ish) comedy that succeeds where many contemporary movies fail. I highly recommend picking it up and seeing for yourself. A+ from me.

Sidenote: For all you fashion-minded folks out there, Emily Blunt's wardrobe is AMAZING in this film.
