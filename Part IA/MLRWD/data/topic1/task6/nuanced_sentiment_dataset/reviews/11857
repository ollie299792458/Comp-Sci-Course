This is another one of those films that came out when I was in the Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii.  To me, all the very best movies were released in the eighties because  we finally got past all that cheesiness of the campyness of the seventies, and this was before computer animation and CGI started to reduce the integrity of special effects that made more recently films look so cartoonish.

What really gives me the chills about this film is, although I came from some pretty frightening, nightmarish neighborhoods of Detroit, while I was in Hawaii, I started to see the beauty of the modern day home design and construction, and when I finally got stationed in Northern California, this development of Cueste Verde looks a lot like the neighborhoods of Vacaville, California (about 50 miles from San Francisco), so watching this film again since I've been in California, has given this film a whole new sense of terror to me.

The classic "haunted house" of film's past usually look more like some hundred year old house.  But this film makes the modern day house look like it can be haunted too.  Whenever I drive through Vacaville, I am reminded of this film.

It is also amazing that even though this film is only 30 years old, it's interesting how so many of the actors and actresses in this film are already dead and gone.  Even Heather O'Rourke (who played 4 year old Carol Anne), is dead and gone.

Yeah, I'll have to say that this film has some stronger means of terrifying me more than just being a haunted house film.  I feel like this can happen even in my own neighborhood.  Thank you Steven Spielberg for putting classic horror in a modern day reality setting.

But, because this film came out in the early eighties, it remains one of my favorites to remind me of my wonderful military days.

When I think of "Poltergeist", I think of Hickam Air Force Base, and the black haired beauty I took to the theatre with me when I first saw this movie.
