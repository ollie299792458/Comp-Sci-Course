I could not get comfortable watching this movie. Probably, because my roomates dragged me out of bed on a Sunday morning. I hadn't taken a shower,outside it was hot, inside the theatre, some genius decided that it would be a great idea to turn off the air conditioner in the theatre. Aside from that, the movie was okay. The end battle was, of course, cheesy as hell. The Captain Jack schizo scenes were just weird. Ted Elliot and Terry Russo ruined the movie I think. I read somewhere that they always wait till the last minute right before the cast and crew go into production before they hand the director the script. The giant Calypso at the end reminded of the classic movie monster scenes from the old Sinbad movies. It sucked when Beckett made Davey Jones kill the Cracken. It would of made the third story more interesting if they kept it in, I think. What's with the other seven pirate lords? During the end battle, they didn't even do anything except cheer at the end.The story ended for Jack Sparrow and his crew, but what about Will and Elizabeth? The first film introduced them, now the third curses them? How could Chow Yun Fat actually believe Barbossa into thinking Elizabeth was Calypso? What was with everyone acting as if they knew that was going to happen to Will and Elizabeth? This movie was just confusing and weird.
