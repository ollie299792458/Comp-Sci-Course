There is much about this film that will revolt you: the way the film-makers try to be "even and balanced" by giving Jama Al Gashey (the surviving terrorist) yet another chance to portray himself as a hero; the way a German politician looks the camera in the eye and proclaims that he "liked Issa" (the negotiator for the terrorists and arguably the most revolting man of the lot); the non-stop laughter from another German politician which starts when he recounts that the Israelis wanted to send a team in (ha ha); the complete indifference of the Olympic Committee then and now (they just wanted the hostages moved from the Village so the Games could continue); the collusion between the German Government and the Palestinian terrorists and so much more.

But perhaps the most revolting thing about this admittedly engrossing movie is that the film-makers and the producers and everyone else involved in it just don't get it.  They don't get that this could be their family tomorrow.  It could be my family, it could be your family.

I wish there was another movie of the horror of 1972 that talked about the victims but (to the best of my knowledge) there isn't.  And so (very reluctantly) I recommend it.

Watch it.  Because this could be you and yours.
