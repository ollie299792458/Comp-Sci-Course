I think all the critics are trying to look too deeply into what is simply a raunchy, escapist black comedy.  Forget about the deeper meanings and just give in to the fun!  Christopher Walken steals the whole show with his hilarious portrayal of a 1960's hippie deadbeat who befriends Stiller in a bar which looks exactly like Moe's Tavern in the Simpsons.  Stiller and Walken take up around three minutes of movie time trying to dispose of a dead horse accidentally struck by an arrow fired off into the night air by Stiller.  As the movie progresses, another arrow finds its way into the back of Stiller's former partner in crime, Walken, as he is trying to break into Stiller's house in order to blackmail him.  In the end, the hippie character runs off into the black night back to Haight Ashbury...Rachel Weisz did not have much of a role in the film, but her presence was certainly a nice add on to complement the film, and she proves that she can perform well in a comedic vein.  The Happy Wanderer song and the Merry go round finale are basically the highlights of the film...the dog poo theme simply vanishes into thin air.
