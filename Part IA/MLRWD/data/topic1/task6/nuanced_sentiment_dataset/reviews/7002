Like many other reviewers, I have a deep affection for the character of hercule poirot and am quick to point out any inconsistencies between the actor portraying him and my own vision of him.  Death on the Nile is the first movie in which I saw peter ustinov in the role (other christie productions with him as poirot pale incredibly in comparison to this one).  At first I thought he was terribly miscast, mainly because he didn't look the part and his "belgian" accent was so phony. However, after seeing this movie a few times, his performance has grown on me; he adds much needed playful humor to the movie which I think is present in much of Christie's books, but many times lost in the movie/tv versions, especially those with David Suchet (who is much too serious for my taste).  I think ustinov plays well the whole "papa poirot" side of the character.  Mia Farrow, Maggie Smith and the other big names did a pretty good job, but I think the Egyptian landscape was the real star of this production, and, of course, the incredibly clever twisting plot.  I'm giving four stars because this is one of the more well made christie productions; my favorite is murder on the orient express with albert finney, who, down to the limp (a war injury mentioned in the mysterious affair at styles), was, in my mind, a nearly perfect poirot.
