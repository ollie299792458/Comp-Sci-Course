I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I would agree with other reviews which alluded to "Quantum Leap" (btw, Scott Bakula has a voice role) and "Groundhog Day" (albeit sans humor).  This movie indeed combines elements of other science fiction works, but it does actually work.  There is the parallel/alternate timeline part of the story.  The brief jump back into time element.  The taking over another person element.  The "do you really know what's going on?" element.  This starts to sound like some of those special effect without a story sort of films, but the creators of this feature actually put the various components to good use and make a product greater than the sum of it's parts.

The best thing about this film, for me at least, is the triumph of the main character over seemingly impossible circumstances in the face of others who naysay his efforts...even impeding those efforts.

The characters are generally likeable and easily related to.  No one does anything superhuman, just working the problems.
