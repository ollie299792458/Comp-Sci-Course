A Clockwork Orange is perhaps the best ever film I have seen transferred to DVD and unless you can afford your own cinema, it is the only way to watch the movie.
Kubrick's theatrical and almost surreal rendition of Burgess's notorious novel is crystal clear with every horrific detail, every bead of sweat, every quivering eyelash in glorious digital detail.
The intoxicating strangeness of every set is still present, despite the reduced scale of a television screen, and every note of the underlying score is not just audible, but exquisitely pronounced.
DVD conversions can suffer often from an excess of contast or problems with colour, a real threat to a director like Kubrick whose use of light is superb, but the DVD faithfully maintains the look of the original film.
If you look closely at the scene where Alex attacks his revolting Droogs you will see just how well the film has been preserved in the conversion process.
Kubrick's blockbuster fuses theatre and film, the real and the surreal, crime and punishment with a punch that despite being thirty years old few modern filmakers could match even if they dared. Thirty years ago this film took cinema audiences places they never wanted to go and now the DVD offers the same rollercoaster ride at home. Just buy it.
