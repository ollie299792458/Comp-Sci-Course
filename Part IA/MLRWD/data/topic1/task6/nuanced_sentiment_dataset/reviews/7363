I have always loved the Kevin Sullivan adaptations of the 'Anne of Green Gables' stories.  OK, maybe the first installment the best, as the second and third deviated from the original books more and more, to eventually have little to do with the L.M. Montgomery stories other than the characters.  I believe Megan Follows (who plays Anne) actually had some issues with this.

Why three stars?  Clearly, not so much my rating of the films themselves, but of the DVD quality.  The films should get 5+ stars. However, I purchased this particular DVD set under the impression that, as opposed to the earlier DVD editions, the image had been 'digitally restored,' as the package claims.  Not only was the video quality not any better than previous editions, it still is only slightly better than an VHS copy!  This has been something that has always bothered me deeply, because such gorgeous cinematography coupled with super acting deserves, in my opinion, superior quality digital editions.  To this day, the films never have gotten such treatment.  If they have, they sure do not look like it.  There is really no reason why the video quality should not be better than it is.  Maybe they tried to compress too much into too little space, I don't know.  Some scenes are almost painful to watch (i.e. the scene when Matthew and Anne arrive at Green Gables), because the image quality is quite poor.  I hope that eventually Sullivan Productions releases these films (as well as the 'Road to Avonlea' series, whose DVD releases also lack in video quality) with the quality they (and us) deserve.

So, if you have considered buying this set to replace the earlier editions with the expectation to be wowed by superb digital video restoration, save your money!  If, however, you have not yet bought any Anne films, then by all means, get them. Inferior video quality is surely made up by the beauty of the films.
