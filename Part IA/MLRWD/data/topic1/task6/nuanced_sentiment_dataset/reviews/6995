I am always amazed to hear people criticize Ms. Russell's performance as Momma Rose! This is an incredibly difficult role to portray, especially with the legendary Ethel Merman having immortalized it on Broadway. The challenge Ms. Russell faced was enormous. She had to make the role of Momma Rose her own by delivering an interpretation that differed from Merman's while still maintaining the integrity of the original. I personally believe she carried this off with great aplomb. Although she does not have a fabulous singing voice, her numbers are each performed with tremendous style and believability. Her personality shines through each of several majour production numbers and her performance in the "11:00 song" "Rose's Turn" is sensational.  Merman was Broadway's Momma Rose, and Roz is Hollywood's Momma Rose. Both portrayals are derserving of great praise.
The rest of the cast is excellent. Mr. Malden is an appropriately frustrated and enamoured Herbie and Natalie Wood sparkles as the one and only Gypsy!  But the film really is a tour de force for Roz Russell and I predict her performance as Momma Rose will ultimately be recognized as a truly inspiring contribution to American Musical Films.
The beauty of this new DVD release is in the widescreen presentation. It allows us to see the film as it was meant to be viewed with the full stage area shots during the theatrical productions as well as the background scenery and sets that are a highlight of the entire production. The old pan and scan format just simply does not do justice to this "Broadway" classic.  Even if you already own the VHS version, I highly recommend you purchase the DVD release. It is like seeing the film again for the first time.
