'State Of Play' available on DVD September 1, 2009, and starring Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck, Helen Mirren and Rachel McAdams, was directed by Kevin Macdonald.
After a woman appears to have committed suicide by jumping into the path of a speeding D.C. subway train, married Congressman Stephan Collins, played by Affleck, is linked in a romantic relationship with the dead girl. Collins institutes the help of long time friend Cal McCaffrey, played by Crowe, to find out the truth behind the girl's death and help clear his name.

Cal goes on an all out hunt with the help of D.C. reporter Della Frye, played by McAdams, to discover the truth, which in politics is never, ever what it seems. Helen Mirren plays a wonderful supporting role as Cameron Lynn, the newspaper editor that Crowe and McAdams work for.
'State Of Play' is an edge-of-your-seat thriller. It is racy with an ever constant government conspiracy theory looming over its story line and characters.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was pleasantly surprised by the fact that I was never able to decipher the 'conspiracy' until the end. I recommend 'State Of Play' for anyone who loves a fast-paced thriller and who has ever questioned just how deeply involved politicians and players become on Capitol Hill
