I don't have many complaints about the video quality of the HD video transfer, overall it's pretty good.  The film transfer for "Undiscovered Country" could have been better, film jitter was easily noticeable.  Some of the older movies don't look too much better than upscaled DVD's, but that probably can't be helped.  In the case of Star Trek III, the HD transfer is so faithful to the original movie that one can easy see the compositing artifacts for some of the special effects, making them even more distracting.  (For example, the clipping boundaries around the Enterprise while it's entering and leaving the space station.)  That being said, it was neat being able to clearly make out fine details for movies which I'd previously only been able to see only  in standard definition.

The main menus are all the same canned 3D animation of the federation insignia, set to theme music from each movie.  Thus, they offer almost no "flavor" and are pretty boring.  Most frustrating is that each disc automatically plays a trailer for the new Star Trek movie (not even the "best" trailer), followed by another for the HD release of the original series.  I can forgive an automated advertising assault when I buy used DVD's which were probably once rental DVD's.  However, when it's something I purchased new, it feels like a big corporate slap in the face, every time I see it.  It gets old real quick--real classy, Paramount.  Minus one star just for that.
