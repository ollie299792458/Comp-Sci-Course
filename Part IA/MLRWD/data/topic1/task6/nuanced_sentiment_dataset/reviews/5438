If you're looking for one of the greatest love stories of all time, buy Gone With the Wind.  If you are one of the chosen few who don't require a happy ending to appreciate a fine story, buy this DVD now!
For anyone who likes fine French cinema, this is one of the more influential titles out there.  Case-in-point:  have you ever seen the original video to Sixpence None The Richer's "Kiss Me?"  I'm not talking about the movie soundtrack version; I'm talking about the ingenious, brilliant one which took place in France.  The race between two of the guys in the group on the bridge (forgive me for not knowing their names) is taken directly from this movie.
If you understand that there is virtue in appreciating a bitter-ending story (and with a love triangle as maddening as this, how could it be anything less?) you will consider this movie a great work of art.  To the uninitiated in the world of foreign films, this is a great first step into a fascinating world where layers and layers of symbolism will add depth to your viewing enjoyment.
