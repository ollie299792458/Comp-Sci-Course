The husband works for a special sound effect company.  The wife is a genuine psychic. She is frustrated that society no longer believes in psychic abilities, and she has someone in the police station arguing that psychics are real.  Their lives are, well, boring.

A perv kidnaps a girl, and takes her to the forest, where coincidentally the husband is recording the sound of wind.  The girl escapes the kidnapper, and hides in one of the husband's trunk.  Of course, he doesnt discover her until later, when the girl is half-dead.

So you ask, why cant this decent couple call the police?

Because, the wife wants to weave something for the police, so they can believe that psychics can help.  Amazingly, the husband goes along with the plan.  They end up suffocating the girl when trying to silence her when the police pays the psychic wife a visit.  This is the height of the movie, the rest, I wont say more.

I really resent movies that act contradictory to what they have built up the character.  If the write something and convinces the viewer that this couple is decent, Im assuming they will BE decent and do the right thing.  Of course, it's possible for people to change, but the script needs to show WHY they changed their characters.  There should be a transition, to make it believable.

Thats why I gave this 3 stars.
