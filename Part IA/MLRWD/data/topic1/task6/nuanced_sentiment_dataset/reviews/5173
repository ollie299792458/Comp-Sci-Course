No wonder this movie has made it into the classroom video collections of lazy and liberal high school history teachers.

I watched it with my son, as it was a "project" he had to complete.  Because it does not out-rightly slam Reagan as evil, I don't think leftists will even like it much.

At best it is a Hollywood soap-opera rendition of Reagan's family life.  Admittedly it IS called The Reagans ... with an "s".

Don't expect to find any clues to Reagan's convictions on leaving the Democrat Party and joining the Republicans.  Nor will you find any mention of his sincere Christian beliefs which led him to conclude that Communism, both in the USSR and in the USA, were evil.  The movie depicts him as a bumbling puppet, instead of the greatest modern day president that he was.

For a much better portrayal of the life experiences and convictions that made Reagan great, I suggest the DVD:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009IWFM4">In the Face of Evil - Reagan's War in Word and Deed</a>.
