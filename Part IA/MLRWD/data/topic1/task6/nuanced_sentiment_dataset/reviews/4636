While "The Highlander" has always been one of my favorite movies,  I was greatly disappointed by the Tenth Anniversary DVD.  The sound and picture were lacking,  making my VHS cassette a cleaner option.
Fast forward a few years,  and along comes the "immortal edition."  Promises abound about more material,  better picture and sound quality,  and Bonus Queen music.
Did the new edition deliver?
While the plot and story are the same as always,  quality of the presentation has been rather varied.  The Tenth Anniversery edition was almost painful,  so it was hard to imagine this version not being a step up.  And a step up it was.
However,  it could still be better.  The picture's not as grainy,  and the lips are actually in synch this time,  but there is grain to the picture that's not even present in VHS.  The sound is also a step up,  but it could definitely better.
Part of the lure for me was the Queen material.  The four videos seemed slapped in there (You can even hear the final notes of "The Show Must Go On,"  an unrelated peice of music,  at the beginning of "A Kind of Magic")  And the picture is not up to snuff with the other collections that contain these videos.  Of the three music tracks,  two are available on a Queen CD,  where the mixes of several songs used for "The Highlander,"  which woulda been more appropriate,  are still unavailable.
I recommend the movie itself,  but could not in good conscience promote this edition and reward such a half assed job.  The movie itself recieves 5 stars,  the quality/presentation of it barely even merits 1 star.
