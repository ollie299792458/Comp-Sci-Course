Originally entitled as "la bestia in calore" by Italian director Luigi Batzella. The story goes around fighting between Nazis and the partisan guerilla, somewhere in Italy during WWII. If you take it in terms of movie running time, this one is more of a bad action movie that includes several fighting scenes, some original to the film and others "imported" from somewhere else. Among those scenes that seem original to the movie you will get a P-47 model plane hovering the sky and lots of fake explosions (smoke bombs). When it comes to the Nazi exploitation part, the title is a bit deceptive as we don't have much of an actual prisoner camp here. An SS Lieutenant Ellen Kratsch comes to help Captain Hardinghauser and his command as they have been bitten hard by the partisan guerilla recently. Of course, Lieutenant Kratsch uses her own "methods" to identify and trap the leaders involved, and these include shooting, raping and torturing the locals. Among the secret weapon arsenal, we get a lab made Cro-Magnon guy who specializes in raping whatever is in front of him, to death. Overall on the exploitation, some not bad shots of torture, yet quite short on sex.

Technically, a good, clear image quality overall. The aspect ratio is widescreen. The feature runs for 87 minutes. Audio is in English and no subtitles are provided. As extras, you get some trailers of other b-horror and exploitation flicks.
