Lantana is a collage of a number of people's lives-- similar to movies such as "The Grand Canyon" and "Short Cuts"-- who come together when a woman disappears and murder may be involved.  But the real "mystery" may be about something else.
In general, the movie has good performances, and the observant movie viewer may recognize more than one level is going on and be struck by the emotions and psychology of characters (especially of distrust and deception especially in relationships).
The problem is that there are better examples of this type of movie ("Grand Canyon," "Short Cuts," and "Happiness" immediately come to mind).  This movie also works on particular coincidences between characters which are probably a bit more annoying than enriching.  The other movies I mention do not have that problem.
But the main problem of this movie is that it is told too linear and the result is more like an episodic melodrama, and this movie obviously was trying to be more.  It should've been more bold and remembered to cross the genre of a "mystery" which it is supposed to be doing.  It needed to start "in media res," in the middle of things, with the truly striking moment, which is right BEFORE the woman disappears.  By telling it linearly, it's an episodic melodrama, and reminds me more of many bad 70's movies, though with better acting and definitely a movie with more substance.  Sometimes linear storytelling is not the right "order" for the story and the way it builds up.
