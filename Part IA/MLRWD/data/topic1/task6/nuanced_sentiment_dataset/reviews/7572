I was the typical "casual" fan of the Foos for many years.  If they came on the radio, I never turned it off.  But, I never really sought out their music, either.  I started hearing them more and more because my 19 year old son LOVES them.  Then, I saw the roc doc "Back and Forth", on Paladia, bought "Wasting Light" (CD), and "Live from Wembley" (DVD), and I've been making up for lost time ever since (who says teenagers can't teach us anything?).

I am a big fan of stripped-down, acoustic music, so when I saw part of this DVD at a friend's house, I knew I had to have it.  This is an amazing show, on it's own, but it's really cool when you pair it with "Wembley" to see both sides of these guys in concert.  S&B is no less powerful than Wembley, but in a very different way (similar to Scorpions' Wacken and Acoustica).  If you're into the Foos (or just starting to), I highly recommend both discs.

One quick warning to those who are sensitive to swearing, or have small children in the house, Dave Grohl uses the "F" word like most people use "and" in both concerts.  It's obviously just him being very stoked, but it may disturb some folks.
