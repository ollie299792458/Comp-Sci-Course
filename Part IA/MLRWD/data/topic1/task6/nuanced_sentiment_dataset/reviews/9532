Pitch Black has its moments and it's a good rent, but the movie just has too many flaws and weaknesses for me to give it any higher than an average rating.
The good: special effects. CGI, of course (the wave of the future--cheap special effects), but quite nicely done. As another reviewer mentioned, the eclipse scene looks impressive, as does the starship crash landing and the aliens themselves. The characters are for the most part weak in this movie but there were a few exceptions. I thought the female pilot, Frye I think, was pretty interesting. Her turnabout is a little hard to swallow, but with a little effort... The addition of Muslim supporting characters was an interesting touch.
The bad: the plot is pretty weak and derivative. It's largely an Alien ripoff and not too good at stealing the best elements of the Alien films. The CGI aliens, at times impressive, almost seem to break up into pixels at other times. They should have done a little more post production work to "decomputerize" them more.
The ugly: the characters are pretty weak. You have Vin Diesel as the consummate anti-hero. Why he has this relationship with the merc, Johns, was a bit confusing for me. The pilot, Frye, is a bit more believable than the other characters as mentioned above. The ending. I won't blow it for you, but was "the big sacrifice" really necessary to the plot? I kind of thought it was superfluous.
The verdict: thumbs sideways. This was an okay movie and good escapist entertainment. Just don't expect the next Alien franchise out of this one.
