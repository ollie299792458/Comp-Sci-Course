I bought the number ones dvd and the dangerous dvd as well as this dvd. Many of the videos are the same on all 3 disc however the long version of black or white on the number ones disc i beleive and the long version to "The Way You Make Me Feel is on the number ones dvd. Also the number ones goes up to 2000 with "You Rock My World" while History II goes up to 1991. You do get dirty diana on the number ones but the short version to Smooth Criminal on it. The long version to smooth criminal is  on this dvd. Many of the same videos from the 80's are on History I and II dvds which is why didnt get History I. I do however have the History Book I album. The volume II dvd also has the incomplete edited version to They dont care about us which I was disappointed in. However in the book I cd it is unedited which came out before the controversial part of the video. The video is longer also. I wish they would have put You Are Not Alone and Speed Demon on the disc. Speed Demon was animated with a rabbit with Mike on a motorcycle while Leave Me Alone had an amusement park ride Mike was riding in and he got up and the miniature roller coaster built on him fell apart. Really cool.I was expecting those songs to be on the History cd as well. Thats one of the greatest songs ever that i grew up with. The dangerous cd is one of the best because it has one repeatitive songs on it because its the whole dangeous album. The songs on it arent on any of the other dvds expect remember the time which is a great video with Eddie Murphy Emon and Magic Johnson. I love In the Closet with Niomi Campbell its about my favorite song on dangerous.
