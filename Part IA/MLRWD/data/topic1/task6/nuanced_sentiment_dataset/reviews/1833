I'm a huge fan of Luc Besson. From the "Last Battle" days. On top of that, Eric Serra is one of the best contemporary film musician. So? I always wanted to have this movie as finest DVD format. I just can't believe how terribly some DVD's can go in terms of the picture quality. This one has the lowest video quality that I ever saw on DVD medium. Well, except a few from Central Park Media or Chinatown bootlegs maybe. No extra stuff I can understand since it is old one already. However, why buy DVD not for the better picture first of all? On a computer monitor, it's even worse. It reaches a rediculous level. It says "Wide Screen", but in fact this one has "Short Screen". Somebody should do something about it. There are too many wrong Wide Screen movies. Now I don't believe the specs anymore. By the way, no choice of full screen either. Can you believe it? You have to. The "bitrate" is lowest one I found so far. No wonder why the picture is so poor. I can make this quality of Disc with a decent digital camcorder these days. Sort of. I'll give the film itself 10 stars on 5 scale, but for the DVD disc 1 star is too many already. This is one of the VHS quality DVD.
