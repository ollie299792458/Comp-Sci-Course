As one who regards Bob Clark's original Black Christmas as THE scariest, and one of the best horror films of all time, I can happily say that this is a remake that never should have been contemplated, never the less filmed. Now that I've got that off my chest, I can add that the remake is actually fun to watch, with it's own creepiness and a good dose of black humor and style. Written, directed and produced by the X-Files and Millenium team of Morgan and Wong, this film at least tries to have it's own identity and doen't take the subject matter too seriously (please take note Rob Zombie!) The result is uneven, and ultimately as bad as it is good, which is a whole lot better than most recent remakes and 'reimaginings' can boast. Delving into the back-story of Billy and Agnes was, I suppose, one of the main reasons to remake the film, though filmmakers need to remember it is the mystery of characters like Billy and Michael Myers that go a long way to making them so horrifying. The film though, does deliver some good scares. Being a modern horror film, the scenes of violence are much more overstated than the almost bloodless original(the obsession with eyeball gouging and eating and the 'angel biscuits' -"they taste like chicken 'cause they are chicken") and I have heard the studio upped some of the gore content before the final cut. Keep in mind this studio interference while viewing the awful ending, then watch the alternate endings and try to guess which was the filmmaker's original intent.
  But despite it's many faults, the remake ,or reimagining (whatever they are calling them these days) of Black Christmas is worth watching if you are a fan of this sort of film. And it is different enough from the much superior original to not have the fun spoiled by constant comparisons. Enjoy!
