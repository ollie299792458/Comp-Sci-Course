I left this film this film thinking what the heck just happened and what the heck did I just watch. As if using every hollywood cliche for relationship comedy wasn't already bad enough, this movie just kept going from bad to worse. For starters why does everyone have to use the stereotype that men are bad communicators and that they don't tell their significant other anything or that all men are rotten cheating scumbags, etc? These are just a few of the many cliches that they highlight in this film and the audience spots them immediately as paper thin plot devices to further a storyline which wasn't great to begin with. And to be honest, bad plot devices can be overlooked if there is a strong plot to back them up, but there are so many subplots and dangling threads that you just want to flush this one down the toilet.

From start to finish very little of this movie truly makes sense, probably because there's so much filler here just to make the 111 minutes. Don't even bother finishing this one either because the ending will leave you completely unsatisfied. The movie closes with the "dilemma" left completely unresolved and women portrayed as cheating whores while forgetting that the male was also a cheat. So yes, don't bother watching this film.
