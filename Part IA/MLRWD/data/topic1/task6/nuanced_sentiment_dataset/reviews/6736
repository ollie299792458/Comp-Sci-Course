I caught this movie on cable a couple of weeks ago, and it really met my expectations of my hating it with a passion!  I really cannot stand these movies.  It's not even good comedy.  It's more embarassing than anything.  These movies have little or no plotlines, overdone characters, and just plain no point.  This is just one in a long line of bad movies like Baby Boy, How to be a Player, Kingdom Come, and that one w/Taye Diggs and Sanaa Lathan.  
First let me echo other posters when I say that Gabrielle's acting was way over the top.  She could have played evil without seeming cartoonish.  She seemed to be trying to hard to convince the audience that she was the evil sister.  I also have trouble believing that these grown women would allow themselves to be controlled by her the way that they were.  
Nothing about the plot was convincing.  From them getting together, to them falling in love, to the wack ending.  And what the husbands do to keep Ray away from Eva is so much more serious than the comedic spin they tried to place on it.  
Just a pointless movie.
