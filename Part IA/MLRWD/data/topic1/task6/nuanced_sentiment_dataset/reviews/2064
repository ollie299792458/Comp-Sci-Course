Bend it like Beckham has been explained by alot of the other reviewers, so i dont wannt to go to much into the name, but im going to start abit with David Beckham. Becks is our most known sports person. He is married to Posh Spice, who he is usally in the tabloids with under there name 'Posh and Becks' and is also seen in the sexiest men awards and polls that seem to happen every week. He is also somebody who at the World Cup 98 got send off to our rivals Argentina, and with him being a major part of our team, we just couldnt cope with just 10 men, and we latter lost on penalties 5-4.
This caused many tabloids to hate him, diss him, and some even tried to kidnap his son brooklyn. But the way he reacted to this, showing so much strengh made everybody love him, and has now become the nations favourite father and husband. He is so big in Europe and football(not soccer) countrys that recently people who are not even from England tried to kidnap his family, now with another son Romeo, and hold them for ransom. this was stoped by a taloid paper who was undercover on the operation, and the people have recently be sentenced.
This is only a small part of Becks history. He is a nations hero, and this film was amde during the world cup 2002, when beckham and England would later face Argentina, beating them 1-0, from a goal which Becks scored. So with this name on the film, it was bound to sell tickets, but it deserved it on its own merits to.
This is more of a description of becks ofcourse, but i hope it helps you know more about him, and his strange and very interesting story, and will let you be abit more opened minded about the film which ive heard some are unsure about as the title is unfamilar.
Oh and 'Bend it Like Beckham' Is about the way he can kick the ball, once scoring from the half way line, one of the very few to ever do it, and the way he scores free kicks, making him the best free kick take in the world.
