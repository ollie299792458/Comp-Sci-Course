I really wanted to like this movie but it got off on the wrong foot when I soon realized that the "Black Death" title was VERY deceiving. This movie is NOT about the Black Death. Yes, it is set in 1348 when the plague was getting going but the plague itself is just a backdrop. The real story here is about the Church and how it used its power to force people into line using savage mercenaries who would murder you without remorse to "save you". So it is a movie about the excesses of "religion" and "control" more than anything else.

The acting is not bad, the story ok, and overall I would rate this 3 stars but I had to take one star off for having a title that is just blatant false advertising. A better title would have been "In The Name of God" or something like that.

I would not buy this movie (but it was ok as a rental).

If you were waiting for the first good movie dealing with the Black Death which killed 1/3 of all Europeans in the mid 14th century, then you'll just have to keep waiting....
