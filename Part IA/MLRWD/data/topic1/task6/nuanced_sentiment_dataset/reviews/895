I think Disney should be ashamed of themselves. They took what could have been a beautiful, inspiring film and made it so much about the "circle of life" that my children were covering their eyes throughout the film and crying. My daughter even had to leave the room because she was so distraught. I understand that there is a learning process about a wild animal's life, but not in a G rated Disney film. We thought we were sitting down to watch an awe inspiring film about our Earth and we ended up spending time afterwards consoling our kids.

Why did they need to include the cheetah scene when he hunts and kills the baby animal or the scene where the baby elephant is hunted and eaten alive by the lions? Not to mention the polar bear dying a slow death. Really Disney??? G rated?

The first hunting scene I said,"Quick! Quick! Fast forward this!" My husband replied,"It's a G-rated Disney film do you really think they are going to show the baby antelope getting caught?" Well, they did.

This could have been a film that inspired children to take care of our planet not be in tears hating "those bad mean animals." Disney- you could have done better- much better.
