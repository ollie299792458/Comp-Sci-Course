It's hard to imagine this is the same person behind "The Beyond" and "Zombi." Heck, even "The Psychic" (pretty rare film to dig up) was better than this garbage. This is one of the more boring Italian horror films I have in my collection. The gore was laughable and not even in a goofy/good kind of way, just atrociously stupid. The young boy, I hope, was banned from the screen actor's guild, and the voice actor who dubbed his parts should have been exiled from all of civilization. Wow. If you'd like to watch a series of unrelated random events with a bit of unexplainable gore, 1 hour of nothing, and a pointless ending with one of the more ham-handed performances by an evil, undead villain, by all means knock yourselves out. The only good thing I will say about this film is that the atmosphere is very Italian gothic, and was effective (reason why I give it 2 stars). Anyway, Fulci should have stuck with his mystery movies and neanderthal gory themes, which he's very good at in moderation. The minute he tried to rip off aspects of the Shining and the Changeling, he lost the tiny bit credibility he may have still had. Avoid this gutter snipe, and move on to his better films such as those I mentioned above.
