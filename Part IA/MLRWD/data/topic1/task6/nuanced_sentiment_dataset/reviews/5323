A convincing lead actor, a wonderful premise and investigative situations that grasp at the intelligence of the viewer. "Lie To Me" is a series that offers top notch viewing entertainment for those looking for something new and thought-provoking in a network television series.

It's exciting and refreshing to see a crime drama series that utilizes human interaction as opposed to crime lab analysis, weapons/ammunitions analysis, DNA analysis or criminal mind profiling to solve a case. The language of the body and facial experessions are universal. Regardless of nationality, ethnicity, gender, social status or religion, every body and face reacts to inward and outward emotional stimuli similarly. The agents in this series expose not so much the Lie causing the body or facial reflex, but the Why behind the Lie Or Truth.

Watch an episode and you'll never Lie in the same way. But you will Lie!

Here's just one tidbit from the episode I watched that caused me to stop and ponder the notion:
It is a myth that someone giving testimony is always lying if they break eye contact and turn away from the questioner. Actually, a person Lying will maintain eye contact to see if the person they're Lying to believes the Lie.
