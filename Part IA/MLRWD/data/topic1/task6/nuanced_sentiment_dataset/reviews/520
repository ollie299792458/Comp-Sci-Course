Okay, I'll start off by saying that this is seriously one of the loveliest and most visually compelling animated movies I've ever seen. The animation and the backgrounds are just stunning to look at, the English dub voices are decent, and the premise of the plot itself has a lot of promise.

For me, though, the story falls apart - and not because of its supposed lack of "originality", which by the way I disagree with - sure, Origins deals with nature and eco-friendly themes the way many other anime films have, but I think it does so in a way of its own that sets it apart from other works. Seriously, this could have been good.

Where it fell apart for me was in the characters and pacing. Agito, Toola, the villain, etc. - they were all just flat-out uninteresting, and no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't feel any empathy for any of them. The relationship between Agito and Toola was particularly irritating. One could count the number of their interactions, all of which are brief, on one hand; yet as soon as Toola goes traipsing off, he's suddenly throwing himself all over creation and his dialogue for the rest of the movie consists of nothing but anguished howls of "TOOOOOOO-LAAAAAAAAA!!" Toola herself is also kind of obnoxious. She's pretty, frail-looking, and has a mysterious and powerful necklace which only she can use - and that's about it. Aside from that she's just useless and whiny.

I'm actually surprised that the movie everyone is citing as having been the major influence for Origins is Miyazaki's Nausicaa. I can see some influence there, all right, but plot-wise and character-wise, it seems to me that Origins draws much more influence from another Miyazaki work - Castle in the Sky, which was far more complex and thought-provoking than Origins. Origins had a good concept and beautiful presentation, but the rest of it doesn't live up to these things.
