I was so pumped for this movie, seeing that I am an x-men freak. Well I think I set my standards too high because when I left the movies I really disappointed. Number one, what happend to nightcrawler? He sort of just disappeared which really sucked because he was my favorite character. And then Scott dies, or at least I think he did. Whatever, he wasn't in the movie for more than five mintues. And then they kind of made it a lot about Jean Grey which is kind of idiotic because it really isn't about her at all and it annoyed the crap out of me. And I didn't expect the same polt of the comic book but I kind of expected the same great polt the other two movies had. Oh and another thing, Logan isn't that loving! Okay don't follow the comic book but at least get some of the character's personalities right. All in all I give this three and a half stars because even though I was disappointrf with it some of the parts I liked it and it was intense and very sad at times too. I just wished they didn't totally head in a different direction with this movie or it would have be so much better. My favorite character is probably the beast played by kelsey grammer becauce that's probably one of the few characters played exactly right. Go see it if you don't mind be a compeletly different polt and disappoitning scences and if you're not a freak about it following the comic book and just wanna see some good action.
