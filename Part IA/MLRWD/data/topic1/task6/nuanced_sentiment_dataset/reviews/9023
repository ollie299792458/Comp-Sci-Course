I'll admit it, I saw this movie before watching the American version, BUT I did see them within the same weekend, so I have a fairly decent conception of both. It helps that my friends and I spent hours discussing the two movies after watching The Ring.
Ringu and The Ring are scary for entirely different reasons. To someone like me, who rarely enjoys horror/suspense flicks, I found myself enjoying both, though I did prefer Ringu's subtle, yet terrifying, building tension to the Hollywood frights of The Ring.
As has been stated in previous reviews, Ringu relies on the fear of the unknown. What aren't they telling us? What horrible truth is lurking just out of sight, around the corner, or just seven days from now? The entire movie is a quiet, creeping kind of horror. It's lack of bright colors and soundtrack of mood music allow the viewer to focus of the events and drag the viewer deep into the story as we try to unravel the mystery on our own, along with the characters.
Be warned, there ARE some cultural perculiarities that, if one has little to no knowledge of Japanese culture, may be confusing (such as the figure in the video with the white cloth over their head). However, these are few in number and in no way detract from the story in any way. On the contrary, considering the subtle, questing air of the entire film, the unfamiliar elements only add to unsettling experiance.
If you're a diehard fan of Hollywood horrow flicks with their FX and straight-forward storylines, this may not be the movie for you, though you should find The Ring a thoroughly enjoyable movie. However, if you want to try a different perspective on the horror genre, or are already a fan of Japanese film, this is definately a must see. 
A story of a terrible legacy that will haunt you for days, or, if you're like me, months... 
As a side note, if you enjoy either movie, but find yourself with too many unanswered questions, buy the book the inspired them all: "Ring" by Koji Suzuki.
