...before some hipster tried to convince you it was one of the greatest films of all time - it just isn't that great.  Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining and I was engaged from beginning to end, but one of the best film experiences I've ever had it ain't.

You spend the complete 2+ hours with the barely likeable persona of Jack Nicholson's role, only to discover that the character you should've been empathizing with the whole time has barely been developed by the end of movie.  The twist at the end is not nearly enough to support the weight of a movie this long, this film easily could have been 30 minutes shorter.  Sometimes I feel Polanski's ego requires his films to reach that magical 120 min threshold come rain or shine, like he needs viewers to make a "commitment" to watching his films.  I really like most of his films but they do tend to contain lots of dead air.

Also, the so-called connection to the title - Chinatown, is a joke and feels tacked on.  All in all, this is definitely a decent movie that's worth seeing, just enter with an open mind and disregard the associated hype.
