Can someone please pull the plug on these romantic comedy movies? I am really getting sick and tired of my wife making me watch the same crap over and over again.

Some of them actually aren't too bad (Princess Bride, Ever After, Ghost etc etc etc) but some of them really are. Made of Honor is definitely a pass on. While there are a lot of decent things about this movie the bad far outweights the good. There is actually good acting and some laughs.

The storyline is very weak and extremly predictable. The storeline is also very unrealistic. No man who is addicted to having sex with a big bosumed blond each night is ever going to be a "friend" with an attractive woman. If the man is addicted to sex he's going to have sex with anyone. I find it strange that the main male character (whose name I've forgotten already) hasn't contracted a sexually transmitted disease. I also find it interesting that there are numerous beautiful large breasted women who are ready to go to bed with a 40ish single male slut on the first date. I admit that the majority of America doesn't wait for marriage to partake of sex but I'm sure most women just don't hop into bed with a new guy each night.

This movie is not as raunchy as some of the R rated ones out there but it still pretty bad with all it's sex talk and scenes and the movie isn't nearly charming enough to make this movie stand out to be anything more than it is. A poorly done predictable sex comedy desguised as a romantic comedy.
