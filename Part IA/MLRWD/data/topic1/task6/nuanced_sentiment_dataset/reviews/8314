When I first saw this movie, i hated it. I was a young boy and realised it didn't live up to my expectations. Until I realised why. All I wanted, as a "so-called alien fan", was another modified version of the two previous films. The first one, of course was really inventive, but all Cameron did for the second film was to multiply the exciting aspects of the first one : more guns, more aliens, plus a REALLY big one at the end to surprise us all ( as a 9 year-old i really enjoyed it) and more action. Its exactly like every sequel: MORE MORE MORE, but nothing new or nothing to say  ( Indiana Jones 2, Star Wars 2, The Mummy Returns, Back to the Future 2 and so on). And then came the third one. The one that most Alien fans hated. WHY? Because its not about aliens anymore. That's why. Because its not a modified version of the others. There are no guns, no big queen, no more cool marines to care about, no more spectacular action sequences, but only one quick and shy alien. At last, we see something new : A whole movie about Ripley. Her character is the center of the storyline. This movie isn't 'bout aliens, its all bout Ripley. Now we can see what was skipped at the end of the second film : her reaction after the 2 previous experiences, what is left of her life,and how she sees the future. It's more of a psychological drama than a simple action flick. And in the end, i must say that i first hated the conclusion. I didn't understood why. And it came to me that this is the only way it could end. Ripley's death. No one's waiting for her on earth and the ones she loved are all dead. There is nothing left for her. So she decide to die with the creature that ruined her life. They are somehow related and they die together ( with the queen i mean). I think its a really profound ending. But that's just an opinion.
