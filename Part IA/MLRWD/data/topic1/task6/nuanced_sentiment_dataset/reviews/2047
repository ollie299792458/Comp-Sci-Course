In the liner notes of Traffic, the director states that his goal was to create a simple picture of the drug trade, not to make a political statement about who was winning.  I think he succeeded masterfully.
The one thing that I really enjoyed was the depiction of Law Enforcement, both the Mexican authorities and the Americans.  Benicio Del Toro was wonderful (duh, he won an Oscar) as a mostly-good Mexican cop.  His scene in the pool with the 2 G-men is borderline hilarious.  Don Cheadle and Miguel Ferrer also gave great performances, as the most direct arguments for and against the drug war.
The plight of the Douglas character's family was a wonderfully interesting story as well, from permissiveness and hypocrisy of adults, to the slow spiral into addiction and acceptance by youth.  Really a good story.
The one thing I thought was far-fetched was the final press conference involving Michael Douglas's character--in the history of government, how many people have ever done that?--but that's my only complaint.  Catherine Zeta-Jones's character is involved in a Cheech & Chong "Up in Smoke" moment as well, but that's certainly forgiveable.
All in all, this is a fantastic film that gives a very even-handed view of the "War on Drugs."
