I came here to order another DVD as I have my first I kept from redbox... and its clean and I know how to look for that, but it hesitates and stops then skips ahead. So I will order it again. I am 53 yrs old and my father passed in 2008. He was and probably still is a Marine in heart wherever he is... heaven and in peace. I read some of the reviews. I can see why we can't elect a good president or get away from the very poor educators and the lack of understanding is here in the population of America. Ignorant weak idiot people.
OK... I said where I am coming from... my father was trained at Pendleton I was born nearby and lived on base, and my Grandson 3 now was born on base... when the hell are you people going to be smart before you talk? Know what you are saying? Sure this is a little or a lot hollywood... but the principle, do you know what principles are anymore? The principle is true! These men and women will go this far and do the beyond to achieve. They don't quit. They don't run away... unlike other ground forces in the military.
So... Dad was of the first battalon- first Marines in Korea... nobody knows what that means right? Well look uo WWII in the Pacific or the CHOSIN RESEVOIR in KOREA thousands went in a few hundred came out.
The film is hollywood the 'spirit' of the USMC is absolutely correct and spot on.
So you fat popcorn self-indulging aholes here in American with your less than clever false posturing opinions... remember WHY you are safe - those guys - the ones portrayed are REAL and they die so you can live. Wake UP America!
