This is a visually attractive adaptation of the first half of Galsworthy's "Forsyte Saga", but it has nowhere near the depth and impact of the original (1969) TV series.  Most of the actors in this series do a fine job, the one glaring exception is the blank spot on the screen where Irene is supposed to be.  Also, too much has been made of Damian Lewis's "Soames"--he mumbles his lines through clenched teeth and portrays his character as evil-incarnate.  Soames is much more complex (and better-spoken) than that!
Most of the secondary characters, although well-acted, are not well-developed.  The wonderful idiosyncrasies of the extended Forsyte clan, particularly the aunts and uncles, are ignored in this version.  The interior sets look beautiful, but, although I'm no expert, they don't appear "Victorian" to me.  The cinematography is generally good except for the irritating and sophomoric use of focus shifts to film conversations.
Finally, it should be noted that this DVD is only the first half of the series.  Presumably, they are filming the second half and it will eventually be out on DVD for approximately the same price.  The recently released 1969 version, which includes the entire series, thus will hardly cost any more and is incomparably better.
