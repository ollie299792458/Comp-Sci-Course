The plot is described elsewhere so I'll just weigh in like this...
The overall good production values, an interesting overarching story, moments of brutal honesty and the intentions of the film make it worth the rental.  The film is not great. The story is belabored by too many subplots and incidental characters. The juxtaposition between humor and drama is clumsy, wrecking the impact of both. The lead actor is serviceable (no pun intended), but lacks the ability to add depth or nuance to the character. (although it appears many here like the shallow notion that by virtue of only ones beauty, one might engage profound change in another.) The lead's transition from innocent to prostitute, and the drama of being with someone in the descent of drug addiction to the charming closeted hollywood star (well played by Michael Medico) who pays for sex, and adds the cliche taboo affair element, feels contrived is played incidentally and becomes unbelievable. The lead offers his character nothing more than emotive beauty, something the closeted actor would have bought many times before without incident.
