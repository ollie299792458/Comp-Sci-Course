I have to admit that I'm a bit biased, because KISS is my all-time  favorite supergoup heroes!  And this is the movie that could have been made  back at their height in popularity back in the 70s.  In fact, the movie is  so well done, it feels just like it was made in the 70s...which is the  effect the producers were shooting for, I believe!  Even though I'm a bit  biased FOR KISS, I must say that this movie should even appeal (and did  appeal to a friend of mine) to those who aren't KISS fans.  In fact we  really don't even see KISS until the end-concert song.  It's a movie that  can be treasured by anyone who wants to see a good, basic story about the  trials, the tribulations, the fun times, the innocence about striving for  your dreams regardless of what other people think.  The movie is  hilarious...and KISS takes no-holds-barred punches to themselves in all  good humour.  I now own the video of this, and hopefully will have a DVD  player soon to get the full-version, with directors cuts and all.  This is  a fun movie you can share with all your friends for a good, light-hearted  entertaining time.  And I don't think a one of them will regret that they  were entertained by a movie made with a big KISS. :-)
