The first thing that I thought to myself as I started this movie was "is this Tenchi?" Tenchi is known for it's humor, action, and non-stop risque remarks, and that's what I had expected when I got this film. What I had found was a love story, a bit disturbing, a bit other-world like, but in the end worth the time of watching. Tenchi is taken to a parallel world by a strange woman called Haruna. She is not a goddess, nor a sorceress, and never shows any signs of special magic power (except for her ability to form an alternate world). She is just like Ryoko or Ayeka in most aspects, which makes it a bit more competitive. Ryoko and Ayeka also are on different grounds in this movie, ditching their previous rivalry so they can team up in search of Tenchi. Instead of the final confrontation between Ryoko, Ayeka, and Haruna being a big epic battle over Tenchi like always, there is no fighting or bloodshed and their hearts do the battling. This movie has a strange feel about it, using bizarre angles and shady lighting. The music is unique, using pianos and accordians in an Italian romance style instead of the sugar-coated, hyper j-pop which was used in the previous Tenchi movies and most other animes. The movie does a fair amount of suffuring at the end, ending too soon and making a PAINFULLY obvious point at who Tenchi really is in love with. While not as stellar as previous Tenchi movies, this film stacks up and is worth a view.
