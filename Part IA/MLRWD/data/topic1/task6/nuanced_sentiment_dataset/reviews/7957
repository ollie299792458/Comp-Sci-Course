I wanted to give this show 2 stars. My wife wants to give it 4. So we compromised on 3--with the result that neither one of us is happy. ;)

Simply put, Covert Affairs is a glamor show, not the serious spy show that a lot of people make it out to be. There's a lot of inaccuracies--the sort you would expect from Hollywood, but those aren't the most serious flaws.

Those come in the form of the awkard casting/acting. Simply put, Piper Perabo, while hot, comes across as much too sweet to carry off the role of a kick-a$$ CIA officer. She acts like an annoying little sister when paired with the male agents, and her vaunted abilities are almost never on full display. Worse still is the chemistry or lack thereof between the two bosses, who are married to each other(once again, wouldn't happen in real life.) And finally the actor who plays Annie Walker's boyfriend, a supposedly tough, rugged loner who comes across as sensitive, emotional, and fragile. My wife says he was hot, of course I don't know anything about that.

I suppose the show has some redeeming aspects, but it's really, really, really not a guy show. Be warned.
