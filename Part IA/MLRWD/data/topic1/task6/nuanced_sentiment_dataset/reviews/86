To be nice, 21 Grams is an interesting movie.  It started off very slow and incoherent, but as the movie progressed, the plotline unfolded to a meaningful level.

The story is very emotional, and the acting is pretty good.  Unfortunately, the method of separating the scenes in non-linear format just didn't work.  It made the movie seem very-choppy, and just didn't flow.  I liked it in the sense that I was using my mind to figure out where each segment fit chronologically, but there was no point in doing this otherwise.

The movie has some very deep, interesting scenes to it.  For example, when her sister flicks her off in the pool this is the same moment when her family is killed.  Very interesting.  I liked this component of the movie.

The few complex scenes and potential excellent-story, just don't make up for the non-fluent, choppy movie.  I was expecting something much better.  I feel like this director was trying to be very "deep," and contrived to make this movie very artsy.  It just didn't work.  I like more naturally flowing stories.
