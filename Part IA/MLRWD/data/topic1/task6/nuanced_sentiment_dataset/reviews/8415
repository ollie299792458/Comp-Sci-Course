The delightful thing about Gilmore Girls is that it relies on nothing but its own merits to be positively the best show on television.  With incredibly loveable characters whose relationships make you long to live in a small town, Gilmore Girls takes you to a realistic world that could only exist in your fondest dreams.  It's plots and characterization rival any of the "best" on television, and its charming wit brings to mind the word play and subtlety of a Jane Austen novel.  There is never a dull moment when you are watching the diaglogue-driven lives of two of the most interesting and eccentric women on TV.  The mother-daughter relationship between Lorelai and Rory may not be typical, but every mother and daughter certainly wishes it were.  The dynamic of the town is at the same time frantic and refreshing, all of the unique characters blending to make an incredible ensemble.  The acting is superb, never missing a beat and is the backbone of what makes this show amazing.  If you delight in dialogue and characters that make you think, feel, and laugh yourself silly--then this is the dvd collection for you.
