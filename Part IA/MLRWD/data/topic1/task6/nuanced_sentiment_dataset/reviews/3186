In this film, Bruce Willis plays David, a man who's less than satisfied with his current life situation, but can't understand why.  As a result of a train wreck that he remarkably emerges from completely unscathed, he meets Elijah, played by Samuel Jackson, a man with a congenital disease that makes his bones extremely brittle and has led a very difficult life as a result.

Elijah has been an avid comic book reader for most of his life, and proposes an unusual theory to David.  What if comic books were exaggerations of actual events?  What if there were people that are more than ordinary and don't even know it?  Elijah, who is on one extreme of the spectrum, is very weak and frail, which makes it very noticeable when compared to ordinary people.  He believes that there are people at the other end of the spectrum that can't be hurt and don't get sick, and that David is such a person.  Elijah supposes that David is a modern hero, and that the reason he feels unsatisfied and empty is that he is not living his life to his potential by seeking out evil and stopping it.

This is the type of movie that revitalizes hope in mankind.  Maybe there really are extraordinary people among us that are genuinely good at heart and strive to help others.

As M. Night Shayamalan tends to do, the ending has a bit of a twist.  While I won't divulge details, I will say that it isn't a necessarily happy ending.  Some people don't like it; personally, I find the ending very moving and satisfying, and could not imagine an ending that fit better into the storyline.
