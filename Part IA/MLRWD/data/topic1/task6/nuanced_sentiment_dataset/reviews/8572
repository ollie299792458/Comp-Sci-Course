The success of the immensly popular kids show "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" lead, of course, to a live-action movie. Obviuosly most of theater flockers would be the millions of saturday morning kiddies who love  the cartoon, but the producers didn't want to forget those whose support of  the original grittier version of TMNT (in the b&w comix) that spawned  the toys and the cartoon in the 1st place. So they decided to mesh the two.  (Aside from new characters created exclusively for the film) only  characters from the original comix were used: the TMNT, Shredder, April,  Casey, Splinter. No Krang, Technodrome, Dimension X, Rocksteady & Bebop  or footbots. (However April is still a reporter though.) But it was done in  the style of the cartoon; lots of joking around, lots of pizza munching and  even multi-colored bandanas and pupils were given to the turtles. But none of  it is done to the point where a fan of the comix couldn't stand it,  actually most of it is quite funny. The plot was even based upon the  original comix following TMNT vol. 1 #1, Raphael #1 (loosely), Leonardo #1  (very loosely), TMNT #10, 11 and 19-21 (Return to New York). Of course some  editing is done to adapt all of these comix into a 100m film and I must say it's done quite well, still us true TMNT fans await a cartoon or film adaptation based ONLY upon the original comix, but hey this is good too.  Also, Jim Henson's Turtle costumes were wonderful.
