I give 'The Fog' remake 3 stars based on one star for the acting, which wasn't bad from Welling, Grace, and Blair, one star of great special effects, and one star for being geniunely scary. It lost 2 stars because they don't explain what the Fog is all about in this version, and the other star is for creating that stupid storyline about Grace being one of the lepers incarnated 100 years later, and for the lose of Nancy's character in the original. In the original the story goes like this... the 6 (not 4) founders of Antonio Bay decided to murder all the lepers that particular night because they new that Fog Bank would role in and force the Leper ship to crash, burn, and sink. In the remake there is no explanation for the Fog. Also Jamie Lee Curtis' character is a passerby, not the maincharacter of the film; the remake makes the same character, played by Maggie Grace the central figure. Selma Blair got cheated out of that great sequence where she is trapped in the Lighthouse seeing the FOG rolling in and she has no where to go but up. Instead she gets rammed by a truck...granted it was startly, but not as spooky. Overall it was creepy. I especialy enjoyed seeing the updated methods of death imposed on the vistims...the lil boys aunt, the weather man, and the priest. But i really enjoyed was the scene where the Disk Jockie's lil boy was running franticaly from the FOG! Not as good as the Remakes of 'Dawn of the Dead' or 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and 'House of Wax', but better than 'Amittyville Horror'.
