Yes, another Avatar the Last Airbender review, but this one I believe will show who will and will not like this, and why. I was very slow to like this show myself. When I would catch it on television I dismissed it as another kid's show, but as it was on cable, a lot, I began to watch it more and more. Beneath what looks like a child's show is a pretty deep story with great character development. I am a big action/fantasy fan from hard sci-fi to Harry Potter, so naturally a story like this would appeal to me. Still, this may not appeal to all fantasy fans. After showing this to several friends and family members I realized if you don't like action, and you don't have much of an inner child, The Last Airbender will not appeal to you. If you do have the above qualities, though, you are in for a treat.

This series has wonderfully animated action, realistic dialogue and character development, and is a great way to convey more eastern philosophies and general moral lessons to kids. None of this, though, is done in a heavy handed or preachy manner. The show is fun, and to contain and teach all that it does is quite an accomplishment. I put this series as one of my top five animated shows of all time. Whether it's for a young person or a young person at heart it's well worth it.
