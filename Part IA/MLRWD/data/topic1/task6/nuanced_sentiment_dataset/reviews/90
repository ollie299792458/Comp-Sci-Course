I remember seeing this movie as a kid and enjoying it probably because it was science fiction. I do remember thinking the ending was a huge disappointment and in that respect the movie didn't change for me.

Now, as an adult (and I use the term loosely) I found this movie to be wanting in so many areas it is hard to keep track of them all. Any kid under 8 may enjoy it (anyone over that age will be disappointed by the special effects) and adults who remember this movie may like it for nostalgia's sake.

I'll skip over the special effects - a few scenes are well done, but on the whole they leave you with more questions and distract you from an already lacking story to be annoying.

As for the movie itself, it tries to do too much in too short a time - I can see this movie as a re-imagined mini-series, however. (The story has potential to be compelling and even inspirational.) However, the characters lack development, the story is rushed and the dialog leaves you asking yourself, "Now where did that come from?" on more than one occasion. The actors either over-act their parts or go through the motions and seem to be waiting for scene to end. Even the robots appear to over act.

Pick up this movie for nostalgia's sake, but don't watch it. Your memories will be much better than the real thing. Trust me.
