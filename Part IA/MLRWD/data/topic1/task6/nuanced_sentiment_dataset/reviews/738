Like previous reviewers, I was under-whelmed by the program. There were aspects of the show I enjoyed, such as beautiful images of the countryside and some interesting food. Although this is not a "follow these steps/America's test kitchen" type of show, one can gain an insight into the cuisine of various regions of Spain. I also like Mark Bitman, who is one of the more intelligent and thoughtful commentators on food working today in the US. Claudia Bassols does not come across as the brightest bulb in the box, but she is at least decorative.

What pretty much ruined the experience for me were Paltrow and Batali. There are hours and hours of inane and self-absorbed conversation between these two. Paltrow makes comments such as "if it's progressing it's art" and harps on about her beliefs about food, in particular her opposition to commercially produced food. These are the inanities of someone too rich and self-absorbed to realize how much poverty and hunger there is an in the world. I also personally found the sight of the enormously overweight Batali, in pink shorts and shoes, stuffing yet more food into himself unappetizing.
