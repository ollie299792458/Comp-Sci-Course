Just finished watching the blu-ray "screwhead" release of AOD. Quite a contrast to the two  terrible DVD versions of this movie I owned previously.

Impressions (disclaimer: I am not an expert at evaluating transfers to HD format):

The majority of the HD digital transfer looks excellent. Clean, sharp, crisp contrast and color. Some defects still present here and there -- most notable is something smudging the screen in a couple places shortly after Ash falls into the 13th century. On a few scenes, the video quality takes a strikingly sudden turn for the WORSE -- for example, looking down into the pit at Ash after he falls in (thankfully only lasts a few seconds). I also noticed that the rear projection scenes (used extensively in the final battle) look extremely pixilated and grainy.

Sound was very good throughout on my 7:2 surround system.

Special Features consist of a featurette on the making of the Deadite Army (worthwhile) and the Original Ending (presented in a very low definition, grainy letterboxed format). Haven't dug into the disc yet for Easter Eggs (if there are any).

Overall, I give it an 8 out of 10. Best presentation of this movie I've seen yet and maybe as good as it gets.
