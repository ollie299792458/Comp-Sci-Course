This film produced by Luc Besson is a throwback to LA FEMME NIKITA and LEON THE PROFESSIONAL with influences from De Palma's MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE and SCARFACE. Visually this film is close to the slick flash visuals of Tony Scott films such as MAN ON FIRE. The relationship between Zoe Saldana and her painter boyfriend is similiar to Nikita's boyfriend in LA FEMME NIKITA. The early scenes with a young Zoe seeing her parents murdered is straight out of LEON. My favourite set-piece was the early prison assassination sequence as Zoe manouevre's herself through the air-conditioning shaft which was reminiscent of Tom Cruise manouevering through the shaft in the CIA building in MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE. The way Zoe assassinates the target in prison and works her way back to her prison cell without anyone realising is reminiscent of good/quality spy and assassin films. The climax of the film where Zoe infiltrated the cartels mansion for a full-blown shoot-out and killing of the head of the cartel is classic SCARFACE. It's not as great as LA FEMME NIKITA and LEON but has inspired set-pieces and Zoe Saldana handles the fights and over-the-top weaponry with great convincing skill. One can believe Zoe to be a ruthless and nameless assassin out for revenge.
