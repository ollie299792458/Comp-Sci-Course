This is by far the best music DVD i have ever seen, or owned.  Zakk Wylde, picked at the ripe age of 18 to play for the Prince of Darkness, none other than the Ozzman himself, in this DVD proves to the world that he no longer has to live in Ozzy's shadow, for he is the man.  This is the heaviest, modern day heavy metal there is right now, and probably ever will be.  From a guitarists point of view, there is no one better than him around today.  From a fan's point of view or anyone who has even seen BLS live, you know that there is more energy from this band than any other band around today.  From his patented guitar solo half way through the set, included his always enjoyable, slightly amped up National Anthem, to his blistering solos, some doubled by Nick "Evil Twin" Catanese, this is a must own for the HARDCORE metal fan.  This is not to be taken lightly.  If you have any complaints, remember, the COMPLAINT DEPT. IS CLOSED.  Hope anyone who gets this DVD enjoys it as much i do.  Hell, i  watch it once a day, and it still amazes me.
As far as vocals, we'll we know that Zakk is a studio singer, but the reason you love this guy is not for his vocals, but his guitar wizardry.  He makes playin look so easy, it's great. 
Well, Long Live the Mother F(%^in Black Label Society.  Only the true HARDCORE can even think of enjoying the most HARDCORE of them all.  So Long from the ATLANTA CHAPTER.  Oh, the BREWTALITY.
P.S.  It does say something when u play a venue and u empty the establishment of it's last drop of BEER, LIQUOR, WINE, etc.
