this would have been a much better movie if baddies werent so hokie,and that noisy sidekick would have bit dust sooner(like in 1st 5 min).the effects were very good,but a better explaination as to the origin of the beasts,and a clearer reason for them attacking ship would have been usefull.treat williams was his grumpy self,femke was stereotypical as the badass rebel girl.the gist of this movie was treat and his merry band of sailors lend their services out to some baddies.they are to transport baddies to a yatch that is celebrating its maiden voyage.apparently a hijack is in the midst.unbeknownst to all is that the ship has been singled out for some really old,really hungry semi extinct over grown sea urchins.much chaos ensues when hijackers find an empty ship and lots of ''red stuff''.the plot/acting is nothing to brag about but there are quite a few scares here and the ending is better than most.this fast paced,often gross thriller/horror flick wont disappoint many and may even make some hope for a sequal. ...
