1 star for a 10 star movie?! You bet.
  I love this film more than you know, but I have really, really had it with this PC BS. I paid $40 not long ago for a copy of the out-of-print extended cut edition only to find that it was actually CUT and poorly edited (I mean it, you can still see John's lips mouth the 'word') to eliminate the F word in the line, "Well thank you pal, the day I get outta prison my own brother picks me up in a f***ing police car". Yes, I know it's crass and disrespectful - but tell me that is not one of the funniest lines in this movie!
  When I saw the 25th Anniversary edition with the so-called 'Theatrical Cut', I was overjoyed. I would have paid twice the retail price for the actual movie with aforementioned line intact. Imagine my shock and crushed hopes only to find that, yet again, this line had been edited.
It is disgusting beyond the filthy word itself to edit this from the THEATRICAL version. Yes, that's right - you were lied to with false advertising - it is NOT the original 'theatrical version'. In the theater, in the 80's, it was different.

UPDATE 8/31/05 - Get this Amazon people - I went to check for the errors that other posters had mentioned like the Bob's Country Bunker scene and found, to my relief, that the scene played fine on my player. BUT!! I decided to watch the rest of the movie and found that I too had errors! I have compiled a list of the errors I have found so far. Check these on your player if you decide to buy this inexcusably poor quality release.

Side A ERROR LIST:
At 1:42:49 the movie skips to 1:43:30 and does indeed eliminate the 41 seconds of footage in between.
At 1:44:05 it skips to 1:44:15 then to 1:44:17 and finally starts up again at 1:46:13.

At this point this almost feels like some sort of cruel hoax on the people who hold this movie dear. Unbelievable. Universal is evil.
