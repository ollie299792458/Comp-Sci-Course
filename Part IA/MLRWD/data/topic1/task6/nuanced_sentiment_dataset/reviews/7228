It's hard to imagine a worse portrayal of the Britt Reid/Green Hornet character than is portrayed in this film.  Nobody expects realism in a Green Hornet film, but the portrayal of the great hero of the dark in this movie was so absurd that it wasn't even funny.  Britt was a total waste with no redeeming qualities.  The film didn't adequately explain why Kato would follow such a selfish clumsy bungling loser.  The producers want us to accept that Kato, who could beat up 20 professional thugs with guns all in one fell swoop, couldn't beat Britt, who had never done any fighting.  Somehow, miraculously, Britt became an expert martial arts expert at the very end of the film simply by thinking like Kato.  As the film ended and credits came up, my wife said, "You couldn't pay me to watch this film a second time."  It just goes to show that better filmic technology does not make up for a lousy script and and extremely poor character development.  The TV series from decades ago was much better.
