Garfield: The Movie is a fairly straightforward story with no secondary tales or other touches that could take this film out of kidvid.  The interaction between the animated Garfield and the real actors and sets is subtle, rather than the eye-popping wow! of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  Unlike better family films such as Shrek or Finding Nemo, this one is strictly for kids as there is little to keep an adult's interest.
The movie starts out with a few scene-setting vignettes, brief unconnected tales much like the Jim Davis comic strip the movie was lifted from.  But right away something is amiss.  Jon, Garfield's human, isn't presented as a complete loser.  He lives in a very nice house in an unspecified part of the midwest that looks suspiciously like Oak Park or a similar John Hughes location.  The furnishings are tasteful and reasonable quality.  And Jon isn't completly incompetent in his day to day actions.
And what's worse, Jon's unrequited feelings for Garfield's veterinarian, Liz, are not thrown in his face (as per the strip) but returned within the first 20 minutes.  The vet character is just as wrong as Jon; both are cute, thin, and dress well.  Jon should be a zhlub, Liz should be strictly business.  Here, Jon's a heartthrob and Liz dresses like she's on her way to a disco.  Wrong, wrong, wrong!
The major plot point is okay (evil cable-TV animal show host kidnaps Odie after dog wins a blue ribbon, Garfield rescues him), the animated Garfield is done well, and the status quo is preserved.  My kid liked it okay.  But I would not advise anyone over 12 to watch this unless accompanied by an interested elementary schooler.  14 June 2004 by mad-haus
