you just know it'll be larger than life, Starship Troopers, Total Recall etc., Hollow Man delivers. Just. Its not a bad film, but it's not a good film either. I just couldn't appreciate the characters, especially Elisabeth Shue's, she just didn't fit.
Basically the story goes something like this. Kevin Bacon plays a scientist (of the mad variety!), who discovers the secret of making things invisible. The problem with this is bringing them back visible. When the breakthrough happens, Bacon unofficially experiments on himself. With his new found freedom he slowly starts to lose his grip on reality, and takes things into his own hands, to get what he wants.
Visually the film is stunning, the special effects look superb on DVD's superior quality. The audio is a classic Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, which enables you to hear every little noise like crystal, and every explosion with window shattering clarity.
The special features are required viewing, just to find out how they managed those effects, with plenty of insight, the only drawback is that on the featurettes they seem to share the same interviews. Don't miss the trailer for the Final Fantasy movie which is also on the disc.
