By putting the mandatory (you can only fast forward - and many dvd players only fast forward at one speed) previews in the beginning of the Animal House disk, Universal has lost a heavy DVD purchaser.
When I first realized the previews were of this nature, I immediately wrote to Universal:
Mr. Craig Kornblau
President of Universal Studios Home Video and Executive Vice President/General Manager, Universal Music &amp; Video Distribution
70 Universal City Plaza
Universal City, CA 91608
My main points were:
 - "One of the reasons I purchase DVDs instead of VHS tapes is that I greatly value the time-saving feature of skipping chapters and going directly to the title menu when I desire.  Essentially, I paid the extra money for a DVD when all that was provided was a VHS tape that can play in my DVD player."
 - "Even though I am an avid DVD purchaser, this is the only time I have ever encountered a DVD that so infuriated me.  If this matter is not fixed, I will never purchase another DVD released by Universal again, and advise my friends to do the same."
Please write to Univeral.  I received a letter in the mail that said their "plan for future relases is to include the ability to bypass trailers by selecting 'Main Menu.'"  It doesn't help those of us who purchased this DVD, though.
P.S. About the menu button: the PS2 doesn't have one, and selecting "menu" from the select button's menu does not work.
