The Adventures in Booga Booga Land: Squid Sushi Loses His Marble (DVD) by Richard Milner.

I was happy to review this DVD as I love watching cartoons. These stories are based on the parables of Jesus. There are 3 episodes included on this DVD!

Squid Sushi Loses His Marbles (The Lost Pearl - Matthew 13:45-46) Marty the Monkey and Gerard the Giraffe are on an adventure to recover lost treasure.

Wally the Waiter (The Soil and the Seeds - Matthew 13:24-30) Marty and Gerard needed to save the day when the chocolate cake recipe was stolen by a thief.

The final episode, The Flaming Monkey (The Wedding Banquet - Matthew 22:2-14) Marty and Gerard have to find guests for a banquet when all of the invited guests didn't show up.

As a grown up who like watching cartoons didn't find this cartoon that interesting but a child may.
