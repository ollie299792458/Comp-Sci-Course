Unlike most of the reviewers of this film, I was overall disappointed with the film.  I was vey enthusiastic about seeing the film after reading "Shake Hands With the Devil" (UN General Romeo Dallaire's accout of Rwanda's genocide) and seeing Hotel Rwanda).  However, I was disappointed by the end of the film.  I feel the writers tried to cover too much of the war and from too many perspectives.  In addition, I was alarmed that the writers did not emphasize the power tool of the RTLM, the Interahwame's brainwash radio.

However, there were parts of the film that I did like.  True accounts can been seen throughout the entire film.  The girl's school genocide did occur and the schoolgirls did stick together.  The militia did go house to house killing off all opponents and political activists for peace.  Unfortunately though, the film appeared to summarize these events than really actually tell a story.

For anyone who wants a very accurate account of the genocide, Ghosts of Rwanda is an excellent, and eerily disturbing, account of the 100 day genocide.  Also, "Shake Hands with the Devil," "We Wish to Inform that We Will Be Killed With Our Families Tomorrow," and "Justice on the Grass" are goods choices for reading.

The film is not as harsh of a depiction as Hotel Rwanda is.  And as for Hotel Rwanda being too Hollywood, I beg to differ.  Director Terry George did not depend on graphic violence and effects on this story; he relied on the powerful and heroic tale of brave individual named Paul Rusesibegina.

See Sometimes in April for a good overview of what happened in Rwanda.
