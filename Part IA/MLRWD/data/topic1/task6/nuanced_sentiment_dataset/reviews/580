You've seen, or at least judged the movie by now.  I personally enjoyed it; low-life characters, stylish and fun action, and Johnny Depp.  But getting past that, this is a great DVD, packed neatly into a single disk.
Weather you like it or not, Robert Rodriguez gives a facinating crash-course on low budget film making, digital photography, and a cooking segment about slow-roasted pork that looks to die for (hehehe...oh Johnny).  I generally am not really that interested in what goes on behind the camera, in the sense that i don't care about when to roll the cameras, how to zoom, and whatnot, but this is definitely interesting.  The actors also give brief but satisfying commentary about their characters, and about doing stunts.  And the F/X featurette?  Made me want to try and make my own action movie.  It seems so easy!
The Bonus features alone are a film geeks wetdream, but in addition to that movie... certainly worth buying, and probably one of the best DVD's on the market right now.
