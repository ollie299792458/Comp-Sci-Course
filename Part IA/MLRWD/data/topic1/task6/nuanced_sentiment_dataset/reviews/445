A great follower of the original movie. It was almost guranteed a sucess because the original cast remained...and that meant more humour and more savin the day in style.
An evil painting of a carpathian sits in the Art Museum, while down below in the deepest tunnels evil slime runs through the heart of New York and radiates evil on the city. The Ghostbusters are once again fighting against the evil spirits that haunt the city. 
We have a killer cast again including:
Bill Murray as the great Peter Venkman - who can't help but make humor out of situations, though he remains the most confrontational when it comes to battling ghosts.
Harold Ramis as the ever so intellegent Egon - his smooth, in the know character creates constant humour throughout, while his intellegence makes him the Brains of Ghostbusters.
Dan Aykroyd as the Ray. He is often either challenged by spooks or brings across child like characteristics (remember how he reacted when they first looked at the ghostbusters headquarters).
I could go on but I think you get the drift. 
Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2 is pure genius - from the script to the the casting. We have a great cast of comedic actors - Murray, Ramis and Aykroyd and the script written by Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd contains the right level of humour and scares.
Ghostbusters 1/2 will remain 2 of my favourite movies forever.
