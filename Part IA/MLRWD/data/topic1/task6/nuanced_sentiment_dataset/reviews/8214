Pulp Fiction, although one of the most imitated movies on it's time, is the real deal.  It is exciting, funny, and original.  Tarantino follows "Resevior Dogs" with this innovative film.  The film is divided up into three stories, and a prologue.  The stories are all interrealted and very entertaining.  The stories are about two hit men, a boxer and his girlfriend, the hit men's boss and his wife and two very funny robbers.
What is so clever about this film is that it isn't moved along by the action.  There are plenty of action scenes and violent seens in the film, but what keeps the film interesting was what would have been cut by a big time producer.  Tarantino's independent approach to the movie helped it maintain its originality.  The movie is fueled by dialogue.  In one scene, the two hit men delay arriving at their tagets place by discussing hamburgers (Ryale with Cheese) and foot massages.  It has it's share of other funny lines ("Zed's dead baby, Zed's dead.")
I loved this movie, and it is in my top five.  It is outrageously original and strikingly funny.  It is the perfect film of the 90's.
