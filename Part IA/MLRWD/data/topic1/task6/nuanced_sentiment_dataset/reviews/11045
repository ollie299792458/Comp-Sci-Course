If you were expecting some new revelations from this latest release of Enter the Dragon you'll have to look elsewhere. Although there is a new 1/2 hour documentary on the making of ETD everything else has been released before, much of it on the 25th anniversary edition of the film. For fans of Bruce it is nice to have so many special features on one double-disc set, however, if you are a devoted Bruce Lee fan you may already own the included documentaries "Curse of the Dragon" which was broadcast on A&amp;E, or the film "Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey" which contains nearly all of Bruce's footage from Game of Death interpreted as Bruce intended it.
The transfer is crisp but I could see no significant improvements over the 25th edition transfer, the commentary by Paul Heller is the same version as the 25th anniversary edition as well, and I found the Dolby 5.1 digital soundtrack rather soft and thin sounding. The new documentary "Blood and Steel:  Making Enter the Dragon" does have a few things you haven't seen before including a couple of outtakes from the film and interviews with writer Michael Allin and friend and co-star Sammo Hung, as well as co-star Ahna Capri's Super 8 footage taken on location, long rumored to contain footage of Bruce in an actual fight with one of the film's extras (Bruce was routinely challenged throughout the filming by extras who were often Triad gang members). Alas, the documentary contains no such footage, finally putting to rest the hope that we would one day be able to see Bruce in a "real fight". 
I may be wrong, but after 30 years I'm convinced there is no "new" Bruce Lee footage left. But then again unreleased material from Jimi Hendrix continues to pop up once in a while. Well, we can only hope....... We love you Bruce. Peace.
