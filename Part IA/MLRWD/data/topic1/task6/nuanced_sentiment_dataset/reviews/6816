Really NOT funny... An assault on Christians, very offensive and should not be watched if you are Christian. This is one of those movies that you wonder - How did anyone with a brain ever put money into this? I believe it is put on by enemies of the Church. If your kids want to watch this, tell them NO!!!

Addendum
My daughter is a high school senior and did not
Ask me before renting this offensive piece of
Garbage. I watched enough of it to be offended
And asked the kids not to watch it.

Am I not entitled to express my opinion as a Christian
Woman who is not brainwashed by our current
Culture of death?

Are only trolls who buy into the current "anything
Goes" mentality allowed to post reviews without
Attack of the little minions trolling reviews?

As a young woman and a product of our liberal
Education system, I too was blind to this mindless
Tripe in the past.

Now a mother and grandmother, I have a different
Point of view now. I only regret I might have seen this
Kind of filth as funny at an earlier time in my own life.

Watching this garbage stays with you at some level whether
you are consciencely aware of it or not.

Probably speaking to the kool-aide drinkers but
why I bothered to comment at all was in case
Someone thought the title containing Christmas
Might make this a Christian film in the tiniest
Possible way... Nope

Luckily, I have not been exposed to earlier
Adventures of these morons, a much more offensive
Version of the "Cheech & Chong" movies my
Friends and I watched in my youth.
