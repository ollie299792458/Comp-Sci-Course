Even lovers of bad movies will hate this one because it's not even fun to laugh at -- unless you count the scene in which you're inadvertently looking up someone's nose while they deliver some long diatribe that's supposed to be important. (I don't remember what the guy was saying, because I couldn't get the insides of his nostril out of my head.)

Even MST3K, which showcases baddies in all their glory and delight, couldn't endure this one. The robots could barely even crack jokes about it, other than "get me out of this" kinds of comments.

If I remember correctly (I saw it 10 years ago, and the stench is still with me), the film was introduced as a "cinematic suppository from our video repository" or something like that. I agree, except that this description might suggest that there's some fun to be had in watching it. No such luck. I'd get more pleasure from cleaning out a septic tank than I had from this horrible waste of celluloid.

Don't buy this, unless you're planning to use it as evidence against the director at his trial for crimes against humanity.
