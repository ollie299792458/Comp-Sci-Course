To sum up: "Lake Mungo" is a waste of time. Rotten Tomatoes had a 93% rating on the movie and IMDB had a 6.1 (The latter can be better relied on than the former). And while Amazon reviews are skewed higher (it is rare to see an average of two stars or lower even when the movie is genuinely horrible), the Amazon reviewers got this one right. As for Rotten Tomatoes, make sure there are enough recognized reviewers seeing the movie (like 30) before you trust their word).

I will not give away the ending but I advise you not to stick around for it. There is one scary idea in the movie - and it is not worth the long wait. Nothing happens in this movie. It is a documentary-style movie filmed as a series of interviews. The concept might be "new", but it is annoying to watch and doesn't make for an absorbing experience. "The Blair Witch Project" did a great job with the documentary style and that movie was actually scary if you saw it before you knew the ending and before everyone was making fun of it.

Just because a movie is bad, does not make it a "thinking man's" horror movie. My two favorite horror movies are slow and well-worth the atmospheric build-up: "The Shining" and "Session 9". This movie will not be scary to the horror movie novice. Is it slightly disturbing? Slightly. It feels conjured up and forced. To quote "Billy Madison", "Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it".

A movie experience is a time-waster by definition, but it should be an enjoyable one. Even bad horror movies can be enjoyable - like Robert de Niro's awful "Hide and Seek". Not knowing that a movie will be bad is like eating something spicy not knowing it it will be - eating wasabi thinking it's guacamole or drinking vodka thinking it's water - it makes it that much worse. Bruce Almighty was a horrible movie but its pain was eased knowing it was going to be just that. I hope my wasted time will encourage you not to waste yours on "Lake Mungo".
