I guess the main problem I have with the movie is that the town of Pripyat is not presented very accurately. The bumper cars were not even in an enclosed area. The mural on one of the buildings looks like it is brand new. The town just does not look like Pripyat. There is no way that the tourists could have ever ended up in the old nuclear reactor just by accident. People actually work there.

I know it's supposed to be a horror film. The story idea was good, but I think a better job could have been done. The town was not realistic. The way the woman dies from radiation sickness is not realistic. I seriously doubt that the 25 year-old flashlight that they found would work after all those years. The Geiger counter sounds were obviously fake. When you look through the window in Yuri's office in Kyiv, you can see a van drive by that reads "Srbija" in Roman letters - so you know it wasn't actually filmed in Kyiv.

They did actually do a decent job of getting Eastern European actors, although technically Dmitri Diatchenko is American.

If you're looking for an informational film about the Chernobyl power plant accident, don't bother with this movie. There are plenty of good informational documentaries about the accident and Pripyat on YouTube.
