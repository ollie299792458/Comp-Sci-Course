This is simply one of the 2 or 3 best comic book movirs ever made!! Nick Cage is a great actor. He pulls out all the stops here, and you can see why he is an Oscar winner. Sam Elliott is once again perfect as a mysterious western iconic hero. The CGI special effects are very well done, with almost none of yhat cheesy "I'm watching a cartoon" feel of some other superhero flicks (see "Spider-Man"). The scene in which the Sam Elliott Ghost Rider from the old west rides with the Nick Cage Ghost Rider sent chills down my spine. I just wish Elliott's Ghost Rider could have played a part in the final climactic battle (riding in to save the day, as all the great old cowboys did). The bikes & stunts were awesome, and Peter Fonda as the Devil payed homage to his classic "Easy Rider" role (too bad Jack Nicholson did not make a cameo).The atmosphere & sets had an almost Sergio Leone feel to them, especially the Biker Bar.I actually hope there is no "Ghost Rider II", because this one ended perfectly, and there is nothing more to add. See this film, and watch it again, you won't be disappointed!
