Honey (Alba) is raised in slum New York, where her mother runs a center to give kids a safe place to be that keeps them off the street and gives them constructive ways to channel their energy.  Honey teaches dance at the center by day and works at a dance club by night, hangin' wit her homegirls and practicin' her moves.  By chance she is discovered by the owner of a studio who produces music videos and he gives her a job choreographing, which is her dream come true, careerwise.  But when he tries to pressure her to sleep with him and she refuses, she loses her job and disappoints a group of young kids from the 'hood she has promoted for the latest video.
But Honey has vision and fortitude.  She has previously committed to opening a dance studio for inner city youth, and presses through with a commitment to see that come to pass whatever it takes.  With the help of her boyfriend and providence the dream is realized.
The most cool thing about this movie to me is that Honey was raised with the example of helping disadvantaged kids - modeled by her mother - and she takes her God given talent and takes it to the next level, in spite of obstacles that stand in her way.  The most powerful obstacle is her mother, who would like to see Honey get out of the 'hood.
This is a powerful movie that is very inspiring.
