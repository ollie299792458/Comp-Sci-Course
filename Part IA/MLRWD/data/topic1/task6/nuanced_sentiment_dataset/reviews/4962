This movie is definetly violent, but I think in a sense you need that to really know what happened during world war II, Adrien Brody I believe in his finest performence yet. The Pianist is a great film and it is even cooler to know that it was directed by someone who is a survivor of world war II who lost almost his whole family. This film was also written from a book, the storyline is almost the same as in the book, it is based on a true story about a polish pianist from the 1940's. Adrien Brody played the part so well throughout the whole movie, The struggles he went through just in order to survive even though his entire family might be dead, he stayed alive because of the love of music. This film will open your eyes and make you see that whatever is going on in your life, it isn't so bad, if he could survive getting shot at everyday and never staying in more than one place for a week than anybody can survive anything. The Pianist portrays WWII really well, the only movie in my opinion that comes close to this film is shindlers list, also a great film. If you have heard good things about this film than it is because it is a spectacular film, an instant classic in my library. But The Pianist, you wont regret it.
