I absolutely love the original Halloween, and I love all of the sequals.. Except for this on, it's pure trash.

What is going on with some of these horror series, why are they getting so horribly butchered, it is a direct slap in the face to actual fans of the series. Kind of like the latest Child's Play, what a joke!

I decided to sit and watch the entire DVD, and it did not get any better, as I watched this, this... well what should I call it, this embarrasment addition to the series I ended up feeling steady incrimates of sheer boredom.

This one is just a money grab, and they are bound to attract more people to watch it that would not otherwise due to the rapper in this film. I think it was Rhymes or something like that but I don't care to check because it is not worth it and I don't care.

I refuse to truly associate this with the rest of the Halloween series, avoid this if you have not seen it, it is not worth your time, and you may just get offended by how terrible it is and at the same time harbors the Halloween name. I am lucky I rented it because if I bought it I would have just burned it, like the producers must have been thinking when they made this, "Hey, lets burn the series, why not? We will get new fans anyway because of the new 'actors'.." *Actors? more like hacks..*
