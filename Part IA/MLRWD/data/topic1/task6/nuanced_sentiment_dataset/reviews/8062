Though not a big Hollywood budget film, THE DEAD HATE THE LIVING still looks like WAY too much money was spent on the terrible script and bad actors.  If this had been a shot-on-video, five-thousand dollar indie flick, I may have been more forgiving with it... but maybe not.

The story and dialog are just plain ol' BAD.  The actors look like they're having fun being in a horror movie... but that ain't the same thing as actually ACTING.  There is nothing special about the cinematography.  There just isn't much at all to like in this film.

The movie is full of inside horror-fan "jokes" that I assume were meant to win me over.  I am a huge horror movie fan.  But these silly inside joke moments were just plain irritating. Winking at me the entire time, this movie did NOT win me over and become my friend.  Instead, the constant inside jokes felt like a desperate plea from the director:  "Please don't judge me ...  I'm a horror fan just like you!!!"

But I did judge ...because this movie wasted 90 minutes or whatever of my life.  This was not a horror fan's horror movie.  It was a weak effort that MAY be appreciated by a very bored 10 year old.  But those of us who have seen all the horror movies that TDHTL cracks wise about will be enraged that Dave Parker was given a budget to make this stinker.

Very, very bad movie.  Avoid.
