This movie is based around a cell phone.  No, not like all the other cell phone movies.  This one seems to have come from "The Dark Side" as the number that is linked to it was previously held by a "missing" woman.  This missing woman was the mistress of a prominent married man.  The phone occassionally rings and whomever answers it and listens is stricken with a sudden urge to commit deathly acts and then die.
When a friend's daughter picks up the phone and listens, she instantly starts throwing tantrums.  This leads in to the movie which portrays the current phone owner (woman) playing detective to determine why she is getting these calls, who is placing them, and ultimately to determine what crime has been committed by who.
Extremely good movie for those with a strong stomach for horror and blood.

Disk has tons of extras for those that are interested in the making of, commentaries, and behind the scenes shots.
All region DVD plays excellent on LG HDBlueray DVD drive (computer) and HD TV with Spanish/English subtitles and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound
