I watched Eden of the East with little knowledge about it and not reading anything about it. This series is 11 episodes long (+2 movies not included in the set) and as you can imagine, there's very little ground that can be covered in 11 episodes. Most Anime with such a series count usually take basically straight problems and blow them out of proportion to fit the timing. The opposite was true here.  The material could be expanded to cover easily 50 episodes if they really could expand to a series that large. The material and the world from which the story resides is huge with a large palette of detail. The problem is that with only 11 episodes they have to skim by so much so quickly, that they leave large amounts of character and situational development on the floor in order to keep up their overly frantic pace of storytelling. Everyone outside of the main 2 leads feel flat, inauthentic and ultimately uninteresting. I know that with time, I could learn to like them all, but as that isn't the flow of this show, the process of watching it was painful.

The conclusion of the series accomplishes very little in terms of the grand scheme of the story's universe, and it just aggravated me more in the fact that there will probably never be answers to the questions I had thought of throughout the show.

As a technical note, the animation was good, and it never had a feeling of budget with the picture or sound. I watched it with subtitles and Japanese, so I can't speak for the English dubbing job.
