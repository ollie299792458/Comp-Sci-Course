I'm a Stone's fan.  And i've heard that Muddy Waters had a profound impact on their origination and style, even to this day.  Drugs, alcohol and money continue to destroy regardless of race, religion or goal.  One has  to admire a hard working young man going from picking crops in the field to making music.  However, paranoia  and  the desire for more is so destructive.  This reminded me of the recent "Walk the Line" movie.  And for years i've heard about the struggles of Chuck Berry.  I'd love to see a sequel that goes from this era of R&B and shows Phil Spector's "Wall of Sound" generation.  So many of the musicians and singers are still around, and this would tie together a wonderful story of a beginning, a middle and maybe a 3rd movie that takes us to Jimmy Buffett, Greatful Dead as well as breakups of groups such as the Beatles, Beach Boys and others.  Each generation needed something and got it, but at what price to the consumer and the artist.  someone always wants to be bigger, better, richer.  In the end it is destruction, death, hostility and hate, with some great music along the path.
