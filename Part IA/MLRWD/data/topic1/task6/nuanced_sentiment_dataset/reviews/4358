This film goes down as the abomination that was the final nail in the coffin of the original classic series. After many years agreeing with that notion, I find it has aged well. TCM 2 still shines to me as THE over-the-top slasher-satire. And TCM3 was a cheap New Line rock n roll Jason-knock off, that I still embrace. In the wake of the horrible Hollywood remakes, this one works when far removed from the other sequels. When it borrows from the original its not due to lack of originality. It suggests the family's massacres are ritualistic and have some metaphysical formula. The fact that they eat pizza and don't kill a single victim with a chainsaw is Henkel's comment that the family is evil without the brutal motif of the other films. This film blends the intense psychotic values of the family with pitch-black comedy pretty well, but nothing close to the original. But it has some art to it: a full-on transvestite Leatherface, an fresh and surreal Illumanati plot, alien conspiracy!, Matthew McConaughey head squashing a teenage girl with his cybernetic leg, and a thousand dumb horror quotables. I see this entry in the series as the ultimate misunderstood sequel and a good watch for the true (jaded) horror buffs out there. And I do wish we saw more of Matthew McConaughey's dark intensity in other films. He did better than expected  as the main villain. I mean, this guy was in EdTV??
