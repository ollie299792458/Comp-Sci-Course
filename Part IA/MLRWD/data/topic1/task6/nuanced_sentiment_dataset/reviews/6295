Larry David is undoubtably brilliant.  As others have mentioned concerning his sizable writing contribution on Seinfeld (and it's diminishment with his leaving that show).  As for his acting talents I am not entirely convinced he should have starred in this role.  
I don't have cable, so had never seen CYE on HBO; I purchased it on good advice from several friends.  My experience watching the DVDs was a mixed bag.  I saw strong shades of the inimitable George Costanza, who is in my humble opinion one of the greatest characters ever on television.  But this show lacked Jason Alexander's delivery and frenzied struggle with the cruel tricks life can throw at you.  Larry also lacks George's willingness to sink to any level to get what he wants.  As Elaine said to Jerry in an episode of Seinfeld where he was slated to take a lie detector test and thought it would be easy to "beat" the machine, "Who do you think you are?  Costanza?"
The "about nothing" and "comedy of coincidence" traits that made Seinfeld a classic are all here, yet somehow didn't elicit the same laughs - for me anyway.  I knew it was funny, but yet it doesn't make me laugh out loud often.  Perhaps Larry seems to take too much of it lying down, or it feels forced in spots.  I didn't "buy it" much of the time.  The fact he and his wife seem like a very unlikely pairing didn't help.
Overall it's a fun ride, but unlike "The Office" I don't feel the desire to rewatch episodes to pick up on missed subtleties.  Worth a watch on the plane I think.
