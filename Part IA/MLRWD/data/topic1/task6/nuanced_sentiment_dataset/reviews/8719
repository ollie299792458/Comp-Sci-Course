For some reason Artisan/Lions Gate deems it necessary to release their hit films again, again...and again on DVD. This is the third time that the Rambo trilogy has been released! The first releases were slim discs with no features. Then they relased the "special editions" of each film which you could get seperately or altogether in a really nifty metal case. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better than "special edition", then comes the "ultimate editions" of the films. Enough is enough! If I were a die hard fan I would be majoryly P.O.ed that I would have to keep rebuying the series. Luckily I am not a die hard fan and I didn't have to have the films right away so I was able to pick up the Ultiamte Editions. It's not only the Rambo films. Artison has released Terminator 2 and Stargate on 3 seperate occasions! WFT...instead of remastering these films for the billionth time, how bought putting more effort into your back catolouge as your releases of Fright Night 2, DeepStar Six, Bride of Re-Animator, and Fortress look terrible.
