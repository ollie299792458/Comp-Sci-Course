If you like the Hulk this movie is for you.  It takes all the elments that make the character attractive and improves upon them.  The story is essentially Savage Hulk liberates planet.  He's asked to leave by the Avengers.  I would have liked to have seen that battle in animated form.  For all intents and purposes it was worth wait. While some liberties were taken with the story it was entertaining.  How about a sequel with World War Hulk?  This one at least has Hulk with Banner's brain.

It's a thinking man Hulk kind of movie.  If you are a fan of the comics or just like this type of animation, you won't be let down.  It's worth watching a few times.  the extras do add quite a bit in the making of this saga.  If Marvel reads these reviews, I have to say, how about a Spidey animated film?

On a historical note: back in the 1970's, Roy Thomas adapted Harlan Ellison's plot, "Brute That Shouted Love at the Heart of the Atom".  In this other dimension; Hulk found the second love of his life, Jarella.  Too bad this story wasn't incorporated into the film.  Ironically he was not the intellegent version.  In the 70's his character was of the "Hulk Smash" mentality.  Artist Herb Trimpe was the quintessential Hulk artist at the time.  I only wish he had input in the modern interpretation of the character.
