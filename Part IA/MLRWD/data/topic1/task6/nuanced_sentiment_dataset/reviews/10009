This is actually one of my top 10 favourite horror movies of all time.
My top 10 horror movies are movies or even movie sequels i have selected which i consider to be better then the original's, evil dead 2 : dead by dawn is one of them. Not only is it better then the original 1981 film, but it uses a bigger budget more technology and special effects.

1987's Evil dead 2: dead by dawn in my opinion is a remake/sequel, remake because it starts off by ash and linda driving up to the cabin. QUESTION "Where are the college freinds from part 1?" anyway linda gets killed off a second time and the sequel then starts when ash is thrown in the air by the forces of the forest. Displayed after that is a good continuation of a movie i have ever seen! (TIP: i normally watch evil dead part 1 - then go straight to the scene where ash is thrown around in the air, in evil dead part 2, and there you have an even greater evil dead movie experience, it avoids the confusion the begining of part 2 had when you dont see the college students. I don't want to give to much away with the story, but expect to be entertained in a surreal kind of way. This movie also has a tendency to make you laugh and blood and gore fans wont be dissapointed.

I can't understand why they are making or have already made the remake to evil dead which will be out this year. Remakes tend to give viewer's a diiferent frame of mind towards the series. And remember there is only one "ash j. williams" who was played well by bruce campbell. "Groovy!......"
