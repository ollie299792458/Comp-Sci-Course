i bought this ... THING yesterday and was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO excited because i have about four of the manga volumes and it's my favorite manga... i mean, i WORSHIP the bookshelf they rest on! so i was really happy when i got this (got it at the local samgoody for $25).  but it forget what they say about it 'following the manga'.  it left out the BEST PART of volume one-where alucard walks up holding seras and says "the vampire's dead, no survivors." and then they find out seras is a vampire and integra gets all PI$$ED off at alu! that was the freakin best part and they left that out! then they changed all the GOOD lines around with BAD ones and ADDED some stuff! geneon's screwed it over AGAIN! >:(

but it was pretty cool to see those scenes come alive. like i didn't understand where anderson's weapons came from until i saw this, then it showed them coming out of his sleeves (kohta-sama says he's fourth dimensional-those of you who don't know who kohta is should be ashamed to call yourselves hellsing fans!). it was okay, i guess. i'll probably keep it, but won't buy anymore dvds until i finish the manga.
