If a very dark skinned Italian has a child with a blonde haired blue eyed German does that make said child an Italian? No, said child is simply considered white. However, transpose dark skinned Italian with very light skinned African American and the resultant child will still be classed as BLACK!
This movie is the perfect example of deeply seated subconscious white racism that without knowing it views black people as some kind of genetic contaminant.

What the hell is passing for white! Why in the hell should a woman as light as our protaganist in this movie even consider herself black when she is no more black than the hypothetical child I mentioned earlier is Italian.

As a historical document this a very interesting, well executed and very bold for its time movie. But as a morality tale about the evils of racism
it clearly fails because it is itself, racist; albeit quite unintentionally.
Check out my review of "PASSING FOR WHO YOU REALLY ARE" BY A.D. POWELL on amazon.co.uk. Buy yourself a copy of this very interesting book and then you'll understand my point of view more completely.
