I had previously seen Wong Kar Wai's two most recent full-length films (In The Mood For Love and 2046) and enjoyed them greatly. I just recently purchased the rest of his catalogue and have been viewing them in chronological order. Tonight I watched Chungking Express.

This film, like all of his films, deals with isolation, loss, and missed connections. It contains two separate stories which, on the surface, are not related. The first story I found to be intriguing though not really so inspiring. The second (which comprises the bulk of the film) was simply amazing! WKW really has a way of placing you into the emotions of his characters! His is an extremely voyeuristic style to film-making. As the story progressed I started to feel uncomfortable as a result of one of the characters' behavior. Then the discomfort gave way to exuberance and I was smiling and even laughing along with this character. I began to sympathize and (god forbid!) even condone what was happening. When the character's game came to an end (as it had to do) I was scared for her but was relieved when her victim(?) also sympathized and condoned her behavior. Then, the story took a turn and it broke my heart in a most profound way. WKW's stories always break my heart, but this one REALLY HURT in a more personal way! I'm not really sure why. But after all the sadness and pain, this story turned around and put the pieces back together!

Beware! This is not a film for mainstream junkies! If you enjoy challenging and thought-provoking movies, then this is a definite must-see! If you have primarily subsisted on a diet of mainstream Hollywood fare but are curious to see the treasures that are possible with daring film-making, then this movie is an excellent gateway drug!
