Okay, I know I'm in the very small minority, but this movie was bad. First lesson in story telling; your audience has to care about the characters. Secondly; the story has to be based in reality (unless it's SciFi).
This movie takes about two seconds to develop any character lines. The plot is so absurd and far fetched as to be funny. Let's see; the NYPD police officer goes over to Camden, New York to take in a hacker for questioning (without a warrant or probable cause). Apparently Camden has no police force, or county or state police, and the NYPD allows it's officers to drive some 5 hours out of the city outside their jurisdiction on something that doesn't concern them (as far as prosecution is concerned).
Now the NYPD officer (Bruce Willis) gets into a extensive gun battle; the apartment where the hacker lives is blown up, numerous people are killed, the apartment building is shot full of holes, but hey, apparently nobody calls police/fire/rescue, and Willis just drives away. I guess checking for anyone else being injured or calling the FD because the building is on fire would just slow the action.
Then there's driving an SUV up a parking ramp and thru a glass window into the "secure" computer control room. Bad building design and security; having the parking ramp and your secure areas only divided by a glass partition. Next you run down the female bad guy with the suv at about 40mph, but wait, she doesn't even get one injury! And the list goes on.
This movie is just a bunch of unbelievable special effects and stunts with a terrible story line that was put there as an afterthought.
If you like special effects and stunts, see this movie, but check your brain at the door.
