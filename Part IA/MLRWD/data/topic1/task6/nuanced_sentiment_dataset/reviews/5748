I loved watching this movie.  The setting started in the archeological dig of a 14th century castle and then the characters, through a scientific experiment,(not given away the plot) move through time and come face to face with the same castle and all the problems that faced the people of long ago.  The characters think that because their from the future it will be easy to overcome the middle ages. WRONG!  It still takes team work and know how to develop a plan that gets them out of some hot and sometimes 'tight' spots.  The love theme of finding your place with someone you love was excellent as two people, each from a different time, come together and make their own history.  Evidence is discovered that unlocks these two peoples history near the end of the movie as the other characters realize their devotion to each other. Over all, one character Chris Johnston played by Paul Walker is searching for his father Professor Edward Johsnton, while seeking the affections of a perticular young lady and trying to keep her safe.  The character of Marek also finds a cause that he champions and knowing what history has written decides to change it.  Will he succeed?  The Assistant Professor Andra Marek played by Gerard Butler also provides a wonderful performance as he guides them through history and shows Paul's character that we can make our own history.
