This movie is not to be over-analyzed and compared with other great movies. It's just a fun movie meant to be enjoyed and not to be taken seriously. For the sensitive one, this movie will rub you the wrong way. This movie touches on every sensitive issues like racism, terrorism, stereotyping etc but it's not meant to be taken seriously. They make fun of the ridiculous sensitive issues that we are currently facing in our society.

While on the first movie you follow Harold & Kumar on their journey to find White Castle, in this movie you follow them again escaping the Guantanamo Bay. As usual they find really crazy characters along the way... KKK wannabes, in-bred son of a hillbilly family, even the president. The best character to me will always be NEIL PATRICK HARRIS. He's just legen---wait for it---DARY.

The bluray has some cool features but the best feature would be to change the story. You will be given an option at certain points to change the story or scene. If you change the first option (where Kumar smokes his bong in a plane and mistaken as terrorist) and choose not to smoke the bong, it'll change into a completely different chick-flick movie in Amsterdam! That's just quite an awesome feature.
