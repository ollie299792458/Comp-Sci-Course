2 stars. The amazon crowd has got it right. This is clearly a hastily made money flick. I was surprised to read about great acting and "gritty" feel. There is no grit whatsoever in Contraband. In fact I abandoned the movie about 15 min before the end, exactly because there was no engagement or grit. There are few things which are working against calling this a good movie:

1. Boring dialogs. I guess nobody read the script or what? 50% of all dialogs are different characters asking Wahlberg how he is going to pull off his smuggling. He always responds something like "have faith in me". The other 50% is Wahlberg invariably asking for more time when on the phone with his accomplices.

2. No attention to details. This is the primary reason why this movie has zero grit. They are pulling their stunts in hot and humid Panama City. Yet nobody is even break a sweat.

Overall, instead of spending money on relatively expensive aerial shots, producers would have been better off spending on better script and actually waking up Mark Wahlberg. Because Mark looks very stiff in this movie. This is a borderline flick which could have gone straight to DVD release bypassing big screen.
