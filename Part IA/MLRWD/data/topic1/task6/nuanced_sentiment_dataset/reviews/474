Having never seen High School Musical, I wasn't sure what to expect from this Zac Efron. He was actually a decent actor. Casting Matthew Perry though as his future self was very....ODD. As another reviewer stated, they look nothing alike and most of us in our 30s and 40s still look a little like our high school senior photo. Matt isn't the one selling this film so I don't know why they would choose him unless he was already on board for the project and Zac Efron was a last minute replacement? But anyway, the film is entertaining if you have nothing else to watch but its also very predictable. I disagree about the content warning from some of the reviewers. There's nothing in this movie for parents to worry about unless your kid has been living in a cave or you're Amish. There is much more raunchier things shown on the CW network and on regular television. Zac Efron fans I assume will just love seeing his face in anything so I'm sure they'll love it. Its all good fun. I recommend it for the family.
