Bought this yesterday and was looking forward to seeing it in hi-def. This is one of my all time favourite movies.
I've never had a problem with blu-ray movies before watching them or loading them on my Playstation 3 however Universal have come up with some new technlogy which is just so annoying that it's almost not worth the purchase.
After you insert the disc, you'd expect that it would load in a matter of seconds, like any other blu-ray.  Not so with this one.  It actually goes out onto the web and hooks up with the Universal website.
After it finally loads (roughly 3-4 minutes), when scrolling through the screens you get adverts for other Universal movies popping into the menus which is really annoying.
If you decide to pause the movie, after a few seconds, the Universal logo will appear. Pressing the pause button again or the play button on the Playstation remote does not restart the movie. I finally found that you have to press the "top menu" button to get the movie to resume.
The movie itself is extremely good and works very well in hi-def (some shots, especially of archived news footage does appear a bit grainy but that's not the movies fault) and there are some very good extras on the disc (the making of presentation is definately worth watching).
Overall an excellent movie totally ruined by Universal. I now have serious doubts as to whether I'll be purchasing any other Universal movie on Blu Ray again.
