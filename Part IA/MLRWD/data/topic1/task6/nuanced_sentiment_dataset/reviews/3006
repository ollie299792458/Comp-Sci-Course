Sorry, but it is. I know the sci fi egg heads talk about what a work of art 2001 is. I personally found it disjointed, and I'm sorry, but flashy images and makeup does not make a good movie. Sci fi needs action and adventure to be successful. Once it becomes elete, it no longer is a movie, instead it becomes a unique piced of art only appreciated by the select few who find it interesting. But if you want a successful movie that sells tickets to the general public, sci fi and non sci fans alike, you have to have adventure and a story that can be followed without being constantly derailed by having to think hard on what you just saw. This movie has the action and adventure. It has good actors and characters, and a suspensful story that you can watch, see an honest beginning, and follow it to the end, in a straight line to it's completion. Gene Roddenberry marketed Star Trek as "Wagon Train" to the stars. Wagon Train was a good, old fashioned, adventure story. You didn't have to ponder why they were on horses going where they were going. This movie is Wagon Train. Sit back, get the popcorn and enjoy a fantastic trip to the moons of Jupiter. Don't worry, you won't have to look for some deep meaning, it's obvious. Enjoy.
