Hard to grasp why this 1976 relic is so revered, mostly by film buffs. Watching it unencumbered by hype, one is struck by how bad the acting is and how TV-ish the script. The plot is completely implausible: I laughed at it. In the middle of S. Central LA, a police station is being "closed" and no one seems to notice when a huge gang assaults it with rifles and guns blazing, for hours. You can hear crickets chirping in the station itself, which seems to be located in some type of park-like area. The interior looks like it was quickly remade from the set of a Western saloon, not a 1976 modern police station. I did enjoy seeing the vintage 70s cars: the cops all drive Ramblers! The girl who plays the station clerk wears a zombie-like expression throughout, even after she takes a bullet in the arm. Naturally, she falls a little for the death row inmate who kind of saves her. We never miss a chance, either, to shoot her in her tight sweater. If you need a laugh at an old-fashioned type of 70s movie, give this a scan.
