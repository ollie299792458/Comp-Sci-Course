Perhaps the best aspect of this movie has to be the introduction of major players in the DC universe (notably Wonder Woman and the Martian Manhunter) who had hitherto been absent in either the 1990's WB Batman or Superman series.
Backed by a strong plot, the movie (titled "Secret Orgins"; originally a three part story) explores the manner by which Superman draws his fellow superheroes into a unified team for the purpose to protect the planet.  The backstories of Diana [a.k.a] Wonder Woman and J'onn Jonzz [a.k.a] Martian Manhunter are revealed throughout the course of the story.  Intriguing character relationships are introduced (i.e. the Flash and Green Lantern) and the series' intergalactic setting is introduced.
It is unfortunate, however, that more special features were not included on this disc (beyond the standard trailers and character profiles).  Especially missed was commentary featuring series creator Bruce Timm included on previous Batman and Superman DVD discs.  
Overall, "Secret Origins" is a welcome addition to the WB version of the DC universe and serves as springboard to the future stories of the Justice League which carry the heroes from the boundaries of Earth to the far reaches of the universe.
