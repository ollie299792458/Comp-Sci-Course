This excellent movie reinterprets the tragedy of Iphigenia in Aulis in a new way. The underlying fabric of the plot brings to our attention many human characteristics such as ambition, jealousy, the need to comply with necessity, not omitting vanity, weakness, despair, hate and opportinism (on the part of Odysseus). The script is superb and convincing since it adds insight of psychology to the myth. The result is a story that unravels with logic the underlying factors of crime and vengence.

The actors are fascinating : Agamenon - and finally Menelaos - transmit their despair about Chalchos' claim of disguised vengeance for the accidental killing of the divine deer by Agamenon's troops who try to provide food for a starving army that is on the brink of revolt; the ruthless and cunning Odysseus pulls his strings from behind, being helped by the priest Chalchos ; Clytemnestra (the most excellent Irene Papas) is betrayed by her husband and becomes unforgiving for the murder of her daughter. And finally the innocent Iphigenia, a girl that seems to consist of fine marble, animated by breath and who is the victim of the sacrifice. The situation is out of control and devoid of reason since the monstrous Greek army has one objective only: invading Troy at all cost.

A powerful movie of high aesthetic value, superbe acting and an insight in human nature that does not fail one moment. Superb!
