First off I would like to make it perfectly clear that I am a huge fan of the Wrong Turn movies.  I saw the first one, loved it, and became even move impressed by the second even though I haven't really seen the second one in it's entirety from the beginning.  And I loved the new traps, blood, and gore in the third Wrong Turn.  But this one is by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen.  It disgraces the Wrong Turn movies more then American Pie Presents Band Camp or even American Pie Presents The Book Of Love (A film I won't even see because it has gotten so many bad reviews) disgraces and insults the American Pie movies.  IN THIS REVIEW I WILL POINTS OUT THE MISTAKES ONE BY ONE IN NUMBERS.

MISTAKE 1 (the beginning of the movie)
-At the beginning of this movie you see an insane asylum that seems worst then even your typical insane asylum with Dr. Brendon Ryan showing Dr. Ann Marie McQuaid (a psychologist) where the cannibals from the Wrong Turn series are kept in the insane asylum, in the year 1974.  You see Dr. Ryan telling Dr. McQuaid about how the cannibals in the movie were found eating their parents in the woods of West Virginia causing them to be locked up where they have eaten a few of their own body parts and that was the only thing this movie did right to live up to it's name.  Doctor Ryan also talks about how the cannibals are smart and have a disorder that allows them to fell no pain what so ever.  After that scene it was like the idiot director and creator of the film decided to ruin the fun of the cannibals trying to escape form the mental institute (as if they hadn't already made a mistake by not showing them in the woods eating their parents, getting captured, and taken to the insane asylum), by just having one cannibal throw what seemed to be a vintage 1960's hair barrette to the smarter cannibals in another jail cell allowing them to pick their cell lock.  After the cannibals pick the lock, a guard comes into where they escaped and is eaten by them.  Then the cannibals who picked the lock open all the other cannibals cells and chaos breaks out.  And as you might guess even though it only shows the cannibals killing Dr. Ryan and Dr. McQuaid they kill everyone and that's the end of their time with the insane asylum and anywhere in the movie from 1974-2002.

MISTAKE 2 (the time period the rest of this movie takes place in)
-Next the director takes you to a college in West Virginia where a bunch of students are in a dorm getting ready to go up to a cabin in the mountains for a ski trip in the year 2003.  Then the group of college students going to the cabin on a ski trip, as you might guess park their car, ride snow mobiles, get lost in a severe snow storm trying to find the cabin and end up settling in at the insane asylum out in the middle of no where the cannibals escaped form in 1974.  Again dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb every single movie that takes place in the past it seems like takes place in this past decade.  Why?  This past decade wasn't that great, sure the internet & cell phone technology from the 1990's was developing tremendously, but the economy was bad and it didn't have the good fashion statements, images, design styles, and fads the past decades did.  Plus the music scene from this past decade is by far the worst ever.  And worst of all the first Wrong Turn movie was made the same year this piece of crap took place talk about a whole in one screw up.  Why not just have the movie take place in the 1970's, 80's or 90's?

MISTAKE 3 (The college students seemed too venerable)
-When the college students in this film decide to spend the night in the cannibals abandon insane asylum out in the middle of no where during a severe snow storm where their cell phones don't work, they park their snow mobiles in front of it and one student (Porter) is instructed to bring their bags into the insane asylum.  Then all the college students except the one (Porter) bringing in the over night bags make it into the insane asylum.  Next you see 3 cannibals have killed Porter before he had a chance to bring in the over night bags and are taking his body into the insane asylum.  Then you see the rest of the college students exploring the insane asylum, turning on the power, getting drunk off Dr. Ryan's scotch, getting stoned, finding an old 1970's film canister containing brutal therapy treatment to one of the cannibals and watching it on a projection screen.  Then one college student tells the rest about the Wrong Turn cannibals legend.  Then all the college students except one (Vincent) get a good nights rest.  As you might guess Vincent was killed in the night because he decided to wonder off.  OK, lets be completely honest here, after seeing the first 3 Wrong Turn films do we really think the cannibals are going to let the college students get a good night's rest?  And do we really think they would kill the toughest target in the one college student who is up first?  And how much time do we really think the Cannibals would take to dismantle the college kids snow mobiles and take there belongings before they decide to hunt them?

MISTAKE 4 (All the college kids except 4 (3 killed by the cannibals) have a chance to kill them and they don't do it)
-The college students find out about the cannibals when they see them killing one of the college student's girl friend's with a barb wire noose, they run to their snow mobiles and find out they don't work.  Then one of the college kids goes off skiing through the woods of the cannibals insane asylum to find help.  The rest of the college kids are stuck in the insane asylum trying to defend them selves from the cannibals with sharp object type weapons they find in the basement of the insane asylum.  A little over half way though the film, you see the college kid who went off skiing to find help freezing her but off near a small fire she made that ends up being put out by a snow drift .  Then you see the rest of the college students except for 2 of them lure the 3 cannibals through a fire trap with their weapons into a jail cell, close the door, and lock it.  Then you see the one male college student who hasn't been killed by the cannibals pouring kerosene into the jail cell the cannibals are trapped in getting ready to burn them to death with a cigarette lighter have a sudden change of heart from words said to him by his friends causing him to change his mind about killing the cannibals after the cannibals had kept their mouth's shut (when asked) about the parts they had taken off the college kids snow mobiles to dismantle them.  OK, would any of the rest of the people the cannibals are hunting in the other Wrong Turn movies have done the same in this situation?

MISTAKE 5 (The ending)
-OK time for the ending, it's pretty simple everyone dies.  2 girls are killed by one of the cannibals traps at the very end and the girl who went off skiing ends up freezing to death.  Then after the 2 girls are killed you see one of the cannibals drive the toe truck they had in the other Wrong Turn movies to retrieve their remains.  Good job not showing us how the cannibals got their toe truck Mr. idiot director, producer, and screen writer.  Yeah I take it the cannibals lived in the cabin they lived in, in the first Wrong Turn too another thing that wasn't shown to us in this film.

So basically all in all Wrong Turn 4 (The Beginnings) does not live up to it's title one bit, is basically just a crappy remake of the first Wrong Turn, and should have been done like this:
-Starts off in the 1950's showing the cannibals being born and possibly them being kicked out of school (who knows they could have been home schooled before they ate their parents anyways).
-Show's them going to the insane asylum for eating their parents in the late 1960's early 1970's.
-The movie should have shown the cannibals escaping and starting what they did in all the other Wrong Turns in the mid 1970's.  Their they could have shown how the Cannibals got their toe truck instead of just bringing it in out of now where at the end of the movie at basically the same time the first Wrong Turn took place.
-And in the end the insane asylum should have been burned down and at least one person should have survived.

If you want a good movie about the beginning's of a monster in a horror film I would strongly not recommend this garbage.  Instead I would recommend the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning, Rob Zombie's Halloween, or Tremors 4.
And on my final note even though it's completely off topic, I would like to send a message out to the idiots who made this garbage Wrong Turn 4 movie.  What's next for you idiots, making a movie about the video game The Final Fight (A film that should clearly take place in the early 1990's), having Duane "The Rock" Johnson play Andore (someone who clearly should be played by Dalip "The Great Kali" Singh Rana with his skin lightened tremendously) and having it take place when this piece of crap garbage Wrong Turn 4 movie took place?
