Just to inform the public about these 4 movies
 Poirot: Classic Crimes Collection (The Mystery of the Blue Train / After the Funeral / Cards on the Table / Taken at the Flood) Starring David Suchet
are great movies and just to insure the public that Agatha Christie Did not write the poirot series with
 Hugh Fraser, Philip Jackson and Pauline Moran in every movie
that the writers who started to make the Poirot series after 1988
they put those three people in the stories with the permission of her Granson who runs the company
because it made it seem like a "family"
Please go on amazon and put in
Poirot The movie Collection 4 as it has
the DVD called Mystery slueths
and gives all the history with David Suschet, Hugh Fraser, Philip Jackson and Pauline Moran  giving actual movie information
very worth the cost $20.01 new and $17.99 like new
The info for the movie is Two actual movies and
"EXCLUSIVE BONUS PROGRAM: Super Sleuths, a documentary about the series featuring stars David Suchet, Philip Jackson, Hugh Fraser, and Pauline Moran; producer Brian Eastman; director Ed Bennett; writer Anthony Horowitz; and others.
So do invest in a great seriess which lasted 16 yrs on British TV and Masterpiece theater. Personally I own all the complete series of Poirot
