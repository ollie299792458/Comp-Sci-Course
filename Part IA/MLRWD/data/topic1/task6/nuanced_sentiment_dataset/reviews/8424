Out of every godzilla film I've seen, I would definitly say this is the wierdest. The story is good and actually quite effective. If we continue to pollute our planet, this is what could happen.
Hedorah himself actually looks very good, and he goes through more than one form. Big G is kinda goofy, with big eyes and a plain suit. I noticed he swayed and stood alot, with this really wierd music playing while he did so. The battles aren't great, and the characters are completely random (as usual).
At the very beginning, this kid comes out and starts playing with his godzilla toys. What he does with them is put them at the top of his slide, watch them slide down , go get them and do it again. That part made me laugh.
As much of the movie was funny as it was scary. The monster (hedorah) was tougher than one may have thought, and godzilla had some trouble. There are no other kaiju in this film, just Hedorah and Godzilla. It probably wouldn't be much better even if every giant monster was in it. On second thought, that could have been cool.
To sum up, it isn't the best Godzilla film at all, but other ones from the same series such as Godzilla vs. Gigan and Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla are much better. Of course you can always check out the other series, and in particular the newest ones from the millenium series, such as Godzilla against Mechagodzilla, Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S or Godzilla final wars. There are 3 others from the millenium series, 7 from the heisei series and 15 from the showa series, including this film, which is from the showa series. Hope this was helpful to anyone who was wondering!
