Clint Eastwood starred and directed this `1971 fatal attraction.' Eastwood is a late-night DJ that has one fan that just can't get enough of him.  The film is based on a true story of a women stalker whose flair-ups are scarier than Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction.  Watching this film I found myself wishing she would just go away. She drove me crazy! The character of Evelyn Draper was develop and portrayed very well by Jessica Walker.  She is very suffocating and what a temper.  The way Walker stalks Eastwood would frighten anyone!  There's enough suspense for any viewer. It's not the caliber of Fatal Attraction (#15 on my Top 20 Films), but if Fatal is the benchmark, and there are a lot of similarities like, girl meets guy in bar, girl stalks him, girl cuts her wrists, the restaurant scene, man's regret for crossing the line and the confrontation. What's the best line in the movie? When Eastwood turns to the police sergeant McCallum and said, "what she needs is psychiatric help," and McCallum replies, "really!" Play Misty for Me is an excellent film. This film is rated R, due to graphic violence and sex.
