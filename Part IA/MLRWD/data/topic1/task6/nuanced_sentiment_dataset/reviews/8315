This is an excellent overview of evolution. What sets it apart are the diverse topics addressed. The dramatic reenactments of Charles Darwin in the Galapagos Islands and at home were very well done.

There is plenty here so one can return to it repeatedly without tiring of it.

Some may disagree but I thought the episode about religion vs. evolution was handled perfectly. While it's thorough and clear about which side has all the evidence, I don't think the documentary goes so far that it would offend or turn off most religious viewers who are negative towards evolution. While they might not go away convinced, I can't imagine them becoming so upset they would turn away in horror or anything like that. Those who have a problem with evolution should make the effort to watch this, if only to think a little more deeply about the subject.

I highly recommend this work.
