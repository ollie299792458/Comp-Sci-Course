The worst Nicolas Cage movie of all time, this movie appears to have potential but is a disappointment. The movie is about two soldiers (Cage and Slater) who are assigned to protect Navajo Indians during WWII. The Navajos have been trained to use their language as a military "code" to help disguise communications. This concept is actually very interesting, and a story which COULD make a great movie. This movie, however, is FAR from great. 
The plot is thin, and the story ends up being mostly a cheesy action movie. The main conflict occurs when Nic Cage has to decide what is more important - the lives of the Navajo's or "the code." The problem is, the movie quickly degrades into meaningless sequences of action scenes interrupted by a little dialogue. I think Nic Cage kills about 200 enemy troops in one battle.
Another problem I have is that the reason the movie seems appealing (the Navajo language/ code etc...) Is BARELY used to enhance the movie. It is merely a gimmick to sell this otherwise completely carbon-copy war movie.
In summary, if what you are seeking is a sub-standard war movie that has already been done many times (and done MUCH, MUCH better) just because you own every other war movie....then you might like this movie. If you want depth of character, real emotion, the suspension of disbelief, and the gruesome reality of war...then buy ANY other war movie.
