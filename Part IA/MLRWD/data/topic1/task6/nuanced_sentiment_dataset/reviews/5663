A couple trying to cope with the death of thier 15 year old daughter individually handle themselves in a way that works for them.  Three people who are completely different get to know each other and all have ways of helping each other cope with where their lives are at.  After going to New Orleans on a business trip, Doug Riley (Gandolfini) meets Mallory (Stewart) and tries to take care of her (like a daughter).  Let me start by saying that Kristen Stewart is a good actress (when not playing Bella) and hold her own with Tony Soprano.  This is another movie that is only watchable because of the performances.  I enjoyed it, but if the acting was bad it would have been hard to sit through.  This is a completely character driven story so if your looking for action I'd look elsewhere, but if you want a well done drama you've come to the right place.  Story is OK, acting again makes this a better movie then it is.  I give it a B.

Would I watch it again? - If it was on TV I would not immediatly change the channel.
