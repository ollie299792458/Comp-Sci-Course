This movie lacks of everything : Story is nonsense, actors are wooden, edition is horrible, trailed had more CGI than the movie itself (the trailer was even more dramatic and better developed than the movie itself!!) and absolute boring and mediocre music.

Anyone who spent $ just to see a 2 min footage of the Kraken (in the trailer you can see more of it than in the movie) and say this is just for "fun" and the "CGI were good" its totally insane.

The plot is ridiculous! gods want to punish men for their disrespect, but at the end of the movie they remain unpunished, and gods had no problem with it!

The pacing is bad as it could be! In 10 minutes the story is in the middle of the plot.

The music has nothing to do with the greeks, or even with epic movies, or anything. Djawadi is just a sucker of Zimmer and get works just cos he is a student of him. His composition are dull, boring, lack of inspiration, and badly orquestrated (he doesnt even use real instruments, just orquestra samplers, and he doesnt know how to use those softwares yet, you can see he just do his less effort if you know the posibilities of those softwares)

For people who dont understand why this movies are made like this : ITS JUST TO CREATE A SORT OF FRANCHISE. If you think they made a movie after a game will make lot of sense, you have at least 90% of fight scenes (men against Hades spirits, guys against scorpions, guys against monster in the woods, guys against medusa, guys against kraken)
For an Arcade game, this is ok, it is suposed you spend more time playing than watching scenes with story development. WHICH IS TOTALLY OPPOSITE TO WHAT A MOVIE SHOULD BE!! Its the same with the star wars prequels.
But we know Luca$$ is a greedy bast and wants to win money only, and he has to make his PC and PS2 games faithfull to the movie, but lets cut with the greed you hollywood animals!!

Avoid this movie at ALL COST!! This is a NON BUY OR DIE situation!!
