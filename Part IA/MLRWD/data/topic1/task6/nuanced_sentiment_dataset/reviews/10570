......and not so concerned about driving the damn RV the next morning  they wouldn't have been in this mess !!
I have to give this gem five stars because it's just that good . I'm quite fond of horror movies from this era because they freaked us out as kids and make us laugh our fannies off as adults .  " Race With the Devil " is truly entertaining , delivers the goods and worth every penny . It has something for everyone . Thrills , action , suspense, proper buriel techniques of family pets while on the road and most importantly - hospitality and tourism of the mid west .
The story starts out normal enough , two couples starting out on a road trip in their stylish Vogue RV bound for Aspen . But with all the great camping grounds across this counrty , they instead decide to pull off the highway.( you know those little access roads you see when your driving along on an interstate and you think to yourself " I wonder what's up there ? " - well now you know ! )After seeing something sinister in the thicket and being blown off by the local fuzz , Frank ( Warren Oates )
declares " We're gonna take care of this when we get to Amarillo .( oh ,
excuse me , Frank calls it Am-eh-rilla )Only they didn't know getting there would be half the fun ! What starts out as a horror movie quickly becomes an action adventure that rivels " Duel " . There are plenty of chase scenes ( I never knew an RV could go so fast ! ) full of cars that blow up in mid air before they actually hit anything and a gratuitous snake wrestling scene that makes you realize that swinging a rattler over your head and beating it on the floor is sometimes the best way to kill it . Add this flick to your movie library and watch it before and after every road trip you take . You won't be disappointed !!
