In the 1976 film, "All The President's Men" Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman portray the two legendary journalists (Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, respectively) who first broke the Watergate scandal.

The film focuses moslty on the build up to the break, illustrating the journalists contrast in their approaches to get information (in one scene Bernstein tricks a woman into verifying information by pretending that another source already named names.  When the woman agrees and even ADDS to the information, Bernstein knows that his information was correct) and their struggle to go against the government in an attempt to uncover the truth.

Though the story itself is quite interesting, the film does little to hold the viewers attention.  Most scenes include little to no movement, merely bland dialouge between characters occasionally punctuated by a tid bit of information about another character...information that was already suspected and merely needed to be confirmed.

The film stops short of what had the potential to be the most interesting part of the film: the trial of those involved.  Instead, the film closes as it opens: with information being displayed as it is being typed on a typewritter.  A rather weak conclusion to, what basically is, two hours of information gathering.

All in all this film would be of intrest to those who have a real passion for reasearching, making calls, and taking notes...and that's about all it would be of interest to.
