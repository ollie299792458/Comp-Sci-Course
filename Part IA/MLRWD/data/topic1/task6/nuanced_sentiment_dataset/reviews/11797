I'm a little confused as to why this movie gets so much negative response. I personally really enjoy it and find the entire movie to be a great adventure. I Love the gadgets and advancements the Mariner (Costner) has on his awesome sea craft. It's great to see modern items we take for granted to be held in such high regards in their world.
It takes little more than a halfway decent imagination to fill in blanks the film doesn't spell out for you word-for-word. I like that there are pieces to the puzzle you're left to conclude yourself. Who knows what may have happened to cause Costner's character to mutate (for those of you who've not seen this movie, it's a slight mutation, not a freakish show of sorts. He simply has gills behind his ears and webbed feet) -- a lot of radiation and nuclear hazards exsist in the world -- who's to say he didn't run into a pile of hazardous waste at some point prior to or even during the appocalyptic glacier-melting that helped advance his evolved state? It's a great movie to get lost in and allow your imagination to go wild. 5 stars.
