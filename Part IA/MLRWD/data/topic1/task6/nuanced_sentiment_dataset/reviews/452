I watched this film in English class in addition to the Zefferelli version, which I can reccommend much more. At least see it, or read the play, before you see this. This would be a really cool, artsy film. However, Lhurmann tries too hard to be prolific, when he doesn't realize that the story itself is prolific enough.
For those of you who already know the play: The Capulets are decked out in leather and spurs, while the Montagues wear hawaiian shirts, that, for the most part, stay unbuttoned throughout the film. That's one bit of advice I might add: Keep your shirts on. Also, the opening sequences, indeed, everything till about the balcony scene, is cluttered, crazy, and hard to follow, unless you already know the sequence of events pretty well. Once everything calms down, you can really enjoy the symbolism of the film.
Also: A few characterization problems: In the play, Benvolio is more of a peacemaker. That seems to be forgotten in this film. Also, making Mercutio into a drag queen was just too much. It means nothing to the actual development of the plot, it's just there for...I'm trying to decide between entertainment and further confusion, so I don't really have an answer to that right now.
In conclusion, whether you're a shakespeare person, or a movie person, you'll find that this film, though the idea has good potential, was executed in a way that was, perhaps, just a bit too over the top to make it good.
