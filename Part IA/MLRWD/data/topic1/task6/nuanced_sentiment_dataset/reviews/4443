Please note that the 3 stars is for the movie only.  The "Digital Copy" is the biggest issue I had with the blue-ray release.  I have both and iPhone and iPad with a definite enjoyment of being able to easily obtain my digital copies until now.  I still have yet to be able to do anything with my Ultraviolet Digital copy of the film or the bonus movie Emerald Knights (great idea to offer this).  According to the Ultraviolet website, downloading a copy will not be available until 12/20 (which in my opinion is a joke and should be available now.  I am currently unable to stream the movies because there is currently no link between my Ultraviolet Digital Locker and my Flixter account. I was able to see the movies available in my locker for about the first couple of hours after redeeming my code but they have been replaced with an error message about a problem with my collection.  Customer service for Ultraviolet leaves a lot to be desired as well as I am still dealing with the issue of not being able to get to my movies.  Most of the movie studios are supporting Ultraviolet so it does not look like it is going away anytime soon.  I do like that, once fixed, the service will work on more devices than previous digital copies.  I just think that it was launched way to early and do not think it was tested by consumers (which for something like this, testing should have been made at the consumer level before it was released).  I hope the studios or Ultraviolet executives see reviews like this and others that have already been written so they realize there is a problem with this that needs to be addressed.
