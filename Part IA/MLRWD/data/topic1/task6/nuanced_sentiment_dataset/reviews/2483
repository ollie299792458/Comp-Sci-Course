I won't enter into the gripe about this being a collection of shorts.  Everyone has already done a decent job at addressing that.  But what I will do is provide my insights into this collection of vignettes from the DC Universe.

SHAZAM - This is the one that brought me to the party.  I was curious to see what they would do with Shazam and the Man of Steel.  Honestly, it was a superpowered street fight.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but this could have been so much more.

THE SPECTRE - I didn't really know anything about the Spectre before seeing this short.  I think it was well done and like the Crime Noir feel to it.  The ending was especially cool.

GREEN ARROW - I am a bit of a fan of The Green Arrow, whether that's the traditional flavor or the 21st Century Smallville incarnation.  This Emerald Archer outing is a fun ride and draws the viewer in to a quick outing that's a bit Robin Hood, and a bit Die Hard.  Nicely done.

JONAH HEX - Again, I've got to plead ignorance when it comes to Jonah Hex.  The story setting was done well enough.  But I just didn't get much of a feel on who our anti-hero was or why he was so interested in his prey.  The interaction was intriguing enough.  Just not sure what it told me about Jonah Hex, or why i should care.

DC and WB certainly didn't cheap out on the voice talent.  There's a great array of talented actos and actresses here, from series regulars to pleasant surprises.  In the end, I'd say this one is worth a rent, or a bargain-bin clearance.  But save your money for one of the full length features.  This peek through the fence only gives a fleeting glimpse of the heroics.
