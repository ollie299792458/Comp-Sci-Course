I'm a major River Phoenix fan. He was the finest actor of my generation - simple as that. He had that rare ability to make you feel...in every film he did. IMO, this is some of his greatest work. You can almost touch his vunerability - that's how powerful it is. You forget your watching River...he totally becomes his character Mike. And of all the Keanu Reeves movies I've seen, I thought he did some of his best acting here. He and River were a great team. They had done a film before this together and their deep affection for each other and their friendship is clear - it shows through. It may have been working with his good friend, River, that made his acting so great in this film. They worked well off each other - and it showed. When I first rented this movie, I didn't get it...thought it was so wierd...and wondered why in the hell would River and Keanu do a film like this??? That was my mistake - I didn't give it a fair chance the first time...only half heartedly watching. But a few months later, I rented it again...feeling I had missed something the first time around - and I'm so glad I did. This is a raw, messy masterpiece that absolutely deserves your attention. River's performance alone is worth the price of the dvd. It touched me...made me laugh and cry. this movie will stay with you for awhile because River's performance is so hauntingly good. The ending was sad to me. But I think it's what you make of it. To me, River will always be searching...and that was Keanu's character that drives by in the end and picks him up. Have a nice day!
