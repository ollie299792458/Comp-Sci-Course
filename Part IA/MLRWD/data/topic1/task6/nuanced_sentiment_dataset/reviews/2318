It's telling that the marketers of "Legion" felt the need to flat-out lie to sell this movie.  Here is a quote from the DVD jacket: "Evil's armies are amassing. Armed and united by Archangel Michael, a group of strangers becoming unwitting soldiers on the front line of the Apocalypse.  Their mission: protect a waitress and her sacred unborn child from the relentless, bloddy siege of the demonic legion."

I watched the entire movie and here is the truth of the plot:
 1) God is angry with the world and is seeking to destroy it. He has charged Michael to carry out these plans.  Michael disobeys God and cuts off his wings. Then he goes to a truck stop to protect an unborn child.

 2) God then sends a legion of angels (not demons)to possess "weak people" to destroy mankind. One angel-possessed elderly lady uses the f-word and a few other expletives while saying "all the babies are going to burn" before she climbs up the ceiling and severely bites a man in the neck.  The fact that these are people are "angel-possessed" is spelled out very clearly by Michael and there is no room for interpretation.

 3) After much more carnage God sends Archangel Gabriel to finish the job. Of course our "hero" Michael is victorious in the end, and God sees the error of his ways and gives mankind another chance.

It's obvious to me that the makers of this movie don't have a clue as to who God is, but they are clever enough to lie because the truth would hurt their sales.  I regret buying this movie, and it will go out with next trash pick-up.
