-FALSE ADVERTISMENT-

The views expressed in the following post do not reflect the specific opinions or beliefs of paramount or John K.

Special features are ok, but I would have no problems JUST having all of the episodes COMPLETE and UNCUT. I thought UNCUT was un edited and/or not tampered with by the man, or who ever tampers with things that people with a good sense of humor enjoy and all of the other worker bees don't get.
Anyway... I wouldn't write this had they not cut one of my all time favorite scenes... The Big Baby Scam bathtub scene is one of the reasons I bought the set, the part where Grandpa starts Whistling to R&S, yet it is nowhere to be seen.
What does this mean, oh I'll tell ya what it means... I am taking this CRAP back, getting my money and will stick to watching my less than good quality "unofficial" R&S DVD that I got from Ebay, at least whoever recorded it had the decency to leave the scene in, Its cool to have these shows on DVD finally but it seems all for not.

There are some really funny scenes that they added but for every scene added there is one taken away.

I think they need to offer an additional dvd with all of the uncut-sorry we did cut them episodes for those of us that were outraged enough to bother contacting them, maybe an online registry where you can register the dvd and get a copy of the actual uncut episodes. I could go on for a while but I won't.

Shame on Paramount duping John K's fans. yeah, blame someone else, Don't lend your name to an inferior product.
Very misleading.
Bunch of Circus midgets!!!

Only get this if you have never watched ren and stimpy in your life, or you have a serious short term memory problem, you haven't missed anything.

Did George Lucas work on the editing team?

If anyone wants to write or call here is what I found...
