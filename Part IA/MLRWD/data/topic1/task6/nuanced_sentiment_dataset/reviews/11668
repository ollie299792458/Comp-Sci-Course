This is a very good ppv and in my mind is underrated. It has 3 main matches so what can one ask for! And it is also historical because of the debut of the Undisputed Title.
Scotty 2 Hotty& Albert vs Test and Christian-- Good match. The crowd really got into the ppv with this match and it did not dissapoint. ***
Edge vs Regal- Another good match, but could've used more action Look for Edge to become popular this year and run after the WWF Title. ** 1/2
Jeff vs Matt Hardy- Disappointing. With all the events leading up to this match it disappointed everyone. They both are aerial fighters and this whole match was done on the ground. * 1/2
Dudleys vs Kane and Big Show- good match! Dudleys always put up a good show at PPVs and the 2 big guys really show their power in this match. ***
RVD vs Undertaker-- GREAT! Lots of action and away from the ring action! RVD earned the Mr PPV title this PPV. ****
Stone Cold vs Angle-- Good! These 2 are great against each other. Lots of action and all. *** 1/2
The Rock vs Jericho-- Not really fast paced. However not bad. ** 1/2
Stone Cold vs Jericho-- Everyone wanted Jericho to win this match even though he is really the bad guy. It was good and started out good and ended well. ***
