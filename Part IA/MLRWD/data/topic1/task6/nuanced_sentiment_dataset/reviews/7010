The first time I saw Jack Black was in "Orange County," and that performance single-handedly made him my favorite pop movie comedian. The first time I saw Michael Cera was in Superbad, which, while good, was definitely overshadowed by the cocky, spontaneous "McLovin." Nevertheless, Cera's later movies continuously placed him in the awkward, shy role, one people could relate to and find amusing. If you go into "Year One" looking for Black and Cera to reprise their standard movie roles such as the ones I described you won't be disappointed. Black's weird/stoned facial gestures, Cera's  awkwardness, and Beavis and Butthead-esque jokes comprise the bulk of this movie's humor. Every other actor, with exception of the characters that play Abraham and Isaac (McLovin!), are pretty mediocre/bad. The stunts are fairly well done as are the historical jokes/pop culture references. I, surprisingly (given the many negative reviews), found myself laughing out loud pretty often. Yet, I recommend you rent this first. You might be surprised just how much you like it's exploration of ancient funny stuff.
