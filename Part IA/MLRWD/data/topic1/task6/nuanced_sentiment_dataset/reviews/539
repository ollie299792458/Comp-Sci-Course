What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a story about real life. It deals with real people, in real situations with real feelings. It tells the story that everyone knows, but won't talk about. A family who loves one another desperatly, but can't seem to find the words to express it. It's not just about any one character in particular, it's about the Family as a whole. Though they may seem disfunctional, they are completly normal and they are about each and every one of us. Each character in this film speaks to someone on a personal level. Those of us who have had a developementally disabled relative, the teenager who is annoyed by everyone and everything, the one who is the "Adult" in the family, the one who takes care of everything and wants to get away but can't, and the relative that is different from most and we try to pretend they don't exisit...at least not to us. Gilbert Grape tells us that we're okay. Everyone is different and that makes each and every one of us special in our own way. Imagine your family for just a moment without the mentally challenged relative, or the quirky teenager exploring the big world ahead of them, or the one that the family pretends doesn't exisit. Your life would be forever changed dramatically without them. It teaches us that we should embrace those people in our lives, love them, qualify their existence, to be a family, because in a moment, they could be gone. Excellent writing and acting by all involved. A classic. A film that will stay with you forever and bring you back often to watch it.  =)
