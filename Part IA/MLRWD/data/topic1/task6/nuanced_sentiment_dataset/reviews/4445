In the 1960's these movies were my Sunday morning treat on TV. However, I am very surprised how much more I like these movies now. Every movie is filled with fantastic displays of musical scores and performances. I appreciate the sound coming through stereo speakers rather than a small tv speaker (as it was). The picture is fantastic. Of course, all is mastered and digital. Back in the day it was ONLY a straight antenna and reception was not so good.

These two guys are just so in "time". They use their talents to develop skits which were later episodes on the TV series. Sometimes in a movie Bud throws a line to Lou whereas in the TV series the roles are reversed.

I bought all four of the volumes of movies and the entire TV series as well. If you search Amazon you will also find a couple of other movies that are not in this collection like Abbott & Costello in Hollywood and Lost in a Harem.

The movies are just pure fun. I leave you with a line from Bud Abbott as he says, "May you live as long as you want and never want as long as you live." Enjoy!
