Truly awful! I'd say this is one of the worst, if not the worst movie I've ever seen. I was tired when I started watching this, and couldn't figure out why I was perceiving no story and terrible acting, it was like a bad dream. I gave it 20 minutes before fast forwarding purely just to see if Clare would 'get her kit off' to warrant the R16 rating, but alas there was no redemption. I saw the comparisons to "Vanilla Sky" and "Lost in Translation" on the back of the DVD. Ha ha, that's rich! Vanilla Sky is definitely a cerebral movie, but is clever, edgy and well written (nothing in common so far). Lost in Translation is nothing like this movie, a slow and subtle touching encounter between two strangers in a foreign environment. Joaquin is so much better than this, yet it was like watching a school play being rehearsed badly. The same applies to Claire, who was actually pretty good in Shop Girl and who knows what Sean was thinking? What a waste of energy and talent, quite like sleepwalking really. Zee from Egypt liked it, perhaps it is 'lost in translation'? :)
