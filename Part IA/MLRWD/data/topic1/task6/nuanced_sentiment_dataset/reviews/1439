This movie has always intrigued me since I first saw it on cable several times. It is a true story about a high school coach who, on a bet from his team, at age 35 or there about, tries out for the major leagues. He thought it was just a joke until he actually makes the team as a relief pitcher. It's also more than a "sports movie" it's about a family who struggles with the decision to go through with this while barely getting by when he's in AA and AAA ball. The acting is good and quite realistic. The little kid who plays the son practically steals the show. The scene that chokes me up every time is when he makes the call to his wife about the blue sport jacket.
You really need to view this on Blu-Ray. It's beautifully shot (Hey, it's Disney, right?) mostly outdoors in the bright sun. Fantastic.

Also what knocked me out was the DVD extras. There are interviews and footage of the real guy on the mound. Wow, this "old man" had an arm! One little thing, the movie character I think was a right hander but the real guy was a lefty and man could he bring the heat. But that really doesn't matter, it's all about the story. Get it.
