I've been watching movies for a long time,50 years, to be exact.

One of the main ideas is that some movie-makers are not making action movies anymore. They're making action blurs/blurbs, like music videos, etc. When there is an action scene, you can't see what's going on;you have to infer as to what is happening?? I remember action films such as "Enter the Dragon", Bruce Lee, where you could clearly see and hear the actors/stuntpersons as they performed their crafts.

Today, the films (many) seem to be made in a coldron of boiling water. The audio is very low (almost inaudible)or mumbly/gargley. I turned my home audio system up in order to be able to hear it better and comprehend the low throaty words.

Then an action scene rushes in and blasts the

Heavens out of kilter. I suppose it may seem that I am picking on

this one movie (The Bourne Supremacy), but actually, this one reminds me of what's wrong with many of the newer ideas in movie-making. To bad, I really wanted to see it, but once I started watching and listening, I was forced to remember some of the negatives which is inherent the newer (1998 - now) action movies. A saving grace, perhaps is that Matt Damon is a very good actor and the plot is great. Wish I could have enjoyed the clearity of action; and the audibility of

normal speech without action . . .
