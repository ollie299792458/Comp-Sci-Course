Maybe I am missing more then I think I am, but would you try to organize a heist with a fugitive whom the whole country is after?  I think not.  The cinematography is great, the silence is great, Yves Montand is great, but Allain Delon as a cold, calculating thief?  Again, I think not.  A complete miscast, including the ridiculously silly get-up - the trenchcoat (which is not taken off even during a game of billiards).  The man sticks out as a sore thumb everywhere he goes.  Also, not to nitpick, but even for a movie where fast, cheap action is supposedly not important, that train escape is even more ludicrous.  Jumping through the barrely broken window of a moving train?  Why not try to overcome the decrepit inspector, who's still tired from the sleep and has his back turned on you?  The script contains too many holes, which were amplified by the clumsy execution of the few "action" scenes.  Give me Jean Paul Belmondo or any of the american noir faces (Richard Widmark, RObert Mitchum...) any day of the week over these guys.  I really liked when the sharpshooter just took out the rifle from the stand and hit the keyhole during the heist.  Sweet.  Unfortunatelly, he is involved with Corey, who just got out from jail and wanted to get back in there quickly again.  Thus, he is trying to unload the jewelery to the guy who would not take it, even after he had agreed to do it, knowing it would be "hot".  Hmm.  Too many Deus ex Machina situations, too many silly and unbelivable characteers, too many cigarettes.  Music's cool though.
