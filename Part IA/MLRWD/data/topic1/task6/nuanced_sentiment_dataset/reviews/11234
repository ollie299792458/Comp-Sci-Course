Although riveting, and well acted and directed, CASE 39 falls short in a few significant ways.  Playing out like an extended episode of the X-Files (without Chris Carter's gift for economical exposition), Case 39 presents yet another take on the possessed-child-from-hell scenario.  Complete with shrieks and screams, Renee' Zellweger does her best to battle with the unseen force inhabiting the little girl's body, but to no avail.

Not only does the plot challenge us to suspend our belief in even a borderline rational story, it has the Zellweger character absolutely defying logic in her decision making.  Why does she take in this child?  Why does she experience murder upon murder, yet stay with the child?  Why does she answer the frickin' phone?  Why does she think burning down her house will extinguish the evil presence?  Why does she think the evil, once escaped from the burning house, will acquiesce and stay put in a submerged automobile trunk?  Oh, I get it!!  You have to DROWN the Devil!!

While this movie is indeed suspenseful, it degenerates into yet another remake of The Exorcist, sans enough exposition to explain the genesis of the girl's possession.  Neither the nature and length of her possession, nor the extent and range of her powers are ever explained.  The director expects us to go along with the premise, content to enjoy the unbelievable ride.

In the end CASE 39 is shallow and lacks even remote believability.  Why can't the Devil ever do mundane evil things like make cheesecake taste like cow manure or cause it to rain non-stop for three months?  The dude is ALWAYS killing people.
