It appears that this movie was either made or funded by the World Wildlife Fund and is obviously intended to persuade children to help support the survival of the remaining Tigers in the wild. Consider it a propaganda film for tigers, if you will. Humans are bad and don't understand the tigers and want to kill them all. Tigers are good and kind and will not hurt you if you are kind to them. A little reality please! Tigers are wild animals and just like any other wild animal they are extremely dangerous and deadly. This does not mean that they should be hunted to extinction or have their habitat destroyed. The tiger and its habitat are in danger of extinction and we need to prevent this from happening. There is nothing more beautiful to see than a tiger in the wild. Is propaganda the way to do this? I think not. Educate children, show them the beauty of nature and of all creatures and they will strive to understand and preserve them.

Now about the movie itself; the photography and sound are excellent. The beauty and sounds of the tigers are fully expressed in the movie. The storyline as others have said is somewhat depressing, except for the ending, and unrealistic most of the time but what the heck, this is a movie. I enjoyed it but would not recommend it for sensitive children. If you are an animal lover and not too sensitive I believe you will enjoy it too.
