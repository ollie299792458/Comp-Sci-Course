I will start out by saying that I did not pay to see this film. I paid to see Y Tu Mamma Tambien, and then went into The Sweetest Thing - because I wanted to see what a 1.75 million dollar screenplay looked like. Well, it looked like the kind of bad B-movie that I used to rent for fun back in the eighties. No story, no plot, no real humor and a lot of bad unbelievable dialogue. The main differance was that this film had a big star like Cameron Diaz instead of someone like Linnea Quigley or PJ Soles - and it was presented as A-level entertainment for theaters instead of a B-movie rental. 
I will say this. It was filmed just like a B-movie. It had terrible lighting (did they even have a gaffer on this mess) and editing, and Cameron Diaz is looking pretty used up like a lot B-movie attresses. Feel free to use a filter on the lens when your actors stay out all night partying - it's good for them and us.
I advise young people to stop going to the movies. Just stay home and rent some old films to see what story and plot can do for a film. I watched this film on Friday afternnon and I thought I was there for a least a week. On Saturday night, I took in a screening of Billy Wilder's Witness For The Prosecution and the time just flew by - full of laughs, twists and great acting. What a difference a day makes as the song goes.
One more thing. I have seen the American Pie movies that many people say started this whole gross out comedy trend (along with Something About Mary). The difference between those movies and The Sweetest Thing is a simple one. The makers of the American Pie movies like their characters, and they like the world they have created. (The most obvious reference points for those movies are Diner and American Graffiti.) The makers of the Sweetest Thing seem to hate the world and the people in it and it shows. It is cynical, manipulative and heartless. And it's boring to boot.
