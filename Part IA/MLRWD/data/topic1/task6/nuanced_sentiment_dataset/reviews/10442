I am buying Showtime for the next season!

With the writer's strike continuing, The Tudors has become my and my friends' new favorite show. As a history major, I admit my skepticism when my folks recommended I watch it, but I have been most pleasantly surprised!

While the history is sometimes accelerated or slight minor details are altered, the show does a fantastic job of weaving all aspects of the "King's Great Matter," and all of the variables of the English Reformation into the story line with general accuracy while still managing to be greatly entertaining. Filmmakers have taken such measures to stress the deep seated emotion and worry held by Henry VIII in regards to his inability to produce a male heir, and secure the Tudor dynasty in England.

The acting is superb, the costuming is a parade for the eyes, and the filming intense. This show captures your imagination and intrigue from the very start. It's got all of my college friends saying "Henry VIII was a rock star!" My girlfriends all saying "What would Anne do?"

Start watching The Tudors and before you know it you too will be shouting "I am the king of England!"
