Kate is good and Gena is great.

I've never seen a Kate Hudson film before and was pleasantly surprised.  The beginning had me doubting however because she fell flat on her face  w/ her reading of 'Treasure Island' -- I'd die too just to get away from her wooden delivery.

Rowland's accent is amazing at times - cuts you to the quick - and she plays 'the edge' so well; is she or isn't she?  Dinner scene near end of movie, watching her and Hudson play cat and mouse, was great fun - they did it very well.

Sets, design, sound and majority of casting all strong points.

Weak points - some loose ends that require repeated viewing; then they do make some sense but then some points never do 'gel'.

The ending?  Well worth waiting for, actually the whole movie is pretty good better than most slasher, x rated flicks.  Not on par with The Others however, nor the Sixth Sense which I am tired of people treating as the holy grail -  T6S was clever but not GREAT - well Toni C. was GREAT.

I'd rent Skeleton Key it but not own it.
