There are a few scary old movies I recall seeing when I was a kid back in the mid 70s, usually on a Saturday afternoon TV program called "Science Fiction Theater."  One had this doctor who gives some kind of injection into this guy's shoulder and later, when it's hurting like crazy, the guy pulls his shirt back and there's an eye growing in the skin!  It was enough to scare a 7 or 8 year old to death back then, and I never forgot it.

Recently I discovered the movie was called "The Manster," and I found it cheaper on Amazon than renting it (if the rental stores actually had it, that is).  The basic storyline is the mad scientist Dr. Suzuki, experimenting with unsuspecting victims, in this case Larry Stanford, a foreign correspondent working in Japan.  I'm not sure what the doctor's goal was, but the reporter spends most of his time drunk and enjoying himself with geisha girls.  Soon he gets the eye on his shoulder and the urge to kill someone.  Eventually a full head pops out, followed by more killings, police chases and... the plot isn't hard to figure out.

But remember, this was a B movie - it probably wasn't that good when it was new in 1962.  It's in black & white and for the most part the special effects and acting are decent - the worst exception being the actress who plays the reporter's wife.  It was kind of fun to watch, especially with the kids who found it mildly frightening, or at least didn't laugh out loud.
