I was only 5 when this movie came out, and had no idea of the controversy it created until seeing it as an adult.  The controversy it created was enough to generate box office returns and made this into one of the most well known modern classics.  And yet, for me, it left many things to be desired.

Brooke Sheilds and Christopher Atkins play Richard and Em, two kids who are the only survivors of a ship wreck on a desert island.  They not only manage to survive and create essentials for survival (food, shelter, etc.), but have language skills and no apparent problems.  Being isolated and knowing nothing of the outside world, they will, naturally, go through puberty and somehow fall in love without really know what's going on.  They also have a baby, completely neive what to do with it and how to care for it, but, somehow, as primative people do, survive.

There is much implied that isn't said in this movie.  Richard and Em just might be cousins.  They are practically naked throughout the entire movie, and made a million people cry "kiddie porn" (although he did use a body double for some of the more reveiling scenes showing Brooke's 14 year old breasts).  The special features are good, where Brooke and Chris recall each and every scene with all the amusing anecdotes that an experience like this would entail.  It was mostly about the lush setting, making Fiji probably the most romantic honeymoon spot for years to come.  It's hard to argue with a beautiful island place like Fiji.

Still, this is a movie about happiness, innocence, and getting back to nature.  That's what we all want, living in paradise and free of the evils of the world.  Enjoy it for all its innocent passions it envokes.
