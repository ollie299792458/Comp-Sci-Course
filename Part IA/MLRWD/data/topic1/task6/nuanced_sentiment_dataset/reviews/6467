The serials were an artform unto themselves -- shot very quickly on a miniscule budget, they are of only nostalgic or historic interest to the Star Wars generation, but we loved them, and this is one of the best.  You have to make allowences -- (spoilers follow).  We see a character walk through an ordindary door, and suddenly he is inside an elevator.  A car with no-one at the wheel still follows the curves in the road -- until it goes off a cliff.  The villain escapes from a sinking ship with nothing but the clothes he is wearing -- and somehow manages to hide a huge metal scorpion three feet long from the other survivors.  What bothered me most, even as a kid: one of the clues as to who IS NOT the arch villian is that the villian has a wounded right hand.  We see a character sign his name with his right hand -- can't be the villian, right?  But he is the villain.  No explanation.  And why do they put an end to Captain Marvel at the end of the story, when the kids watching the serial were reading about Captain Marvel's continuing adventures in the comics every month?  Having said all that, Captain Marvel flying is, well, a marvel.  Even if the script doesn't make any sense, the serial looks great.  Watch it one chapter per night, not all at once.
