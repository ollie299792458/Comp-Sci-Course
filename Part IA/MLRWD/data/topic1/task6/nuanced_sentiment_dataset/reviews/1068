Now, I know it's really not possible to write a review of this product being that I have yet to view it. All I can say is that I a really excited about this release. I am a huge fan of the show and my one regret is that I got on the boat late. The summewr of the original survivor was a turbulent one for me and I never got in on the action until late in the season. Now, when I discuss the show I always have to take a back seat when the events of season one are brought up. The release of the "highlights" DVD was not enough. Now, I will happily be able to view the season in its entirety, on a high quality DVD format loaded with extra's. So, I must say thank you to the producers for finally seeing the light on this needed release for fans of the show. Although I would have rather this release come before the airing of the All Star edition, I will gladly be one of the first to add this to my collection. And stay tune for my actual review when I finally get to view the product.
Edit(Update)
So I finally got my copy, ran home and popped the first DVD into the player. So this was the beginning of the adventure. What really shocked me at first is how different the show seemed. Everything from the camera styles and lighting seemed to come from a different place than the later seasons of the show. Jeff himself was no where near as polished, often stumbling over his now famous catch phrases. Not that I am complaining. There is a real raw and exciting feel to this edition. I got to meet such interesting characters as B.B. the crotchety old work horse and Ramona, whose queasy stomach in the early going may have cost her. My only qualm so far with the box set is the fact that they have listed who was voted off on each episode on the back of the box in the episode description. While I know a lot of the basics of what happened, it still would have been cool to keep a little suspense going for those of us who never saw the premiere episode. Well, more later!!!!
