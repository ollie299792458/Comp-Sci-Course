This movie is plain terrible.  So uninspiring I can't even think of a decent title (I just finished it).  BTDKYD is so boring and slow it was aganizing to sit through.  I was really amazed I didn't shut the [...] thing off.  I thoroughly enjoy both Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman, but even they aren't enough to redeem this stinker. [Spoiler Alert here, so don't continue if you are a masochist and plan on watching this flick]

The film is about two brothers (Hawke and Hoffman) that decide to rob their parents jewelry store.  Hawke recruits a third person to help out (Bobby), this man is the one that goes in the store to rob the place.  Unfortunately, the brothers' mother is there and it goes wrong and the robber is killed and she later dies.  The tangled web gets complicated when Bobby's wife and her brother figure out what happened and demand money from Hawke's character.  Yada yada the brother's decide to rob a drug dealer to get the money in order to do the pay off in exchange for silence, they kill the drug dealer.  Then shoot the guy extorting them, father figures out they did it.

There saved you from watching a depressing and slow movie and a few bucks.
