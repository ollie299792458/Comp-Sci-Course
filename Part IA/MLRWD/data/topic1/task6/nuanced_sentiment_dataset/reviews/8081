Remember on Halloween when someone invariably handed out a pack of crayons or a small bag of pennies to trick-or-treaters? You were probably a little confused at first, then a little disappointed, but you probably used the crayons or spent the pennies anyway. Mad Monster Party is like Halloween crayons to me - not very exciting but certainly adequate.

The Pros: The sets and character designs are awesome - very detailed with
some mod 1960's touches (the Monster's Mate rocks a pair of white go-go
boots). The send-ups of classic Hollywood monster movies can be quite funny and clever, and the tongue-in-cheek nihilism of the ending makes for a memorable finale. In terms of the image and sound quality of the DVD, nothing seems to have been lost in the transfer from the original print and in fact may have enhanced the original audio/video experience.

The Cons: In between the gags and humorous references lies filler in a plot costume. In my opinion, the plot here is a distraction - Dr. Frankenstein is ready to retire and chooses his nebbishy nephew Felix as his heir. The monsters disapprove and in a series of alliances and betrayals attempt to exterminate the interloper. It's all rather uninteresting to me and kind of superfluous as the best parts (the titular party where a skeletal band plays and a monstrous food fight takes place; the picnic in the jungle where Dracula unsuccessfully tries to ambush Felix) seem to happen extraneous to the plot. In addition to the weak plot, the songs are tolerable but not very memorable. I doubt you'll be humming these tunes after the credits roll.

If you happen to find this DVD in your Halloween goodie bag, appreciate it for what it is, have a little chuckle, groove to the retro score, then gorge on the fat and calories of richer Halloween treats like Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride.
