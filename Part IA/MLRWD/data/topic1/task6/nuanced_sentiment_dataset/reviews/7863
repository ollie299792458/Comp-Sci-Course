So I bought this DVD for four dollars because I hadn't seen the movie since my age was still in single digits. One of my earliest memories is sitting in the theatre weeping over Big Bird's Lonely Bluebird. I'd been watching a lot of old cartoons thanks to DVD and the internet, so I was wary that time had also been a cruel mistress to this movie as well.

I was pleasantly surprised that this is still an adorable movie. I watched it (27) with my brothers (21 and 15) and our mom (48) and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. But then I am a big kid and will still watch Sesame Street on occasion. The songs are fun, and if you remember the early (er... mid, I'm not that old) days of Sesame Street, it's fun to see all your favorite muppets and people again.

There are cameos by Chevy Chase and Kermit the Frog as well as a reference to 'North by Northwest' Some things you may not have appreciated when you were a kid.

So I don't know about how little kids appreciate it nowadays, but I can certainly recommend it to anyone who is not afraid to be a big kid and enjoys a bit of nostalgia now and again.
