I rented this film expecting an easy to watch action film (my expectations were fairly low in terms of an intelligent script or suspense) but unfortunately I was so bored, I had to watch the film in installments.

Characters in the film are shallow and the introduction to them leaves you not caring one way or the other about them or what happens to them - a serious flaw in a thriller.  After all - how can there be suspense if you really don't care if any of the characters live or die?

The film finished and left myself and my girlfriend stunned as we were waiting for the big finale that explained what the hell the point of it all was.

No suspense, no sub plot, no real action and a terrible script (keep an eye out for the line delivered by one of the hitmen, "I don't know ... I just don't know" - its straight from a school play)

Its a terrible film and I wouldn't recommend it under any circumstances, you'd get more suspense & consistency just flicking the channel on the remote control every minute.
