The show is great, no complaints there.  I am however surprised that no one has mentioned anything about how poor the extras are.
There are no foreign language tracks despite warnings in French.  Why bother when there is no French language track.  No big deal as I don't speak French, I just found that odd.  The few "extras" I did check out turned out to be nothing more than advertizements for other TV show DVDs.
The worst part is that the back of packaging says that there is closed captioning.  When attempting to view the captions all I get is an error saying "No captions recorded".  There are no options in the DVD menu for turning on closed captions either.  I do not know if this is an error on the part of my DVD player (which displays captions for every other DVD I own), or they simply forgot to put the captions on.  Am I the only one that the captions don't work for, or am I the first to notice?
5 stars for the show
-2 stars for the DVD extras/presentations
