It is not suprising to find most reviews here for this set are all about its problems. I definately agree that this set leaves much to desired for fans of classic animation. However, I think the dvd more than makes up for its shortcomings (which include no original titles, no cartoon names in the menus, and double sided disks) with quantitiy alone. I have never seen another set of thatrical cartoons that contains SO much for so little cash. We're talking over 50 half-hour episodes made up of about 3 cartoons (though admittedly, the clips that ending most episodes are pointless.) And no, the cartoons aren't great either. Kids should love them, but it can't be watched by most people like warner bros. or mgm cartoons. But if you are a fan of classic cartoons (why else would you be reading this?), good animation, great backrounds and music, and some genuinely funny gags will make it good entertainment. I think herman/Katnip and baby Hueys are your best bet, and some of those horribly cute and repetetive caspers should be avoided at all costs. As for the lack of proper menus, printable lists you can stick in the dvd are readily avalible on the internet.
