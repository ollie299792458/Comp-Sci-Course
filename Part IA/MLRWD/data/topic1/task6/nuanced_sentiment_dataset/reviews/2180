I think it's always a bit tricky to translate books properly onto screen. The book this movie was based on was an okay book with some amazing parts and the movie is pretty much the same (perhaps having the writer of the book also co-write the screenplay had something to do with it).

It's a movie about despondent youth who turn to drugs for a more vibrant life and not realizing until it's too late at what cost.  There are plenty of movies with the same theme and nothing about this film stood out above the rest.

The acting was great but the movie started with Dan (Heath Ledger) and Candy (Abby Cornish) already using drugs and I never felt attached to them as characters until much later.  The viewer always assumed that Dan was the reason Candy started using but we discover that Abby's childhood was not all rosey as it first seemed and that Candy was the one more strongly dependent on drugs.  There were lots of interesting points but they were never delved into with any depth.

The movie was okay.  I'd recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Q4CS">Requiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JM23">Spun (Unrated Version)</a>, or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EU1Q7M">London</a> over this one.
