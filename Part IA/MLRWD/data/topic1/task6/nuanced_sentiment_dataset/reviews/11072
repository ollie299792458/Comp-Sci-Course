This movie's got it all, don't listen to the haters, nay-sayers, and squirreley whiners; if you like manly action movies than you will like Quantum of Solace.  It's got everything, a manly British protagonist, an pencil-necked effeminate French villain, a fine Russian lady (playing a hispanic lady) and a fight scene just about every ten to fifteen minutes.  The portrayal of the Americans is mildly unflattering but coming from the Brits I think it's excusable, besides, it's not like we're not the ones making the movie anyway, and one of the Americans is a good guy anyway.  The effete delicate Frenchman (Dominic Greene) has convinced the world that he's a sensitive environmentalist but naturally he's really a rotten little crook whose trying to exploit the people of Bolivia.  And the sexy lady of the film has a score to settle with the fat, smelly-looking Bolivian dictator, who gets his own just-come-uppins near the end of the film as well.  All in all, awesome all-American(en route via Britain) action movie.
