I grew up watching re-runs of "Dennis the Menace" on the local D.C. TV station.  It was one of my favorite shows as a kid and I think I probably saw every episode in syndication before the age of 10.  I was really excited and delighted with the first season on DVD.  Its a real keeper, full of top notching writing and story lines.  This formula, along with the wonderful character actor Joseph Kearns as the grumpy Mr. Wilson, made for a set I didn't want to end.  I was thrilled that in short order Shout Factory! would release season 2.  I preordered it immediately.

Now that its in my hands and in my DVD player what do I think?  The season started out great with the usual tight and crisp writing that made the first season such a pleasure. Somehow the writing made the precocious Dennis Mitchell the perfect comic foil to Mr. Mitchell.  Somewhere about half way through the first 15 episodes or so of this second season, things started to go downhill. I believe it was a change it writers.  Suddenly the tightly scripted plots turned into meandering and at times quite disjointed affairs.  The result is fewer laughs and more yawns.  I'm not sure why this was so.  Were they trying to tone Dennis and Mr. Wilson down?  In doing so, they created more yawns and giggles. Maybe not everyone will agree with this.  To me, the change was quick and painful.  I'm hoping the next season, which I believe was the first for Gale Gordon will fare better with time.

Shout Factory gives a lot of bang for the buck here, tough.  For around 20 bucks for 38 episodes of entertainment, you can't go wrong in the final analysis.  The prints are greatly improved over Season 1.  It is very encouraging that this company hasn't abandoned the format all together.  Releasing "Dennis the Menace" on DVD is testament to that.
