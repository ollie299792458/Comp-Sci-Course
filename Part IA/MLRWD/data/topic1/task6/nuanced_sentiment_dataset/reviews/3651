This movie has a good story line: two sisters feel threatened by a stepmother that barely tolerates them.Both sisters were recently released from a hospital, presumably from the trauma of losing their mother-which we are left to guess how it happened-for now. The older sister always tries to protect her little sister from their new stepmother but doesn't always succeed. Strange things happen to the oldest sister but her father seems to be in his own world, not noticing what the dynamics are of the relationship between his daughters and new wife. The story takes several twists before the end and leaves you a bit confused about what actually took place, especially as it bounces back and forth between past and present. In the end, I think I get what the story was trying to tell us but I also think the writers could have left out a twist or two, making it easier to understand.

Update: 02/09: I truly didn't understand this film the first time I saw it and decided I needed to watch it again. After a second viewing, all the pieces come together and created a cohesive whole. The movie is actually genius; it just takes some creative thinking to understand it all. I can't change the stars here to update my new take on this film but I will write here that after a second viewing, it really deserves 5 stars. This movie is close to perfect, after all.
