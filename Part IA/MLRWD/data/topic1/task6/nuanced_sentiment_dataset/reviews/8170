This movie is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen. It is so funny, charming, and entertaining. This is a movie for the whole family,  kids and adults. This movie often gets a bad wrap that it does not deserve. I admit, it is no Beauty and the Beast nor Hunchback of Notre Dame. But it has its own charm. The music is so catchy, and the characters  and animation is so unique and different. I think kids don't like it as much because some of the humor is a little over their heads, but teens and adults are sure to enjoy it. And the critics keep knocking it because it didn't follow the Greek myth. But the Hunchback also didn't totally follow the storyline. Victor Hugo's novel is a much darker story. Phoebus and Esmerelda's relationship was not as sweet and romantic as Disney made it out to be. The same goes for The Little Mermaid and Pocahontas. If that's the basis for deciding if Hercules is a good movie or not, then someone might as well not like any of the other aformentioned movies. If the storyline of any of those movies was totally followed, then they definitely wouldn't be for kids to watch. On a final note, all I can say is give it a chance. You won't be disappointed!
