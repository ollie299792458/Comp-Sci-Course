Although Pierce Brosnan is by far the best Bond since Connery, he can't  save this film from mediocrity. Not even with the aid of eye candy Bond  girl Denise Richards.
I can't really pinpoint the exact reason why I  don't really like this movie. There are great effects and some good acting,  but a number of details spoil the overall experience. First of all, the  plot just seems to be bits and pieces from all the other Bond movies mixed  quite badly together to form something not entirely uninteresting, but  definitely less than exhilarating. And that's a big crime in a Bond movie.  Secondly, Bond has gotten far too many one-liners for his own good. Brosnan  fights bravely to prevent his character from becoming a walking clich&eacute;, but  even he can't save this script completely, although he really tries.  Although a Bond movie is not a real Bond movie unless good old James gets  to say some witty lines now and then, there are limits. This is not a  slapstick comedy!  Overall, the movie never really catches the real Bond  spirit.
Tomorrow Never Dies was a far better movie than this, and I hope  the next Bond movie will be that as well.
