If you like romantic comedies, you just might enjoy this movie! I am a big fan of Amy Adams, and I like to view her earlier work before she was famous (check out Catch Me if You Can, with Leonardo de Caprio). I realize Debra Messing is the lead in this movie, but as usual, Amy Adams is gorgeous and plays the beautiful half-sister (same Mom - Holland Taylor)to Debra. I've been a fan of Peter Egan since watching him on the British production of Lillie (about the notorious Lillie Langtry, played by Francesca Annis), and he plays the father of the bride (Amy Adams)and step-father to Debra Messing. Holland Taylor is always a joy to watch; her role is similar to her Mother role in One Fine Day, when she played the mother to Michelle Pfeiffer. The musical score is lovely, and also included are several romantic Michael Buble ballads, and one short bit from Maroon 5. The scenery is the gorgeous English countryside and Debra Messing's ex (Jeremy Sheffield) is not hard on the eyes (hunk alert!). Of course Dermot Mulroney is the romantic lead to Debra Messing's Kat, and they are not bad together. I rather prefer the Brits when it comes to the men in this film. Enjoy!
