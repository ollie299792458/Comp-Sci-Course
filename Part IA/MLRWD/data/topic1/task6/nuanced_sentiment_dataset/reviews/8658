As far as Vamp flicks go, this one is mostly cute and fun. The character development is not deep. The plot has holes so deep, I had to throw away all my preconceived notions about things like, you know...REALITY?! But, hey! This is a movie. There's a reason why film makers don't make Vampire documentaries, eh? That being said, if you let yourself buy into the carefully crafted (I mean that literarally) world, you will definitely have fun with this one. I think this film was shot in Prague. So, the general look of all things vampy get a huge "thumb's up" (sorry:) for virtual realism. You know how fun vamp flicks, like "Interview With A Vampire,"  "Dusk Til Dawn," and "Bram Stoker's Dracula" have beautiful vamp chics/wives who figure into the story, but not on the screen? Well, this film features the chics in a different way than most commercial vampire flicks have in recent history. There's some sillines to the movie, as far as c.g.i. usage. I mean, at times it's a bit heavy handed. But, realism is a hard thing to create in a story like this. If you have a healthy imagination, you'll understand why when you see the things these loonies try to bring to the screen. But c.g.i. stunts and gross-outs are a fun and necessary part of any healthy campy vamp flick. There are a few things in this movie that were truly unnecessary and felt more than forced: the entire ending!  However, the execution of the credits were a reminder that a zany band of professionals worked hard to create this film. The costume, makeup, set design, and actors were all well chosen. The music, the odd turn of the plot, and some effects, sadly, were not. But, if you're crazy for vamp movies, this one really won't let you down. Just bring your sense of humor and check your intelligence at the door.
