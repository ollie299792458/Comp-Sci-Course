"Romance" is a troubling and fascinating film exploring the shadow side of female sexuality, and is bound to inflame moralists and (certain) feminists alike. Like a whole batch of recent French films, it raises that vexed question of art versus pornography (or art and pornography, depending on your point of view.) "Romance" certainly SEEMS like art in its chic austerity - think white apartments, long existential silences, a heroine with that kind of long-limbed, angular beauty that conveys fragility one moment and deep suffering the next.
It's a cold, alienating film; we don't like or identify with anyone in particular, and we are invited to take a voyeuristic/anthropological interest in the fairly disturbing proceedings. In this, Breillat's objectives are certainly toward art: she wants to make us think, not drool. She's also very, very French in that she intellectualizes sex sometimes to the point of overbearing grimness and humourlessness. And yet that very intellectual coolness and sobriety is also what makes "Romance" so riveting; it's certainly not a likeable or even enjoyable film, but you can't deny it has the power to mesmerize you while you're watching it and provoke thought afterward. It's worth seeing, at least to gauge your own responses.
