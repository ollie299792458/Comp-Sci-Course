Just sitting around on a saturday afternoon, waiting for six-thirty when we go out, Mary, Mike and I, to visit some friends down the road.  Tuned this movie in, midway.  Looked interesting.
The silioquoy delivered by mister divito fifteen minutes later is among the best things i've ever, ever seen.  
Whether you're selling lubricants, or buddha, or jesus --- it's all the same, but what and where is CHARACTER, guts, honesty, balls....?  is there love in your heart?  is courage part of you?  this is among the greatest scenes ever made.  jesus, gautama, lao-tsu and me, we all bless this film, though it might be i'm the only of these who've seen it.  
This film is a blessing, and a bendiction, and for some maybe an epiphany.  Truths well expressed is the best thing one can say about any theatrical art --- this little film scores aces in terms of truths well expressed.  
Five stars from my soul.  I love this little movie.....
i am greybird, an old fart in the arizona desert, enjoying many things, this great littel movie among them ....
