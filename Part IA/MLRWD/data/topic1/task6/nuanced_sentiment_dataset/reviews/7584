This moive is one movie that I will always have in my collection. The charming Drew Barrymore and the most handsome Dougray Scott make for a perfect couple. My granddaughter loves this movie very much. She says that this must have been the real story because it's nothing like a Disney movie. Don't worry.. I try to tell her it's the same story told in a different way.. yet she protest.. in wishful thinking that Gaberilla is real.

I think that the Book the character's father brings her to read moves her to be who she is, which is a gripping person who you'd like to know. Dougray is so enchanting that you'll want to find other movies he is in.. which I think this one is his best! I only own two of his movies. I don't know how many he actually made. I love both Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott in this movie!

The character of the Fairy God Mother is a great surprise.. and an artist who sees the beauty in Cinderella and portays it not only in what he has to say to the prince about her.. but what he paints. I would recommend this story to anyone of any age. It has a few gems in it that you will want to look into once you see the movie. It's more then charming and enchanting.. it's positively everything that romance and love should say. You will wish that you could find them in a follow-up movie.. "Where are they now" type thing. I would love to see them in another movie together!

Buy it.. it won't regret it!
