I thought this movie was great. Yes, there are 2 scenes where the main character beats up two different women. Each scene is about a minute long, and yes, they're pretty brutal.

However, if you can stomach that kind of thing, then I DO recommend you see this movie!

Basically, the story revolves around Lou, who is a small-town sheriff. He winds up getting involved in some scheme to get a prostitute out of town, but ends up in bed with said women, and then falls in love with her. Their relationship is a sadomasochistic one, to boot. Anyway, even though he loves her...he winds up killing her (and enjoying it), as well as his fiancee later in the movie. Lou "seems" like such a nice guy...but what's great about this movie is seeing his sadism leak out here and there. He truly is a sociopath. We also gets glimpses of his, ahem, disturbed childhood throughout the movie. In the end, Lou's deeds catch up with him, but seeing how it all unravels for Lou is fascinating. I give this movie is 5 stars! Plus, I thought the spanking scene was pretty hot! :)
