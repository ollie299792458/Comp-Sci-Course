Yes, this man is a dedicated teacher. No, his methods are not the wave of the future for educational reform or methods that would often work elsewhere. The perspective of this film is skewed by describing these students as underprivileged inner city kids. Actually they are mostly Asian and Latino immigrant students. As a successful teacher of underprivileged children myself, I can tell you from experience that it is relatively easy to teach students from immigrant families, even those who are poor and just barely learning English, because their families came to this country for more opportunity and are usually highly motivated to succeed. The true underprivileged and most challenging students are those whose impoverished families have lived in the projects for generations, have little faith left in the American system and are often unmotivated as students and parents. Families from this demographic are conspicuously absent from this model teacher's class. This is an important distinction to make, because when this teacher is touted as a "hero" and an expert on inner-city education, all too often people with less knowledge about the educational system will be awestruck and believe this is the only way to go. There are many dedicated teachers in this country who use more sustainable methods of instruction and who are valiantly struggling with much more challenging students than the ones in this film.
