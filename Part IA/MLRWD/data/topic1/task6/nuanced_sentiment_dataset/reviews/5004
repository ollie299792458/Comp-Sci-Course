This movie just didn't live up to it's cool cover. I didn't research the "All-Star" storyline in the comics, wanting to see something fresh and new. I'd had hoped this would be a precursor to the new upcoming Zach Snyder Superman film. If it is, there goes my high expectations. The lackluster story is just not worth owning on dvd.  Presenting Lex Luthor as the villain for the umpteenth time is a major flaw makes you feel like you've seen the movie before. A different villain or threat would've made the movie better. It's not really entertaining until "guest stars" appear or until they show Lex and Clark escaping together. I HATE the wimpy voice of Lois Lane. She's always been annoying, but also aggressive and strong, her best quality. Also, the animation gets really bad once Superman wares the white custome with the CHEAP CHEAP looking "S" on the front. Plus there's no resolution. It's sinceless that a 60/75 minute movie does not have an ending. What's to carry over? This is not Lord of the Rings. Like the previous Superman movies (Doomsday etc), this is only recommended for the diehard fans.

The single disc edition features the feature film, a Superman/Batman Apocalypse preview and one for the upcoming Green Lantern "Emerald Knights" animated feature which looks decent, as they are introducing a Supergirl-like character for Green Lantern.
