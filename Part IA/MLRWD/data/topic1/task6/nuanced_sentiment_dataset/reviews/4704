I was vacationing in Europe earlier this summer, and a brief tour through Venice (complete with Gondola ride) prompted me to dig up my Moonraker DVD when I got home. Venice is of course one of the locations Bond visits this time around, along with Rio de Janeiro and finally, outer space.

I call this the most ambitious Bond movie ever, because even the newest Brosnan installments, for all their heavy action and effects, haven't launched Bond into outer space. All things considered, it's handled rather well. The space romp is only the last portion of the film, and the build-up to it is as realistic as one could expect from a Bond adventure. It also helps that the special effects hold up well, not quite "Star Wars" level but still rather impressive. The only silliness is the space marines, but what's a Bond film without a final epic brawl between the good guys and bad guys?

It's pretty much the non-space parts of the film that fall flat. Mainly, Moonraker is a rehash of The Spy Who Loved Me, the film before it. The plot and pacing is pretty much the same, except the threat has moved from underwater to outer space. The Bond girls are flat and unmemorable, and Roger Moore's acting feels stale and lifeless. If he'd projected the same energy and charm as in the movies before and after Moonraker, this film would've been much better. The film's saving graces are the memorable pre-credits parachute sequence and the action sequences in the gondola and on the cable car.

There's a nice making-of documentary, and also a second special effects documentary which feels like a "best-of" piece culled from clips from the documentaries of the other Bond dvds. Otherwise, the disc isn't quite as loaded as others in the 007 series. More of a rental for non-fans, though the uniqueness of Bond in space may convince you to add it to your collection.
