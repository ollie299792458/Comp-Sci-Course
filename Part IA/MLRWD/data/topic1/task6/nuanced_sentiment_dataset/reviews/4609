I absolutely loved the first two seasons of this show and entered this season with a lot of enthusiasm, but I must admit I've been a little disappointed with it. I've still found some enjoyment from it, but I have some qualms. I'm all for character evolution, but are we to expect that Sheldon would, a the drop of a hat, change his eating schedule so he could have dinner with Penny? The show has practically been built around Sheldon's crazy idiosyncrasies, and then one of the major ones that has been harped on in the majority of the episodes goes out the window in one scene? Also, Leonard's character changed in, for me, unpleasant ways while he was with Penny (I hope it will be better now that they are not together). Instead of the kind, innocent guy who was just trying to live outside of his genius physicist stereotype he suddenly got upset and angry far too often for my taste. It just feels like a different show this year. I can only hope the season finale will be a set up for a better season next year.
