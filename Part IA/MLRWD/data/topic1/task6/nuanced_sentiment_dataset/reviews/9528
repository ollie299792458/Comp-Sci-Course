Ice Age: The Meltdown is exactly what it sounds like: the Ice Age is thawing out, a great flood is imminent and the mismatched trio of Manny, Sid and Diego find themselves on another journey together. There is no inner group conflict this time around but rather the conflicts are personal to each character: Manny copes with his fear that he may be the last mammoth, Diego reveals that he has a petrifying fear of water, and Sid feels unappreciated by his peers. When Manny runs into Ellie, the only other mammoth left, who just happens to think she's a possum, he brings her along for the ride with her two possum brothers, Crash and Eddie, as well. The ensuing voyage to get to the end of the valley to escape the flood is completely uninteresting and bland, as are all the jokes and problems they face on the way. The witty dialogue that was present in the first film is sorely lacking here with the only laughs coming from the zany physical antics of Scrat, the prehistoric squirrel, and his never ending quest to get his acorn (it says something about the quality of a movie when the funniest parts come from a comedy formula originating in the ice age itself). Ice Age 2 is more of a letdown than anything, a boring and cliched story of a group of oddballs overcoming their fears and differences to become better "people" in the end. Though a series of shorts featuring Scrat would have been far more consistent and entertaining, Ice Age: The Meltdown's box office intake would indicate that this latest installment probably isn't the last of the franchise and that as long as the next one still has Scrat included, it will be just as big of a success.
