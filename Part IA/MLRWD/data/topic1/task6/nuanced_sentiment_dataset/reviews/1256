I cannot figure out for the life of me why so many people are giving his movie horrible, almost vicious, reviews.  The main complaint seems to be the historical inaccuracies.  Well, the showtime TV show The Tudors is worse, grossly inaccurate, yet many people still enjoy it. This movie is inaccurate as are many film interpretations, but get over it.  Other reviewers said that the actors were miscast and didn't look anything like the real-life personas.  I 100% disagree.  One only needs to compare a painting of Henry VIII to Ray Winstone to see the resemblence.  In fact, Ray Winstone is probably my favorite Henry VII as he somehow manages to make a man who was overweight and unattractive seem sexually appealing.  The show The Tudors, which I do like as well, is basically a Hollywood soap opera version where everyone is incredibly attractive.  But what I liked about this film was that it was the opposite - the actors looked similar to the real people (more similar than any other film interpretation) and, as a result, seemed more realistic.  The movie itself is a bit long and not the most exciting - more of a docudrama than a soap opera like the Tudors - but it definitely is worth watching, if at least to see another interpretation of Henry VII's life.
