I caught this movie on TV, and it was entertaining enough for me to sit through the whole film.  I would have liked to give it a 3.6 stars if I could.  I think it has a spark of something which makes it a little better than average, but I hesitate to call it excellent (4 stars).  Since I knew nothing about this film, I was quite amazed to find people categorize it as a horror-comedy when I later looked it up here on Amazon.

I am an easily terrified person, so I generally stayed away from horror or gory movies.  I remember when I finally gathered enough courage to watch "The Shining" because it is said to be such a classic, I had to turn my head away every time I sensed something potentially scary coming up.  In the end, my total viewing time of that movie was less than 5 minutes.  I suppose this explains how much I can stomach a horror movie.  When I watched this movie, the word "scary" never came into my mind.  I though it was fun, the special effect nice, and it was nice to see Michael J Fox again after a long while (although I wished his character wasn't so headstrong, as usual). The plot could have been a little more unpredictable.  But it was fun, entertaining, but no horror movie.
