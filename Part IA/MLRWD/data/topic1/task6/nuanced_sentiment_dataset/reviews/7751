Mase is doing something in Rap right now, which is going cause alot of negative energy among hardcore Hip-Hop heads. He is coming back to Hip-Hop, same as before - minus all the sex, drugs, violence and cursing he previously threw at the listener effortlessly. One might then wonder: when stripped of all that defined him as a Bad Boy labelmate, how can he be the same Mason Betha that we all loved back in 1996? Simple: He still has that effortless lazy flow, he still knows how to ride a beat better than 90% of todays MC's and most importantly he still has that teenage charm (Even though he is now into his 20's). The album opens with the late Summer anthem "Welcome Back" in which a quick paced party beat is torn to shreds by Mase's hungry flow. As soon as this ends, "Breathe, Stretch, Shake" (which is the albums only real club track) destroys any skepticism that Mase can't hold it down for feel good music anymore. "My Harlem Lullaby" is by far the best track on the album. This song is dedicated to the fans and people in Mr. Betha's life that didn't abandon him when he abandoned Rap. His singing has improved, the melody is spectacular and the beat is one of the best to be released in a long time. "Gotta Survive" is a slightly hardcore song, lyrically focused, in which he delves into the hate that plagued him while he was gone, and still follows him now that he's returned. The final track, "Do You Remember" featuring Cardan is reminiscent of his 96 days where Mase softly sings along "Do you remember the way I used to be, back in 96 when I made you move your feet" - If you don't remember, you'll definitely be reminded. The only setbacks that keep this from being a five star album, is the abundance of love songs. Mind you, they are mostly good songs save for one of them (Number six on the albums track listing). But hey, Mase is a lover not a fighter. In a world of subpar Hip-Hop, Mase's "Welcome Back" is a must have and I recommend it to any pre-96 Hip-Hop veteran.
