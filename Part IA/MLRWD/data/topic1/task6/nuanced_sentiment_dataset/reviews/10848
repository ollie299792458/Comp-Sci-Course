The single star is not a review of the movie, but to agree with other reviews that object to Combo releases. I question there is a real market for Combo releases and see this as a means to charge higher prices for the most popular movies. I refuse to buy any Combo releases for the higher $$$ and urge other buyers to do as well. We need to send a message or we will see everything released in Combo adding up to 40% to the price!!! The arguments made for Combos are that (1) you can also play it on standard DVD players and (2) it "future" protects us in case the HD DVD format becomes obsolete. For (1), there may be some interest in this but for me I didn't buy an HD DVD player to watch movies on a standard DVD player. For (2) frankly, I'll take my chances because if HD DVD becomes obsolete, existing players will last for quite a while and combo players will be available. Also, I can afford to buy into Blu-Ray or any other new technology with the money I saved not buying Combos (I wouldn't take a step backward to DVD). If the studios think there is a market for Combos, fine! -> Just release a HD DVD only version also at the same time. See how many they sell of each. Frankly, I only moved up to HD DVD when I saw Amazon pricing them comparable to DVD. If you don't think there is a strategy on the part of the studios using Combos to generate more revenue just look at the upcoming releases of White Noise (HD DVD only) and White Noise 2 (Combo). What sense does that make other than to create interest with the first movie and then sock it to you on the second! Look at this and other series (Bourne, Harry Potter, Oceans 11-13, etc.) same pattern. If they truly want the launch of HD DVD to be successful (as I do!), Combos pricing is very counterproductive. Annoyed and frustrated.
