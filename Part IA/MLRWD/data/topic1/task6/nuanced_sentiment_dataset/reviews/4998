I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the first Transporter.  I expected it to be the usual fights and explosions without plot but it actually had an interesting character study with an interesting "damsel in distress" plot line.

I was SO disappointed in this second movie because it is everything I feared the first one would be.  I watched it with my action-loving boyfriend and he started rolling his eyes during the first "hero surrounded by bad guys - beats them all like every kung fu/action movie in the last 30 years" scene.

The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the lead actor still provides some great character moments and the writers provided at least one good/original fight scene which was a one-on-one.

If you like lots of unbelievable car chases and fight scenes and don't care much about believable characters then you'll probably like this movie a lot more than we did.  Otherwise, get or rewatch the first movie.  Let this one go for a night you're too lazy to change the channel.
