I saw this movie through YouTube and I'm glad I did not buy or rent it on DVD.  This movie was a more accurate account vs. The Girl Next Door and of the two, it's a somewhat better story - hence, three stars vs. one for The Girl Next Door.  However, that's not saying much.  This movie was downplayed a bit compared to what really happened to Sylvia Likens.  I do understand movies like this can only be so graphic or else people's stomachs won't be able to handle the awful events that took place but so many events were left out compared to what really happened.  What was left out?  I won't tell the truly graphic stuff; just Google that and you'll find out.  Events left out were the scaldings Sylvia received, the salt thrown on her afterward, the Judo kicks done by Paula's boyfriend, and the note Gertrude forced Sylvia to write to her mom and dad just days before her death to make it look like she had nothing to do with the murder.  It's a sad story of what happened to Sylvia but this movie could have been done a lot better.  Really think hard before buying this movie.
