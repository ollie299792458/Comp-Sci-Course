A while back, I had a hard time deciding whether my favorite Christmas movie was Lethal Weapon or Die Hard.  Thus, I was psyched to see a film come out directed by Richard Donner, who did Lethal Weapon, and starring Bruce Willis.  The result is a good movie with good acting, a couple of great action scenes, and a good message.

Despite that, unfortunately "16 Blocks" is painfully slow much of the time, nowhere near as funny as either of the two movies noted above, and a bit "expected."  The conclusion of the transport sequence has a slightly unexpected twist, but if you saw the previews, you could guess most of the rest.  And despite all the hubbub about his performance, I found Mos Def's character to be so annoying throughout most of the flm, especially at the beginning, that I wanted to shoot him myself.

Now, according to Amazon, 3 stars means "It's OK," so maybe I should add one of those qualifiers that says, "I'd give it 3 1/2 stars, if I could."  After all, I really WANTED to be bowled over by this movie.  But 4 stars means, "I like it" and, unfortunately, I was too disappointed to be willing to say that.
