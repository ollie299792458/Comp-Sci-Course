I would have give 3 and 1/2 stars if I could.  This movie have a great creepy magical atmosphere that I like, we cannot really describe how creepy magical it is but we can sense it, it's remind me of early childhood movies that I love who got that type of scary magical atmosphere to it.  I think the performance of Miranda Richardson as Queen Elspeth the Evil stepmother of Snow White is Great, she's a very talented actress, she's the one who is the best in this movie.  The script is weird but it different and I like it.  The mother of Snow White also give a nice acting performance even if we didn't saw her much and also the brother of Elspeth give a very good scary performance, he his so creepy, I had wish to see him more often in this movie.  Snow White performance is so boring, she have no character, she just plain beautiful, she had no charisma.  The father of Snow White gets on my nerves and also the Little men who one include a little woman and a 6 feet tall man get really much on my nerves.  If this movie would have a good Snow White, one who can act and got not just beauty but charisma, that is much more important then beauty and also a good acting perfomance is more important then beauty the movie would have been great and if the little men will only be little men and not the weirds one we saw in this movie.  Because you got the Queen, the atmosphere, you only need at lest a good Snow White and good Little men and the movie will have deserve 5 stars.
