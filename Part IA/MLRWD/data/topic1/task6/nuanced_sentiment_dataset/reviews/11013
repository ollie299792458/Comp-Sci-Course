As if we needed another Hollywood fiasco to prove once and for all that today's filmmakers shouldn't mess with a perfect and powerful movie classic. Yet they will anyway, and they did here. I can say only two things in the movie's defense, but even these aren't altogether positive things. It is nothing like the original in truth and Streiber makes a good Raymond Shaw. However, every character that mattered in the original is painfully underdeveloped, the plot is not clear or riveting, and the idea of torture and murder depicted by this movie will undoubtably turn your stomach. Being a former SERIOUS movie fanatic, I went into this new release believing that I was watching pure sacrelige, and felt guilty for a while, but after about an hour I realized that the new Hollywood is lacking that one thing that old Hollywood had so much of--direction. The film is rated R, and with good reason because of the violence, but the language isn't as strong as most war movies and the incestuous mother/son angle is almost as subtle as it was in the original. As a matter of fact, just watch the original and be thankful that we have that.
