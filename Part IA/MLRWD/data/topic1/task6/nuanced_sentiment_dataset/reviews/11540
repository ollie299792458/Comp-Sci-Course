Why?  Because there are several facets to this film, and it is almost impossible to comprehend everything going on all at once.  First, watch it for the original cinematography by Leni Riefenstahl.  The off-center camera angles, the close-ups, the moving camera shots.  It may not seem like anything out of the ordinary now, but compare it to other films from the early 1930s, and you will realize how ground-breaking this film really was.  Nothing like it had been seen before.

Second, watch it for the propaganda.  This film was sanctioned and bankrolled by the Nazis, in an effort to portray themselves in the best possible light.  The Nazis had recently come to power in Germany amid much turmoil, and they wanted to get some "positive press" out to the people, and the result was this film.  It was meant to impress but also to intimidate, and it likely achieved both aims.  To see all of these Nazis chanting slogans and marching in lock-step, you get the impression that "Germany is on the upswing!  Come join us!"  That was their intention, and I dare say it was effective.

Finally, you might want to watch it again, this time with the audio commentary by historian Dr. Anthony Santoro turned "on."  Dr. Santoro filled his narrative with many tidbits about not only the known Nazi leaders like Hitler and Himmler, but also many of the lesser known ones, like Streicher and Bormann.  I found that his knowledge of these figures and their era added depth to my understanding of the film.

Overall, this is a very good production.  Everyone should see this film at least once or twice.  Five stars.
