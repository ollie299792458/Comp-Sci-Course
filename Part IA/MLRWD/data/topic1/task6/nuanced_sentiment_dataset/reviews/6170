This is a classic slapstick, tough luck comedy story involving a road trip from East to West coast.

In a nutshell: an expectant father is flying from ATL to LA when he crosses paths with a odd-ball guy who ends up getting them kicked off the airplane for suspicious behavior.  In the process, he "loses" his wallet and, by a mixture of circumstances, has to travel across the county with the same nutcase who got him thrown off the plane.  During the journey, they get into a mix of trouble.

What I liked:  Zach Zach Galifianakis is really funny throughout -- great scenes and acting.  The obliviousness to societal "norms" is what makes it funny.  As you see in the preview, Robert Downey Jr.'s character is telling a sad tale of his father leaving him as a child.  After hearing it, Galifianakis starts cracking up laughing and says something about how his father would never do that because he loved him.

Disliked:  Some of the craziness is overdone; needed more edgy scenes and clever ideas in some points of the film; the Mexico scene was a bit much.

Overall:  VERY GOOD for a mindless comedy.  If you liked Hangover, Wedding Crashers, Sex Drive, Road Trip, American Pie, etc., you'll probably enjoy it.  Fortunately, it doesn't go as far as Borat or Jackass in terms of shocking and grotesque humor.  But, if you are easily offended, dislike raunchy jokes, or just don't enjoy this type of comedy, it's probably not for you.
