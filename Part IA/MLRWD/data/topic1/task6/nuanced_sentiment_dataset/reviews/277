I had high hopes going into this film, but was ultimately disappointed. The images themselves are stunning, and in my opinion the best medium for their display would be a gallery followed by a slide show. As a film it was incredibly dull. There is essentially no narration, little music, and any interviews with locals are not subtitled. In the end it felt like pure narcissism on the part of the photographer. We don't really need to see you taking the pictures, they should speak for themselves. If he didn't have anything important to add, I'm not sure why he felt the need to make the film. Maybe it was to give us plenty of footage of himself. I knew it was going to be bad when at the beginning of the film the audience was subjected to several minutes of background conversation about setting up a shot (comments on the lighting, etc.) that was not even directed to us. As I told a fellow viewer, this is what most people edit out. If it were up to me, everything in this film but the photos would have been edited out, and it would have been about 10 minutes long.
