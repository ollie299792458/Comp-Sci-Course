Not much can be said for the director of Cabin Fever 2, let it be known, I did not expect much, this film followed my expectations almost perfectly.

I must admit, the depth in which character detail was delved into was amazing, you really get a feel for who these characters are, however character detail does not the movie make.

At many times in the movie, the pace is just entirely too slow. At one point, you follow the lead female role around, as she goes from each room of the house, this took about 45 minutes alone. As a matter of fact, for more than 80% of the movie, you follow her around, which very little twists or turns. It's not till the last 15 minutes, that the movie actually gets intense, with some rather disturbing imagery.

As far as horror goes, if you're into gore/violence, this movie is not for you. If you're willing to go nearly an entire movie with very little action, and you enjoy rather in depth analysis's of characters and motives, then this movie might possibly peak your interest. I however, enjoy the old sense of hacker/slasher movies, and I did not receive what I was looking for.

Stay scared,
