The movie was my favorite movie of all time when I was a kid. I saw it at the show 9 times and just loved it. It's a great family film filled with fantasy and adventure, and the good guys always win in the end (and get their girl as well). But I have to agree with all the other one star raters. It looks like they took it from a very well used VHS tape. I thought my TV was at fault, for the graininess of the picture is downright disturbing. You try to focus on the Cyclops chasing the guys, but are forever distracted by the flashing and changing colors of the sky behind them as light and dark dots keep flashing in the background. It looks like there's a sandstorm happening behind them. Someone really needs to save this classic and give it a proper restoration. It is a total waste of money to purchase it in Blu-Ray. Get the DVD for a fraction of the cost. I'm sure all those rating it 4-5 are rating the story, not the quality of the print. It reminds me of the old TV days when you had an aerial and were trying to pick up a distant station. It would get snowy at times and then clear a bit and then snowy again. That best describes this movie on Blu-Ray. Some spots are a bit better than others, but the vast majority of the movie is very grainy. Don't waste your money. Buy the DVD.
