This film is not nearly as moving as the book of the same title, which captures youth as a much more nuanced, ethereal time (not to mention developing the story so well that it lingers, like a Polaroid picture, long after the color has filled in). But it is a fine adaptation, filled with textured performances and much of the metaphoric depth of the novel (the fish flies, the accumulation of material goods and their subsequent abandonment, etc). My one complaint is not with the film itself but one of the reviews posted above--from Kayla, who has transposed, word for word, the review of the film written by web reviewer James Berardinelli (found easily on Rotten Tomatoes and other sites). It's amazing that people on this site are willing to plagarize for the sake of ratings--and disturbing, too, that others are buying products based on reviews of products that the posting "reviewer" may or may not have used/seen/read in the first place. But so much for those inclined to artistic theft--check the film out, and the book as well; they're both of the highest quality.
