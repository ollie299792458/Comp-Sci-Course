It seems fan boys can't accept that there will never be an "Evil Dead : 4." (If there turns out to be one eventually I apologize ahead of time.) So people are left wanting more of the "Ash" character from the "Evil Dead" franchise. Get over it. This is what happens when people left wanting more get what they want. In this movie Bruce Campbell is made to look like a VERY VERY pathetic loser because that's funny. No, it makes him unlikeable and turns you off of this film fast. They should of showed a down to earth married older guy with two kids from a previous marriage (Which Bruce is.I read his biography)who brings out his heroic side to fight a demon. You know someone that's REALISTIC. Instead, we get some arrogant jerk trying to do an "Ash" impression for an hour and a half too long. The last half hour where they fight the demon is pretty cool, but most of the characters beside Bruce are forgettable. Some of the humor is pretty bland, but okay. I heard they are making a sequel. If so, they better step it up on the next on.
