Disturbing and thought provoking. Not for you faint of heart people, but if you want to see what real life can be like for the thousands of lost girls (and boys, although that is not explored in this movie) who dream of  making it big and end up ground meat in the porn industry, rent this movie.  
I recommend every parent see this film to realize just how precious  their children are. The scene where Janet related how her daughter hated  her stepfather and ran away just to try to find a better life broke my  heart! Some better life she found. Dead at hands of a sicko to make a few  bucks. 
I thought the film was well made and Nick Cage's performance was  only rivaled by that of Joaquin Phoenix as Max. I would like to have seen  the relationship between Tom and his wife explored further (that's why I  only gave it 4 stars).
Although I am sure it gave Tom nightmares, I too  am glad he killed them. They deserved it. God knows our justice system  wasn't going to do anything about it.
