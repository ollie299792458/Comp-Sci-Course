This movie is a must read (the book, that is).  All in all it's an okay flick.  The early scenes are bit maudlin as the film tries to compress a lot of emotional background into a minimum of film time before getting out to sea.  Some of the feigned New England accents are truly painful (the award for worst effort goes to the actress playing Captain Linda Greenlaw, a hideous parody of a Downeast Maine accent).  Mark Wahlberg turns in a workmanlike performance as Bobby Shatford, whose girlfriend begs him not to go on the voyage.  Clooney is okay as the doomed Captain Billy Tyne, but the film is trying to accomplish too much in too little time, so no one really gets to develop their character.  The best performance is turned in by an actor I didn't recognize, who plays a shaggy, bearded crewman who spends half the voyage at the throat of one of his mates and leaves his little boy ashore.
The special effects are very good, and the scenes of the fishing boat fighting the storm are gripping.  Nevertheless, the book is a much better read than this was a film.  Buy the book; you'll enjoy it a whole lot more.
