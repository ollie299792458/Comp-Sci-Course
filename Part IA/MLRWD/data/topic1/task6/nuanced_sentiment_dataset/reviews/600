This is my all time favorite version of Jane Eyre. I have seen all the rest, but this is by far the BEST!! I'll tell you why this is sooo good. It truly follows the book. Probably the only one out there that does such a good job of it. Every character, even the more complex plots of unknown family members (all three siblings are included in this version) every line (practically)is in this version. You really feel Jane's anguish as a child in a confusing adult world. You are saddened when her only friend at Lowood School dies. You see her frustration with certain teachers who only want to suppress her curious nature. you finally feel relief when she grows up to become a teacher herself at Lowood. Then you see her growing affection for Thornfield hall and all that encompasses it. You feel how she feels when she is made to feel inferior to Blanche, and your heartstrings are tugged at when she thinks Mr. Rochester is sending her away to Scotland, far from him. A very touching and intensely romantic scene. There are hundreds of reasons like this that make this version superior to the others. Do yourself a HUGE favor and buy this on DVD! I also have the video cassette version and have waited patiently for this incredible movie to be transferred to DVD. The wait is over, sit back with a pot of tea and enjoy yourself!
