I saw this movie in the theater, and it was one of the very few I've ever considered walking out on. I'm not that hard to please. I'm willing to suspend disbelief. I'm not that demanding. But I could not get into this one at all. Right from the beginning, there were no characters I cared a bit about. Maybe the acting was great. But if you hate the leads, what's the point?

Time has (thankfully) dulled my memory of the details of this film, so I just remember it as mean-spirited and terribly uninteresting. If there were someone I was cheering on, maybe I could take it. (Who could really imagine this with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, as another reviewer mentioned. Really?). My friend and I were about to leave the theater when a totally random line (someone singing "I wish I was a Kellogg's cornflake") made us laugh, and we sat out the rest. I really wish we hadn't. Maybe I'd find something to like in it a second time through, but the first impression has really kept me from coming back to this one.
