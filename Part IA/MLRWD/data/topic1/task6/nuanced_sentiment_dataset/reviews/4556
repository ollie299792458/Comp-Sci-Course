Well, I caught this movie in the early AM on cable one night and was totally blown away by the sheer psychotic violence of it. Demented, more bloody than Texas chain saw by a long shot...just ultra violent. I was shocked and disturbed, which is why I had to order the DVD.

WHat I got in the mail looked like the same movie. However, I've literally just finished weatching it..or most of it. I actually stopped to write this review and a letter to the merchant. EVERY SINGLE SCENE HAS BEEN CUT OR EDITED. There is no violence, only the suggestion of violence. There is no shocking bloodshed (as in the scene where a man gets split in half with a blade and literally peels apart while still living...). What remains is shocking only in the realization that all I got is a PG13 Japanese gang movie with poorly dubbed british accents. I can't friggin believe they actually sell this without the violence. I mean, what's the point? Isn't that what the whole genre is about? It would be like watching porno because you like the acting. NOT.

Save your time and money, don't buy this pile of dung. Wait for a directors (UNEDITED) cut.
