I am 53 years old. I grew up with horror films. It has been one of my "guilty pleasures" since I was a kid. Zombies, ghosts, serial killers, goules: I love'm all. All that being said, this is the only movie I have ever actually had to get up and leave the room over. It is nothing more than cold, detached, brutality. It is like putting on the bloody clothes of Jeffry Dahmer, and hugging your kids while wearing them. Indeed, this movie makes me feel like some sick voyeur tagging along with the kind of person who would molest children, kill them, and dismember their body. It feels like what it would be like to stand by, powerless to intercede, while the entire act is played out before your eyes. If it were possible, I would erase every memory of ever seeing this film. I am tempted to write the NetFlix company and make a STRONG complaint for not making a stern warning part of the review (or even stocking it at all.)

If you value your piece of mind, just pass this film by. Consider me a friendly time traveler warning you about making a dumb future decision.
