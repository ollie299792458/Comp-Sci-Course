Before I begin, I should probably say that I have a bias when it comes to movies starring hairy white guys.  That kind of built-in humor can keep me sailing for at least a good 60 minutes.  So I've always been a big Robin Williams fan.  Without that element of casting genius, this movie would have been about at fun as flat beer.  But every time you see his furry arms, my friends and I can't help but bust out laughing.  Great writing there, and kudos to the director for those moments. (The Lord of the Rings trilogy, by the way, is a veritable cornocopia of gut-busting scenes.  I know the hairy feet aren`t real, but I really appreciate the genius behind it.  The prosthetics are so believable.  Very impressive)

I have to say, though, that I was a little shocked at some of the blatant racial slurs here.  I know it's pretty common in these types of films, but that kind of stuff really just always gets under my skin.  I mean, come on already.  So I have to dock it another star just for that.  You might not mind it so much.  Good family fare, all around.
