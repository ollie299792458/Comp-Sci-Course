The first film in the "Alien" series and by far the best. The crew of a mining space ship investigates a distress call, and after landing and investigating, they end up with a pack of trouble. An alien life form gets attached to a crewman's face, and he ends up as the incubator for a creature in a very bad mood. The creature is much worse than "The Thing," being smarter, more aggressive and very ill tempered as it proceeds to kill off the crew, one-by-one. In this move all the men are stupid; the only one capable of dealing with the creature is the crew-woman Lieutenant Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). The film is very effective at scaring the audience (it scared me a lot), but it's really a grade B slasher move in the garb of a sci-fi thriller. The acting is generally wooden (especially Weaver), and perhaps this is why the creature was in such a bad mood for the whole movie. The technology on the ship is inconsistent-- advanced robotics and machine intelligence, but there're still typing on keyboards, and perhaps even running some future version of Windows that's still buggy. Still all in all, the film is fun, and if you like getting scared then you'll love it. Unfortunately the rest of the "Alien" series doesn't measure up to the first-- they should have quit while ahead.
