This is the classic tale of Icobbod Crane (Johnny Depp) and his fight with the headless horseman. Crane is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow by the New York courts to find the real murderer and bring him to justice using his own inventions to detect the killer. He meats Catrina Vanhousle (Christina Ricci) who bewitches him and falls in love with.

Crane goes to sleepy hollow and disbelieves that a headless horseman is responsible for the murders until he comes face to face (um I guess it would be more face to body) with the horseman. He overcomes his fear of religion and the unknown to find the person responsible for controlling the horseman dispite the help of this God fearing town.

Watch as Depp and Ricci fight the horseman. The special effects in this movie are second to none, the soundtrack/musical score adds a chilling feel to the movie. A must see for all Johnny Depp/Christina Ricci fans. Or fans of Horror movies or movies with fantisic special effects.
