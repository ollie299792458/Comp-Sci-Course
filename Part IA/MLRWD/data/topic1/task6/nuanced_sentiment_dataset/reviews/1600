Brothers had the potential to be a great 5 star movie but something lacked that's hard to put a finger on.  There seemed to be holes in the story such as when Cahil (Toby Mcguiire) was presumed dead but was taken as a POW.  There was no story as to how he was captured and what led to his being taken as a prisoner.  The romance between his brother (Jake Gyllenhal) and his wife (Natalie Portman) never really developed into anything but you would think that there was a serious relationship going on at the end.  You may be tempted to repeat the movie to see what you may have missed.  I was a little disappointed in the acting.  There are some top name actors here but there was no stellar performance and the acting seemded a little too scripted, insincere and overaught and just plain lazy as if the actors are just going through the motions - the movie seemed to lack direction.  Natalie Portman, although she is nice to look at was the worst.  She showed absolutely no emotion, said very little and little to no sincerity in the acting.  All in all it is a movie worth watching to judge for yourself but I recommend renting it first.
