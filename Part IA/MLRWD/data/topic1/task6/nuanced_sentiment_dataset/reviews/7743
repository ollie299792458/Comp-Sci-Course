I will admit I am a big fan of the DC Universe Animated features.  However, I did not like this product, at all.  The story is weak and it seems to be written by someone who does not know the Superman character, or just started reading him after DC started competing with Marvel for more "in depth and personal" views of their characters.  Please note, this applies to the comic as much as the feature.  As someone pointed out, Superman is not everyone's favorite because he is always the boy scout, always comes out on top and even in death, you know he will overcome anything.  So, for this to end as it did, it shows that even the story teller is trying to make his mark more than he is carrying on the tradition of Superman.  But let's not stop there...the flaws with this film go beyond the bad subject story.  The story itself is told very poorly.  I have stated my biggest complaint, but there is also too much going on in this piece to have a cohesive timeline.  I get that they want to include as much as possible from the All Star series, but at least those books made sense (as much as comics make sense).  And they made sense because there was some sort of order and reason behind what occured.  Not here.  Kryptonian Astronauts only as a 5 minute aside?  The Parasite chases Clark Kent and Luthor and Lex is too obtuse to figure that the being of immense power the Parasite is pursuing is not him?  Come on now.  Once again, a bad story being poorly retold by someone who does not know the characters and is more interested in making his own mark, and does so at the expense of the story, the icons about which he writes and the viewers.  The only reasons it gets more than one star is because I am a fan of Superman and I cannot "hate" anything with him in it.
