This is an almost impossible topic to do well; Nelson and company came very close.  There are a few historical errors, and the relationship between SS and prisoners - with the exception of the people like Nyszli - was rarely as "conversational" as the film suggests.  The hierarachy within the sonderkommando itself is also missing, which was a key part of what they had to contend with.  Typically, SS spoke directly (in the form of giving orders) to non-Jewish kapos; not to the class of prisoners who figure centrally in the film.  Likewise, the frenetic pace of the work when there was a transport to be "disposed of" was not shown here.  I assume this was in the interest of everything being "matter of fact," which _is_ generally true to the sonderkommando's everday adaptation to their task.

I found the mix of accents confusing - why did only the Germans get them?  And some of the interaction around planning the rebellion needed a bit more context, I think.

That said, there is more here that is _essentially_ true than in most Holocaust films.  The grayness of the film itself fit its subject.  When the "ash speaks" at the end, in the form of the incinerated girl, I was initially put off.  Why this flight of poetry in the midst of such an unpoetic film.  But it was short and on point enough to add at least something.
