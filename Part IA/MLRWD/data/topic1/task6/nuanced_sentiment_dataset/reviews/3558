By reading all of these reviews on this page I can tell you guys are fans of classic scifis and I know why you guys are going to disagree with me but here we go.  The plot is great, acting was good-not over dramatic like some other 50's movie, and it must have been a hit back then but its 50 years later and to me its just plain boring and corny. Being aliens far more advanced than humans I can't believe they wear stiff suits they can barely walk in.  Their beam shooters or whatever they are, they are just bronze cups on their hands.  I'm sorry but I just can't believe that.  Better movie if it was made now like War of the Worlds.  The effects, gizmos the aliens have could have been made more creativly rather than just a brown plain looking suit.  If it was made now it should have a solid plot, good acting, better effects, and I am not talking about the type of movie where the good looking muscular hero saves the world by blowing everything in his way.  I can't stand movies with many explosions put together with a thin plot. Damn Chuck Norris movies.
