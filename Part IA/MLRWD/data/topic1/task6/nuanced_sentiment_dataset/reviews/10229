We LOVE Raymond, but this set was defective.  Amazon replaced the first set with another and I had the same exact problem.  The 4th episode of the first disk of season 1 would not play at all (odd that it was the same with both sets) and both sets had paint on the "play" sides due to the paint from the cardboard sleeves.  The first season came in a red sleeve, so all the disks from that season had red paint on them and caused some of them to not play correctly.  The second season came in a green sleeve and had green paint on the disks and the 3rd season came in a blue sleeve and had blue paint on them, etc...I could scratch most of it off with my fingernail, but some of them skipped in the areas where the paint was.  Also, the first set had glue on 2 of the DVD's which caused them to skip or not play at all in those areas.  I couldn't remove all of the glue and actually scratched one of the DVD's trying to do so.

I am not going to try for a 3rd set, so I just went ahead and ordered the more expensive set (for $40.00 more) that comes in the box shaped liked Raymond's house.  I was really excited to get this set for $95, but it was not worth saving the $40 for all I have had to go through to get a good set.  I will follow up with another review when the new set (the 3rd one!) arrives...
