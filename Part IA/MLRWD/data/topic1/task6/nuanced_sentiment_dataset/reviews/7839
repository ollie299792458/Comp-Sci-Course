Just finished watching this with the hubby and I'm wondering if maybe we're not the target audience. We're in our thirties, been married ten years with a toddler sound asleep in his bed upstairs. We're so far removed from the life portrayed in this film that we couldn't relate to many of the characters.

The main character, Sam, is a freelance writer who mostly does short stories. He has trouble with the longer, form, the novel, and his life mirrors that since his relationships are mostly short-lived (with the exception of his best friend.)This is a movie about Sam and his friends growing up.

The good things about the movie are that there were some moments that made us laugh. Also, I thought I thought the ideas were original.If this is Josh Radnor's first jaunt as writer, he should do it more often.

The bad things however, outweigh the good. I had a hard time really liking any of the characters. I felt like they were making obviously stupid decisions. I also had a hard time buying Radnor as Sam because every time I looked at him, I saw Ted Mosby. His mannerisms were the same as Ted, he was just a much more irresponsible version of him. I also thought some of the dialogue was awkward, especially in the bar when Sam is flirting with Mississppi.

So we'll probably not watch this a second time, but again, I don't think we're the target audience. Perhaps younger people would enjoy this.
