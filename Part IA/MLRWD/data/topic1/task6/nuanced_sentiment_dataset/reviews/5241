By far one of the technically best movies ever made. I may be over stating here,but consider these points.
I beg you to find a single section of the movie that didn't relate to other parts of the movie. In this respect it is phenominal. The only other Sci Fi movies I have encountered that come close are the original Alien and T2. An almost Shakespearian use of foreshadowing, plot device, and humanity.
2. Continuity: Robocop shows down with Dick Jones, Drops his gun. Later in the movie, does he magically have his gun? NO! Lewis has sneak into the police dept. to give him one. Freakin perfect. Many other instances of this.
3. Realism: Have you seen other action movies from the 80s, (including Robocop 2 and 3). Bad guys are lame characitures (wrap around shades, headbands, mohawks, etc.) This movies' bad guys look act and feel like genuine people and bullies. "You a good cop? Yeah, I bet you're some kind of a super cop, Comin in here all by your self". Clarence, Emelio, Dick Jones. Dag, these guys come across as real today as they did back then.
4. Socio-commentary: The adverts are brilliance. The hatred of yuppie indulgence (before yuppies were a "thing"), the deprecation of society. Compare the gas mileage of the 6000SUX to the modern SUV (SUX, SUV... 1 letter off) hmmm...
5: That gun!!!!
6: Premonition: Yuppies, Vehicle Extravigance at the price of Gas (6000SUX), DVD, (think about the time it was made), The TV show everyone watched in the film seems a little to like Howard Stern for my likes (I'd buy that for a Dollar!)
7. The scene where he walks through his own home and remembers his past (or pieces) is one of the most touching pieces of filmmaking ever.
8: realism #2: Computers work like computers. No flashy pop up displays, truncated words to fit a screen. Realism over flash. Brilliance!
Well, anyhoo, this is an amazing movie, and I've watched a lot. this is the one to watch and own. Go get this. I mean it. go get this movie. I know where you live.
