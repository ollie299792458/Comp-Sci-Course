The five stars are for the movie itself and the original "Ultimate Edition."

I bought my original edition in February 2003 and got the one with the gold foil embossed slip case, 2 disks with both the extended version and the theatrical version of the movie.  Since then, even though almost every e-tailer and retailer show that the Ultimate Edition with 2 disks and two versions of the movie, they do not actually have them to ship.  I have ordered from several e-tailers and the keep cases show "Extended Cut" on the bottom of the front case label and not "Director's Cut," they do not have all of the featurettes any more or many of the other extras.

I feel the manufacturer has deluded all of their clients who sell these DVDs by NOT changing the name of the DVD.  It should not say "Ultimate Edition" when it is not the Ultimate Edition.

I don't think Amazon was trying to cheat or fool their buyers and finally have a note in their Editorial Review that the current release is a "stripped down" version - only one version of the movie and fewer extra features. [Original review Feb. 7th, 2005, updated Jan. 8th, 2007]
