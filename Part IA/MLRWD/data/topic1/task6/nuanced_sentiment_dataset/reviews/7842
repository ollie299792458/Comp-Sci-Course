As the title suggests, this movie, IMO, isn't a movie for the more hard core survivalist, end of the world type of movie enthusiast. It's a teen movie with a bit of survival in it. Don't get me wrong. I thought it was a good movie for what it was. It had great special effects. It was nice to see they didn't skimp there. Characters were a bit stereotypical. A little too much teen angst and inappropriate conversation during times when you should be paying attention. Really, do you need to talk about your love life as you're trying to blow up a bridge? Would you just stand there laughing while a herd of farm animals chase off your enemies? Isn't it like common sense that they just might shoot back??  Sometimes it seems that they're about to get serious, but then the movie takes a turn back to bubblegum teenie bopper problems.  It's not a bad movie but it's different from what a typical fan of this genre might assume. If I were to compare two movies as different from themselves in the same genre,  it would be Independence Day vs Battle Los Angeles. One takes a more light hearted approach to the genre while the other is more down and gritty. Its the same with Tomorrow When the War Began vs Red Dawn.
