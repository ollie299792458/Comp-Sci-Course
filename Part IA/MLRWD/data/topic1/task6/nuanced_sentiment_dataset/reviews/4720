Saw this little known film in theaters a while back and my initial reaction was "woah, this is awesome". Think Tarentino with a serious feeling, mixed with thick UK accents and a lot of sharp plot twists and you are there.

The nameless protagonist is quickly in over his head after a slew of business deals go bad. His exctasy supplier stole from some serbs (just like in "24" the serbs are ruthless) and a big wig named jimmy is trying to skrew him over. Naturally our hero is caught in the middle and he's just trying to retire.

The movie confused me at certain points in the beginning because of the many introductions to characters and the intricate sideplots, but in the end it comes together quite nicely. Also, some of the accents were so thick you couldnt understand a word of what they were saying. Im not even going to mention the ending because you will just have to watch this. Realistically, this movie is a 4.5 but i recommend it for anyone who's into the contemporary gangster style film and definately anyone who's into british mobster films.

Enjoy!
