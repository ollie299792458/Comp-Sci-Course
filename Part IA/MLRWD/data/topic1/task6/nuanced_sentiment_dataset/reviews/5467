This is a great Godzilla movie!  And it's one of my favorites because it's got plenty of Godzilla, it's fun, and it never bores me!  
That's right, there's plenty of Godzilla...well, enough to keep me from wondering what happened to him.  Aside from the Big G, there's also Meganulla and Megaguirus - and they also get plenty of screentime.  
And let me just say that Godzilla is hilarious in this movie!  Sure, he's destructive, and still looks mean, but he does indeed do some bizarre things when he's fighting Megaguirus.  
All in all, the Monster Scenes in the movie deliver.  And it's all spread out in good doses, unlike other Godzilla movies where there are noticable lapses in Monster Action.  
And when there's no Monster Action, the Human Scenes keep us entertained.  They're fun and they're campy - just the way they should be in a Godzilla movie.
As for the characters, there doesn't appear to be any memorable characters, but that doesn't stop this movie from delivering memorable lines!
MEMORABLE DIALOGUE #1
KUDO - Bodybuilding, huh?  What a waste of time!
MAJOR FUJIMORI - What's that?
KUDO - Why do you want to be fit when we're gonna make Godzilla disappear up his own butthole?
MEMORABLE DIALOGUE #2
Fujimori is crouching down to talk to the little kid, and he recognizes her uniform:
LITTLE KID - Say, are you a G-GRASPER?
FUJIMORI - Yes, I am.
LITTLE KID - But you're a woman.  So how come you're fighting Godzilla?
(Fujimori doesn't even answer)
MEMORABLE DIALOGUE #3
After Kudo tries desperately to contact Fujimori on the radio, she finally replies:
FUJIMORI - "Why do you want to talk to me so badly?  You gotta crush on me or something?"
Make no mistake: this movie's great!  Both the Human Scenes and the Monster Scenes are great fun.  And you see plenty of Godzilla in this movie.  One of my favorites!
