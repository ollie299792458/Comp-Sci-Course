The interpretation of Eugene O'Neil's Long Day's Journey into Night in the 1962 Katharine Hepburn version was produced with great brilliance. All of the characters with the exception of one, acted with some of the best emotion that I have ever seen in movies of that era. The exception that I am referring to in my last statement was Ralph Richardson's portrayal of James Tyrone. I think the casting directors could have picked a better individual to portray James Tyrone. He preformed his part with emotion, but it was nothing of what I expecting. The image I received from the play was nothing close to what Ralph Richardson had performed.  The play depicted Tyrone as a handsome older gentleman, which Richardson was far from unfortunately. Also in the play Tyrone seemed to have an irritable temper. Richardson's was a little temperamental but it just was not what I was expecting, it could have been just a little more intense. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, it was a little long at times, but almost all movies are slow at times. Their use of sound effects greatly added to the emotions that they were trying to implement into the different scenes. The producers and directors also did a wonderful job with the cinematography, it greatly added to the mood of the movie in general.  So, if you enjoy the classics and do not enjoy seeing them butchered (as some other productions have done), I would strongly recommend watching this movie.
