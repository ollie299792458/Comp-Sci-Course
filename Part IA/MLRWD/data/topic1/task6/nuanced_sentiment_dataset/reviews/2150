We went to a sneak preview one night and that was when they did
not tell you what it was.  We had seen the play so when they
told us it was THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE we hooted and hollered.And from the opening scene we knew it was a a real treat.
I was sad that the movie came out early in the year because those
movies are usually ignored at Oscar time but this time they remembered Maggie Smith who won her first award.  Equally good
is Celia Johnson as the headmistress who personifies conservative
education.  She nearly steals the whole thing from Maggie. The
Brits gave her and Maggie their Oscar equivalent.  Gordon Jackson
who later achieved wide fame as Hudson on UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS
is delightful.  Jane Carr who played Mary McGregor later appeared
on NBC sitcoms.  Over the years this has been a favorite movie
of mine and I hope the dvd will be letterboxed.  It certainly should be. This will be a most welcome additon to my dvd library
and hopefully many other fans.
