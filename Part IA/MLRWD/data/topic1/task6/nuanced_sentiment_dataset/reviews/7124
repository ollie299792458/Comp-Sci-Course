Picture this, a guy approaching twenty sitting on a plane trying to choose a movie to watch. One of his choices is 'The Beach', a film he's heard about but never really considered watching because he heard it was a 'chick flick'. Then he figures, it has to be better than a gay guy making out with Madonna.  This is how it started for me. I started watching it a realized, Leo's more than a pretty face here. After Robert Carlyle's scene, I was hooked (plus Virginie Ledoyen looked really hot). When the credits started rolling I sat back in my chair and thought, wow, that movie rocked.  DiCaprio has this strange way of picking all the right roles (He was quite impressive in Basketball Diaries and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Titanic was crap.) His character of Richard was very complex and difficult to play. A disturbed twenty-something looking for peace of mind, it doesn't get tougher than that.  Besides Richard, my favorite charcter was Etienne. Canet's portrayal was picture perfect and his dedication to his Swedish friend was touching.  Overall it was one of the best movies I've ever seen, even though I know many won't agree with me. I shows that there are always flaws, even in the perfect world. Oh, and one more thing, Robert Carlyle rocks!!!
