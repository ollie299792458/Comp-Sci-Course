I agree that the trailer for this movie was ingenious, but as with most quick, straight to video releases, the overall quality of this movie, in my opinion, is very poor.  I loved the original Lion King, and it will always stand out in my mind... but this movie really upsets me ina  number of areas.  In one scene Timon and Pumbaa comically decide to run for their lives from the stampeding herd in the gorge.  As I recall that was a very sad scene in the original movie, where Mufasa was killed and Simba was run off.  I hardly thought that a good scene to make funny and light by Timon and Pumbaa.
There are plenty other scenes that are badly parodied.  The original scene with Simba majestically running home to reclaim his birthright is laughable in the wrong way when Pumbaa runs back to Pride Rock.
Another point that bothered me about this film was the music.  One song, the Warthog Rhapsody that was never used in the first film, was poorly plagiarized in Timon's sentry song.  Another song, Lebo M's "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" was also slapped into this movie from its original appearance on the CD "Rhythm of the Pride Lands".  
The only thing really going for this movie is the innocent humor... something that a younger audience would enjoy.  I for one did not see the depth that I so loved in the original Lion King, and I'm heart-broken by how this movie makes terrible fun of the original's very serious events.
