I'm not a horror fan, at least not a fan of things jumping out of the shadows.  I'm also not a fan of gratuituous violence in films.  So I avoided this movie for a long time.  But everyone I know that saw it thought it was great, and it did win the Best Picture Oscar, so I finally gave it a try.
Well, I'm glad to say that nothing jumped out at the viewer and the gore was necessary to the plot and limited.  The movie was well done, and the acting was very good.  But why was everyone CRAZY about this film?  I give it a solid 3 stars, which is to say above average, but it must have been an off year for the film industry if this was the best thing they turned out that year.  
Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors, but I don't think this is a role that "only he could play."  The same could be said for Jodie Foster's performance.  As for the writing, this is supposed to be a psychological thriller.  Clarice is warned over and over not to let Dr. Lechter "get into her head."  He asked a bunch of questions about her painful past.  She answered them honestly.  Yeah.  So?
A movie for the masses I guess.  I am now neither afraid nor tempted to see others in the series.
