I really wanted to see this movie because the Trailer looked amazing. My favorite actor, Jason Bateman, was in it. And, I really enjoyed Horrible Bosses. HB got a horrible review on Amazon, but I found it really funny-- so when I read that this movie also had terrible reviews, I just ignored it and paid $4 to see it.

Unfortunately, the Trailer was a lot different than the actual movie. They really should hire whomever the guy is that makes the trailers to make a movie! I wish I paid more attention to the reviews. THe Change-Up was excessively raunchy.  It would be funny to people who like that kind of humor.  I, myself, find it amusing in small doses and when it's well timed.  The raunchiness here was just over the top though.

I think that might be a reason why this movie didn't make much money. It actually was a financial loss, according to Wiki.  According to IMDB, it is only a 6.5/10.  It had some funny moments, but most of the punchline was captured in the trailer.  There was a lot of cursing and swearing.  There were a lot of vulgar jokes.

It was like they took the Disney movie, where people switch places, but fraternized it. There was a LOT of nudity. It was just randomly placed. Some scenes which were meant to be funny-- struck me as more grotesque.  It looks like the producers were going for shock factor.  If you like movies, like Weather Man or Elf, maybe you would like this.  It is more in the style of Will Farrell humor.

This is nothing like Horrible Bosses or other work that Jason Bateman usually does.  Just so you know- before you purchase....
