This popular series has remained a hit and it is easy to see why.
If you are a Western fan, then its appeal is that of a 'classic' Western series.
The picture quality is good for that era, though many would wish that they would re-master it in COLOR---which would offer the viewer a great deal more in appeal and ability to appreciate the wonderful scenery, as well as making it really come alive.  Color adds depth to each scene as well as the over all reality.
Life is not in black and white...and never was.  The life of a cowboy was mostly outdoors, and people appreciated the beauty of scenery, sunsets, etc.

The last season episodes leave a bit to be desired in terms of variation of story line.  It becomes the same old plot with nothing new.
The first season was clearly the best.  My two favorite episodes were "Till Death Do Us Part" though the ending was silly and not believable.  The other episode about Christmas and a little boy wishing for a rifle to help his sheep rancher father was excellent and gave Steve McQueen a real chance to show his many talents.

Many female Steve McQueen fans will lament that fact that as each season passed, there were fewer and fewer episodes where Josh Randal interacted with women.  Definitely lacking in romance--which was an area that McQueen excelled in as an actor.  Again, the plots became too much alike.
