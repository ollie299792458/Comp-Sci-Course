The Duckie edition of Pretty in Pink is not what it promises to be. It has great interviews, and extra features the original DVD release did not contain, but don't buy it to see Duckie and Andie get together. The promised "Alternate Ending" is not included on the DVD. Many fans say that we should all be satisfied with the original fairy tale ending.  I loved that theater ending, where the girl gets her Prince Charming. It is a great finale.

However, although I agree that it is a fairy tale, one possible happy ending to this fairy tale would be that the underdog, the boy who loved Andie (Duckie) gets the girl. His utter devotion to her happiness is evident in the theatrical version, where her happiness is so much more important to him than his own that he sends her off to the boy she dreams of.  It should make no difference if the actress does not feel genuine chemistry (an argument repeated many times in the DVD interviews)--that's what acting is about: pretending that which is not real. Good acting can make it appear that there is chemistry. We underdog/outcast-types don't feel the theater ending should be thrown out, we just want a chance to see the other possibility, to see Duckie get his wish, and for Andie to realize she loves him too. It was a real disappointment to see this package promise that little snippet of the alternate fantasy, only to have the special features tell us incessantly why it was a bad idea instead.  I did genuinely enjoy seeing the actors discuss their experiences on the set, and laugh at the debate over which ending they thought made the best sense. I would have bought the DVD for those interviews, but I was tricked into buying it for the Duckie ending. It is dishonest that this DVD does not contain the promised contents--even the title promises we will see Duckie prevail.
