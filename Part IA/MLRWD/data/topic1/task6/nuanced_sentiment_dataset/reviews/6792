No Disney movie has ever been awaited with such anticipation as was Pocahontas. After the series of early '90's masterpieces--The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King (which broke both box office and video records) everyone expected the trend to continue. I was wary before the fact that this one might be a letdown, and indeed it was. It didn't live up to the anticipation or the pre-release screening. The "Colors of the Wind" song was good enough to tantalize, but the rest of the score and songs are far from Alan Menken's best (seen in Mermaid and Beast).
Simply put, this movie was a disappointment after the Great Four. It isn't all bad by any means. I appreciate its good points, especially the fact that it didn't give us a predictable white=bad/all things Native American=good scenario and showed us the Indians' prejudices as well as those of the whites. That being said, however, the movie's heart-on-sleeve political correctness becomes very stifling indeed to the escapist joy we expect from even the most serious Disney animated stories. Aladdin proved that Disney animation can be both fun and appealing to adults at the same time. Pocahontas is seriously deficient in the fun factor.
It really was the beginning of the downturn in the latter half of the decade for Disney. None of the other films following it come close to the quality of the Great Four, even though "Hunchback" is undeniably powerful. Now, with the disturbing trend away from musicals seen in "The Emperor's New Groove" and "Atlantis" (which began as early as "Tarzan"), it's hard to believe that Disney can catch the early '90's magic again. Unfortunately, Pocahontas is clearly the beginning of a decline.
