Gelsey Kirkland and Mikhail Baryshnikov are superb; the changes/deletions are not a problem.
THE PROBLEM: it's KULTUR again! The video is very cheaply reproduced,as usual, at premium prices.
In addition to the individual and conjoined talents, the creativeness, the staging, lighting, costumes, directing, etc-
a large part of one's experience is the quality of the physical presentation. As usual, the colors are washed out,the sound outdated.
Others, even with old material, put in the financial resources to restore quality work. KULTUR as usual is cheap and rips off the consumer.
They do the same with their DVD of the Bolshoi Ballet's presentation, incidentally.
For comparisons check out Maurice Bejart's version of the Nutcracker- on another label and The Royal Ballet's presentation on Opus Arte.
Granted these were recorded in recent times; nevertheless, check out lovingly restored DVDs by a company with integrity and you will
see and hear what I mean.
The one star is for the superb work of Gelsey & Mikhail ( I wish I could have given it 5 stars)
Fortunately, I am able to check out DVDs from my Public Library system and thus avoid getting ripped off by KULTUR!
