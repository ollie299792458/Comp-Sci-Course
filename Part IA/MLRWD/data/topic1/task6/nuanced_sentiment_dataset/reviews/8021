Without revealing the ending, Thomas Crown donates one of his own paintings to replace the stolen Monet.  Everything that happens after that is pointless.  Thomas Crown may be handsome and charming, yet he  deliberately makes Catherine jealous to test her and he encourages her to  become a fugitive.  He does nothing but jerk her around, yet she falls in  love with him.  I don't know what Catherine saw in Crown or what he saw in  her.  At first, she dated him just to get the painting back and then she  turned into a whiny, weak clinging vine.  The sex scene on the marble  staircase looked too uncomfortable to be believable.  Rene Russo topless on  the beach was unnecessary.  Faye Dunaway played Crown's psychiatrist, but  considering his behavior, she wasn't helping him.  Crown mispronounced  Lima, Ohio.  (It's like the bean, not the city in Peru.)  It's possible  that Crown wouldn't know this, but Catherine was from there and she didn't  correct him.  The soundtrack, except for "The Windmills of Your  Mind" was intolerable.  People have said it was nice to see the  over-40 Rene Russo in this sexy role.  I've read that the frist choice for  this role was Cameron Diaz.
