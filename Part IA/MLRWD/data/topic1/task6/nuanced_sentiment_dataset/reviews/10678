This movie is absolutely amazing. I have seen it three times thus far and plan on seeing it many more. I was never a fan of Steve Martin. However, this film gives me a whole new respect for him as both a writer and an actor. I rented this movie a while back because of Claire Danes. She has always been a favorite of mine. From the moment this movie starts you are pulled in by her character. She conveys the part of Mirabelle so well and you really feel for her. This story is as true to life as it gets. I have experienced a little bit of everything she has in this movie (except the older rich guy part) but the same scenarios. Whether you are a male like Ray Porter, insecure about getting too close to someone, or a guy like Jeremy who hangs on until the very last moment for someone he loves, or a girl like Mirabelle who has to make a choice to let go in order to be truly loved, this movie WILL move you. You cannot pass this one up. The score is also brilliant. There is not one bad thing I can say for this film. You won't be disappointed.
