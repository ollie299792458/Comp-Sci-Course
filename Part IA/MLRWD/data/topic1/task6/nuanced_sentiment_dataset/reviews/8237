While not the greatest musical ever captured on film, "Bye Bye Birdie" is undeniably a nice diversion for any film-watcher. In the film, the youth of America (or, more specifically, those of the female persuasion) are outraged when popular rock and roll idol Conrad Birdie is drafted. This sets off a case of mass hysteria around the entire nation. But there is one conciliation for the throngs of teeny-boppers. Before he leaves for the army, Birdie will sing a brand new song on "The Ed Sullivan Show" and, at the song's conclusion, will kiss one lucky girl goodbye. This girl is Kim, a teenage girl from the Midwest with a pretty face, nuclear family, and a steady boyfriend. Her world, however, is turned upside-down throughout the story which is filled with dancing, teenage romance, and comedy. Ann-Margaret puts in a great performance as Kim, most notably the "I've Got A Lot of Livin' To Do" number. Bobby Rydell also does a great job in the role of Kim's boyfriend Hugo.  The show stealer is, however Albert, Biochemist-turned-songwriter played by Dick Van Dyke. His musical number "Put on A Happy Face" is the undeniable highlight of the film. The film is rather corny at times, but is still worth the time of checking it out.
