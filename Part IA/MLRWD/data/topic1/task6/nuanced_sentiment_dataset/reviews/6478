The editing in this feature left a lot to be desired in terms of what the actual show must have been.

The concert is inter-cut with a bunch of subplots of fans and their reactions to certain characters on the show, which is fine. Only in the process, actual performances were cut short or cut out altogether. The editing on some of the performances themselves was badly done as well. There was a whole jitterbug performance by Britney that was ruined due to bad camera work and editing.

Based on some other 3D live performances I have viewed, I found that less is more. Fast cutting and insane camera moves only help to pull you out of the feeling of actually being among the audience. I love get bird's eye views, but not if the camera is literally swooping on stage and past the actual performances.

The extra features included a bunch of intros to performances by Sue Sylvester that were disconnected that if actually part of the presentation, would have made more sense and made the show feel like a complete package.

And where was Mr. Schuester?! I mean if Holly Holiday (Gwyneth Paltrow) can have a cameo, where was he?

Was this whole production handled by a Fox intern?
