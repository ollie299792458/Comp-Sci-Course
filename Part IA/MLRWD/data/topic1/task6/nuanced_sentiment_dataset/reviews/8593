Robin Williams in this movie unfolds, for once more, the charisma he has for comedy. His transforming to Mrs. Doubtfire undoubtly brings to mind Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie. Still this is an original movie since Robin Williams does not do it to launch his carrer as an actor, or to win the heart of a woman but he does it to be close to his children.

The movie is hillarious with timeless funny scenes. Pierce Brosnan seems to feel awkward with the things Robin Williams does and you wonder whether he is just acting or he is REALLY feeling this way since Robin Williams does not seem to follow the script but he does his own things.On the same note the kids (especially the youngest one) give you the impression that they are genuinely amused with the things Robin Williams does.

THe movie is filmed in San Fransisco, which along with New York is my favourite city for shooting films. A very entairtening movie with very positive messages about parenthood or even more specific fatherhood. At the end of the movie you come to love and sympathize with Robin Williams accepting him for what he is: A man with wicknesses but with devotion to his children.
