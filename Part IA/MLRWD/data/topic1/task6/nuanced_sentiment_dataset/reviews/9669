when some people think of classic, gothic horror, they think of Dracula or Frankenstein, or the Shining. This movie and the short story it was based on fit the bill.

one of the few things we have when we are alone with someone--anyone, is trust. trust that when we are sleeping, nothing will happen to us. this movie takes advantage of that in the worst way. a group of men, all working in the unforgiving antarctic for different reasons, and some don't like each other.  they are isolated from others by distance and the harsh conditions--and there is a monster among them.

when Carpenter first created this film, it was not only panned by critics, but he was called "the pornographer of violence" for creating it. imagine creating something so wonderful, and having small minds tear it apart. i'm suprized he didn't quit making movies altogether.

fortunately, critical reactions have cooled, and the movie is consistently listed among the top 20 or so horror movies of all time. you have to watch it for yourself to see why. if you haven't seen this movie, and are watching it for the first time, it will be on par w/ watching "Alien" as a virgin viewer. you won't regret it.
