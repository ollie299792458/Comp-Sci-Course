Let's face it... this movie is one of those box-office hits of the month. While this movie is surely popular with sports car enthusiasts nation wide, there is relatively no real drama anywhere in the film. This was a definitive characteristic of the original "Gone in 60 Seconds," only the car chase in it was much more entertaining... and much longer. And although there is not one single dynamic character in the entire film... that's not really the point, is it?

The point is that with a big enough budget, some big-name actors, and action producer Capo Jerry B., people are going to be entertained. There are actually some exciting car chases, as well as some interesting cop and robber interaction. However, the plot driven narative makes for plenty of tongue in cheek moments, albeit taken with a grain of salt.

At the end of the day, "Gone In 60 Seconds" might keep your attention long enough to realize that you should have just watched "The Rock," Jerry B. and Nic Cage's action packed masterpiece. Nevertheless... this film is not bad. The movie is fun, and the cars really do make your mouth water; I was definitely convinced by Eleanor, as well as her little red button.

In the end, there is one huge problem with the film... the Lamborghini Diablo has minimal screen time... come on people!!! I know they had the car rented long enough to give it some decent screen time and maybe a car chase or two... but nooooooo; just Nic stealing the car and driving away, and that is it. It's such a crying shame. If you want get a good look at a Diablo, as well as see one in action, watch "Bedazzled."

I only recommend buying this movie under three different circumstances. One: in one of those cheap two packs... Two: used at a dirt cheap price... Three:  the next time it appears in a Sunday newspaper ad or on Amazon.com for less than 10 dollars.
