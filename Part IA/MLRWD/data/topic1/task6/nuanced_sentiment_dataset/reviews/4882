Yes that's right everybody "5 stars". Ya it's pure trash. So? Sometimes it feels great to lower your standards, and really underachieve. Some of the nicest and classiest peoples I know have those qualities. O.K. I have to admit the heros in this drama drink a lot of beer, copious amounts one might say: chugging, drinking, shotgunning, gulping and shooting lot's of Beer. Beer drinking for sport; in celebration, in remorse and out of respect. Drinking beer under social conditions, and with personally destructive results. Beer drinking training. And Yes, a beer drowning (no surprise). The plethora of hangovers are uncountable, some more creative in their debauchery than others. But I admire how these plucky individuals fight against all odds, to better themselves. One brave soul sacrifices a lucritive carrier as a male prostitute. There are gratuitous shots of [...], profanity, male nudity and more profanity. But Cloris Leachman's throttling of a kielbasa is one of the finest moments ever put to celloloid. After all, aren't we all beer drinking losers, subject to even the slightest whim from our loins. God knows I am.
