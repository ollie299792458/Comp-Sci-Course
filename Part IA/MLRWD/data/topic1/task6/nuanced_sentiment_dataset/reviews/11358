hello people of amazon,

this will be maybe too personal what i will write.

this movie is an absolutely transcendental meditation, like a dream, a unique masterpiece, one needs to see it a few times at least to be able to capture the deepness there. like a very nice song you want to listen many times again and again, this movie is something like this. each time you see it you realize a new point, you recognize a new detail in it. you discover that some camera movements, some details you had skipped and did not even recognize previously gain importance when you see the movie again and again.

this is in one hand a disadvantage for the spectator beacuse one needs to have a deep concentration on the movie while watching it which is not easy always. i guess in general there are some prequisites -should i say unfortunately maybe- for the spectators to sit down to watch some of the Fellini, Visconti,  Antonioni, Bergman, Pasolini movies (we might name many great art cinema directors as well). 8 1/2 is without any doubt a very good exaple in this context.

the dream scene in the beginning was so nice and impressive but still personally i found the "asa nisi masa" scene absolutely fantastic. some people associate this scene with Jung's "anima" (a-sa ni-si ma-sa) theory thinking that Fellini in fact did mean something really beyond. again more personally for me, the camera movements, the zooming into the picture on the wall and zooming out into the face of the little girl, the absolutely great music chosen there, the old lady and her conversations with the children, the discrete images of the burning fire, the woman entering a door all seem irrelevant, however in fact put-together as a whole they serve to complete the plot(s) of the movie. Fellini invites you into his dreams, shares them with you and makes you dream wtih him together.

a great movie, a must see for the people who love cinema.
