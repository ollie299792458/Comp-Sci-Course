I am shocked at the star rating given to this movie. It seems most viewers based their recommendation soley on action (which wasn't great) and not a bit of facts (in which this movie was sorely lacking).

I spent two years as an aid worker in the Balkans after the Bosnian war and the NATO siege of Serbia and Kosovo. I went to see this film expecting to get at least a shred of credibility. I should have known better. What I saw, to my extreme disapointment, was the usual Hollywood pander, presenting a fictionalized account of true events as recycled media fare: the Serbs were the only bad guys, everyone else was victimized, no other ethnic group committed any war crimes. Rubbish! I worked with hundreds of Serbs were innocent victims in this tragic civil war. Outside the town where I worked in Bosnia, there was a "concentration camp" where Croats jailed other Croats who refused to fight against the Muslims! Does that say anything about the insanity of this war? For Hollywood to present such a stereotypical, one-sided aspect of the situation is irresponsible and poor judgement-- for some people, this may be one of the only movies they about the Bosnian war, and they will walk away thinking they know the whole story.

If you want to see an outstanding war movie as well as a more accurate representation of what happend in Bosnia, check out the movie "Savior" with Dennis Quaid. At least they try to present all sides of the story, rather than doing a gross injustice to a complex war as in "Behind Enemy Lines."
