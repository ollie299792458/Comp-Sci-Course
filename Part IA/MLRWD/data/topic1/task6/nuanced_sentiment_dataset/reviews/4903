This movie is a vast improvement on number two,but that is not that hard really.Eric Mabius plays the character a lot better than Vincent perez's  manic turn with a menacing sense of calm about him,it fits the role better.The gorgeus and talented Kirsten Dunst seems a bit wasted,as her part is fairly low key and reserved.A slighly better plot about wrongful death by execution  adds to the storyline.But where we have one improvement,another is bound to go wrong and in this case sadly the film has a rather low budget look about it,and I prefer the Batman- style gothic city look of the first two movies which does not appear so much here.Also,the character is fast becoming a cliche' unfortunatly.How many times can a person be raised from the dead and all decide to wear a long black raincoat or leather jacket as well as the goth/metalhead look.The action also fails to hit the mark again compared to part 1,again the showdown is a low-key shootout with not much else happening.Do not get me wrong though,I am still a fan of the series,and this part has better actors and storyline than no.2,but has not got the look of the first and second.The DVD is a good quality affair also with insightful special features and great picture,and a good choice of digtal surround sound mixes.Roll on part 4,this instalment is heading in the right direction.
