After seeing the lot of video game-to-big screen adaptations, you have to realize that these movies are primarily flashy B-movies.

With that being said, it's not doomed at all - like some of its predecessors have been. The production is great. The sets are complete duplications of the game's setting. You get a good sense of Doom 3, the game. The special monster effects were done by none other that Stan Winston(Alien series, etc.). For that reason alone you should check this movie out.

With regard to the storyline changing: The changes to the story are done with class and intelligence. If you weren't in Hell, then why not science class? Genetic engineering isn't exactly completely sci-fi these days, so it's acceptable. The only bad spot was the first-person sequence. It was completely uncalled for and wasn't really thought through at all. I got the feeling of walking through a Halloween spookhouse watching people in low budget costumes jump out of corners screaming "BOO!".

Bottom line...if you like the Rock, a decent action/sci-fi film that entertains, pick this up at your video store as a rental. Again, these B-movie game genre films aren't for everyone.
