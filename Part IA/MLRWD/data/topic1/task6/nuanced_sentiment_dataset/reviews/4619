From a technical point-of-view, the reconstruction of 'The Big Red One' was very, very well done. It's hard to see technical faults.

If you like combat, there is a lot of it in this film. However,  the film still shows the unusual continuity of the original.

Overall, he film as a whole does not flow from one battle scene to another like a 'normal' film does. It start with scenes in North Africa, but it jumps from one battle to another, then you are suddenly on another ship going somewhere. There is nothing to hold the film as a whole together. I understand from the extras that this is what Sam Fuller, a WWII combat veteran and director of this film, experienced. But unlike this film, while he may not have known where he was going when he boarded a ship for an invasion, he knew that two months passed since the last battle and that he had been recuperating in XYZ for those 2 months. We weren't there and didn't experience it, so to me, the film jumps from one battle scene or even from one continent to another with little to tie the bits together.

And to be honest, some of the battle scenes seem kind-of corny.
