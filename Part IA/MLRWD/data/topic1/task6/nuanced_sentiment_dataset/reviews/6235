While I'm not a fan of the usual slasher flick, I was wooed by the creative and intriguing trailer for this film and had to see it, in order to find out if it was able to outdo the original.  I'm still not sure which I like better, but I have come to a few conclusions.

The cinematography is incredible in this film.  Every scene seems gritty and dirty, each set piece infested with either dust or some other type of gore.  It is easy to know right away which places the characters want to avoid.  But, of course, they do not avoid them and eventually meet their demise.

Jessica Biel is her usual self, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.  But it is just a little unsettling to watch sweet Mary Camden use the expected language of a rated R slasher.  The film goes for more of the shock factor than gross-out by introducing several disturbing scenes:  a very graphic suicide, creepy calm townspeople with a hidden agenda, and a hatefully immoral sheriff (played by Full Metal Jacket star R. Lee Ermey).

All together, the film was entertaining, but very unsettling.  If the action were not constant (unforgiving, even), I may not have enjoyed it.  But the story picks up very quickly and the fast-paced thrill ride does not let up until the end.

If you are looking for an entertaining, but not necessarily great, movie to keep you watching, this is a good one.  If you are looking for a more intelligent and scary thriller, look elsewhere.  Recommended for fans of the original.
