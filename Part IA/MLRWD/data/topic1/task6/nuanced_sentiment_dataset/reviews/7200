Like many, I was interested in the train-wreck that Joaquin Phoenix had supposedly become a year or so back.  Personally, I felt this business was all a hoax from the get-go, but the real question is, WAS IT A HOAX - OR WAS THE FINISHED PRODUCT AN ELABORATE COVER-UP?  I'll be honest with you, I enjoyed Joaquin's performance in "Walk The Line" - being a somewhat fan of Johnny Cash - but I was never a big Phoenix fan.  That's the problem that I have with this movie.  Though nobody can deny the innate talent that Phoenix has, in my opinion, he (despite his Oscar noms) was not such a big star that this doc would not make you think this could or couldn't be real.  And I guess, in retrospect, this is the hook that made people wonder whether any of this was all real or ficticious to begin with.  That being said, the movie is somewhat entertaining, but I honestly feel that it would have been more widely accepted had the audience been in on the joke to begin with.  As a piece of performance art, I guess you could say that this is alright.  I'm not disappointed to have spent money on this.  As a mockumentary, I think the box office totals speak for themselves.  At the end of the day, I can only say to Joaquin Phoenix and Casey Affleck, "hey, you got my 20 bucks, and I have no problem with that, but please, if you do this again, don't show so much male frontal nudity".  Okay, now I've gotten that out of the way, gentlemen, go back to making real movies.  I participated in this experiment with you (since I paid for it), but in the end I am left feeling less than satisfied.  On second thought, hit this one up on Redbox.  Oh yeah, I'm going to be nasty now - one of the guys in the commentary sounds like Chris Griffin from "Family Guy".  Sorry to make fun of people with speech impediments.
