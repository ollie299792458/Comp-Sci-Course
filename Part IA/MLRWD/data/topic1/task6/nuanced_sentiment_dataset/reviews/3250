I own this DVD set.  And though I like it, that doesn't change the fact that it sucks lead bricks. Why do you watch action movies? For action.  Why do you watch ... well you get the idea.

This is an action series.  The beautiful graphics always deliver, and so do the fight scenes.  The characters, histories, items, and weapons are all very creative and original (although the plot devices are anything but original -- oh wait, did I say plot? What plot?).

And I know other reviewers got sick of Samuel Jackson's voice after a while, but I didn't at all, and was glad to continue watching the series (Of course, I often fast-forwarded with subtitles turned-on during the fast-forwarding, to get to those action scenes or those scenes that seem important without slowing the pace). I still have faith in Samuel L. Jackson's acting abilities, despite his part in the new SW trilogy.

That being said, the dialog, motivations, character interaction, etc. are all sub-par.  It's really stupid. And I mean really stupid.

If you like great martial arts, then rent this and keep the fast-forward button handy.  If you love great graphics, martial arts movies, and Samuel L. Jackson, buy it anyway, and keep the fast-forward button handy.  Just keep in mind, you'll be using the fast-forward button often.

If you love good anime (I'm not talking animation quality here) or can't stand to watch sub-par stories and horrid film execution, just move along. There's nothing to see here.
