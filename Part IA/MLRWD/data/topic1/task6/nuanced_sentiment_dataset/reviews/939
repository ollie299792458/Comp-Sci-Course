Perhaps most irritating is the Lloyd Bridges line to the token female astronaut when she comments sarcastically about women simply staying home and raising babies: "Isn't that enough?"  I think the most remarkable thing about this terrible film is its stereotypes.  Yes, the film was made many years ago, and I don't mean to say that these were not present in great films of the era or fault the filmmakers for this, I'm simply saying that it's an interesting cultural nugget.  The man from Texas is deeply offended when someone says that Texas looks like a mere speck from space (come on, I'm from Texas, but it would).  The woman who chooses career - and a male-dominated scientific career at that - over home and family is portrayed as cold (and overly emotional when her correct calculations are discarded) until she finally realizes that she simply needs a man to hold her.  Further, how silly is it that there is an intensely planned trip to the moon and then oops!  We're on Mars instead.  You "can pretty much sense the string" elevating the objects that are supposed to be floating when gravity starts to go on the fritz (see "Things which are Funny Floating").  However, a much more tolerable version of this film was indeed done by that guy and his two robots.  It was the first episode (#201) in the cable era of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and well worth it if you can find a copy.
