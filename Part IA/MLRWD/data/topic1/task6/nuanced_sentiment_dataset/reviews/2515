let me start by saying that i am a guy who really likes comic book movies, and i love well done vampire movies ever since Salems Lot scared the bejesus out of me when i was a kid.  I wasn't terribly impressed with the first Blade, but i went to this one anyway to see what the movie producers thought of their audience these days.  now i just want to cry.
script:  i originally thought it was written by a 3rd grader, but then i went and looked at some of my own 3rd grade writing, and now i feel that i overestimated the film.
acting:  i didn't notice any, but if i catch any when it comes to dvd, i'll edit my review.  i don't understand why snipes does these.  he's capable of so much better work.  sigh.
casting:  dracula looks like a runway model.  who decided to make the most evil being alive, the father of all vampires a piece of well-dressed eye candy?  and the lead female vampire, a sort of young sandra bernhardt without the talent (yeah, it was that bad,) was as uninspired as they come.  did anyone even tell her she was playing a vampire?
visuals:  probably kind of cool, but as EVERY SINGLE THING in the movie was BLACK, it was really hard to see things, especially at night (95% of the movie.)  i know black is cool, but that was very, very dreary, hard to make details out, and just visually dull.
music:  an absolute assault.  i understand how great it is to have really intense music help shape cinematic climaxes, but apparently the director thought that the whole movie was a climax, which by definition means that there were none.
If this sounds harsh, i'll point out that even people who liked the first two are writing in to say that this one was not as good, so you can imagine what that means for the rest of us.
i gave it two stars, because some of the wisecracks were funny, but let my experience be a warning to the wary.  it's a crime that anybody was paid to make this thing.
