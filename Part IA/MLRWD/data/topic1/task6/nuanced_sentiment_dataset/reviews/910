I am a horror/psychological thriller fan myself, and I was looking forward to this one. All the theories and mythology surrounding mirrors made this one look like a really good investment. I suppose it just comes down to taste, however. The use of gore, special effects and injury makeup is so much that many of the supernatural characters and injuries are grotesque. If you're a SAW fan, I'm sure this won't bother you, but I actually did cover the eyes of the person who was with me during the bathtub scene. That was ridiculous, and wholly unnecessary. Overkill would be putting it lightly, and the same goes for a lot of the "attacks" on humans. The ending will leave you asking yourself what in hell just happened.

The concept behind it is interesting, but when you finally find out what's going in, you might find yourself scratching your head, wondering how it even slightly makes sense. I understand suspending belief for the sake of entertainment, but I did not find this entertaining. The highlight of the movie for me was watching the cop's reflection smile and take a shot at him.

Final verdict: If you're into gore, outrageous plots and really pushing the limits, this might be for you. If you're like me--a horror fan just trying to find another movie to enjoy--then I suggest saving the money. I spent one cent on this movie, plus three dollars shipping, and I STILL want my money back. I'm selling it as soon as possible.
