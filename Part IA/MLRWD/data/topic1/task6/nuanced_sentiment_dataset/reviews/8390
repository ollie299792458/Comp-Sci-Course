My opinion of the this film is very mixed, perhaps confusing. I apologize if it does not help:
T3 will be extremely exciting for newcomers to the Terminator genre, but die-hard fans of the first 2 films may be slightly disappointed. Arnold is back in top form, perhaps his best form. Kristanna Loken's Terminatrix was calculated and cold, making her a perfect killing machine. Unfortunately, Nick Stahl bears no resemblance to the John Conner we are familiar with(blonde???) My largest complaint was this: This time, Arnold's Terminator is not likeable at all. He is cold, rude, and devoid of chemistry with John. He reminds me of Linda Hamilton's Sarah from T2, who, thankfully, was not in this installment. The fight sequences between The Terminator and The Terminatrix were very intense and exciting. The most satisfying surprise in T3 is the cameo of Dr. Silberman in the graveyard scene. It was, among many other scenes, very funny and nostalgic of the previous films. Unlike the intense stand-off at Cyberdyne headquarters in T2, there is no defining battle sequence in T3. When I first heard that James Cameron's passing on this film, I did not think it would have a large impact. I was wrong. I think if Cameron had made T3, it would have been legendary as the first 2 films. Sadly, The Terminator franchise follows in the footsteps of The Alien franchise: a disappointing third installment that does not live up to the previous efforts. Is James Cameron trying to tell us something? In closing, go see it, if for nothing else, entertainment purposes.
