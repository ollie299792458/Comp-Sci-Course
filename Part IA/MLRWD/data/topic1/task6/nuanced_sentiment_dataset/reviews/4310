I watched this movie out of curiosity for the new Russian cinema. I have also read some very ecstatic reviews regarding Sokurov's achievements in movie making. However having finished watchig Father and Son I was largely left flabbergasted by all the praise given this film. To me, this whole thing has never been able to go beyond the ambicious idea. Being a native Russian speaker I was able to follow the dialogue closely and was practically taken aback by the amaturishness of the way actors engage in talk. The conversations and acting did seem so unsettlingly contrived and insincere that several times my intention was simply to turn it off and be done with it. But somehow I've gotten to the very end of it. This was my second dissatisfied encounter with Socurov's work. The first one was Russian Ark, which, beyond its technical originality and scope, to me, amounted to little more than visual expression of Russian paranoia and the screaming desire to be accepted among the "cultured" of this world.
