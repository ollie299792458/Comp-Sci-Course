I have been an avid fan of Donnie Yen since Iron Monkey back in 1993. Every film that he is involved in as an actor, he only improves in age. After watching this film, I must say this is his best work to date. The choreography is top notch as well as his acting and Donnie hardly kicks (Donnie Yen is known for his acrobatic Kicks) in the film which is hard to believe!. The style that he uses in the film is Wing Chun which uses more arm and hand combat, and less kicking like the Mantis Style. There is one crucial point to this film, and that is Donnie Yen portrays the life of Ip Man. Ip Man was a master of Wing Chun in the 1930's from Fo Shan, China. This is the first film ever to be filmed about the life and times of Ip Man and it was worth the wait. For those of you who is not familiar with Ip Man, he was the instructor who taught Lee Jun-Fan ('''; pinyin: L' Zh&egrave;nf'n) also known as Bruce Lee.

Did you know that Ip Man and Bruce Lee were on Film together?. Watch "Enter The Dragon" you will see Ip Man in a cameo appearance with Bruce Lee.

In the meantime... I look forward to Donnie Yen's next project.
