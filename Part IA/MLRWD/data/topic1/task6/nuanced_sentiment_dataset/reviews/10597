"Louie" is a fantastic series and I hope FX sees it through to Louis C.K.'s satisfaction and grants him as many seasons as he likes. However, preliminary artwork has been revealed and shows that the Blu-ray edition will use "flipper" discs, with Blu-ray media on one side of a disc, and DVD media on the other side of that same disc (for more examples, see Universal's BD/DVD "flipper" releases of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00371QQ34">The Jackal (Combo Blu-ray and Standard DVD) [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00371QQ5W">Out of Africa: 25th Anniversary (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00371QQ8Y">Traffic (Combo Blu-ray and Standard DVD) [Blu-ray</a>]).

Beyond the problem of most consumers paying more for a dual format release, the biggest practical problem with these releases is that you cannot put the disc down anywhere outside of the player or its case, and you must handle the disc by its edges at all times--there is no labeled side that you can rest the disc on while swapping them out, for example.

This type of release is completely unacceptable, and I cannot purchase this set if it is packaged with BD/DVD "flipper" discs.

I beg 20th Century Fox to re-consider this poor decision and release the Blu-ray edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R4ZMOK">Louie Season 1 2Disc Combo (in Blu-Ray Packaging)</a> with Blu-ray Discs only, or alternatively, with separate Blu-ray and DVD discs.

Again, I cannot support this release until the situation is rectified. My deepest apologies to Louis C.K. and the entire creative team behind "Louie"; I really hope this message reaches someone at Twentieth Century Fox in time to correct this planned release.
