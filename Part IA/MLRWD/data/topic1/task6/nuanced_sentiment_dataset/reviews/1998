I have seen several anime films in the last ten years or so (anyone does who has friends who draw, I think) and most of it has either left me disgusted or, even if impressed by the animation, bored and wondering why I didn't just watch Bugs Bunny instead.
Up until now the best one I had seen was "Princess Mononoke", and it was tedious for a good twenty minutes right in the middle of the film.
Metropolis, however, transcends Japanimation.
I thought, watching it, that if someone made a live-action version of this, shot for shot, it would undoubtedly be the highest grossing film in history, and probably take home the Best Picture Oscar.  Not that there is anything in it that can really be called "acting", and the story, though very deep (especially for anime) and thought-provoking, is not one of the most thrilling ever told.
However, a combination of tightly direction action (and repose), a script universal and yet human enough to make you genuinely care about these 2-D characters--and some of the most amazing visuals ever juxtaposed on screen--make Metropolis a high quality SF FILM and the fact that is it animated and tied to a dubious genre is almost negligible.
Except, of course, that you will marvel that something so epic and detailed can go from an idea in a man's head, to a drawing, to the setting for a world that will make your seen your own in a new way...
