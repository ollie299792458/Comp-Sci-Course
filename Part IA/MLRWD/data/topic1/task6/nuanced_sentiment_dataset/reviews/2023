I am one of those who loves all the older classic horror films and I was reluctant to watch this one. I won't even bother watching the remake of Nightmare on elm street since Robert England isn't Freddy Krueger for heavens sake. But I finally made myself watch this one......first off it ticks me off that they have to ruin movies with all the naked bodies and raunchy sex, which this movie is minus the raunchy sex. I know all you guys out there totally enjoy that part of a horror film....but hey that is what pornos are for right!? I did however get the biggest laugh out of the groin part and that is all I will say on that note. Still the original is so so much creepier....that is the whole point of a horror flick is to be scared. So if you are interested in humor and naked chicks.......everywhere.........then rent this, however if you want to be afraid I suggest renting movies like Sole Survivor, The Beyond....these are older type of movies but they are much better without all the fakeness of todays computer technology.....back in those days it was all about making things look as real as possible. But Piranha isn't scary at all just silly and raunchy.
