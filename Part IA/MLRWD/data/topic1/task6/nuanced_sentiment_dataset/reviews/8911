This is an important movie that any classic horror fan should have. It is the first (if not, one of ) Zombie movie. Bela Lugosi as a voodoo doctor with Zombie slaves. Some good early drama, romance and horror. Yes it is dated, but if like a good atmospheric horror film that moves on a purposely slow pace and has a great chilling performance by Lugosi (his evil eyes are really creepy) then you will enjoy this.
For those of you who haven't seen this and are curios about this movie and other classic horrors - definitely check this out. This is very well done horror not titled Frankenstein or Dracula. It is roughly about an hour or so long & is great to watch on a nice cold foggy day or when in the mood to watch an old gritty black and white horror film
If you want to buy it or see it, I recommend the DVD from the Roan group as the transfer is as sharp as I have ever seen. It is a public domain film so many companies like Alpha have released it, but the Roan Group is the one to get..plus is has a few cool bonus features..
The movie might not hold up well compared to today's zombie movie standards, but film historians and others who want to see movies that are ground breakers in their time certainly should not pass this little gem up...
