I just want to say that I'm not mad that Robert (Schwartzman) Carmine isn't back. I'm mad because the plot of this movie SO goes against Meg Cabbot's books.

 Not to be rude or anything, but why do these movies even share the same title as the books? It seriously makes NO sense. Ok, so the first movie was a lot different than the book, but not THIS different. I'm sorry, but this movie sounds like it's going to be horrible. I'm not one to be bitter, but as a happy Rooney fan who discovered Robert Carmine from the first movie, it's a bit annoying how they pressed the connection at the end of the movie, and then made a sequel without him. Obviously, I think it was Rob's choice not to make an appearence in the film (and with the plot the way it is, I totally applaude him!). If you're purely mad about Rob's absence in the film, go buy Rooney's cd. :) (&lt;- you'll recognize the garage band tune from the first movie as track 1 on it!). Still, I kinda wish they would have just STOPPED with the first movie. The prologue, while meant to make fans of Carmine's band happy, is dumb. Really dumb. 'OH! I think I'll concentrate on making my band famous while one of my best friends and love interests, (no, wait, we were never that!) is getting married and stuff!' Michael's character is totally wrecked. With the books, it's such a precious little Mia/Michael connection, and the movies just put the books to shame. Honestly! Mia trying to decided over 2 princes smitten with her.

 It's funny, because specifically in the first book, Mia recalls Lilly saying something anti-Disney. Yep, I'd have to agree with Lilly these days, especially with this film. Can we say MAJOR MONEY MAKER AT THE EXPENSE OF THE BOOKS??!

 Do yourself a huge favor:

 READ THE BOOKS. thanks.
