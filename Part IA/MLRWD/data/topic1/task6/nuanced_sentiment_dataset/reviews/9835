This was a different role for Sean Connery. Sean Connery was General Roy Urquhart, the commander of the British 1st Paratroop Division in the most disastrous blunder of World War II____namely the Allied invasion of The Netherlands on September 17, 1944. What went wrong? In a word, everything! The Dutch Resistance wasn't contacted. Given the fact that it had been compromised early in the war, I can see why. The Germans were in retreat and the puppet government of Seyss-Inquart was tottering on the brink of collapse. So what happened to OPERATION MARKET-GARDEN? It failed. It was bold in concept but it failed. It failed because the Germans knew we were coming. There were also twice as many casualties as D-Day. How could this have happened? The Netherlands had been invaded along with France, Belgium, and Luxembourg in 1940. Plus the Allies didn't practice for it. They'd just sent troops over piecemeal and ordered them to hold three bridges. One at Nijmegen, one on the Maas, and one at Arnhem. The Germans had been able to temporarily turn back the Allies. It didn't last. The September Miracle was a one-time deal.
