I have to admit that this movie could have been an utter disaster. And this movie did a few things pretty well, while other things could have used some polish, some rewrites and maybe some different direction altogether in some areas. Helmsworth was great as Thor I'd have to admit. The story overall was rushed and I get that there is enough of Thor's back story to easily make two movies (and it is a popcorn movie) but as a comic fan you can only hope for the treatment that it deserves. The love story wasn't developed enough for anyone to care-but that aside--Portman has never looked better. Asgard was interesting but never felt 'real'. The place seemed empty and devoid of a population despite a rather large crowd shot. And the small town where Thor lands in feels a bit to much like a movie set. I also  could have done without the giant metal guy-it reminded me too much of those 50's alien invasion movies-little cheesy.

I'd have to say I'm not sure what I was expecting....Maybe a bit more Braveheart...A bit more Kevin Noland. But all-in-all its not a bad attempt, and while fun and entertaining-- I can't shake the feeling that this film will not age well.
