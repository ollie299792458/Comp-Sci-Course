This review is for the blu ray product AND the movie itself.

Saw IV on blu ray is great. Apart from some grain or other small (hardly noticeable) goofs, this is a great film in high definition. The sound (music/ sound effects) was great. The Unrated, Director's Cut of the film in blu ray means more footage of violence in more detail (making the squeamish cringe more). The special features are great and numerous including audio commentaries and several "the making of..." footage of traps, props, and the "Director's Diary" which explains the making of the film from the Director's point of view. All in all: a great horror experience.

The film itself is actually better than many say it is. With many film franchises it's difficult to please EVERYONE. Obviously, film critics were not the intended audience. This film is intended for fans of: the series, gore, plot twists, and watching your friends cringe. Fans of the series will love the traps, returning characters, and the addition of more of Jigsaw's back story. People can also enjoy this movie just for the horror because there's plenty of it while not caring about the plot. There are also plenty of clever twists and revelations that should satisfy people who like surprises.

Although, compared to the others of the series, its not the best, it is still a better move than given credit for. People that criticize it for having a confusing story shouldn't complain because they are watching a fourth movie in a series and expect to know everything thats going on. People that don't like the acting have standards too high for "scary movie" acting (you try being a normal person pretending to be in very desperate situations and see how "convincing" you are).
