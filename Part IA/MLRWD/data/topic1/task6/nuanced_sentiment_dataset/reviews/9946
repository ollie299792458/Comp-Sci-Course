How embarrassing!  I have told a BUNCH of my friends with kids to check out the Wiggles because my kids LOVE them, and I think they are kind of entertaining myself.  When I said this I thought of the Wiggles from such films as Toot Toot, Wiggle Time, and Wiggly Wiggly World.  Great kids songs, good choreograhpy, nice sets, etc.  So...a few of my friends went out and purchased the Wiggles latest flicks.  For those not familiar, we are talking Cowboys, Sailing, and Big Red Car.  YIKES!!!  They HATED them and wanted to know what I was thinking.  One of my friends gladly gave Red Car to me (they said they wouldn't watch it more than once), and oh my!  I wish I NEVER recommended the Wiggles!  This movie was just so so so bad.  I felt terrible that my friend bought this movie on my suggestion of the group.  I couldn't believe this was the same Wiggles on my earlier DVDs.  What the heck happened to them?!  I thought their movies would get better as they went on, but this was definetly not the case.  My friends ALL HATED the Wiggles.  I feel so bad.  I will never recommend the Wiggles again to a friend.  At least not their later work.  I love the Wiggles earlier work but Here Comes the Big Red Car is a BAD BAD BAD movie.
