This movie is a complete waste of money. Let me list the let-downs. First of all, Jackie Cooper playing James Hawkins is WAY to young. In the unabridged series, James is about fourteen, or fifteen, not nine or ten. Jackie should not pooch his lip out, he looks like a baby. The Jim in the book is poor, so why was Jim in the movie dressed in rather expensive clothes? The movie was also very poorly written. It barely stuck to the real story, but had a lot of other stuff added in to "fill space". There were a lot of other characters that were not really supposed to be there, like the musician, and some people in Silver's pub. There are not supposed to be any carriages that ran over Pew. The so called "Sailors" were pathetic. Also, Mr. Hawkins never appeared in the move, and made it very empty in the beginning, and the ending was a total letdown. They never ported in Bristol again. Silver never gave Jim his parrot in the book, until you read, "Back To Treasure Island", which is two or three years later in Jim's life. Take my advice, and just stick to unabridged books, they won't let you down.
