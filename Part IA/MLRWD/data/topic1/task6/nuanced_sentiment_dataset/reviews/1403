(that's from the film folks, don't get mad at me)

ZMD takes one of the popular tropes of zombie films and turns it on it's comic ear. A lot of times the biggest challenge the characters face in any zombie movie is getting along with each other. In ZMD, they tear it off at the arm and run with it making the first (as far as I know) political zombie comedy.

The beginning of the movie has a great scene showing the uber-idyllic life that's going on on this island and is accompanied by some cheery music which gave me high hopes for the rest of the film. The first 30 minutes are a slow burn while the inhabitants go about their lives and zombies start appearing here and there in the background of the shots. Again, something that worked great.
When the zombies finally come out in force, they never quite feel threatening, seeming more of a plot device to move the characters along their paths.

But there is plenty of blood and gore to keep it going along, the effects are good and the comic bits mostly work with a couple of great one liners. If you need a zombie fix, this should hold you over for a bit..
