Big names, but strictly a film for teenage boys to snigger at.  It's rated 18 - anyone older than that will be disappointed.
I think this movie must have been intended as an `American Pie' with women outside their teens.  You know, raunchy, fun, yet with the grace of knowing what it is and laughing at itself and the world.  Whatever, I am stunned that Cameron Diaz and Selma Blair would put their names to this tacky piece of film that is an excuse for pretty women to shake their booty and talk (and sing!) about male anatomy.  Intelligent this is not.  Christina Applegate's defining TV character Kelly might have written, produced and starred in this it is so mindless and immature.  But here Applegate is the `mature' one - a foil to Diaz's ditzy character. 
Perhaps this film is supposed to be striking a blow for feminism - you know, girls can be shallow and only after one thing too.  That message is clear in the first five minutes of the film - I'm only sorry I spent the next 82 minutes of my life watching it to see if maybe there was something more.  There wasn't.
