I have read like three books on Joan of Arc and I have seen the mini-series on NBC, starring LeeLee Sobieski (I love you!).  Everything I have seen or read about Joan of Arc, Jean d'Arc, was better than The Messenger.  Joan was a kind, wonderful person but this movie made her look like a maniac that should be put away.  Though I have to say Milla Jovovich played a wonderful crazy person.  Joan's visions weren't even correct.  In the movie she saw some man that looked like Jesus, while in life she saw Saints, such as St. Catherine.  The war scenes were gruesome, but I liked them; they were realistic.  Another thing wrong was how Joan found her sword.  She didn't find it in a meadow, as if someone dropped it there and she found it.  Her voices told her that the sword was in St.Catherine's temple around the alter, so she sent some of her men to the temple and they found it buried by the alter just as she said.  No one else knew it was there before.  I was so upset after watching this movie, because it didn't show the true Joan of Arc.  I would recomend reading Joan of Arc by Mark Twain to find the real Joan of Arc.
