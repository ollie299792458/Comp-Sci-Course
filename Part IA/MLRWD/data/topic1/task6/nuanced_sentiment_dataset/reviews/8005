Others have reviewed this film accurately stating a lot which was well said.

Vaguely inspired by Wilde -some quotations feel contrived indeed- this is a good film as long as you disregard its main theme, that of everybody's being imperfect and that real love and maturity are achieved by accepting one's partner and oneself for what they really are, flaws and all.

In fact, when dealing with the matter, the rhythm skips some beats, acting become less convincing and the script even more so.

Much is to be enjoyed instead: the accurate rendition of a specific time, with fabulous costumes and settings, the good acting and the continuos, spotless bantering of the different characters that, when forgetting about Wilde, sounds sharp and cutting and convincing on the actor's mouths.
Poor Everett has to deal with more Wildean lines than everyone else and that he can survive them tells us volumes about how good an actor he is.

Do not misunderstand me, I love Wilde and I am sure each of these actors would be perfectly capable of doing one of his plays: unfortunately this is not one of his plays and the script, elsewhere sparkling, suddenly loses gloss when Wilde is being imitated. Or when the attempt is made at conveying the deep theme mentioned above.

Therefore enjoy this choral comedy, for whatever good it has to offer but forget Wilde and be merciful on the more profound moments.
