The "Green Mile" was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It had such warmth and compassion. The first thing I had heard about it was from my father and he said 2 words "excellent movie". Coming from  my father that is a rave. This is someone who said he liked  "Titanic" but it "wasn't what it was made out to be."  and I loved it.  I finally saw the "Green Mile" and was rivited  the entire 3 hours. I didn't realize how long I had been there until I was  coming out and realized it was 6 o'clock and we had entered the movie at 3  o'clock. I am a HUGE Tom Hanks fan and he did a FABULOUS job and Micheal  Clark Duncan did an absolutely amazing job as John Coffey. I can't say  enough good about this movie. The best I can advise is that everyone should  buy this movie as soon as possible. It is a definte DO NOT MISS. I think  anyone who thinks Shawshank outshined the "Green Mile" doesn't  understand. Shawshank was a great movie, but the "Green Mile" was  absolutely the best I have seen in a LONG time. SEE IT, SEE IT, SEE IT.
