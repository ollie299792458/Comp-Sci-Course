...Most of the time, the type of comedies we get are teen comedies that pretty much only focus on sexual topics. Not my cup of tea. It's just not funny.
But here, we have a brilliantly funny comedy about a black man mentally stuck in the 70s who's out their protecting racial equality. We also have "The Brotherhood," a secret organization doing the same thing, consisting of mostly blacks. But they stress the message that you just have to be "down" to be in the brotherhood, and you don't have to be black. At first, it seems like only blacks are welcome. But then they realize that working as an equal team is how the job should really be done, regardless of one's race. So this movie has a good message, despite all the racial jokes.
But enough of that. This movie is hilarious! The jokes they make about both black culture and white culture kept me laughing all the way through. You can't take it too seriously. If you do, getting offended will come with the territory for you, and that's not what this movie is about. What goes through my head when the jokes are cracked is, "That's exactly how it is!" And I'm a white guy.
Sure, a lot of the jokes are ones that have been used before. But the WAY they're used in this movie and the creativity behind it all is what made me laugh.
So if you don't get offended easily by culture jokes, and you're in the mood to laugh a lot, this movie is for you.
The DVD has good picture and sound for the movie. It even has 5.1 DTS. This DVD also has a good amount of special features that'll keep you occupied as well, including deleted scenes, outtakes, an alternate ending, a behind the scenes look at the movie, a few original cartoons of Undercover Brother that the movie was based on, etc. - most of which kept me entertained.
Great movie, great DVD!
