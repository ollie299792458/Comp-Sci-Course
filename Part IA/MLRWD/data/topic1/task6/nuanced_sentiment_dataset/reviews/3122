Since doing Pure Burn Super Strength- also from Bob- I thought I was in for a super cardio workout. Wrong. 20 min in and I'm thinking, "In the preview the fitness models were almost crying, so I know it's coming." I had barely broke out into a sweat. 40 min in and I'm thinking: This workout is a bit boring. I love Bob; and his workout style but I was expecting more cardio. Yes, more jumping (there's some), more kicking (hardly any), more running, more sweat. This is just a low key strength workout. No where near as hard as his real strength workout though, so if I want a weight workout, I turn to that DVD. For this workout, there's too many dumbbell swings (standing in one place- how does that count for cardio?)and just too much standing around. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think a cardio workout should be a lot of cardio. I expected my HR to be in the 140-150 zone. It barely made it out of the 110's. The real winner in his workout series is the strength workout. I can't see wasting another workout on this one.
