Like J.D. Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye, The Graduate is an offbeat, tenderly funny and ultimately poignant tale of alienation and youthful angst. It's a coming-of-age story that manages to avoid the pitfalls and platitudes that tend to plague the genre, and winds up saying something truly original about growing up in the modern world, about coming to terms with our futures and confusions, about understanding the people around us, about finding our way and falling in love. It does so with a quiet sense of humor, a perennially wistful tone, and a really cool Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack.

The people behind the film are wonderful- Dustan Hoffman plays the role of Ben Braddock (the film's protagonist and titular character) with just the right mix of starry-eyed introspection and sly wit, earning our sympathies before the opening credits are over and keeping us on his side through the cathartic finale. Anne Bancroft takes on the role of the nigh-on-legendary Mrs. Robinson with smoldering sexuality and a sharp sociopathic edge. The script is a mixture of stinging satire and tender, clich&eacute;-free romance, with plenty of memorable lines and iconic images.

The result is a classic movie, and one that every human being with a pulse should see (preferably before they turn 25).
