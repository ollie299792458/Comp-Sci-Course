It can be agreed that 'Raising Helen' is not 'Schindler's List', but it's a fun movie and resonates well with any woman who has sisters and anyone who has had to care for someone else's children.  I think my favorite line in the movie is the line delivered by Jenny (Joan Cusack) in response to Audrey (Hayden Panettiere) when she and Helen find Audry in a hotel room with her boyfriend.  Audry declares, "YOu just ruined my life!", and Jenny replies, "Well, we'll fix it later.  Get in the car."

The writers could have done a bit more research regarding the character of Rev. Dan Parker.  If nothing else, whoever heard of a Lutheran anything named "St. Barbara's"?  For that matter, IS there a St. Barbara?  One gets the sense that the screenwriters wanted a priest, but couldn't use one because priests can't marry, so they assumed that the Lutheran faith is 'Catholic Lite' -- same basic idea but with marriable priests.  While most people might not really notice, I did and it made the movie somewhat laughable.  Not *amusing*.  Laughable.  In a sad, 'Surely if you're going to write a Lutheran into your story and make his religion relevant to the plot, you'd do a LITTLE research first" sort of way.

Oh, and Lutheran preachers are pastors, not priests.  Sheesh.

But that aside (and I concede that that is minor), it's a fun movie and worth renting from the dollar rack.
