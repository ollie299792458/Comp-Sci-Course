When it comes to having a volcano erupt in the middle of a city, it can't get any more un-real than that.  With that being said, once you manage to suspend your disbelief it's actually a pretty fun movie to watch.

The acting is definetly over the top, even Mr. Lee Jones himself manages to over-do his character.  You learn very quickly while watching this movie that the characters are not worth caring about!  They make very stupid decisions that show they have no common sense whatsoever, and its hilarious watching it happen.

The plot itself is very basic and follows the sterotypical Hollywood "survive a natural disaster" storyline.  Complete with the lead character who is usually a male coming to the aid of the city (Jones) his sidekick which is generally a female (Heche) and the annoying son/daughter of the main character.  All is done perfectly cliche' which makes this movie (in my opinion) a fun and adventurous comedy.

I recommend this movie for some good laughs and a fun time pointing out the sad mistakes Hollywood makes when it comes to these type of movies.
