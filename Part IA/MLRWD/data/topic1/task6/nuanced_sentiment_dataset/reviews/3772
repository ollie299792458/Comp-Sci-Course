This title was one of the finest books I have read about the present food culture in the U.S. I was so much looking forward to being able to watch this in a video presentation along the lines of Super-Size Me, and being able to show this in my HS Nutrition class that I teach. What an embarrassing, huge disappointment!
Not only was this video a mutation of a very well written and researched book, but its whole approach was rather clueless and pointless. If you read the book, you may have scratched a little bit of meaning out of the film, but to an unfamiliar viewer, was this about illegal aliens, fast food chains, teenage workers, meat-packing and ranching industries, or some fast talking Hollywood cameos? The scenes were so piecemeal and disjointed, it almost makes you want to eat a "Biggie" because I was getting sick watching this mess anyway!
The crude pointless sex scenes and inappropriate vulgar language makes this a definite off-limits to young adult viewers, especially in a school setting. Guess what producers....this is what your target audience shoud have been! I am just so glad I rented it from Blockbuster before I purchased this piece of junk!!!!!
