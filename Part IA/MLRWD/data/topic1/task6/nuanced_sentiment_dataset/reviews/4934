THE LIFE OF BRIAN has remained one of my favorite Python flicks after the glow of the Holy Grail began to wear thin from overuse. If you're considering purchasing this movie, you've probably seen the movie already  and are a Monty Python fan. If not, get ready for one of Python's most  sacrilegious and hilarious movies of their collection! If you are easily  offended, you might think twice. However, the satire here is equally  distributed and is not aimed so much at religion itself but moreso at the  amusing ways in which people can behave "under the influence" of  zealotry.
I thoroughly enjoyed rewatching the movie, but it was a great  surprise to find that this DVD comes packed with some great bonus  materials. Several full-length, revealing interviews with the cast go into  more Python history than just that surrounding this flick. And a rather  large collection of scenes cut from the final release are also quite  interesting.
The video and audio quality seem to be on par with most of  the other DVD movies I've seen so far, despite the film's age.
All in  all, a great addition to any Python collection.
