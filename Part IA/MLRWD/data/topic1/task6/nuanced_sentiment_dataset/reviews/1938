Another film released nationwide in theaters in 3D, designed and rendered with the full intention that most would see this movie in 3D and now it is arriving for all to enjoy in their home. Oh wait, no not all. Who do you think you are? Some can enjoy the movie in 3D, those who decided to go out to buy a new Samsung 3D TV. What if you don't want to buy a Samsung, what if you like Sony or Toshiba, well, then you are out of luck my friend. This is another exclusive deal, again limiting the amount of content available to all consumers. By limiting this amount, you are getting less and less people interested in buying a 3D TV. The only reason I see in doing this is to sabotage their own product, create a black market item (Shrek goes for $150, Avatar is being sold on Amazon through an outside reseller at $300), and push people into piracy. Way to go guys! If the content is available but you make it too expensive or to hard to get, they will turn to piracy (think of the music industry). That is why I am boycotting all the titles that were available first in exclusive deals. I will never buy Avatar, Shrek, How to Train Your Dragon, and so on either DVD, Blu-Ray, or 3D Blu-Ray. The people behind these movies talked about how great 3D is, (James Cameron & Jeffrey Katzenberg) that people should enjoy the movie in this type of presentation and yet, they made backhanded deals in the end, so very few people may enjoy them. If we get enough of us together maybe we can save 3D!!
