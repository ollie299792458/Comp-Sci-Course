I see that a deluxe five DVD set of Barbra Streisand's TV specials has been released recently... So why doesn't Warner/Reprise do the same thing for Frank Sinatra's classic TV specials? Could "The Family" be involved perhaps...? Sure, they can get behind a phony "Sinatra at the Palladium" multi-media extravaganza where you watch 20-foot projected videos of Sinatra singing accompanied by a live orchestra thanks to "unprecedented access to Frank Sinatra's film archives"... but they can't seem to get Sinatra's video performance legacy released appropriately on DVD...

The classic 1960s, 70s, and 80s musical TV specials (A Man and His Music Part I & II, Sinatra+Ella+Jobim, The Main Event, etc...) are still being sold as individual DVDs at full price ($15-$20 each). They are each about 50 minutes long with "stereo" sound (actually "2-channel mono" I think) with no bonus features whatsoever, packaged in flimsy plastic and cardboard cases.

Why don't they compile all 9 of the Reprise Collection Sinatra TV specials in a 3-DVD package with 3 specials per DVD? Price it at about $40-$50, include some bonus goodies (there must be hours of stuff in the vaults... better go with 4 DVDs!) and give this material the deluxe, classy treatment it deserves.

Surely this would sell well enough to justify the minimal investment required (just repackaging/remastering the same old material for the most part). Wouldn't a DVD set like this be a better 90th birthday "limited edition" release than reissuing the sub-standard Duets CDs again? And what about all the amazing unreleased audio that remains stagnating in the vaults...? Get with the program, folks!

I am truly very happy for all you Babs fans though! You're "the luckiest people in the world..."
