The commentaries on this film are an absolute MUST for aspiring filmmakers.  There are two separate commentary tracks, one by Corman and Sayles, one by Gayle Anne Hurd.  They are fascinating lessons in the art,not to mention the joys, of moviemaking.  The "can-do" spirit, the creativity, the desire for artistic excellence on a budget, and yes even the fun of making the movies will inspire anybody who ever thought of pointing a camera.  Corman and Sayles offer a lot of things to consider for all the people ramping up their digital cameras, and some useful tips for any era (flashing lights can make a crappy set look much better - as any fan of the original Star Trek knows)

The commentary is really a "warts and all" kind of thing in some respects.  Hurd's comments include an incident in which a tech guy is accidentally cut and severs his femoral artery and has to be rushed (in Hurd's car!) to the hospital.  On the other hand, Hurd talks about how she and James Cameron were painting a set at 3:00 a.m. and reflecting on how well they worked together and vowed to keep making movies together - a partnership which eventually led to Terminator 2.

The lessons to be learned by aspiring filmmakers on these commentaries are definitely worth the price of the DVD.  And it's not a bad little movie either.
