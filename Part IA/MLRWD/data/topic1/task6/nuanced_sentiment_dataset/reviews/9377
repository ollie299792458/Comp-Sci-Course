Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Bill Nighy, and even Toby Kebbel are all wonderful actors. I dont think many will disagree with that statement. Sam Worthington is just about useless as an actor....unfortunately i may be alone in that thought. Not that Sam specifically is to blame for this putrid puddle of bile. For those unfamiliar with the story....go to google and look it up. For those who are, you have my sympathy for sitting through this garbage. Not a coherent or even interesting plot in the what seemed like forever that it took to conclude it. The writer needs to have his keyboard taken the hell away from him immediately, the director needs to be shot (in the leg...not condoning murder), and the entire class needs to be slapped and have their union cards suspended till they get to the nearest theater/acting class they can find.

Its like all the worst things about the fast and the furious were taken and molded into greek mythology. Please consider that before you waste precious and beautiful life on this crap.
