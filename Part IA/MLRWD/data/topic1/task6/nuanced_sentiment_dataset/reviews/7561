As other reviewers have noted, this movie has a hard time deciding whether it is a comedy or a drama.  It is billed and advertised as a comedy but it is not 100% a comedy.  Robin Williams plays a commedian/talk show host, Tom Dobbs, who decides to run for President on the urging of his fans.  The first part of the movie thus plays out as a comedy in which Dobbs makes fun of his political opponents.  Eventually, Dobbs is elected President.  At this point, the movie turns into a drama.  I would not mind, except that many aspects of the drama portion are an insult to the viewer's intelligence.

New electronic voting machines were used for the election, and it turns out there is a software glitch; the machines declare the winner based on the alphabetical order of repeated consanants in the candidate's name, so that the "BB" in Dobbs makes him a winner over other candidates with "GG", and "LL" in their names.  This is a really stupid software glitch; I would have preferred something more plausible.  Elenor, a woman in the company designing the electronic voting machines discovers the glitch and the company tries to discredit and silence her.  Eleanor manages to reach Tom Dobbs and eventually tells him, and he goes public with the news because he knows, in his heart, that he should not have been elected.  The length of time it takes Eleanor to tell Dobbs about the glitch is also annoying and insulting to viewers.

I think the film would have been better if we got to see Dobbs do all the things he said he would and assemble a non-partisan cabinet, and work toward representing the people who elected him rather than special interst groups.  Eleanor could have seen that Tom Dobbs as President would be good for America, fallen in love with him, and chosen to keep quiet about the glitch.  This would have made for an interesting romantic comedy.
