This time Max gets caught up in a power struggle between the two ruling parties of Bartertown, claimed by Tina Turner to be civilization rebuilt. On one hand we have MasterBlaster, a midget and creator of the methane gas power derived from pig feces and on the other we have Tina Turner, the figurehead of law and order. Master, considered to be vastly intelligent, speaks childlike English and rides on a big steel-helmeted man. Their relationship is, complicated, to say the least.

The first half of the movie revolves around Bartertown's Thunderdome and the nauseating repetition of the line, "Two men enter, one man leaves." Max must fight for his life in the Thunderdome to win his property back. The town is sometimes portrayed with a jazzy saxophone and trumpet score giving the leather clad dominatrix tribesmen a noir detective feel. This pairing of music and image is simply nonsensical.

The second half of the movie is a post-apocalyptic rendition of Peter Pan's lost boys. The children want to be swept away to (no joking) "Tomorrow Tomorrow Land" and they think Max is a Messiah come to take them there. Not only that but the climax is the only car chase of the film and it involves a fantastical train making a fanciful escape; the children, Mad Max and the reinvented Master, all aboard!

The movie's high points are Dean Semler's cinematography (his other work includes: "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783219857">Waterworld</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008PBZZ">Dances with Wolves</a>") and Tina Turner along with her great lines, "He's just a raggedy man!" Also, I was pleased with the diction and symbolism of the ending scene which did satisfyingly create a sense of finalizing the trilogy and the hero mystique of Mad Max. However, there is no great cinematic achievement here. As the film tries to 'modernize' by updating to the music and styles of the time (the 1980s) and substitutes violence, car chases and meaning for silliness and absurdity (perhaps to win a younger audience?), it loses the original quality of the previous two and unfortunately becomes a relic of its time instead of an enduring sci-fi classic.
