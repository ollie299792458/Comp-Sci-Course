There is a certain kind of movie in which the entire premise depends upon the characters not clearing up important miscommunications.  "While You Were Sleeping" was a classic example, and I hated that movie.  I've never had much love for Sandra Bullock, and I spent the last three-quarters of the movie (that is, most of it) sighing and grumbling "just TELL them!"  but then, hey, there wouldn't be much left to make a movie about.  Or there might be a more interesting movie about to be made.  Either way, I'm all for it.

Intimate Strangers starts out that way, with a woman making a wrong turn and mistaking a tax attorney for a sex therapist.  The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't try to sustain the miscommunicaton for very long.  After two visits, she figures it out.  The bad thing about this movie is that once she figures it out, the more interesting movie never really emerges.  I suppose we're supposed to wonder about their relationship, why she keeps coming back, what he's thinking, etc.  But it just looks to me like she's getting off by knowing he's fascinated, and he's too weak to do anything but be fascinated.  She's the naked woman in front of the open window, and he's the voyeur in the opposite apartment.  In fact, that literally happens in the movie, with a bit of variation.  Yawn.

Yes, eventually she leaves her husband, and maybe we're supposed to believe he helped her decide to do so.  But isn't her husband working harder and harder to make her leave?  And yes, the movie ends by him finding her.  Am I supposed to be happy for them, the exhibitionist and the voyeur, together at last?  Yuck.

The French and Pedro Almodovar seem to like making movies about weird sex and sexual relationships.  I don't find them fascinating; I find them mostly boring and vaguely distasteful.  No more, thank you.
