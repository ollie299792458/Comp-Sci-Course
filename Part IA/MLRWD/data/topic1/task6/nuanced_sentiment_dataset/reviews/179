This is by far the biggest let down of the summer.  I was so looking forward to this movie being the huge Hulk fan that I am.  I love the television show as well as the comic.  The movie is totally different than the comic or the tv show.  First of all, Banners father was portrayed in the movie as experimenting on his son when he was young, basically saying that it was the senior Banners fault that his sons alter ego was the Hulk.  This is not in the comic or the tv show.  They basically took the character of the Hulk, disguarded almost everything that the viewer knows about him, and made up their own story on how the Hulk began.  They even had David Banner admit that he liked being the Hulk  in the movie.  Correct me if I am wrong, but isnt the whole point of the Hulk story that of Banner searching for a cure?  The CGI didnt even bother me, it was the way the director totally butchered the story of the Hulk. And the end of the movie was so far fetched, it was hard to understand what was going on.  There were so many holes in this movie, so many things that happened without explanation.  If you dont believe me check it out.  Just make sure you have two hours to waste!
