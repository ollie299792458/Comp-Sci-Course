Is Ellen page the most charming young actress around these days or what?  She has a fresh, intelligent, unpretentious appeal, and it makes sense that she would be attracted to the role of Bliss, a 17 year old girl trying to break out of the small town mold she feels trapped in, secretly opting for the roughhouse world of roller derby competitions, while her mother continues grooming her for a far more conventional future (word has it that Page backed out of being in Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell in order to star here).  Page has a good supporting cast backing her up, chief among them the also quite-charming Alia Shawkat as her best buddy, Pash; with Daniel Stern and Marcia Gay Harden both warm and sympathetic as her struggling-to-be-understanding parents.  Both parental figures came across as believable, flesh and blood people, which Hollywood often has a hard time accomplishing in youth-oriented comedies, sad to say.  The movie itself is definitely a bit on the predictable and moralistic side, but shows respect to all its characters, never descending into caricatures for easy, smug laughs, and sporting that very strong Girl Power vibe: so nice to see it come out in FAVOR of tough roller derby girls in the end, no apologies.
