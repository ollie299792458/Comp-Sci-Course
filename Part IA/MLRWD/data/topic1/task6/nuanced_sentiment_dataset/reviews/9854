I'm generally a fan of Verhoeven's films--SPETTERS, THE 4th MAN, and even the maligned STARSHIP TROOPERS which I felt was a hilarious & sarcastic view of the US Military.

I thought FLESH + BLOOD was going to a treat. Specially since it starred such great actors as Rutger Hauer, Brion James, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Susan Tyrell... What a letdown! Only Brion James played it real. (And Jennifer's last sex scene was brave and realistic)

I have no problem with graphic violence when it makes a point. But I hate it in a cartoon, and this film was a super-violent swashbuckling cartoon with the over-the top external performances one normally sees only in an amateur play.  No shadows, no air of mystery-- overlit like a TV soap opera.

The voices seemed dubbed in a studio--unnatural and disembodied, and not fitting into the ambiance of the scenes.

To top it off, the two lead actors' hair was straight out of the 1980's, and Rutger's "White Outfit" looked like it was stolen from Siegfried & Roy's closet. I kept wondering when the white tiger was going to show up.

Laughable plot twists, awful dialogue, anachronistic. Though most of the exteriors of the "castles" did seem authentic to the period, the interiors looked like Hollywood sets from cheap "Erroll Flynn" movies, and to make it worse, from the 17th century.

If you want to see a film which authentically portrays the extreme violence of that era, with brilliant performances and REAL locations, check out Roman Polanski's MACBETH. These actors are so comfortable with Shakespeare that it never sounds like a speech, but conversation.

Verhoeven showed total disrespect for the audience's intelligence on FLESH + BLOOD. AVOID AVOID AVOID.
