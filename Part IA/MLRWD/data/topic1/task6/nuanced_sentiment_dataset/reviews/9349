If this review was from my child, it would be a different story. But since she does not have a computer or typing skills...because she's 2...I get to write the review.  I think this DVD starts off very strong. We love the first 4 or 5 songs and sing them often. The guys seem to be having a good time. The songs are easy to learn both the words and the dance moves to (for the most part).  "Shimmy Shake", a Beatle's homage, is such a fun song we all get up and dance to it. My daughter loves "Dr. Knickerbocker" which I also find very catchy. There are some good versions of classic songs like "You make me feel like Dancing" (with a cameo by Leo Sayer) and "Day-O (Banana Boat song)".

Unfortunately, the DVD loses its great rhythm after that. There is a walz section that has no singing that few children will dance or sit through, and the guys sing La Bamba so fast no child (unless Spanish) could ever pick up the beat or try to learn any of the words.  Some of the non-singing skits are too long. We only watch the first few songs, then purposefully distract the child and turn it off because we, the parents, can't stand watching the rest of it.

Back to my daughter's perspective: She loves it! She really gets into dancing to the music and listening to the Wiggles fun accent.  So, my review is partially based on her opinion. I would give this a 2; she'd give it a 5. I tried to split the difference.

With these facts in mind, as a parent, I would ask myself what the point of buying this DVD is: If you want something you can enjoy with your child, this probably isn't the one for you, unless you are ok with gritting your teeth through 1/2 the DVD. If you want a DVD to keep your child busy while you get stuff done around the house, by all means, buy it.
