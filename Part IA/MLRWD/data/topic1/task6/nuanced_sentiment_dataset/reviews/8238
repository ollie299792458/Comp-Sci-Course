Really liked the movie, must agree that it's the best MI ever. One thing I liked is that the team is forced to improvise - a lot of things don't go quite according to plan, and the high-tech gadgets are failing right and left. Which brings me to the point of this review...

This was my first time using Amazon Prime. I have a Netflix account and occasionally rent a movie through my AppleTV.  With both of those services, I have never experienced any problems with the quality of HD streaming, unless they were directly related to issues on my home network. Yesterday, my internet connection was rock solid and at full speed (20mb down / 5mb up), and my local network was up and running smoothly. In spite of that, connection to the Amazon server dropped app. 5 mins. into the movie. This was fixed by restarting the Amazon application on the PS3; the movie continued where it had left off, and in HD quality. However, throughout the 2+hrs. of the film, I noticed that the picture appeared to be frequently and annoyingly stuttering, especially in rapid action scenes. My very nice 50" Bravia runs at 120hz, and I have thus far not experienced a stuttering picture from any other stream or local source.

So at this point, I'm not too sure about the quality of the Amazon streaming service. I'll probably rent a few more movies to see how it goes, and if the problems recur, I'll just stick with iTunes.
