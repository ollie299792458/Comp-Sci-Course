There was a funny line one of the characters said to the Richard Gere character that highlights the problem with this movie:  "How'd you get so rich if you're so stupid?"  For a "master of the universe" this guy (the Gere character) makes nothing but wrong decisions, so that undermines the movie.

As far as acting, Richard Gere is Richard Gere (hired for his looks, not his acting ability).  There were three exceptional performers:  the black kid Gere gets into trouble (played by Nate Park), Gere's lawyer (a superb Stuart Margolin), and Susan Sarandon (playing Gere's wife); the movie comes alive in the scenes they are in.  The movie would have been much better if Sarandon's character was given more screen time, and less to frivolous scenes such as "high-power" meetings where someone doesn't turn up.

Technically, there were some problems:  the director managed to make the world of the ultra rich look merely ordinary, not sumptuous, and the sound recording quality wasn't as crisp as it needed to be; it was a strain to understand the dialog in many of the scenes.

[Spoiler] Another important detail that is an example of the movie coming up short:  Graydon Carter (of all people) plays a hedge fund manager who ultimately buys out Gere's fund.  After he signs an agreement, he's informed there's an accounting gimmick to the tune of $400 million, but still decides to go ahead with the deal.  In business, due diligence is done before an agreement is signed, not after the fact.  And why he would swallow a $400 million loss on behalf of Gere's character wasn't dealt with.

A 51% movie -- just good enough to keep going, but not a total waste of time, thanks to some good performances.  Could have been much better, but the script would have needed work.
