These sets are everything all TV-shows-on-DVD should be. Great extras, uncut, restored picture and sound, bonus footage, etc. Paramount continues in that same fashion for the Fourth Season set, but for the first time, this one contains a few discouraging flaws and mistakes. Like everyone else, "The Fashion Show" has been transfered HORRIBLY. It's missing frames and everything moves "non-smoothly" like it's stop motion, but it only shows on parts of the episode. It just comes and goes.

I don't know anything about missing footage from the original versions of the I Love Lucy episodes from their first broadcasts, but from what I've read, a couple episodes in this set have some missing scenes, therefore are incomplete and are syndicated versions. Something I wouldn't notice, but others will and it's a shame because everything before season four was completely uncut. Some people really know their stuff, so I'll take their word for it.

As for the reviewer below, perhaps he can't see the problems in "The Fashion Show." And how can some DVDs contain missing footage and others don't, unless Paramount re-released a corrected set without announcing it. I'm still waiting to see someone else with a *perfect* set of season four.
