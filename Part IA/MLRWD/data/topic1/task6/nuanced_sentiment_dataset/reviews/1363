Okay, this movie had a message, particularly for young black men, namely get a job, stop hiding under mama and for God's sake stop running around with chickenhead's and losers who aren't about anything but living to see the next day.  I mean come on, there are lots of young black men who hide behind their mama's still live with their mama's and really don't know what they are going to do with their lives.  There's always work at the post office and the military will at least get you outta the house (join the Air Force, not the Navy or Marines if you know what's good for you!) So I don't buy into the idea of their not being any hope for urban black youth, life is hard but c'mon now! I thought the beginning of this movie was insightful but the rest of it seemed to go in all sorts of directions. Jody and nearly every black person in this movie is overly obsessed with sex and saying four-letter words. I think this movie beats Casino in the cussing category.  It seems like Jody spends too much time getting mad about Melvin and his mom and not doing something more practical like finding a decent job and moving out.  And his babies mamas, these women need to take classes on raising their self-esteen, seems like they don't particularly mind being nothing more than sex objects and of course cussing like sailors when their kids are around.  I mean I don't care how urban you are, and I grew up in an urban neighborhood and I am from a dysfunctional family but you know what, I moved out at twenty, I worked my way through college and I am on my own.  What's Jody's excuse? This movie teaches a lesson but it has to go over the river and through the woods to do it and by that time your mind is cluttered with all the bajillion sex scenes in the movie. Geez this movie could be shown for the soft-core porn on cable.  I mean I don't know any black people who act like the people in this movie and I grew up in a similar neighborhood.
