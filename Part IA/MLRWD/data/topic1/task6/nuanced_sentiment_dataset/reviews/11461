The Jupiter two set has at least doubled in size and they now have a below decks power reactor, an absolutely enourmous storage room filled with a multitude of boxes marked as food or supplies and big old closets have been added to their state rooms.

Dr. Smith is not as horridly evil, nor are their guest stars such wishy washy do gooders, as in season two; and malevolent screeching aliens take more of the center stage, which is certainly to my liking.  Their season three 'countdown' suprise cliff hanger beginnings seem better done to me than in the past and are a blast.

Major West seems to have finally gone out and purchased more of a personality somewhere, at long last.  At times he even seems to have that certain happy look about him that makes one wonder if he was perhaps out all night whoring the night before?  In real life, of course.

And best of all, for some reason the season three episodes I have watched so far (about half of them) seem like they were not as endlessly repeated in syndication as seasons one and two were.  So although I can never be sure, perhaps I haven't seen some of them before.
