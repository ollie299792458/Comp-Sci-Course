I agree 100% with the previous reviewer, Jay.  There is no excuse for cutting out some of the best footage in this documentary (the performance of "A Quick One" was the Who's chance to show up the Stones, and  they took full advantage of the opportunity).  I have a bit more to add to  the saga of the missing footage.
As with some of the other reviewers, I  also saw this film in a theater.  I didn't know much about The Who at the  time, so I didn't remember all the details of the film.  A few years later  (mid-eighties, I guess), I stumbled upon a Thorn-EMI video copy of the  film.  Of course it was great to watch, but I kept wondering "Didn't I  remember seeing Keith Richards introduce The Who at some point?"  Then, around 1989, The Who did a reunion tour and both VH1 and MTV showed  the full, unedited version of the film.  Boy, my video copy seemed pretty  lacking after that.  A few years later, the current BMG "Special  Edition" came out, promising all sorts of bonus songs.  I couldn't  wait to get it unwrapped and into the VCR.  Guess what - it was the same as  the Thorn-EMI version!  I was so disgusted, I packed it up and sent it to  BMG's home office.  Included was a letter asking why the video didn't  contain the full theatrical release or the songs listed on the box.  A few  weeks later, my video came back along with a letter claiming that this  release was taken from the most complete master copy available, and that if  I wasn't satisfied, I should take the video back to the place of purchase  for a refund.  How's that for arrogance?  What they should have said was  "This was the easiest master to find, copy, and sell to unsuspecting  Who fans.  They'll buy anything and be happy with it.  Heck, they'll  probably even recommend it to their friends!".  Maybe I did end up  keeping the tape, but I'll be darned if I'm going to recommend it.  
Don't settle for this video.  The DVD is scheduled to be released at the  beginning of 2001.  Wait for it.
