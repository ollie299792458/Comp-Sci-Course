I, unlike so many reviewers before me, am not a particular Alien/Predator franchise fan. I haven't even seen all the Aliens movies. That being said, I still think the monsters/creations rock. They are cool, mean, and iconic.

When watching this film, I guess you wouldn't expect to see award winning performances by a stellar cast. And indeed you don't. The acting, to put it bluntly, sucks. The plot is, as one would expect, quite thinly spread over the duration of the film, but again, doesn't matter. That's not why one wants to see this film. The characters, their relationships, and their stories do tend to be too loosely explained, which unfortunately bleeds in to the main story a bit. You are told nothing about anything.

Thus leaving the action. There's plenty of it. Loads of gore, violence, and bloodshed, and some of it in places you woudn't expect it, for instance a maternity ward in a hospital. This I do approve of. A mainstream (sort of) film that dares go kill pregnant women in a very graphic sort of way. The fighting between the predators and the aliens are definitely a notch better than in the first AVP, and a bit more frequent.

The action and the violence, effective as it may be, is, however, in my opinion not enough to redeem this film on its own. And sadly the action is the only redeeming factor there is. This film, the whole AVP idea in fact, is to me, a far cry from "Alien" and "Predator", two superior movies, and should, in the interest of art, probably not have been made. They have been, and now we're left with two lazy sunday afternoon films of which the second is somewhat better than the first. 2,5-3 stars.
