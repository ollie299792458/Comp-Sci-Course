The DVD box proclaims 'From the Author of The Hours' (Michael Cunningham) and so comparison is inevitable.  Like The Hours, Evening deals in lost dreams and thwarted hopes, unfulfilled loves and a kind of resigned endurance.  You can see what drew novelist Cunningham to this as his first screenplay, an adaptation of Susan Minot's novel, co-written with Ms. Minot.  A superb cast, however (including Meryl Streep for three or four scenes) can't make Evening as coherent and affecting as The Hours, Cunningham's novel adapted by David Hare.  Despite its rambling length - with much emotional repetition - the plot has major holes and fails to convince us that these people are any more than their own worst enemies.  As often happens when past and present are intercut, the past is lively and engaging, the present, which is mostly reflection on what went wrong, becomes rather tedious.  Precisely why heroine Anna and true love Harris miss each other is never quite clear.  What might have been a five hanky story ends up flat.
