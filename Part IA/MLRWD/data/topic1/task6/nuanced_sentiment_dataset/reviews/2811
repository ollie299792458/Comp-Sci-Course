Just didn't measure up to a 9 year old's recollection of this film. Still, it wasn't too bad. There is some good action, and while heston is loud and pretentious, it's an unusually subdued performance by his standards. Walter  Matthau plays a drunk that seems to pop into scenes inexplicably. Victoria  Principal is very cute as the sister who wears a T-Shirt of a daredevil  because she has large enough measurements. Marjoe Gortner plays Jody, the  oft-mistreated store clerk who wears giant blond afro hair that supposedly  fits under a "regulation" length wig when called to duty by the  reserves. of course, once in charge during the quake, Jody goes nuts,  shoots his enemies, and tries to rape Victoria Principal, who looked at him  once in the grocery store and obviously wanted it.The DVD is pretty short  on extras. Picture quality is alright and sound also, nothing spectacular.  Typical disaster script, with affairs and turmoil leading up to the big  shake, then lots of overwrought acting from the various lovers in the cast.  Some of the special effects really are well done.
