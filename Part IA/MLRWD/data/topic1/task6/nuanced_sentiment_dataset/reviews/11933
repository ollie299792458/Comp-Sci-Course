I first saw this movie in 1973 in Sierra Vista, Arizona from an invitation by  a boyfriend. We were both about 18 then. The movie theater had the latest in stero sound and the movie screen was huge. Let me say that "The Cowboys was one of best and heart warming movies I had ever seen but the DVD I am sorry to say does not do it justice. The New Mexico and Colorado vistas, the aerial shots on the opening credits just does not exhibit the exiting burst of emotion when this fantatsic movie was transferred to DVD. Also the movie was reduced in size which made the landscape and the action incomprehensible. This movie should only be seen in Blu Ray with stereo surround sound. I will buy the Blue Ray DVD and Blue Ray player.  I did like the interviews with Mark Rydell, Bruce Dern, A. Martinez , Roscoe Lee Brown and 2 other cowboys. The still photos were nice. I will only reccomend this movie in Blue Ray and stereo sound if you want the total emotional experience of "John Wayne and The Cowboys"
