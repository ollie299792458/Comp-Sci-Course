I just became aware of the MAGNIFICENT box set of Laural and Hardy films, that is available in England. I must admit that years ago, I purchased both of hallmarks LAURAL AND HARDY CRAPPPY releases, and was very glad to add them to my classic comedy collecction. I was eagerly awaiting more from them, but today while looking through all the titles on those 10 classic shorts, 4 shorts per disc, (talking), for [...] a pop, put out on that GREAT DVD-R way, by some dubious company called Hollywood`s Attic, and then investigating the availability of Laural and Hardys feature films, also on that GREAT system of DVD-R, buy some other equally dubious companies as Movies Unlimited, Nostalgia Home Video, Hollywood`s Attic(again), and Nostalgia Family Video, also selling for [...]a pop, thats if you want the luxury of chapter stops and maybe a menu too, WOW!! Then I read the reviews of other people, and what they had to say about the two hallmark releases, and I literally started to get sick to my stomach. All this time these GREAT WORKS are available overseas and not only that but presented in wonderful quality. AMERICANS deserve to have these TREASURES, and in wonderful quality. hallmark has really made me sick. Who ever is in charge of hallmark should FIRE that JERK who is in charge of their DVD department. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING WITH THE WORDS HALLMARK ON THEM AGAIN, I WILL NEVER WALK INTO A HALLMARK STORE AGAIN, I WILL NEVER WATCH ANY HALLMARK MADE FOR TV MOVIE AGAIN. AS FAR AS I`M CONCERNED THE WORD HALLMARK IS THE SAME AS CRAP!!!
