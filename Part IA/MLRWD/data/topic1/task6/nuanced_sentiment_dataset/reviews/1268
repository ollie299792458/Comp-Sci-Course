If you're looking for intelligence, a good plot, or a riveting adventure, you're probably in the wrong place. If you're looking for good clean escapist entertainment, you're in the right place. If you looking for eye candy, you're definitely in the right place. The soundtrack ain't bad either.
This movie has gotten some pretty bad reviews since it's theatrical debut. These reviews all made very valid points, if you don't have a clue what you're talking about.
What you have here is a movie that's based on a computer game that's based on....wells T&amp;A. Let's face it, the Tomb Raider fan base began as a bunch of lonely men with too much time on their hands.  It wasn't until later that the game caught on for it's actual value as a RPG, and well...that value is questionable.
I for one, went to see this expecting nothing more than a lot of great footage of Angelina Jolie doing some really cool stunts.  I was impressed with the spectacle I received. Overly impressed. So, I give it a 4 star rating for its great spectacle, but if you are looking for something more....that's the fifth star that just isn't there.
