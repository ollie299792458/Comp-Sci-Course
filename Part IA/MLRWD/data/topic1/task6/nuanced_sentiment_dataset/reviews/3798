The movie started out well.  The technology of the Obedience Disk makes Hulk smarter.  The writers give the fans insight into the Hulk's thoughts (i.e. his views of heroism, how his days of neverending conflict have affected his worldview).  The writers also reveal Caiera's backstory.

Unfortunately, after the Hulk vs. the Red King conflict resolves itself, the story simply ends.  There is no development of Caiera & Hulk's relationship.  There are no scenes of Hulk's life on Sakaar after the conflict.  A story as detailed and thorough as Planet Hulk deserves to be told in its entirety within the logistics of moviemaking.  The only way Marvel could make amends to Hulk and Planet Hulk fans for this partially-completed product is to make a World War Hulk animated film that is 2.5 hours long.  It has to contain the best Hulk vs. Iron Man battle Marvel has ever created.

While this movie has to be purchased in Blu-ray in order to fully appreciate the animation, I would recommend waiting until this movie is on sale before Hulk and Planet Hulk fans purchase it from Amazon.
