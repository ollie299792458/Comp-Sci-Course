What's ALFIE all about? If you were to ask the principle character he'd probably say freedom. Moving from one "it" (his term for girl - almost an abstraction) to another - no commitments or attachments and only an "honest" assessment that love is illusory or at best fleeting and therefore "the moment" is king. Alfie is caught in the crossfire of birth and death and refuses to confront either because he cannot understand the relationship of the past and future to his present. Alfie is the eternal mischievous boy who has charmed his way in and out of trouble (and women's underwear) his entire existence. An astute observer of the folly and frailty of human emotion, he is content to remain on the outside, unaware that there might be something of value superseding immediate gratification. As the film progresses, Alfie's charm is wearing thin and he starts experiencing the fallout from his years of shallow depravity. On those rare occasions when he chooses to confront the unfortunate but inevitable consequences of his behavior, he is disgusted and ashamed but ultimately unable to put these feelings of revulsion into a context and therefore continues his detached existence in ignorance. But he's no longer funny. In fact, by the films close, Alfie has become painfully sad. A flawed film in many ways (the ludicrous bar-room brawl comes to mind), ALFIE nevertheless succeeds primarily due to Michael Caine's performance. His ability to take the audience with him, as co-conspirators, in a lascivious game that is both intoxicating and shameful is remarkable. Unfortunately, while the emptiness of his character has had a sobering effect on us, Alfie has learned nothing of the experience and helplessly asks us, "What's it all about?"
