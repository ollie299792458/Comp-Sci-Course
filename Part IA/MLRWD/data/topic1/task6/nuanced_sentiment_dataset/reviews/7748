I liked Night of the Living Dead.  I Liked Day of the Dead and Dawn of the Dead.  I even liked Land of the Dead.

This movie fell face-first into the mud.

To be honest, the first-person camcorder style is officially overdone.  I'm tire of the same excuses being used in EVERY frickin' movie like this one as to why the guy with the camcorder can't put down the frickin' camera, even to go to the bathroom.  Blair Witch was good.  Cloverfield was Ok.  By the time I get to Diary of the Dead, it becomes old.

Too much introspection.  Too much philosophical crap, and virtually no plot.  There was nothing new added to the series by this offering.  I found myself fast-forwarding through portions of the movie.

Romero should have just stopped with Land of the Dead.

It wasn't a wretched piece of film, but when I find myself bored watching a horror flick, it tells me that the movie wasn't worth making in the first place.

The acting is good, the writing is just Ok, and as I said before: the camcorder perspective is just plain not worth seeing again.
