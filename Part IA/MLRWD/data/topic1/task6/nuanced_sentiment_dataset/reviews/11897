I love this movie and have since childhood. This review is not concerning the film, but the actual DVD that I received.

I did not realize that this would not play in my USA-purchased DVD player (Went back and looked; it does state this in the description, but wish it had been more prominent. Even still, I accept fault for overlooking it.) I WAS able to play it on my laptop, though, so the purchase is not a total loss.

One quirk: (In the English version) there are subtitles during the Jewish wedding scene, something I had never seen before and I actually enjoyed very much. Growing up, I never knew what they were saying. Much of it is clear from the tone/expressions but it was still kind of nice to see the actual words. Then.... the subtitles strangely continued halfway through the next scene and then stop again. It seems like a poor editing oversight. I can't say that it took away from the film itself, but might be a useful tip to future purchasers.

Even with these problems, I'm still glad that I have a copy of this fun little film.
