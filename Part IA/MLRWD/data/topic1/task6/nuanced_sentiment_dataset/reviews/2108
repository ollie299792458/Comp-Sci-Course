When I first found out that their would be a Jeepers Creepers 2 I was so excited. I loved the first one. I thought Jeepers Creepers 2 would be one of them rare horror sequels that would actually be entertaining. But I was as wrong as I could be. The saying in the previews go, "Every 23rd spring, for 23 days, it gets to eat. Welcome to day 23." Well actually, it begins at day 22. The beginning is a attention grabber as it starts out as The Creeper pretending to be a scarecrow. A boy notices The Creeper. The monster then swoops the boy up into the air, leaving a older brother and his dad heart-broken. Because of this, the dad wants revenge. Then it's day 23 were The Creeper discovers a bus full of high-schoolers and teachers. That's when it becomes a yawner. He does the same thing to most of his victims and that is: takes them and fly's them to his home. We very rarely see any deaths. What makes the movie more worse is that it is about 1 hour and 45 minutes too long! The first one was only an hour and a half but I wanted so much more than that because there was more blood and gore, more deaths, and most of all The Creeper was much more scary! In Jeepers Creepers 2 we hardly know any of the characters because they start dropping dead before we even know their names. The second one doesn't even follow the traditions that it did in the first one. Like the song that showed that The Creeper was coming near.You actually hate the characters so much that you want them to die. Another big problem about the movie is that they spend way too much time in the bus. Even though this one wasn't much of a success in theaters, something tells me there might be another Jeepers Creepers in the making...for better or for worse.
