Long story short, this DVD is not a true widescreen version.  In fact, it is far from it.  I have the fullscreen version of this movie, and was able to compare scenes.  Obviously, the fullscreen version I have is a cropped version of the original film.  It is clear that this "special widescreen edition" is a further cropped version of the fullscreen version.  Thus, they cut the sides off of the original film to make the full screen version, and then cut the top and bottom off of the fullscreen version to make it into this "widescreen" version.

Trust me, you don't want this DVD - it's like watching the film in a movie theatre when you are about 3 feet from the screen.  The top of everyone's head is constantly cut off, and the images are noticeably grainy due to being so heavily zoomed.  I suggest looking for an old version of the DVD (it has a different cover).  By the way, the old version actually has both fullscreen and the same kind of concocted "widescreen" on the same disc - so it's even a better deal if you want to watch the so-called "widescreen" version.
