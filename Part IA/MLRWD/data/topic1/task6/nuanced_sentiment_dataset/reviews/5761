I had the unfortunate experience of being forced to sit through "Jersey Girl" while en route from New York City to Boston via bus.

Despite being a huge fan of Kevin Smith, I had no desire to see this.  Not even his genius could make J.Lo and Ben Affleck palatable.

Basic premise: Affleck and his giant head play Ollie Trinke (yes, Ollie Trinke), a man obsessed with his career as a publicist.  He falls in love with Gertie, played by J.Lo, whose hair makes the movie even more annoying.  They get married, Gertie gets pregnant, and everything seems to be falling into place until complications during childbirth lead to Gertie's untimely death and J.Lo's thankful exit from the film early on.

Ollie, unable to deal with the loss of his wife and having to deal with a baby on his own, falls apart.  Because he is frantic and stressed, he loses his job.  He has to move out to Jersey with his father, played by George Carlin, who he assumes will raise his child.

Flash forward - Gertie, Ollie's daughter, is 7 years old and played by the unbearably adorable Raquel Castro.  Ollie has miraculously turned into a good and attentive father.  While renting a movie, Ollie meets Maya, played by Liv Tyler, who is a graduate student working in the video store.

Hijinks ensue.  There is a musical number.  There are botched forays into the sentimental.  There is unconvincing romance.

I have no idea why Maya was into Affleck's character.  Yes, Castro makes Affleck more appealing, but one dimensional Affleck plays the character either smugly or devoid of emotion.  Yet she is rabid.  Makes no sense.

Affleck's performance is inconsistent and unconvincing, except for the portion at the beginning where he is playing the arrogant and self-obsessed publicist.

Smith's oversimplified journey into the saccharine falls flat in the hands of Affleck.

The movie ends up being pure sap and mostly bland.
