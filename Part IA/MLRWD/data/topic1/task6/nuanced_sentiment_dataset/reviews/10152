This dvd release is great except for one thing. I hate double sided dvd's. I've figure that 6 one-sided disks would hold every episode. That's why I gave it only three stars. About the show itself, I don't like the episodes take place in Los Angeles. I like the episodes that take place in Washington D.C. better. I also wish Steve was on more and in the field, as well. On Phantom of the Roller Coaster They said the park was called Fun Universe, but on the roller coaster on the screen in IADC headquarters it clearly says Magic Mountain. I already knew it was taped at Magic Mountain, but I feel they should have taken steps to make sure we didn't see the name of the real park. Like maybe replacing the name or covering it up on the coaster cars before taping it. I doubt the riders would have minded if Magic Mountain wasn't printed on the coaster car. In Time Bomb, Cassandra said in 20 years Adam's grandfather was going to work for the IADC. Now Adam was from 2155 and 20 years after he arrived in the past would be 1998. Adam's granfather would have had to be at least 20 or so then so he was born in around 1978. 2155 minus 1978 is 177 years old. The show didn't say his grandfather was still alive, but the way I can figure this up is if his father was about 70 more or less when he was born and his grandfather was 70 more or less when his father was born. Doesn't sound logical to me unless they started living a lot longer and slower in the future. It would make more sense for it to have been his great great grandfather. I cannot understand why they took out the words to the theme song. During the 2nd season the opening words to the song were no lontger there, but the words were on the end credits. The third season had no words except on the menu. I wish they had kept the words in during the opening and end credits.
