I had no prior knowledge about this film before seeing it, other than I knew Shah Rukh Khan was in it. So, the impact of the film was probably more powerful than if I had been told things ahead of time. The part that REALLY blew me away was seeing Shah Rukh Khan without his shirt buttoned up. I wasn't expecting that. I can recognize and appreciate when a man is especially handsome. But, I'm the type of girl who has always been more impressed by the character of the man, not just his looks. I had seen MANY of Shah Rukh Khan's films before seeing this one. And I already completely loved him - because of who he is and how he is. He is very handsome to me with his shirt buttoned up. Seeing him with his shirt unbuttoned took me by complete surprise and took my breath away!!! Other things I like about this film...I love the story, the music and dancing, and it was especially fun to see the guest appearances of other famous actors. This film is at the top of my list of great Shah Rukh Khan films!!!
