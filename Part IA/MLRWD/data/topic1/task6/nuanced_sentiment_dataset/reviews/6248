You learn more than you ever wanted to know about crossword puzzles from this documentary. For instance, did you know that the Monday puzzles are easiest and progress in complexity to the Sunday puzzle? And did you know that crossword puzzles are symmetrical, such that the black squares viewed the right-side up look the same as they do upside-down?!

However, what was most inspiring to me was the tenacity of Will Shortz in pursuing his passion. It really reminded me of the George Bernard Shaw quote: "The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself." Shortz had discovered at an early age that he loved puzzles and proceeded to construct a major for himself in college dedicated to the study of them. I was just awestruck that someone at that young of an age would understand that he didn't need to abide by the confined choices in society. I think most people never arrive at that for their whole lives. It really made me think about the number of times in my life when I force-fit myself into a predetermined set of choices or in accordance with society's expectations of me.

Only drawback to this movie is its length. I think the point comes across in the first 60 minutes, and then it kind of plods along for the final 30 minutes. I do applaud the director for making the finale - a crossword puzzle championship that takes place on stage - highly suspenseful. Just as I applaud "The Social Network" for making computer programming suspenseful.
