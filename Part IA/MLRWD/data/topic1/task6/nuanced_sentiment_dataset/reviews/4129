I am not sure how to describe this movie.  No doubt, many Christians will enjoy this movie for the way "true love" and forgiveness is portrayed.  Indeed, the director highlights forgiveness as a core ingredient to the film, but is it?  Imagine, if you will, that your soul mate, your spouse, the mother/father of your child, suddenly disappears to leave you to raise your son.  Why?  According to the film, dad was too interested in his career - he missed the birth of his only child and at least one anniversary because of work.  Mom turns to alcohol and drugs and eventually leaves dad & son on their own.  Dad & son move to start a new life, dad meets a nice woman who cares about his son, but 10 years later, their paths meet again when mom suddenly appears at a church gathering.  Mom explains to dad that after she found God and cleaned up her act, she tried and tried to find them, but couldn't.  Hmmm...guess she's not too good with a computer.  Dad, no doubt an angel in disguise, wants to pick up where they left off.  It didn't appear he had too much anger, resentment, etc. after 1o years and says, ok, all is forgiven...let's be a family again.  The son takes mom back as mom without so much as a question as to where she has been and why.  So, dad dumps the girlfriend and dad, mom, son live happily ever after.Sorry, but I found it goofy and unrealistic.  The pastor in the movie has a grin you wish he would just put away.  Did you know, according to this pastor, Christians can't marry non-Christians, but if they're already married, it's OK?  But, it's OK to divorce.  Bottom line - I thought it was a sappy, idiotic movie, but hey, it's a religious film so it can't be all bad...can it?
