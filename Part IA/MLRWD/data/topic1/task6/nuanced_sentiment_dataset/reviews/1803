Nine Queens is a caper movie in the tradition of "The Sting" or "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels." Ricardo Darin plays a jaded con man who adopts a younger accomplice (Gaston Pauls) as a "fill in" for his missing partner.  The two go off on a short series of petty cons, which ultimately lead to an opportunity to sell a counterfeit set of stamps (the Nine Queens) to a potential buyer who notionally is leaving the country and will not have time to check the authenticity of the stamps.  Another leading character is the estranged sister (Graciela Tanenbaum) of the character played by Ricardo Darin who believes that Darin is cheating her and another younger brother out of their inheritance.  There are numerous other characters and even the bit players lend color to this movie.
Plot twists abound in this cleverly plotted comedy thriller.  To provide more detail on the plot will spoil all the fun.  Suffice it to say that you will have difficulty guessing the ending.  The dialog is crisp and genuinely funny and, in places, touching.  The art of Darin, who often plays sensitive guys in the Argentine versions of "chic flicks") is to keep you liking him even though his actions are so consistently rotten.  Pauls also plays a good character, who engages in the criminal life with arguably noble motives.  No one can claim that this movie is profound, but it is really entertaining and a great introduction to Argentine cinema.
