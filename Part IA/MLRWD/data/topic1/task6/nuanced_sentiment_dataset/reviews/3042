Please take note the horrible amount of stars I gave this "DVD". The movie itself deserves a ton of stars. I love this flick. I've gone through three copies thinking something was wrong with the disc. Come to find out, I think the problem is simply my DVD player. I've had this "TOSHIBA SD-3107" since December of 1997. Along with around three-hundred movies and I've never had a glitch until I purchased "The Emperor's New Groove". Every so often througout the flick, it skips and jumps around like crazy. All three of the discs did it. I tried it on my dad's player (TOSHIBA SD-2107) which his model is one down from mine, and it did the same there. Then I threw it in a Sony Playstation 2 and it played perfect all the way through. I'm guessing my machine is simply 'old' and cannot handle the complexity and newer technology that they put on these discs. I have a feeling I need to do an update on a new DVD player. I purchased the machine back when they first came out... I guess I'm going to keep this one until I can afford one of the DVD Recorders coming out soon. Despite those crazy problems the audio and video are perfect! And oh to note, I'm 29 years old. I get tired of reading peoples' reviews saying that this movie and other Disney flicks are for children. I'm a huge kid-at-heart. You could never be too old to view these type of films. And if you pay attention, there are a lot of adult orientated material in Disney toons. Even back in the day. So keep an open mind. Just because it's a cartoon, doesn't mean it's for children. Later...
