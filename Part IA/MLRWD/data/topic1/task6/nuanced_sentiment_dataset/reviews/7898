Fawlty Towers, among those who know about it, is generally considered one of the funniest television shows of all time.  Created by and starring John Cleese (of Monty Python fame), each of the twelve episodes is sheer genius in some way or another.  
The setup is simple: Cleese plays Basil Fawlty, the rather snide owner of a second-rate hotel.  Cleese surrounds himself with hilarious characters, including his overbearing (but far more competent) wife and the bumbling but good natured waiter Manuel ("You'll have to excuse him; he's from Barcelona.")  Each episode finds Fawlty involved in some scheme, which usually has something to do with abusing customers and hiding things from his wife.  The plots build in classic screwball fashion, as the situations get more and more absurd while Cleese digs himself deeper and deeper into a hole. The comedy ranges from incredible dialogue to some perfectly timed slapstick, and all of it's funny.
Though I'd seen all of the episodes before many times, the DVD set was a great buy.  It's packed with extras, including commentaries by the director of each episode and some really informative, in-depth interviews with John Cleese and other cast members.  In fact, while I got the discs just because I wanted copies of the episodes, I've had a ton of fun with the extras.  Add in fairly nice packaging (the art on each disc is hilarious) and some other cool things such as cleverly designed menus, and this is one of the better TV collections I've seen.  
Well worth your money if you've never seen the show but enjoy British comedy, or if you're an old fan and looking for a new way to appreciate this great series.
