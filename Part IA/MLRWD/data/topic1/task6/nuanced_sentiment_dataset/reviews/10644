The premise of this "thinking man's" tale is intriguing enough, with appropriate and fitting set designs and costuming, a semi-fleshed-out dystopian society (a dystopia being a utopia with hidden insidious elements), and an interesting trio of main characters.  Their motivations are established and followed through nicely, and the nature of their world aided in those motivations.

BUT... it wasn't until York and Auggeter enter the ice cave... the exact moment when they put on clothing to warm themselves - is the very moment the movie changes gears.  Motivations become skewed.  Plot points are made slapdash, forgettable, and at times annoying (the Peter Ustinov character in particular).  The conclusions take on a woefully predictable air and the extraordinary setting lowers itself to the mundane and cliched (the ages-old phrase "does not compute" is used as its climactic signative).  Only the leads' performances and Jerry Goldsmith's landmark score survive the whole ordeal as shining beacons.

4 stars for the first half of "Logan's Run", 1 for the second half = 2.5 stars.
