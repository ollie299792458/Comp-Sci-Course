I haven't seen Jude Law in any film except this one.  From my limited experience, and after having seen the 1966 Alfie, which was hilarious, this one stunk to high heaven.

In the remake with Jude Law, Jude Law smirks after every comment he makes which he thinks is funny (but is hardly clever, unless you're a total loser and you live an unadventurous lifestyle with no romantic prospects).  He seems to think his comments to the camera are shocking.

For someone who's got his s--- together, this movie is totally dull.  In the entire remake, Alfie makes a comment which he thinks makes him seem so indifferent, but then he ruins what might at least have been a b movie, by smirking at the camera for 8 seconds of nothing, as though letting you in on some devilishly adventurous and carefree life; his noticeable attempt to fashion of coy smile on his face only throws him out of character and makes me think he was a loser yesterday, a born loser at heart, who somehow got thrown into a scenario where he's sleeping with a lot of women now, and that he can't handle that.  Not of a man who is a born "b_stard magnet," who couldn't care less about the girls and has so much experience with women that he no longer finds it funny or very noteworthy.

Compared to my life, his life is slightly duller.  He just draws attention to his being such a "bad boy" (gasp), which obviously makes him a big loser.

I nearly killed myself after 10 minutes of watching this.

However, I give the 1966 version 5 stars, without reservation.
