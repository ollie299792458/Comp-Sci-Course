I've been into DBZ for a while, so I can be overly critical when it comes to new merch and rereleased videos. I've been buying the new DBZ seasons on DVD since the first ones became available. The picture quality is simply amazing, especially after viewing VHS versions. Funimation is digitally renewing the quality of the entire series, one season at a time, and they're doing an excellent job. Another notable feature is the 3 different audio options available, Japanese dialogue with Japanese music, English dialogue with Japanese music, and English dialogue with the US broadcast music. Earlier VHS tapes only let you watch with English dialogue and Japanese music. I like watching DBZ with the US broadcast music, which is available on these DVDs. Also another cool feature, marathon play. This play option plays the title theme once at the beginning, and from then on cuts the title theme, recap, and ending credits out from between episodes, shortening view time and ending the ever irritating task of skipping forward with the remote. All these features, along with a shiney box and informative insert, make the $30 paid for the season more than worth it. If you're a fan of DBZ these seasons are a must have.
