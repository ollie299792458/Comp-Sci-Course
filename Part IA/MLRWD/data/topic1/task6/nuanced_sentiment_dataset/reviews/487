I've got all three of these Crossroads festivals and 2010 is not the best of the bunch. Of course Eric is still top shelf, His performance with Steve Winwood on Voodoo Chile was terrific. The other stand outs where Susan Tedeschi's great voice and band. Jeff Beck's version of Nesen Dorma. Beck always is improving and is always doing something new. I know Derek Trucks is capable of far more than just sliding a piece of glass over the strings. There is way to much emphasis on Slide Guitar. I know it's a blues thing, but not every song. Enough already. David Hildago and his boys still light it up. The other great performance was Earl Klugh. Eric needs to allow more jazz players into the fold. Personally I think alot of these roots players are afraid of the musicanship of the jazz players. I missed McLaughlin. Mabey next year Eric, Larry Coryell or Mimi Fox huh? If it's a guitiar festival then lets see some other styles. Frankly there were alot of repeat type performances here. I love BB King with all my heart and he's getting on, but we've all heard The Thrill is gone. We've had enough of Killing Floor as well. To be honest, there are bunch of so called big stars featured here, which I'm amazed have a career at all. All in all it looked like a great event. We must keep the Blues alive and live music alive at any cost. Generally I got the feeling that they just showcased the usual performers because they felt that's what folks wanted. There was not the feeling or performances chosen that equalled that last two concerts. The last two I had I watched and still watched repeatedly but this one just doesn't give that feeling. Better luck next time. I hope the next festival, they might want to find some more innovative and newer talent. I also hope that the veteran players stop falling back on what they did and start thinking of new ideas. They should take note of Mr. Beck and Mr. Klugh. Mike Zinna Huntersville, NC.
