I know that they don't try to market these kinds of films to twenty year old males, and being just that I can't help but feel that these kinds of films are a little out of my realm, but I usually keep an open mind 'cause I occasionally like movies like this, so I decided to go against my gut on this one and give M-I-L a chance. Unfortunately, my gut was right and this film was exactly the kind of crap I'd expect from a team of producers and screenwriters who come up with a movie about a psycho in-law mother starring Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda. This setup is so formulaic and the gimmick so obvious: this movie was designed for guys a little older than me to pay big bucks at the theater after literally being dragged there from home by their girlfriends or wives, mainly wives. The film itself offers very little amusement. Maybe one or two slightly laughable moments but that's about. The producers are only worried about getting you to the theater, not what happens while you're there.

And just this style of romantic comedy feels completely worn out. There's the proverbial gay-guy friend, the serious and oh-so-heartfelt climax and tons of tongue-in-cheek one liners, but very little substance or overall acting quality or characters you could really give a rat's you know what about. Like I said, the film's a gimmick, designed to get nagging housewives out of the home, into the Expedition and to the theater with their hubbies.

And maybe my two decade old mind just doesn't have the stomach for these films. Maybe I don't have the experience necessary to really derive a real meaning out of this mumbo jumbo, but that's really out of my control. I at least have the ability to recognize my own flaws, something this movie obviously didn't have. Anyway, I recommend you go rent Fever Pitch instead, that movie has eons and eons of amusement and character likeabilty over Monster-In-Law.
