This movie is what a zombie movie should be! I havent seen the old dawn of the dead so i can't compare it to the old one (but i doubt the old one is better than this) There are some acting problems that some people may not like, but i didnt mind most of it. the special effects were excellent, not as good as lord of the rings though. The first part of the movie (about the first 5 or 6 minutes) was pretty boring. but when you get into the basic story line, it gets good. this movie isnt really scary unless you think about it, if it did happen. thats the scary part. the DVD's extras are good, not excellent like the movie but good. I havent seen the deleted stuff though. but i did see the breaking news and the Lost Tape. they werent directed very good, and its kinda fake. People say they didnt really like this because "it wasent as good as the origanal".....this is a new movie. yes it was based on the origanal, but thats why they made it into a new movie. So if you like zombie movies you will  LOVE this one.
