It could have been so much better.  Good special effects, a quite decent concept, good actors, good sets and backgrounds, in general a great feeling to the movie, but the plot suffered a little.  My main complaint was that of charater development, especialy regarding the 2 leads whom were supposed to have some sort of emotional attachment/connection.  The problem was that they never spent enough time, or dialog, together to develop the bonds that were needed by the end to explaine the things.  She was supposed to fall head-over heels for him, give up all she was raised to belive, etc, etc, etc, (don't want to ruin too much if you haven't seen it yet), yet I think she spent more screen time walking though doorways (entrances and exits) than she did with the other romantic lead.  Don't get me wrong, I like Kate Beckinsale in tight leather walking away from the camra as much as the next guy, and I look forward to timming things out when I get the DVD, its just with a little better editing and the addition of a scene or two this movie could have been one of the better ones, and deffinatly would have gottne another star.
