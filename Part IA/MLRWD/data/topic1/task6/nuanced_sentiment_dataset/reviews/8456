What a travesty! I'd just finished the book, about which I can't say enough-- colorful, clever, moving, unsentimental, funny, mysterious-- and called up the video store to see if they had it, ran right over to get it,  and watched it immediately. A word to anyone who's read it: DON'T see the  film. I almost pulled a muscle from repeatedly rolling my eyes! There were  so many bizarre liberties taken with characters and story (including  missing the entire POINT of Larry's experience of "God," i.e.  that it wasn't the Western concept of "God," contrary to the  saccharine way it was presented in the film) that Maugham must have wept  when he saw what Hollwood wrought. I read in the foreward (of the Penguin  ed.) that he himself had written a screenplay, at Cukor's invitation,  asking for NO FEE-- the studio gave him an Impressionist painting as a  gratuity (ironically,  you'd never know from the film that art, esp.  painting, had so much to do with the story), and yet they abandoned his  screenplay as well as Cukor-- how tragic! I'd give a lot to see that  screenplay. I found the acting, esp. of Power and Tierney, to be mannered  and not at all appealing; as is so sadly typical of US films of the period,  the costumes and makeup were comically anachronistic, and that's quite a  feat when the story takes place only a couple of decades prior to the film  being made! Dear people who love this film: do yourselves a favor and read  the book! It has none of the syrupy sentimentality depicted in the film;  Larry is a strange and elusive character; Isabel is much more interesting  for not being gorgeous UNTIL her later years... I could go on for pages,  but must swallow my vitriol and turn my energies to seeking out that lost  screenplay. I give it a couple of stars for the possibility of its severely  diluted message sending the occasional viewer to the book.
