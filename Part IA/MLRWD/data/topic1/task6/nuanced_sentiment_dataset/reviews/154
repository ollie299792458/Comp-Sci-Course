From all the talk from the critics, one would expect a lame, over-producted action flick. One who's style is beyond the story-line and acting. This, however, is not the case in THE SHADOW. One critic describes  THE SHADOW as "enjoyable, well-mounted, but ultimately  forgettable". This is a statement I can agree with. With time, nearly  every movie is forgotten, unless it's an outstanding gem, which is in my  opinion becoming a rarer find as we speak, as GONE WITH THE WIND and THE  WIZARD OF OZ. Most wonderful movies of today, and yesterday, for that  matter, are praised for years and then begin to be abandonded. THE SHADOW  was never "nationally acclaimed" as a mark in film-making  history. It was another movie out of the thousands that was acceptionally  great.
Alec Baldwin portrays the title character in this thriller who is  kind of like our Superman. In real life, he's just another person, but when  the bad guys show up, he uses his outstanding powers to conquer good over  evil. Penelope Ann Miller's character falls for him, as it is coming to be  in most movies. Tim Curry, in his small but rewarding part for his fans,  plays a crazed mad man creating the beryllium sphere used in the crazed  conquerer Kahn's atomic bomb.
This movie, all in all, is good to watch  for a while and when the mood is right, but don't expect it to be one  that's a blast to watch over, and over, and over, and over...
