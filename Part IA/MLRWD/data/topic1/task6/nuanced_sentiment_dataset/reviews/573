This film isn't a blockbuster. Hell, it isn't even a "good film" as far as really good films are concerned (this film really doesn't warrant me going into detail on what I consider a "good film" should be), but it is good old fashioned entertainment!

What do you get when you abduct little European and Asian girls and train them as stone cold killers? An exciting movie with a gripping storylines! All the makings of a quality production, right?

Unfortunately this film suffers from the same flaw many modern martial arts releases suffer from: the scenes which should be emotionally gripping come across as utterly silly. The formula of such films is simple: really bad dialogue, awful acting, absurd gruesome scenes or the combination of all of the above (like this film has). The further along this film became the more I was reminded that I was watching a foreign martial arts movie.

But I didn't give the rating I did because I didn't like it! Taking the film as a martial arts movie, I would go so far as to say this is certainly one entertaining film! The storyline is the true gem, if it sounds like you might like it - give it a rent - chances are you won't be buying it anytime soon but at least it'll entertain you.

The acting is what you would expect from a low budget foreign film and shouldn't be that much of a surprise. However it should be noted that the action is fast paced, the women are beautiful, and the men are utterly clueless!

3.5 - I wish I could give it a 4 but that would be misleading, I should note though that I very much liked the storyline and found it surprisingly memorable for such a low budget film (a film I would gladly watch time and again if it were on TV, but again I wouldn't spend my money on buying it).
