Well,where does one start on such a milestone in La Striesands

career?.A very good friend of mine put me onto this little gem

way back in 1995,I was on leave from work,and at a bit of loose

end when said friend tells me "I've got a lovely Babs film on VHS

that you'd just love",so I put it on and watched it over,and over

and over.Just LOVE this movie,whats not to love?,Babs looks

stunning,in a variety of Cecil Beaton designed Regency outfits

the English accent..just devine,and Babs had no prior coaching

on the accent at all,the musical score,sensational,and the flashback sequences,especially the "orphanage" sequence,(this is

a piece I've memorised,and even went so far as to tape this part

and play it in the car!),wow!.To think that On A Clear Day was a

flop just makes me wonder..why?.So now after having only VHS copies and a rather washed out LaserDisc,we now have On A Clear

Day FINALLY on DVD..can I say that when I found out it was coming

to DVD I almost wet my pants in anticipation.So On A Clear Day

is perfect escapism,lush to look at,colourful and with the ever

stunning Barbra Stiesand as Daisy Gamble slash Melinda Winifred

Wayne Tentrees (the 1840 English coquette),how can you go wrong?

See it......love it....BUY IT
