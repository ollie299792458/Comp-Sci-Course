Reviewers are right when they say this movie is boring. A bunch of characters walking very slowly around a haunted house, flashlights in their hands, yapping on to each other and occassionally someone dies.
There are many cliches in this film, here are some of them:
-Haunted house is shown at night, therefore dark and supposedly spooky.
-Every single death relies on lots of blood except for one, and the blood looks like red drinking punch you'd find at a teenage party.
-Not much emotion shown from the characters. When one of them dies they are happy to just gawk at the blood and even stand in it whilst they mumble on about whatever stupid trite conversation they're having next.
-Very bad acting all around. Falling into a tub of freezing water with dead bodies floating in it they may as well have fallen into a swimming pool with inner tubes floating there for all the fear they had on their face.
-Scary asylum women all have black hair and black mascara to give a gothic effect to show 'darkness' of their soul (anyone would be scary if they were going to kill you, you don't have to stereotype everything up)

A really lame effort. If you're looking for another version of 'The House On Haunted Hill' (original) then don't bother renting this one out.
If you liked the movie 'Ghost Ship' - you'll love this. It's pretty much exactly the same only without a ship.
