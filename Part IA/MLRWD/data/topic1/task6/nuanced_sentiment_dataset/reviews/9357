For those who expect to see a movie filled with historical facts and events this will be a waste of time. The title itself is strongly misrepresenting the movie. It's a Russian attempt at making a hollywood style blockbuster hit.  It's not a complete failure as the movie is full of nice special effects and great costumes. The story line revolves around the typical "powerful villain kidnapped a princess and the poor hero will save her" theme. It's a big budget anti-Polish propaganda full of myths, legends and unicorns in order to get attention of the younger audience in Russia. The winged Polish hussars are depicted as brutal rapists and murderers where according to most European historians they were the most noble cavalry which was undefeated for 125 years and for such time it defended Europe from Muslim (and other) invaders. For those who are not bothered by such historical misrepresenting and typical movie cliches along the story line I guess it's a watchable movie and may even be fun for a lazy Sunday afternoon.
