This movie had potential to be good.  The setting, time period and basic idea I think was with good intentions, and the acting in and of itself isn't bad.  It is set in the late 1800's in South America with a plot that portrays a Romeo and Juliet type of romance only without the suspense or captivating quality.  We are introduced to two characters who fall in love, but it is unclear how, why, and not portrayed well.  Sticking with the Romeo and Juliet theme we know that the 2 characters' romance is forbidden but again, it is unclear why.  The movie is set during a time in which a cholera epidemic is sweeping the area but it seems to have little relevance to the already weak storyline.  Then the majority of the movie consists of the man sleeping around with hundreds of women and the woman character in an unhappy marriage which results in a boring and un-engaging hour or so.  The movie should've wrapped up with a happy ending but it is again portrayed weakly and leaves the viewer going,  "That's it?"  Not that great of a movie unless you just want to watch it for the bare breasts.
