Orange County can be described as the movie that will set off a dozen more teen-movies with sharp witt, sarcastic humour and a lack of "troubled-with-sex-in any way" formula that has ruled teen movies since American Pie came out.
In 80's style, minus its standard absurdity, Colin Hanks starts his career in a better way than ol' da did. His skills as an actor can be seen in his subtle performance which comes out as realistic and funny with a lot of class.
Jack Black has not given us a great performance since "High Fidelity," but in this movie he's hysterically funny, still, the role did not provide for room to show off his skills.
The story is solid and steers away from slapstick-teen-comedy, and instead deals with the troubled situation a young man is put into when all his college plans are destroyed and his family is only a wacky burden. The only two things i did not like were the california-surf-dude-pals and the fact that Chevy Chase only apears for less than a minute. Other than that some great cameos make everything funnier, and the laughs keep on coming.
In this DVD you will also find 15 teasers, or interstitials, 10 of which are really funny, the only one they did not slip in was the "great writers" interstitial.
4 deleted scenes and commentary by director and writer make this dvd a better buy.
All in all this is a good movie, fun and enjoyable, even though its not a blockbuster. This will prove to be a future classic, and will probably launch the starring role players on to bigger things.
