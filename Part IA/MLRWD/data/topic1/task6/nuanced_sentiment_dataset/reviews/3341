Overall, this film is a disappointment when compared to Jurassic Park.  Everything just seems thrown together and out of order.  It's completely obvious that the scares are meant to, well, scare you, but they just lack perspective.  Anyways, on to the plot...

  Ian Malcolm( played by Jeff Goldblum) must go to Isla Sorna, site B to retrieve his girlfriend Sara,( played by Julianne Moore) who has only too willingly agreed to go on an expedition commissioned by the late John Hammond,( played by Richard Attenborough) who in an unfortunate turn of events, has lost his company InGen.  So, before the scientists can get too comfortable, BAM!  InGen's helicopters fill the air and military units mobilize to collect..something.  Anyways, between dodging spikey Stegosaurus tails, eluding the Velociraptors in a momentarily suspenseful scene in the tall, tall grass, and eventually the films's climax(?) with the Tyrannosaurus escaping from capture( surprisingly) and running around San Diego, it's clear the writers and producers had action and "good intentions" in mind, but sadly, it just didn't look as good on screen as it did on paper.

  I would recommend seeing this movie only to decide for yourself if it is disappointing.  Afterall, everyone is different, right?
