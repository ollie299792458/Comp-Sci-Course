I've been a 3D nut for many decades. I pre-ordered this from amazon and man, what a disappointment! The video quality is only a little better than the shutterglass 3D DVD bootleg from back in the 90's (and at least the 3D DVD was FULL SCREEN) which was made from a japanese 3D VHD disc. Even the "red/blue" 3D trailer for this movie (from the 3D Film Expo at the Egyptian Theatre here in Hollywood) was Full Screen. If you Google this title, you'll find a few websites with photo comparisons (PAL, NTSC, DVD, Blu-ray, etc...) and you can clearly see that this 3D Blu-ray crops the film from ALL FOUR SIDES. Only a little is cropped from the left/right, but quite a bit is missing from  the top & bottom to create this 1.85 ratio from Full Screen. Some of the 3D perception is lost due to this, and is probably what others here have meant by certain scenes looking "flat" or "2D". One of the most striking scenes is the one where Margot & Mark are talking in the livigroom. This wonderful shot is obviously setup for the 3D effect. Margot's hand is resting on the end table in the extreme foreground, showing off that beautiful diamond ring. Guess what? In this 3D Blu-ray release, her ENTIRE hand is completely cropped off! I kept noticing these cropped scenes throughout the movie...characters cropped at the waste, tops of lampshades cropped off, etc. Yes, it's great to see that red dress looking REALLY red, but unfortunately the colors are severely oversaturated. I think I'll be holding off on "House of Wax" or "Creature FTBL" until reviews come in from other guinea pigs out there LOL!
I'm sure others will agree the printed black ink on the Blu-ray disc itself looks horrid. I've seen better labels on bootleg DVDs! Any way, just my 2 cents.
