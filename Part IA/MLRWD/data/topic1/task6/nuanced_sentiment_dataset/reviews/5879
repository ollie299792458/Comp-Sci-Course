Before the Rolling Stones started doing rediculous stadium shows with huge horn sections and complex stages and 200-foot-tall inflatable dogs, they did shows like THIS.  The focus was on the music.  This film captures the band at the top of their game.  Jagger still had soul and hadn't yet become a parody of himself.  I've never been a Ronnie Wood fan, as I feel Mick Taylor shreds him on guitar.  But this show captures Ronnie working his *** off with Keith Richards to provide that quintessential dual-guitar attack the Stones have been famous for.  Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman are very good too.  But the show is, as it's always been, about Mick Jagger.  In 1978, he was still just a singer, and he sings every song here with heart, soul and charm.  The Stones clearly still had something to prove and their work ethic during this show is unbelievable, ferocious and unmatched.  If your bucks are limited, don't bother with 'Bridges to Babylon' or 'The Biggest Bang' or 'Four Flicks.'  Pick THIS disc up and watch the Stones at the height of their musical prowess.
