Film noir based on true events - just the names was changed for the movie.

Primary I don't like very much film noir's in documentary style - but this one was really better than I thought. With other words: it was really thrilling how the cops hunting "Roy" (Richard Basehart) and Scott Brady as Marty is very good looking and attractive. No its interesting to see the work of the police departement but also to see "Roy's" side.

Very interesting: in a very small role can be seen two former child actors: Rex Downing ...Young Hoodlum (uncredited) who's famous as young Heathcliff in "Wuthering Hights" (1939) and Tommy Kelly as "Young Hoodlum aka Redhead" (uncredited) who was Tom Sawyer in 1938 "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer". Tommy Kelly was also a boy in a band in "Gone with the wind".

So far very nice to see those actors in this movie.

Part of this movie was directed (uncredited) by Anthony Mann!!!
