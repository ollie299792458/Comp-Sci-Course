The film itself is well-made, though utterly predictable, thief-with-the-golden-heart stuff.  And of course, for those of us who either live in Boston, or are familiar with the area(s), it adds another element of enjoyment.

But for me, the best thing about this film is the memory I have with my wife, of being at Fenway Park, for the world(?) premier.  This was the scene (after fighting traffic into the city):
Outside the park, there's a huge line, with folks waiting to see the stars, and hoping to possibly get a "golden ticket" into the event; a massive screen erected in the famous ballpark, with the cityscape of Boston above and around it; free popcorn and drinks for everyone; lots of projection and sound equipment, paparazzi, and all sorts of artsy folks who probably know people, who know people, etc.; and everyone got a free black blanket with THE TOWN (in red) embroidered upon it (it's still in the trunk of my car).  Ben Affleck, along with a large number of the cast, as well as pal Matt Damon with his pregnant wifey, all showed up for the event. It was really fun, though we thought seriously about trying to scalp the tickets to the frothing fans outside. I'm sure we could've bagged several hundred dollars for them.  Thanks to my pal Christopher for giving us the tickets.
