My independent I chose to read was The Natural I felt it was a good book and its about this man name Roy who is a born winner with his whole dream going the right way he would like for it to be going. He is also fighting to win the toughest game of his and will do whatever it takes to stay on top and keep the love of his life by his side. The Natural is about a career baseball player Roy Hobbs from his first false start to his final failure. Roy is travelling with his manger Sam for a try out with the Chicago cubs. The other people that are with Roy on the rain includes Harriet Bird, and a beautiful woman who catches Roy's eye Max mercy who is a sports writer and this guy name Walt the leading hitter in the American League. Roy finds out Max Mercy had published an article about his sellout for the nights and Roy cry for his own failures.  Roy is an idol and the fans worshipped him and he is a man fighting for his life and much more. This book was very exciting and I enjoy reading it because I'm into sports and it's a book about baseball and if you are a person who is into sports and love at the same time this is the right book for you. This book The Natural is expressing how a man feels about baseball and his life all together and don't known how to handle loving the woman of his life and holding on and dealing with the baseball people and traveling all around and trying to stay on top and stay strong and knowing everything will turn out for the best.
