Jake Green (Jason Statham) is out after spending seven years in jail for a crime he didn't commit.  Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta) is the man who's secret he's kept.  The movies revolves around the concept of the game and the perfect con.  It uses chess as a clumsy metaphor for the interaction between "players" in the control of drug trade in a city.

I loved the preview and am huge fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0747262055">Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXS4">Snatch</a>.  Guy Richie and Matthew Vaughn made two great films: Guy directed and Vaughn produced.  Now when Vaughn did the amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IFQLG4">Layer Cake</a>, I thought maybe he was the real talent in that duo but then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZAE1I">Stardust</a>.  So I'm thinking there's some magic in their collaboration.  Magic that's clearly missing from Revolver.

A few good action sequences, good dialogue, and spotty but great moments in performance from the cast mix into a fair film.  However, it really was uneven and suffered many issues keeping with the central plot device.  Richie is an obvious fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003W8NM">Fight Club</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F214">The Usual Suspects</a>, as am I.  Both earlier films executed their twist with much more creditability and style.  The psychological aspects wear a bit thin by the end and the "expert" commentary during the credits make you think more than the entire film does.  I really think a script tweak, less cryptic pacing, and a redesign of the reveal and climax would make a much better film.
