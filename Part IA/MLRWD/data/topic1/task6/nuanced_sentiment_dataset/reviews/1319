Like all of you, I've been waiting forever and a day for this stuff to come out.  I got my second copy of it (because my first one wouldn't play) and it took a while, but I'm finally able to view.  I read some stuff in a review that during California Jam, the DVD would revert back to the menu and such.  My problems were that once the DVD loaded, I was not able to highlight any choices on the menu.  It would not turn BOLD RED as it should.  This happened on both of them.  I have a fairly high end DVD player, and really was looking forward to seeing and hearing this in the quality I'm accustomed to.  NONE of my other hundreds of music DVD have this problem.  I don't know what the deal is, but this needs to be addressed.  I ended up hooking my kid's PS2 to my system, buying 50 bucks worth of decent cable so I could try to make it as good as possible.  Still sounds a little ragged---I'm really disappointed with that.  I'm curious as to anyone else having this problem.  Other than the DVD itself being unplayable, the material is wonderful.  I strongly recommend purchase even for the casual ELP fan.  Sometimes the visual just does it to send you over the edge.
