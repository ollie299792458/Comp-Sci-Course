When I first heard about this film, I was both excited and apprehensive. While I was certain that Angelina Jolie was a great choice for protraying famed videogame character Lara Croft, I was worried that the game's look and feel would not be translated correctly onscreen.
Sadly after watching the movie I was proved right on both accounts. Angelina Jolie nails the part of Lara Croft perfectly, even down to her faux British accent, and is perfectly fit and just enough of a badass to make her believable.
That unfortunately is where the fun of this movie ends. Sure, there are the requisite beautiful locations, such as fabled Angkor Wat and Iceland, but what happens between beautifully-shot scenery is a bit of a mish-mash.
The plot is largely ignored for the sake of some good action sequences, most notably the bungee attack. There's something about an all-powerful triangle (triangle?!) that the secret society Illuminati wants, and Lara has to find it. Or what? Oh yeah, the bad guys will get it.
The DVD is perhaps worth a rental; it 's chock-full of extras, including deleted scenes, a U2 video, Alternate main title sequence, and various featurettes on special effects, stuntwork, and Angelina's intense physical training for the film. There's also an easter egg and some ok DVD-ROM material.
Unfortunately while Tomb Raider looks great and has a pretty good soundtrack and some nice action sequences, the whole film feels rushed and just simply pasted together. Let's hope that if there is to be a sequel that more time will be spent on storytelling and less on blowing stuff up.
