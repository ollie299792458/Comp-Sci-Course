Total Recall is one of the last 1980s movies that filled itself with the new special effects that were being developed quickly yet with gratuitous amounts of explosions and cheesy writing and acting. However, all of that is wrapped up in a much more interesting and unique premise. This is also one of the last Scwarzengger films were he wasn't being played up exclusively as the big tough guy with a funny accent (save for T2). So all in all, this certainly is a big dumb movie, but it's one of the best big dumb movies ever.

However, this Blu-Ray release here is downright weak. The point of Blu-Ray for movies is to be a giant disc that holds terrific audio/video quality and a massive amount of special features. All of which this release fails on. This is one of the early Blu-ray releases, where big movie companies seemed to just throw out all their movies they could find with little thought in order to get a buck from all the people looking to see their favorite movies in high-def.

-There is essentially no extras included. There's an annoying little advertisement for other Blu-ray releases from LionGate, and a condescendingly pointless 5 minute long documentary on Mars(the setting of the film).

-The video quality is particularly bad. It may be 1080p, but there is no clarity whatsoever, there's plenty of film grain everywhere which can be distracting on a large television. Colors and shades are muted to the point that background details are hard to tell what they are. All of this doesn't come close to ruining the movie being that it was never meant to look very good in the first place, but it's still annoying. That pointless sole extra is in 480p. The audio quality is pretty boring, while everything is clear enough there is essentially no excitement put into it.

-The packaging is simple yet decent. Surprisingly no advertisements thrown in the case. I found it amusing that the back of the case lists interactive menus as an extra. I do like the silver reflective look on the front and spine of the case that gives it that look shiny-rainbow look.

Overall, even though this is a great movie there's no reason to buy this release, even for the $10 or less price tags I've seen on some of these in stores. The newly released Total Recall (Mind-Bending Edition) [Blu-ray] has a superb transfer, and a good selection of extras (including a full commentary with Arnold and Verhoeven).
