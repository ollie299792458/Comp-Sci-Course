I remember seeing this movie a few years back when I was a teenager, I hadn't read much about the SAS or other elite forces around the world and was quite impressed by the story the movie had to tell.  A few years later I started to gain an interest in reading and came across Bravo Two Zero the book by Andy Mcnab, I soon followed that with Chris Ryan's 'The one that got away' and various other books written by ex SAS troopers.  
The resemblance the movie has with regard to the book is all superficial; there are obvious flaws in the movie (at one point it shows Chris Ryan walking down an Iraqi highway during daytime talking to himself).  
Its obvious that the film was made with a seriously low budget, it shows dramatically in the sound quality, the dubbing is awful and in some points the actors speak and the words don't come for several seconds, the relationship between sounds and events on screen are sometimes many seconds apart.  
But if you look past the movies short comings its still a representation of the tale of heroism and survival in extreme circumstances that gives Brits worldwide a warm feeling inside that while we have these boys on our side we'll always have something to be proud of.
I like this movie but I can only give it 2 Stars, it has to many faults to get anymore, but if your sentimental towards all things SAS, go for it.
