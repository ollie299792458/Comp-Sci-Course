Well, the movie is still great, but this DVD edition leaves much to be desired. For some unfathomable reason, this print is inferior to the one used for the original DVD release. The picture is somewhat darker, the colors are more intense, and the overall sharpness is softer.
 It's definitely a different print, because the english translations of the "klingon" dialogue appear within the picture frame rather than below it as it did on the original DVD release. It may have been done so that Nick Meyer could make his relatively insignificant alterations, but to me this begs the question of why the big drop in picture quality? Several other movies have been altered by the directors ( James Cameron's "The Abyss" and "Aliens", for example ) without suffering the ignominity of looking worse than they did before. In this age of digital magic, surely something could have been done to improve the look of this print.
As if that isn't odd enough, the image on the face of disc two is actually from the movie "Star Trek: Generations" and is printed upside-down. Hello...quality control, are you awake?
Still, it's nice to have the extras, and the director's changes to the film are definitely improvements ( if not Earth-shattering ). But I was hoping for a bit more. Frankly I felt that the extras for "Star Trek V" were more impressive, and I was hoping that since this was the last movie featuring the original cast, that a bit more depth to the extras, and more care with the final product would have been taken.
