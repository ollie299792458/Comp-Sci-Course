"Terms of Endearment" is about a middle-aged, well-to-do woman, who has lost her husband and raises her daughter by herself.

The middle-aged, well-to-do woman is played by Shirley MacLaine, who has recently lost her husband. Shirley Maclaine's character is called "Aurora" and her daughter, played by Debra Winger is named "Melaine."

The show begins by briefly focusing on "Melanie's" childhood, which includes the death of her father, and then proceeds to her young adult years. "Melanie" lives with her mother and decides to get married to a professor played by Jeff Daniels, whose character is named "Flap Horton."

The mother, "Aurora" is completely against "Melanie" getting married because she thinks she's making a mistake. It is either because she's too young, or "Aurora" doesn't think "Flap," an English professor is successful enough to care for her daughter.

Ultimately, she gets married and they have children and it focuses mainly on how the two mother-daughter relationship is affected by her getting married.

It's definitely a heart-warming and sad film. It's definitely a drama without humor.
