Many have already praised the film itself and that is one of the major problems with Amazon - people talk about the film and rarely offer insight to the buyers who are here concerning the DVD quality itself.

I noted that some made mention of a 2-sided version with an error.  These are most likely the earlier pressings that have the COLUMBIA CLASSICS banner.  The newer pressings from 2004 have the 3-1/2 star rating at the top and only the widescreen version on the disc.  In either case they are currently out of print due to poor sales.  I can cite one reason and that is the poor quality print transfer.  It is faded, washed out, grainy, and suffers from compression artifacting especially played on newer High Definition televisions that came out within the past couple years.  The print used may have looked great on a standard 300 line tube set but not on a 1080 HD flat screen one.  It missed Sony's re-mastering in High Definition and not quite sure why?  And I don't see a re-release on the near horizon as Sony's management are not too keen on older catalog titles.

One hint for bargain hunters - I picked up a brand new factory sealed copy at a local Big Lots for $3.  Get them while you can before the gougers make a profit from you because once they are gone, that is it - no more stock.  They were available during the week of April 12, 2009.
