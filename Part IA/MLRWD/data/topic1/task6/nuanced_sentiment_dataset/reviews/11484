The Enterprise crew travels back in time to... 1980s San Francisco. Not exactly the high point in American culture. The acting falls flat and the humor loses its novelty. I really liked this movie as a kid, but now it just seems silly and stuck with that 1980s vibe. It hasn't stood the test of time, in my opinion.

What do I mean by stuck in the 80s? Case in point: Kirk and Dr. Taylor go to a fancy Italian restaurant in San Francisco, at which their table is set with breadsticks, and Kirk orders a Michelob beer (as opposed to there being french bread, olive oil, and a fine wine). Is that an example of how tasteless "fancy" restaurants were in the '80s, or a case of bad '80s moviemaking? Or a joke? I don't know. Either way, I didn't appreciate the flourishes.

As a Trek fan though, you can't miss this one, and you'll just have to look over the movie's foibles. It certainly stands out from the other Trek movies with its attempted humor, especially after the darker and more cerebral Star Trek II and III movies.
