This is by far the BEST anime out there, and I've seen a lot. FLCL has one crazy storyline, awesome music and stunning animation. I'm an animator myself, and I know when to appreciate great animation. This story deftly blends CGI, 2D and even has a fake manga scene. FLCL is only 6 episodes long...but it's long enough. The music by The Pillows is definitely one of its highlights. The spunky rock `n' roll makes you want to bang your head and cheer!!

FLCL features some crazy characters and a plot line that is so out there that you're not sure you even understood what you just witnessed. But do not fear; that's its charm. Underneath the bizarre plot lies a coming of age story about finding ones self and learning life's hard lessons. The more you watch it the more you get from it. Most anime you watch once then you're done with it, not this one. A second viewing is recommended.

The DVD even features a nice director's commentary that helps explain some of the inside jokes and zaniness of the story. The dub is quite as good as the original japanese, and makes understanding some of the story a bit easier. I always watch both the sub and dub versions because you come away with something slightly different. This box set comes with a nice little booklet and I even got a great looking t-shirt after mailing in a postcard. This is a great buy, and worth adding to anyone's anime collection.

If you like anime that has giant robot's popping out of people's heads, a girl from outer space, people getting beaten with bass guitars, and Vespa bikes, then this is something you most definitely want to check out.
