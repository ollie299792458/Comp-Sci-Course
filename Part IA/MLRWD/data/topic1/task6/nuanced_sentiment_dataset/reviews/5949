Being a long time,  hard core CSN fan I read all the reviews before deciding to take a chance and purchase this dvd.  With all the negative comments I wasn't expecting much.  Turns out this concert deserves to be in any CSN fan's collection.

Granted,  the comments on Crosby's condition/lack of contribution are mostly right on,  he was certainly not playing with all his facilties.  But Stills and Nash carry the day.  Makes you wonder just how significant Crosby was to the group in the first place.

Any seasoned CSN concert goer learns that it is always a crap shoot when you go to a CSN concert.  I've seen them live 6 times.  Some nights they are on(and incredible),  other nights(not so good).  This night Stills and Nash were on.  Stills clearly shows why he is one of the best acoustic/singer performers around.  I've seen Nash get excited and animated in other concerts when he knew they were on that night.  Same with this concert.

So . . . if you are a fan,  buy it and play it loud.  Not many stinkers on this one.
