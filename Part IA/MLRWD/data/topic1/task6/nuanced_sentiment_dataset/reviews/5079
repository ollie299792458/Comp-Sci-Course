This film was terribly boring. I thought I would be watching a documentary which would address solutions to poverty in the third world. Instead, I was watching a film which basically presented a rant on how colonialism was responsible for destroying native cultures and societies back in the 1600's (which is widely acknowledged in history books) and how western nations are still responsible for the shape and state of poverty in third-world countries (I am not convinced from the film).

The film was very skewed in the way it presented information to make it points - mainly it seems to attribute capitalism and privatization as the cause of poverty in areas like Bolivia, Kenyva, and in other slums.

Skip. This film is much too biased. Towards the end, the movie starts to target neoliberalism - without giving me a good idea of what that is. I also felt the film was too overreaching in terms of trying to attribute third-world poverty to a few western countries, the World Bank, and the IMF.
