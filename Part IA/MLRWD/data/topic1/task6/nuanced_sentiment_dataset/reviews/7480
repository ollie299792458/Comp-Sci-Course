After the mess that was Moonraker, the 007 series had nowhere to go but up, but who knew it would get this high?  Although Roger Moore's Bond era is best known for witty remarks and lots of over-the-top gadgetry, this film proved that Moore could deliver an old-style espionage thriller, and in fact, one of the best Bonds of all time.  A British submarine code machine is somewhere at the bottom of the Albanian coast, and it's a race between 007 and Soviet-backed agents to find it.  The execution is near-perfect, hints of Bond's tougher days (such as the trip to Tracy's tombstone and Bond tossing his hat in Monepenny's office) let the viewer know that the REAL 007 is back, while traditional Moore elements like the Lotus and the drunk Italian man are blended perfectly.  Everybody, from Carole Bouquet to Julian Glover to the late Cassandra Harris (future Bond Pierce Brosnan's wife) to the terrific Topol pulls their own weight, and then some.  Although the rest of the 80s films sometimes make a Bond fan cringe, this one is a jewel.  It was definately worth it to suffer through Moonraker; this film was the payoff.
