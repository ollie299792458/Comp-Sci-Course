Since apparently the critics love this film I feel the need to explain that the acting in it is extremely stage-drama oriented, many have said that it was the greatest stage production of Othello ever.  However, it  really does not make it as a movie, the acting is as overblown as I've ever  seen, especially Olivier as Othello.  Sir Lawrence also heavily edits the  text to shape the focus of the play away from the villanious and  entertaining Iago and onto himself, a typical move by the most arrogant  actor of his time.  
As a treasured relic from the 1960s this film is  worth watching and owning if your interest lies there, but as a adaption of  Shakespeare's play this film is the worst one that I have ever seen  praised.  The makeup is interesting to say the least but didn't even fool  my professor's 5 year old daughter, who commented "Isn't that a white  man trying to look black?"  
Though there are no examples of pure  brilliance for me to recommend, I thought that both the 1952 Orson Welles  adaption and the 1995 version with Kenneth Branaugh are much better.
