While this film truly is fantastic, there are certain things bogging it down on this dvd release from Kino. The major problem is the colorization process, which, when the dvd is inserted into the dvd player, is the first option you are given. The color in this new color version looks better than the Ted Turner colorizations that bastardized so many films. The color process makes the film look chalky, and does not look like 'it was shot yesterday' as Ray Harryhausen says in his commentary (which is one of the highlights of the release).
The film itself, however, is fantastic. A great adventure story with a great pace, great characters, effects, and a wonderful score by Max Steiner. Merian C. Cooper was supposedly disappointed by this film, and I can't understand why.
At times, however, the film does seem a bit preachy, and there are moments that don't hold up well. But there are moments in this film to be cherished, such as the sacrifice scene towards the close of the film, where an exciting and eccentric dance routine (reminiscent of ancient Egyptian dance moves they broke out on the dance floor some 3,000 years ago) and an exciting climax. All in all a good film.
AND: thank God this comes with both the b&w version and the color version. WHEW!
