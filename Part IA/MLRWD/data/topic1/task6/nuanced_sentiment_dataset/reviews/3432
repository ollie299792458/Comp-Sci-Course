When I watch a movie that I enjoy, I'll watch it many times with months in between to allow it to breath. If I can find more depth and meaning each time, I consider it more than just a film, it becomes a teaching about life. Such is my finding for this exceptional movie. It offers up a wide variety of important, even vital, lessons of life portrayed to perfection by everyone involved. The writing, directing, acting, locations, depth of meaning are all most excellent! In today's world we often race by the more subtle and beautiful aspects of life. A movie such as this calls forth pause and consideration of what is being served up for our enlightenment as well as our enrichment. The Last Samurai is about the redemption of humanity as well as the individual- the awakening to a deeper level of life, honor, purpose, self sacrifice, and pure, love. While watching this film for perhaps the 7th time, I fully realized that it is a true masterpiece. I suggest to the viewer, that they treat this film as one would a rare and fine wine. The point is to take your time with this film, sipping it slowly and savoring every drop of it's wonderful bouquet of thoughts and emotions, and in the end become enriched by an understanding what films have the potential of delivering and sadly also, what they seldom do and that is a fuller appreciation of "life in every breath."
