This documentary shows two annoying old biddies (relatives of Jackie Onassis) in their vermin infested and falling apart 75 room mansion on Long Island.  Ok, so they're insane, they're related to Jackie O and their once beautiful place is trashed.

We are never given any real biographies of the two women, other than hints of singing and/or stage work here and there.  It was distracting trying to figure out why anyone would even care about these two. Nor are we given any real history of the mansion.

Without the history, there's nothing interesting about these lunatics other than the Jackie O connection.  I'd rather have seen a documentary on the racoons in the attic.

This film is essentially a train wreck for intellectuals looking for camp that's not as mainstream as, say, Beavis and Butthead.

Personally, I'd take Beavis any day.

If nothing else, this film will make you want to clean your house, which is pathetic if you're the filmmaker.
