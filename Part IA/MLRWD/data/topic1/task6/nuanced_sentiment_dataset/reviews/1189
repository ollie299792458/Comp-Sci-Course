This is the first film of the director's where he completely misses his mar: Think "Abbot and Costello Meet Fairy Tale Theatre."  Their mischaracterization of the Grimm Brothers is inexcusable. The real Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were born in Hanau, Germany, studied law at the University of Marburg, became amateur folklore collectors, were in short, the exact OPPOSITE of the con-men characters who bear their names in this otherwise incredibly entertaining fantasy. Why the writer or director felt such fictionalization was neccesary is beyond me. Other reviewers who talk about the historical accuracies of this film leave me completely baffled, other than recognizing that Germany was under Napoleonic occupation at this point in that country's history, this film fails in most other points of historical accuracy. Marvelously magickal special effects and wonderful attention to detail on the actual "fairy tales" themselves leave me to wonder how they could have blundered so badly in the portrayals of the title characters.
