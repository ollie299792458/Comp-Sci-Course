Right out of the gate you will notice the goofy camera work. You are not supposed to notice the camera work in a movie, its just supposed to flow. This had to be this camera crews first movie. Weird angles, obnoxious close ups, fuzzy lens filters (by the way, don't pay for the HD version, its blurry anyways due to camera effects) jerky camera movements and zooms.

Second, I noticed the language. I know its rated R and expected it to be an R rated movie, but they forced the "f" word into sentences it wouldn't naturally be in or even make sense in and got old very fast. I think producers do this as a way to make sure the movie is rated R and not pg-13 b/c R sells better. Fine, but they did a horrible job of it and was just embarrassing to listen to.

Third, the plot is basically a rehash of every other heist movie. I don't expect every movie to be original when Hollywood cranks out so many movies a year, most movies are plain remakes anyways, but this is a total ripoff. If you think you want to watch this movie, simply watch "Gone in 60 Seconds" (even has one of the same actors) and "Italian Job" back to back, add some goofy plot twist and then you have "Contraband" This movie does not have the quality of either of those but rather just the ripped off plot. It also takes two thirds of the movie for any of the action to start even start.

The only reason i gave it two stars instead of one was because of a twist a short time before the end which saved the movie. It made my feel better about wasting the money, however, still a waste. I'll be honest though, I almost didn't make it that far. The beginning of the movie sucked so bad that I almost shut it off regardless of the money I spent just to play Call of Duty, which by the way HAS A BETTER PLOT THAN THIS MOVIE.
