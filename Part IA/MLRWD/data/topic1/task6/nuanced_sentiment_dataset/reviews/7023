The acting is excellent and the premise is good, but this is something that I can only recommend for those days when you are too sick to get off the couch with the remote missing, as I was. Otherwise you would quickly get up and do some fast fowarding. This is an incredibly drawn out series and when I finished season 1 I realized I could have watched half of the episodes and gotten as much out of it. It was also evident who the "bad guys" were after a few epidoes, which can sometimes work to heighten the drama (isn't that what we love about Columbo?), but if the director doesn't intend for you to understand who is doing what until the end (which is my perception) then it leaves it flat. I would totally rewatch some episodes, and like I said, the acting is really good, especially the interplay between the two detectives.
