This is complete and utter garbage. Bridgette is a revolting, wanton, fat, stupid woman doing her best to somehow replicate on the silver screen the fatuous feats that one might have done in childhood. The story is pointless. The main character is everything a man hates in a woman; desperate and annoying and wholly lacking any kind of confidence in herself. She says infantile things on the phone to her boyfriend and does all she can to be as outrageously facile as possible in public.  The jokes are stale and any purpose is completely lacking.

The film devolves into a series of scenes documenting how irritating she is. One is forced to put up with that tragically common English expression shag' again and again. The `shags' her bloke, her friends and old boyfriends all `shag', and she has `shag flashbacks'. It is all drivel and unbearable dross. She is a modern nightmare. I failed, I guess, to see the point. Is she supposed to be the defiant voice of the disenfranchised women in modern England? If so, it is a voice not worth hearing.

I am not sure who would enjoy this. Fat women with no friends who want to feel that other people are even more pathetic than themselves? Perhaps. Do yourself a favour. Put it down and read Cummings or Tennyson or Eliot. Use your mind and try to find the glory that once was England, because it certainly isn't here.
