If I had to assign one word to this movie, it would be "heavy."

I watched this movie with my 6 year old daughter. She was bored (though a good sport), and I expected a lot more magic and a greater feeling of wonder, particularly when in the toy store. I hadn't anticipated that death would be a constant vein throughout the movie. Also adding to the sense of sadness and loneliness was the element of misfits who find a friendship with each other that was unsettling itself in some ways. Finally, the most lighthearted moments (that is, the funniest parts of the movie) occurred when the store was throwing a temper tantrum (a bit of a mixed message for kids I think).

My daughter and I both were sad enough to tear up several times during the movie. (I'm certainly not opposed to children's movies that include death, for example, "Where the Red Fern Grows," "Old Yeller," and "Charlotte's Web" are all movies I watched in grade school and will have no qualms about showing my daughter.) Given though that we set out to watch a fun, magical show (based on the previews), I was disappointed when instead we left the movie feeling "bummed."

This movie may very well be a tool for opening communication with a child on death and the feelings of sadness, anger, fear, and then hope that are often associated with loss, but I do not recommend it if you are looking for a feel good or whimsical movie as I was.
