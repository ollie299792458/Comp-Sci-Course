I saw this movie with a couple of friends at home on DVD. At first we tried to give it every chance we could, but the amount of stupidity that this movie thrives with made it impossible. What was the deal with the wind in the greenhouse? Did it have a hole in it? Why didn't Jim make use of that oxygen that was brought to him and insisted on choking and fixing a computer instead, it would save all that time he was choking and trying to say commands to a computer. Why did the girl that brought the oxygen to him stay in the middle of the room instead of going up to him and supplying him with it while he was working? How come the computer doesn't have a manual input capability? What if the entire ship was depressurized, they wouldn't be able to say any commands to the computer since sound doesn't travel without air.
Why is the reboot mechanism located outside on the ships hull! I can go on and on. What amazes me is with all the money they had for this movie they couldn't hire someone who knew some basic high school physics and had some common sense to read the script and make sure it makes sense. Special effects are the only good part of this movie. Everything else is either below average.
The ending sequence was pretty interesting, although in my opinion alien looked a little bit too CG. The whole DNA idea is also very original. Beautiful matte work on those landscapes as well. Unfortunately that's about all the good stuff this movie has to offer.
If you still want this movie in your collection, rent it first. I am sure you won't buy it after seeing it.
