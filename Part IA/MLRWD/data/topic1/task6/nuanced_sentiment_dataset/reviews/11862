A group of confederate outlaws spend their night in a remote and deserted plantation house. As the night older, they start to find the terrifying secret that haunts the house and the wrath trapped alongside it. And this begin the nightmare that occurs to the group of the outlaws.

Being a period horror film is a plus point for Dead Birds because is not common these days to some directors to set their movie is period times. The civil war it self is more enough to be scary and that are benefit for Alex Turner, the director, to spine some chills in this feature.

I'm glad recently independent horror movies have tendency to shows a strong performance, when the bib-budget flick that somehow lose the spirit of the horror it self.

Dead Birds sure is a rare in the genre that try to become a griping horror movie that wasn't imply just on scare tactic. The atmosphere is build enough to scare have some jump-on-your-seat moments. All of these are works fairly well, especially in the first half, but somehow in the second half the plot is getting unclear and the movie became unbelievable. Afterwards, in the end, it return in the good sense.

To sum it up, Dead Birds is still delivers some good scare, and despite the flaw is worth watching.
