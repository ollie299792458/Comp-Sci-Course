As I get older I realize how right the great Mad Magazine
was to skewer The Omen and its even more preposterous
sequel, Damien: Omen II, in its hilarious pages.  These
films might have scared an old horror buff like me
when I was 10 years old but the more I watch the two
films now, the creakier and more totally ridiculous they
seem.  I will grant that the first film is a horror classic
despite the absurdities once must swallow in suspending
disbelief witnessing the accelerated catastrophes and
mysterious murders that befall all who stand in Damien's
way to power.  This sequel is well-made but more of the same,
Bill Holden is great as usual but yes he does seem out of
sorts in the "Gregory Peck" role, and Lee Grant is near-comatose as his unbelieving (but secretly Damien-worshipping) wife.
  One thing I will say about these films is anyone that knows the final biblical Book of Revelations (which Damien quotes out loud in this sequel) knows the passage: "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads."  Well, this
might be quibbling but Damien's "mark of the beast" is square on
the back of his head (or the top, looking like it was done with
a produce ink marker!  Aisle 5, antichrist price-check please) and NOT anywhere near his forehead or his hand.  And if this is the case then shouldn't there eventually be thousands if not millions of fellow anti-Christs roaming the
earth with the mark on them?  I'm pretty sure the 7 Daggers
of Meggido are totally fictitious as well, and nobody ever gets
near enough to Damien to actually use them anyway, so we'll
never know if they really are effective, like Raid, of
finally offing the Antichrist.
  But hey aren't we supposed to take Revelations that literally/seriously? I think not, and neither should we take this film, fascinating trash though it might be.  And Lance
Henriksen was destined for much better films (ALIENS), God bless him!
