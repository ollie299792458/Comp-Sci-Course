I used to be a big fan of this show and now i am not. i recently bought season 2 and was disappointed by it. the scripts were weak and not very entertaining. the episodes they put on tv years ago seemed to be the best of the bunch. i will probably buy more though. in all fairness, william katt, robert culp and connie sellecca are terrific actors and their talent is shown in this show.

i know this review might sound negative, but there were a couple of good episodes i intend on watching fairly regularly. the one with biker gang was funny and didn't waste anytime getting interesting. also, the one where Ralph goes into another dimension and a ghost tells him that the suit is no good here. Ralph has to take Bill into another dimension to get rid of the woman inside him that's possessing him and they both almost die. Good episode. it makes you think about the limitations of the suit.

i will probably buy more seasons even though i was disappointed even though i thought the scripts could have been better. i mean,aliens that give a human a suit where he can fly, become invisible, resist bullets and where he helps people should be a good show...

i give this 4 stars. i each for the main actors and one for the show. maybe that's more than it deserves.
