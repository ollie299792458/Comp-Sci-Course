Man can not tell the truth.  The truth exists only for an instant, after that it is only a memory, a memory filtered through human perception.  Does this make man evil?  No, it only makes him human...
  "Rashomon" deals with such themes.  Akira Kurasawa's thought-provoking, meditative, and inovative film asks philosophical questions about the nature of truth, by showing one act of fatal violence as seen through the eyes of four different people.  The results are varied, and obscure the truth.  But this is far more complex than one would imagine, for the characters do not, as it is often said, tell the story to make themselves seem the more innocent.  In fact, 3/4 claim to have commited the murder themselves.  This results in a profound, but delightful psychological and philosophical puzzle of a film.
  The visual aesthetics of Kurasawa's film are beautiful, and most innovative considering the very low budget.  As a whole the film has a soft, meditative, and very Japanese feel.  Scenes of the sun playing through the trees, dappling the ground in dancing shadows, come to mind as being most effective.  But what is most impressive, is that the pacing can be so lively, and entertaining, despite the fact that the majority of the film is made up of variations of the same scene.
  Kurasawa's pallete of truth and humanity introduced western culture to Japanese cinema, and is still a fine introduction to the film of that culture.  All in all, "Rashomon" is most interesting, and satisfying fare.  World cinema at its finest!
