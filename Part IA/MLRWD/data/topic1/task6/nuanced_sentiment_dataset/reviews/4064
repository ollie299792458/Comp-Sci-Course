the jokes...some crude...most clever...all whizzing by faster than some can catch before another sharpie stings us somewhere and somehow...

Sacha B C is a master at at being  and showing us the unexpected...or whoever wrote script helped him a bit too... This guy star is  tall, handsome and looks weird in a beard... but once that is removed,, he dances all over ...insulting every one every thing anywhere and also all in sight.

I'm impressed by alll the jokes that flew  by me so fast ...that now I have to re-see this film and laugh at  the jokes I got and then find the ones the movie threw at us  that jumped away. Loved it.

Some of us are very picky movie viewers, going seldom because we reject so much... including those too many made for 12-1/4 year old males. In fact the  3 trailers before the Dictator came on  and that we were force-fed to sit thru were AWFUL....loud, crass, unfunny, foul language used to elicit some kind of response with the same old old old stupid slapsticks.

So the movie we paid dearly for - the Dictator - himself came on when we were ready  to walk out. But being particular also means enjoying the unusual, the uncommon, the odd, the dissident and different and the de Cohen moves.

Fast and furious - as in angering the P C public - this film is a gem, a must-keep, a fun funny movie.

wanna try it for yourself and then report how delighted you to might become ? I did.
