I'm not a scholar or a historian but I just can't believe how the hosts of the show always jump into the conclusion and give credit to some imaginary Aliens for starting civilization. It's laughable. It's also an insult to the ancient sumarians, akkadians, babylonians, atlanteans, greeks and the rest of mankind.  There's absolutely no solid proof, none! just wild theories and hypothesis. I'm as much amazed as anyone else that the ancient people (who we believe were bunch of primitive idiots) build amazing stone structures of geometrical precision. But why wouldn't they? the ancient primitive man was not always a dumb caveman. Man exists on this earth for hundred thousands of years. During that time, there probably were many, many well advanced civilizations here on earth. As with any civilization, they eventually ceased to exist for one reason or another; the great flood and perhaps other natural desasters. I just don't buy the whole theory that some skinnky geeky aliens came here and help us build Egypt. I think it's nonsense.. As of today, there is no evidence for aliens. People can believe in whatever they want but without solid evidence, they're just naive fools.  I'm sure that I will even get responses that I should be open minded or something to that extent. When you're open minded, people will throw junk in!  I gave this DVD two stars for entertainment only.
