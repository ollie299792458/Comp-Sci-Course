I have never seen a vampire movie,where the vampires are relentless, grueling, Ultra violent, and have no mercy of the living. The movie is set in Barrow Alaska. A small town in a very remote place. Josh Harttnet plays the sherriff who encounters strange happenings after the sun goes down for the next thirty days, only to find out that evil vampires are about to kill everyone in their path and take over the town. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat about ten minutes in, and does not let go to the end. You can really feel what some of the victims went through as they are slaughtered at every turn. Because ,they mostly kept the camera on the victims during most of the attacks, instead of seeing a victim get attacked then the camera turned away. It has been awhile since I have squirmed in my seat, seeing so much carnage in a horror film. Okay, the only draw back is the sub par acting and plot holes, like, where did the Vampires come from and other minor things.The over all story and pace of the movie is done very well. I could not leave my seatto get any popcorn or go to the bathroom, because there was something going on.The vampires are very convincing looking. They definitly are better than most of the vampire movies I have seen in recent years. The gore factor is 10, the suspence another 10, the acting who gives a damn, this is a horror movie. Not a drama, chick flick or kiddie flick. To some of the people Iwill say this, like the movie for what it is. It is an uncomplicated movie and stylishly done. I wouls definitly buy this one for my collection and see in the movies again!!!
