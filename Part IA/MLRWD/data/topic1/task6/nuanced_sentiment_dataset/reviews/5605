THIS is Mel Brook's WORST movie ever. I think it's sad how so many great actors would've been in it, but THAT was then.

Usually EVERYTIME I read a review on Amazon, at least ONE [or two] people give any item "1 star", but I'm disgusted to find so many [rednecks?] giving this piece of trash "5 stars".

So....I'LL be 'that one person'!!

The OVER-hype-n-tripe reissuing of THIS film on VHS or DVD is also pretty weird considering IT probably used the "N word" more than ANY other film in the past 30+ years! I can't believe any TV channel [cable or broadcast] would still even show it!

With it's 'synthesized animal abuse' & 'over-use of the N word' it should've been burned & tossed years ago...

Mel thought it would be funny to invite "horses to bring their owners to the drive-ins" on it's first release, but I think Mel did MANY GREAT other films like "The Producers" [his BEST!] "High Anxiety" & "Silent Movie"..........so STOP re-issuing this piece of garbage over & over...OK??
