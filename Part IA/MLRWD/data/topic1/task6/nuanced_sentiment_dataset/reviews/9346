For the first two seasons, I thought this was far and away the best show on tv.  I love spy thrillers anyway, and this blend of espionage and humor seemed perfect.  I thought the writing fell off a bit in the third season, and I really didn't like the introduction of the Jesse Porter character into the series in the fourth season.  I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Michael, Fiona and Sam, and didn't want to see another character thrown into the mix to disrupt things.  I even felt mother Madeline's character had outlived her usefullness (and still do) but I've grown to like the Jesse character and enjoy his interaction with the other three.  I really enjoyed season five, even though it had the potential to be a disaster.  The whole premise of the show is Michael Westen being burned from his agency and out in the cold and how he deals with that.  With season five, he's back with the CIA (in a manner of speaking) and I was concerned this would destroy the whole reason behind the show.  Not so.  The team behind Burn Notice did a wonderful job reintegrating Michael into the intelligence community and yet still keeping him as sort of a rogue character.  I do wish Grant Show's character could have stuck around a little longer.  I thought he made a good partner for Michael.  But I understand that his demise propelled the season storyline, so I understand.  I think Anson Fullerton is a great bad guy, and have enjoyed his scenes with the group.  I like the idea of one last bad guy from the group that burned Michael, and one who was there from the beginning.  Overall, I really enjoyed season five, and thought it was their best since the second season.
