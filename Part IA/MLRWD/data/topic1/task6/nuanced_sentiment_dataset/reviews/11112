It's easy to be critical of Michael Paxton's documentary on Ayn Rand.  It was produced with the cooperation of the Ayn Rand Institute (the religious wing of Objectivism headed by Leonard Peikoff) and, as such, presents a one-sided view of Ayn Rand.

Particularly disappointing is the documentary's slighting of Nathaniel and Barbara Branden, who played an enormous role in Rand's life from 1950-1968 and were largely responsible for the launch of the Objectivist movement.  Nathaniel, of course, had an affair with Rand, with the consent of their spouses.  Leonard Peikoff (who didn't learn about the affair until years later) blames Rand's split with the Brandens on Nathaniel's supposed failings.  Of course, there is every reason to think the split was a bit more complicated than this.  Unfortunately, Peikoff (mistakenly called Rand's "intellectual heir") even speculates that the affair did not hurt Rand's husband Frank O'Connor when the evidence is to the contrary.

Paxton did, however, have access to Rand's archives and the documentary contains plenty of interesting pictures and video of Rand.  Even those who know a fair amount about Rand's life will learn a lot.
