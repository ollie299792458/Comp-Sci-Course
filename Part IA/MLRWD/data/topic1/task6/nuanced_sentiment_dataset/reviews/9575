This is one of the only movies that I will turn off before it's finished. Although I did have to watch the rest of it so I can say I watched Casablanca. 
This movie is horrible! It is so boring and unoriginal that I can't stand it. The only good thing about it is the cast. Bogie is the man of course and Ingrid Bergman makes the screen shine with her beauty and talent. But that's it.
How is it boring? Because all they do is talk. The only moment I felt enthralled is where Rick flashbacked to Paris and the end. That's it. The rest is a bunch of talking and ordering the African-American around. Now I know it's old but it's not based on the Civil War. It's during World War II. A lot of people, including blacks, got killed so the studios could make this awfulness.
How is it unoriginal? It's about a love triangle. You take away the locale and the nazis and that's all it is. Besides, there's absolutely no chemistry between Bogart and Bergman. They looked more uncomfortable than in love. A lot of professional reviewers praise it because they base it around World War II. Of course they did, the movie was made in 1943. 
According to the AFI this movie is #2 in the best movies of all time. It's right above The Godfather. Say it isn't so say it isn't so.
Final words: If this movie is so great then could anybody tell me the director or the screenwriter?
