Okay.......we have ALL been warned about "Sequels" and just how disappointing they can be, but this one takes the cake!

Between the gratuitous sexual scenes which were neither erotic or sexy but rather a nightmare from a maladjusted twelve year old's mentality, to some Government official wiping his bum with the Bill of Rights [just plain gross and not at all funny]; this so called feature film rests at the very lowest of the bottom feeders from greedy film studios to make a quick buck off a substandard sequel to an originally creative effort.

I thought "Harold & Kumar go to White Castle" was a well written contemporary "young" comedy which actually displayed some wit at times as well as good comedic acting [loved the racoon attack in the car].

But this movie is just plain embarassing and has NO REDEEMING QUALITIES on ANY LEVEL, despite your age, gender, or cultural background.  It is toilet humour at it's worst, and would make the most obnoxious elementary schoolyard jerk you can remember back then just plain blush.

Such an opportunity to something truly creative with an established fan base was literally "flushed down the drain" by the Producers and the Writers of this rediculous crap. They should be ashamed of themselves.

Save your money, Pleeeeease!  Don't waste it on this!
