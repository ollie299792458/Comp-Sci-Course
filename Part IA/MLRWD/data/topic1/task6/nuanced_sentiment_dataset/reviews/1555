I ended up not being able to use this product and had to send it back.  There is a fitness test in it because it is so extreme.  They recommend that if you can't pass the test to start with something lighter.  This is a good recommendation, and goes to their credit.  Of course it would be better if they told you this before you purchase the product then lose money in shipping to and from.  It would also have been nice if I knew ahead of time that I needed a large area with all the moving around this course requires.  The area that I have to work out in is to small for all the exercises.
And most inmportantly, if you do return it, watch your bank statements!  I received the return authorization number and sent mine back.  Thankfully I had delivery confirmation on it.  Not only did I not get a refund, but the next month they charged me the second installment!  (Yes I bought this directly from the company.)  When I called to question this they needed to track the package to make sure they received it.  I then received the refunds that I was supposed to get, and quickly too.  But of course the refund did not cover shipping and handling either way.  And even with the "free upgrade to express delivery" the S&H was over $21.
