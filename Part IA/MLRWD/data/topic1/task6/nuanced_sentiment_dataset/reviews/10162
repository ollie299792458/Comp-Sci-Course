I seem to be one member of an elite group of people who absolutely LOVED this film. Upon seeing AMERICAN PSYCHO in a sold-out theater, it was painfully obvious to me that most of the movie-goers in there were  expecting something along the lines of SCREAM. A crumby slasher flick. A  story which displays a number of gruesome and well-thought out deaths. A  story where there is a hero. A story which ends happily ever after. This  movie had none of the above, which is what made it such a fantastic and  original film. Despite the graphic violence portrayed in the novel by Bret  Easton Ellis, most of the killing is off-screen and left to the viewers'  imagination. But the slaughter is also accompanied by fabulous black  humour. In fact, I can't remember the last time that I laughed so hard at a  movie (and was looked back at like there was truly something seriously  wrong with me). Mary Harron does a fantastic job directing this movie and  her decision to cast (and stand behind) Bale as Bateman is nothing more  than perfect. *Some may know that Harron temporarily left the directors'  chair when the studio told her that Bale would be replaced by Leonardo  DiCaprio. The film was almost given to Oliver Stone, but came back to  Harron when Leo decided against the role...THANK GOD! All-in-all, AMERICAN  PSYCHO is flawless. If you've got a taste for humour which is black as  night, a knowledge of 80's pop culture and if you know just a tad about  serial killers and the fact that they can indeed be that handsome man next  door, you'll EAT THIS MOVIE UP!  Enjoy!
