Having read and enjoyed the books, I was surprised by some aspects of the Spiderwick movie. A warning to parents of children 9 and under: this movie is quite scary, and contains violence - yes, violence. There are many sword slashing scenes which feature puncturing, slashing, biting and blood. While most of the blood is monster (green) blood, Spiderwick also features scenes which reveal monster bites that make the monsters much more scarier and real than your average children's flick.

Another disappointing aspect to Spiderwick is the portrayal of the father. The father is seen as cold, uncaring, and unloving. The father cheats on his wife, abandons her, and abandons the children - even at the end of the movie. Lastly, there is a scene in which it appears that the father has come to the rescue, but in reality, the father is actually a hideous monster in disguise.

Why Spiderwick goes out of its way to portray fathers in such a very negative light to such a young and impressionable audience baffles me. This is careless, cruel and irresponsible.

The movie could have easily - by a country mile - left the blood, violence and father bashing out, and Spiderwick would have been a 5 star movie. With the "junk" left in, it was 3 stars at best.

In conclusion, I wouldn't say this is a movie for children under 10 unless a parent is involved. My younger daughter was scared to death by what was taking place on screen. Older children should be able to process the violence and father-bashing a little better.
