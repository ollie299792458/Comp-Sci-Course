I know many people consider this an inspirational movie. I remember seeing a group of students at school discussing just how great this movie was, how inspiring, how positive. After viewing the movie myself, and trying my best to be upbeat about it too, I never felt this way about the movie. In fact, I thought it was stinko. Seldom could I understand just what rocky was saying, since he seemed to be talking with a mouth full of ham sandwich all the time.

What is the basis of this story? A guy, severely outclassed in ability and experience goes up against an impossible foe. It is an old plot of amature vs pro and the amature winning. So what. There are so many movies that use this plot - outnumbered, outclassed, outeverything vs what appears to be an unbeatable foe. Many of these movies do carry this through and show how the beaten down can sometimes come back and win it all. These are the ones to see, not rocky.

I do not recommend this movie to anyone seeking an inspirational movie.
