This actually was not intended to be a sequel to The Amityville Horror, just a 3D movie that put a new spin of the Amityville story. It was named Amityville 3 or whatever in Europe by the over seas distributer to cash n on the amityville series name. Just as Lucio Fulci's movie Zombie was named Zombie 2 in Europe because Dawn of the dead had been named zombie over there and the distributers tried to cash in on the enormous success it was.

Anyway, Amityville 3D was eventually taken into consideration as a part of the series later on when they made amityville 4 since that movie had nothing to do with the series either and after that every movie was just separate story taking place in the Amityville house. So, therefore none of the amityville movies after part two are really sequels considering a sequel continues directly an ongoing story and none of these do.

I give this movie 3 stars even though I have never watched the entire thing in one sitting because it was rather lame, but it was somewhat inventive and I could tell that a lot of it would be better in it's original 3D format in the theaters, rather than on video.
