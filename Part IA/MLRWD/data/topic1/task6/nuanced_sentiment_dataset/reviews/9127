Recently I have become a quasi-fan of the gore/sh(l)ock genre and this film seemed like it would be a great addition to my ever growing collection. The subject matter and notoriety of the film were enough to intrigue me. However, to say that I was disappointed is quite an understatement.

Like other reviewers have stated, the film is actually quite well acted. The scenery is very lovely as well. That's about the only redeeming qualities I could find in this film. While I always try to keep in mind the date a film was made, especially when dealing with films in this genre, I can't imagine how anyone would find this to be "the more horryfying movie ever made." Not unless you're talking about the ridiculous dubbing one must endure throughout.

The torture scenes were mild at best unless you just can't stand the sight of low-grade Halloween fake blood. I was also under the assumption that the film would primarily focus on the more "gorey" aspects of the witch trials, but it didn't. Instead the film seemed to be more intersted in the pseudo-political struggles between the the inquisitor (Herbert Lom), his sadist in training (Udo Kier), and the wonderfully hideous Albino (Reggie Nalder). In all I'd estimate that the torture scenes comprised maybe 10-15 minutes total of this film...I could be wrong however, I may have fallen asleep.

I can, however still appreciate this film in the context that it was released as presented at the time it was. But, if you're really into high quality gore stick with Miike.
