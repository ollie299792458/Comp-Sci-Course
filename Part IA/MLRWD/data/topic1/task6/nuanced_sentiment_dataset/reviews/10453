I love this show!  I can't wait until the complete version of Season 2 is released.  The characters are all interesting and have depth to them.  Stefan, Damon, Elena, Jeremey and Bonnie are the anchors of the show.  Matt is also very important! The characterization of Stefan as a good guy who can also, be a bad guy as well as Damon as a bad guy that has some redeeming qualities is great!  Elena and Bonnie are strong female characters that I don't think the show would be as good without either one of them.  The TV version is different than the original books.  I think that is OK as you can't always make a TV show or even a movie follow the original book(s).

 I also, love the books that were written by L.J. Smith!  I am very disappointed that the publisher has fired the original writer, L.J. Smith and has appointed someone else to write the story that she created!  I won't be buying anymore of them unless they are written by her.  The whole feeling of the characters is different in the Stefan Diaries.  I realize that they were written to follow the TV show more closely, but the next 3 books should continue the story that has already been started by Ms Smith.
