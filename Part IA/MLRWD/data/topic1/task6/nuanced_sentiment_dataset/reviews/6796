If you like movies that make you loathe every carbon-based being on this earth -- movies that make the bile rise from the depths of your gastrointestinal tract and shoot up your esophagus and make your mouth tingle with existential horror -- then this is the movie for you!

The majority of the film focuses on the incredible (as in, "wow, that is not credible!") naivit&eacute; of a 15-year-old girl from the Paris suburbs who decides to let some sleezy Italian 20-something pop her French cherry. Happenstance forces the 15-year-old and her embarrassingly un-smooth older lover to conduct all of this business (the screwing, the pre-screwing banter, etc.) in a room she shares with her pudgy 12-year-old sister Anais. The whole piece unfolds like a dreamy high-budget after school special, except for some truly enjoyable scenes that reveal the sisters' unique bond.

I guess there's some other good stuff about this film, but let me cut to the chase and say that every moment of it is RUINED at the END which is NEEDLESSLY VIOLENT and DONE PURELY FOR SHOCK VALUE. If that's your thing, fine, whatever. But personally, I think pain porn like this is for hopelessly jaded or deeply pretentious people who think that it's cool to exhibit pure contempt for our species. The creative mind that conjures this ending is one that has no sensitivity for the kind of suffering she attempts to portray, and the kind of viewer that stands back in appreciation is either a sadist or afraid to declaim anger at such a dehumanizing portrayal of murder and rape for fear of being called "shallow" or "prudish" or -- mon dieu! -- "sincere."

If you've ever witnessed or been involved in any kind of violence, watching this movie is a really awesome way to get retraumatized.

Zero stars!!!!
