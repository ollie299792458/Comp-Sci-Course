Since my Appreciation of Cinema class in college (about 1967) I've made it a practice to watch "art" films, commercial films and those in the large gray area between in equal measure. One goes into a film from one of the masters/greats/pioneers with a bias towards enjoying it, if not loving it. Yet there are some films nearly universally pronounced masterpieces which I have difficulty enjoying. Among Godard's, I find Pierrot Le Fou and Alphaville to be so stilted and self-consciously arty that they are difficult to watch. (Only in small part because one's eyes tend to roll back in disbelief). I can appreciate the absurd and the surreal when they are handled well, but there is a lack of smooth flow, a sort of jerkiness to Pierrot Le Fou which makes me uncomfortable.
Another reviewer compared it to Pulp Fiction; like it and many other "guy noir" flicks of recent years, it tries to make violence comedic. Where Tarentino (in my opinion) pulls it off well by making an action flick, Godard just messes around with too many genres:action violence, musical, comedy, heavy social commentary, and more. Overall, it certainly isn't a terrible movie--it has many redeeming scenes to be enjoyed. But far too often, Godard hits you with a bat to make his points, then flitters off in a total about face stylistically and plays the non-sequitur card way too often.
I should state that on dvd I watched the Fox-Lorber edition. It is far from a great transfer, many imperfections and a lack of clarity. I don't recall the quality of the screened version I watched (hey, that was 40 years ago!), maybe Godard wanted a crudity to it. But other viewers state that the Criterion dvd & the blu-ray versions are much better.
