After re-reading the books and watching Jackson's live action version, I rented this movie.  It was interesting to compare the story editing with the live version.  Overall, this version stays very close to the book, with large sections of dialog lifted out of the books intact. In some places the rotoscoping is very poorly done, but in others I didn't think it detracted much.  Surely, the animation is not up to today's standards, but I thought it worked well.
Really, my biggest complaint is this:  after about two hours I started thinking, "Wow, this is really long and I guess they've got another hour to go to wrap things up...".  And then the movie just abruptly ended with the battle of Helm's Deep.  Merry and Pippin are off with the Ents...  Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are about to cross the mountains of Mordor... It was as if they ran out of money or just suddenly decided that the movie was too long, so they whacked it off.  Gandalf comes riding up and starts slinging purple Orc blood around in slow motion and then the narrator intones:  "...And so they drove evil from Middle Earth..."  and lived happily ever after.  The End.  
Other than that, it was interesting..  It's a pity they couldn't find some footage to restore for the DVD version.
