This is a wonderful film as it shows the hypocracies of life. To be tortured by the Hungarian Fascists just to turn into a Communist torturer of the former torturers makes perfect sense to me. This IS HISTORY. There are plenty of cases of people who started as Communists turned into Nazis and ended up "Democrats". Now, I call this the instinct of survival which in turn is very human...
I would recommend this highly to any teacher or person interested in the period of history between 1890s to 1960s. This film may be able to explain - as much as a movie can do that, of course - why people do certain things at a certain time.
Because they want to survive in times of trouble and most people would not have the guts to stand up against totalitarian ideas. I wonder whether I would have the guts myself.
Buy it, it is worth it. Fine performance by Ralph Fiennes.
A last thing: it is certainly not a movie that would doubt the value of every single political idea. No, it just sends out the message that if you look for a sense of life and values therin, do not look into politics or political ideas. For that, you need to open your eyes and look around for yourself.
