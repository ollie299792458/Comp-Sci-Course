Though Priest youngblood may try to justify his pimping and dealing saying "this is what the white man left us" and "I only deal to white MFers"; that is not the message of the film. The scenes show us differently-such as when they accidentally break into a poor, honest sista's decrepit place with her children around a stove trying to stay warm; how eventually this is a strange form of suicide. But what it does do is point out the failures of the mainstream civil rights movement and the man to get us as a people off the bus riding and instead actually owning it; even if we can ride anywhere on it and Obama (who I voted for but would prefer Ishmael Reed or Kalamu Ya Salaam)now drives ONLY as a symbol. Actually, my father was similar to Priest and mama to Cynthia. I'm now a new film producer myself-people compare my political, artistic, musical, and social sensibility to Gordon Parks Jr. at his best-Supafly. One of the best FILMS period-if it'd been a white film it'd have won many oscars at the time it was so powerful. I'd actually give it SIX stars!
