Before "Pretty Woman" Julia Roberts showed off her wonderful effervescence in "Steel Magnolias." This movie has an all-star cast that includes: Sally Fields, Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, and Dolly Parton.

"Just rat it up and make it look like a football". I was at a wedding shower recently and the bridesmaid jokingly made that remark when the mother of the bride mentioned that she didn't know what she was going to do with her hair for the wedding. Another young woman sitting next to them asked, "Isn't that from the movie "Steel Magnolias"? They all started laughing with several of the other young women exclaiming, "I love that movie", and "It's one of my favorites", and "One of the best movies ever made". That pretty much sums up "Steel Magnolias". For many women it has managed to cross over from generation to generation, binding them together. Before there was the raucous comedy "Bridesmaids" there was the genteel movie "Steel Magnolias" that--even without all the comedic crudeness--managed to do it better.
