I can't explain it,but like so many other people,I'm fascinated by gangsters.I'll read any book I can get my hands on and I'll watch any movie made about them.One of the first was "Dillinger".It may not be the most accurate film ever made,but at least John Millius tries to make up for it with thrilling action.The plot plays more like the generic "Cop out for revenge" (Purvis hunting down the gangsters responsable for the June 17,1933 shoot-out that left three agents dead) rather than an attempt to tell the life of Dillinger.One of the few perks of the film are some surprisingly accurate portrayals.First there's Warren Oates who has the distinction of being the only actor who played Dillinger,who actually looks like him!Other accurate portrayals inclue Steve Kanaly(from T.V.'s Dallas) as Pretty Boy Floyd and a young Richard Dreyfuss in a psychotic,but accurate version of Babyface Nelson.The most telling part of his character is when he declares "I go in shooting.I kill everyone in sight.I grab the dough.And leave shooting!" That line seems to define the film.Despite it's historical flaws,it's still an entertaining action flick from the "Drive In" era.
