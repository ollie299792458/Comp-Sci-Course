I dont really think this movie deserved to be marketed on DVD as a "Fox Studio Classic."  This 1942 showcase for the Glenn Miller band is amusing and well-made, but a minor entry in the musical comedy genre by Twentieth Century Fox.

The flimsy plot concerns Connie (Ann Rutherford), a small town girl who falls for Bill (George Montgomery), a trumpet player in the Glenn Miller Orchestra.  They marry immediately, but problems ensue courtesy of a group of catty "orchestra wives" and the band's lead female singer (Lynn Bary), who tries to regain the affections of Bill, her former boyfriend, leading to the dissolution of the band.

The cast is serviceable, but unremarkable.  Ann Rutherford  and George Montgomery are attractive and play their parts well, but they lack the charisma of Fox's leading musical stars, like Alice Faye and Betty Grable. They're easily upstaged by the underrated Lynn Bari as the rival, Fox staple Cesar Romero as a womanizing pianist, and Carole Landis as a catty "orchestra wife".

The main reason to watch this film is to hear the musical numbers by the Glenn Miller Orchestra (all of them great) and also to see the superb dancing specialty number by the Nicholas Brothers (who sadly appear only once almost at the end).
