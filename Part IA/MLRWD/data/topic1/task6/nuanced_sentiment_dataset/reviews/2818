This movie was a big  disapppointment, the second one was AWESOME!  The last fight scene should have been in the third one.  Theres one pretty cool fight scene in the beginning, then it goes into you typical martial arts action hero defeat story in which I have no problem with, but they dragged it on to long,  Tony Jaa "Tein" gets his bones broken and goes thru recovery, then trying to decide whether or not he should fight anymore or if he should continue to live anymore.  Then he has some wise words then he starts training,(they really dragged his training out to long in this movie) re-unites with lost love, and begins his mission for revenge.  I said it about Ong Bak 2 that stupid crow guy is the worst villian ever, not because hes sinister hes just stupid,  in this movie they use a lot of "wire-fu" In which I hate The last fight scene was about maybe pushing 8 to 9 minutes, but personally I only thought the first 4 and a half was cool the rest just seemed like a really lame Jet Li fight scene.......  Just not the Tony Jaa that Im use to, Oh yea theres some weird mystical power which was weird.  I promise you that in the last fight scene your going to say "what?" atleast 8 times, and not because you cant believe what you just saw, a lot of stuff that just doesnt make sense.  I really gave this movie 2 stars only because it was associated with the "Ong Bak" series.  The movie looked great, how it was shot and etc.  But just disappointing.
