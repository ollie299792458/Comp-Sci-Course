An odd, yet yet ingenious idea. Cannibalism in the California mountains during the 1840s. Great performances by all especially Guy Pearce. Being a big fan of LA Confidential this one was a far different character. Cursed by his cowardness during the war with Mexico he's constantly having flashbacks early on to the brutal battles and how he survived(you'll like that one). Soon he decides he had better escape but runs into the American counterattack on the Mexican base. He takes advantage of the situation by capturing the Mexican commanders. Instead of haning him for cowardness he's given a medal and treated like a hero. But his company commander knows the truth and wants him as far away from him and his men as possible. He sends him to a fort in the California mountains run by a skeleton crew. Soon a stranger is found passed out outside their fort. But he isn't what he seems.

 Ravenous has a peculiar combination of black humor and one of the best musical scores for a movie I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong the music isn't the best for any movie but it just fits into the movie so well its amazing. An eerie western mix that was brilliantly put together. The black humor might push some away, but for me it made it much more fun to watch.

 Ravenous no doubt deserves to have better track record than it does. One of the most interesting tales I've yet to come across in a movie. When someone has the words odd, peculiar, and eerie all in the same review you know it isn't an ordinary movie and this is by no means an ordinary movie.
