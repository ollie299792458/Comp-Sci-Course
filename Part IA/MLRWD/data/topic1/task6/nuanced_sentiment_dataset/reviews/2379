I recently started watching this show, and although I admit in the beginning I was unsure if it was anything I would enjoy, I am so incredibly happy that I stuck with it!

After 2 days, I've finished watching the entire anime series, and although the ending left some things to be desired, it has created a need in my soul to begin reading the manga (I'm on chapter 240 and continuing onwards).

Yes, I agree that Gantz is very violent, there is sexually explicit material and it is most definitely not for younger audiences. However, if you are looking for an Anime that differs from the norm, one that gives you a story suitable for adults while twisting what you intially expect from just any old anime then this show is exactly what you need.

I can compare it in quality with the Hellsing OVA (not the 17-episode series, but the so far 4 episode series that follows the manga incredibly well).

This is definitely worth the time and money, it will leave you begging for more and the manga provides it once the anime is done!
