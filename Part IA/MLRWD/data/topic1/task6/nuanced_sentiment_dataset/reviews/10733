Die Another Day - Am I the only one that has noticed a problem with the special features disc for DAD that comes in the Ultimate JB Vol. 2 set?  Where are the supplemental features left over from the previous special edition?  They are listed on the box but they are no where to be found on my copy.  They are not even menus on the 2nd disc for this material as there are on all the other films.  Does anybody else have this problem?  Maybe I just got a defective pressing.

Thunderball - The supplementary segment titled "Bill Suitor - The Rocket Man Movies" seems strange.  there is no title credit to this segment and no talk whatsoever of 'Rocket Man Movies'.  It just jumps right in with dialogue and seems as if the segment starts at a point where Mr. Suitor has already been speaking for a while.  Anybody else notice this?  Also has anybody noticed something odd in the title credit sequence?  It seems as if there was some fluctuation in one of the scenes of a frogman swimming buy, which is also included on the textless version on the 2nd supplementary material disc.  Very strange that this problem exists on the new "ultimate" edition but not on the previous special edition.

Again, has anybody noticed these problems besides me?  I am sending my copy of Vol 2 back.  Thanks.
