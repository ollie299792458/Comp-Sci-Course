There are a few guidelines to be adhered to when watching films of this calibre'. notably, one should leave their concept of logic behind, when watching asinine films like this.
now that we got THAT out of the way (a bone for the snob mob), this film is a fun fest in the screwest of screwball ways imaginable. for those of you who are still wondering, yes it is a mindless stupid comedy, that's the point!
The movie is about two guys Jesse and Chester (potential Darwin award candidates) who get drunk one night and next day wake up to find their car missing, the rest of the movie revolves around them finding the location of their car and trying to make good for their girlfriend's anniversary.
While its not the best in the genre' (oh yes, there IS a genre of this kind of movies  heh heh), its still harmless frat boy fun.
I am surprised by the negative reviews that films like these receive, i mean, what do you guys expect from movies like this??? solid plot, screenplay, good acting ?
and to quote my favorite phrase in the film

"The el fuego of all that is el fuego" ....  LOL!
