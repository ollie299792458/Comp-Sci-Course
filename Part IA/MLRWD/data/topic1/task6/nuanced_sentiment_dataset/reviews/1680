This was a fun movie... not specifically a 'good' movie, but quite fun. It's basically the story of a group of friends who go on a road trip to steal a copy of Star Wars Episode 1 from George Lucas before it's released. I didn't find myself laughing out loud too much throughout movie... but I did have a smile on my face through most of it. There's a lot of cool cameos, and of course as would be expected in a movie like this a ton of geeky Star Wars (and Star Trek) jokes and references.

I think the reason this one never elevates itself above an average comedy, is that there are way too many overused and cliche plot devices and comedic elements... to the point where it feels a little disingenuous at times. But let's be honest... I'm probably being a little too critical of a movie that wasn't meant to be analyzed, its meant to turn your brain off and enjoy; and that being said I'd say it did its job in that respect. Worth a watch, especially for any of you big time Star Wars fans out there. 3/5 stars.
