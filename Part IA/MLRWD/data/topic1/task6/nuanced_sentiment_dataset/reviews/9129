Despite the picky people on here, I actually enjoyed this movie in its own right.  For an 80's movie its not bad at all, Louise Fletcher is awesome as the grandmother and the twins are far less annoying here than they are in the book.  In fact, a lot of things in the movie make more sense and are more believable than in the book.  In the book, they are able to get out of the attic, get on the roof and even go swimming in a lake.  Duh, then why didn't you escape then?  At least in the film, you really got the sense that they were trapped and while the actors are older than the ones in the book I actually like Kristy Swanson (despite the horrid movie version of Buffy) and she captured Cathy for me.  The radically changed ending is important for the film version because it gives the viewer a sense of closure while the books continue on.  If they had planned to make all the books into movies, then the ending would have ruined it but this ending is actually quite satisfying and gives you a soap opera sort of squeal of glee when the mother gets her comeuppance.
