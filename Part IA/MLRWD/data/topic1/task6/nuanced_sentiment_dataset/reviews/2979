To understand and appreciate this movie you'll need a little background information.  First of all, it's not one story, but a combination of three stories from the graphic novels of the same name, with a short clip from another story as an introduction.

The introductory skit, starring Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton, is from "The Customer is Always Right", the others being "The Hard Goodbye," "The Big Fat Kill" and "That Yellow Bastard".

Shot in a way that is as close to the original comics as possible, the movie is in black and white, except for certain highlighted objects in the frames that are vividly colored in stark contrast.  Without significant amounts of nudity, it earns its rating because of the violence which is central to the plots, and boy, does that white blood flow and fly.

The movie smells of Tarantino, but he only directs one small, and of course totally weird, bit, the majority being done by Robert Rodriguez, and Frank Miller, author of the novels.

Each segment is illuminated by star power such as Jessica Alba (Nancy), Rosario Dawson (great as Gail), Benicio Del Toro (outstanding as Jackie Boy), Michael Clark Duncan (Manute), Carla Gugino (Lucille), Rutger Hauer (Cardinal Roark), Jaime King (Goldie/Wendy), Michael Madsen (brilliant as Bob), Brittany Murphy (Shellie), Clive Owen (Dwight), Mickey Rourke (brilliant as Marv), Elijah Wood (creepy as Kevin) and not forgetting Bruce Willis (Hartigan), in one of his best performances ever.  I also liked Devon Aoki as "Miho" whose role brought back memories of Kill Bill and the Crazy 88.

Without knowing the source, the movie would be a bit confusing, as characters can be seen appearing in all three stories, and after a while, some of the female stars start looking alike.  There's nothing light about this movie, and it may not be for everybody, but the action keeps coming and the blood keeps pumping, and it's hard to look away.
