I first saw this animated version of the Dickens classic when I was 9 years old.  It ran every year on some station or other for about the next ten years, then dropped out of sight.  However, it stayed very much alive in my family's folklore, with a gaggle of annual snickers about preparing the "woofle-jelly cake" and "razzle-berry dressing."  I was delighted to learn it was available on video a few years back, and after much searching happily found a copy!I think there was never any finer Scrooge than Magoo...his miserly tendencies make him nearly typecast.  (Visualize, if you will, J. Thurston Howell III playing Scrooge in the Gilligan's Island production...same idea!) Technically, the production is notably one of a bygone era of animation; so what?  The musical score is top-drawer Broadway quality, written by an award-winning team of composers; and the actors selected to provide the voices of the characters were perfect choices.  (There's even a "cameo" appearance of Gerald Mc Boing-Boing as Tiny Tim!)  Those viewers from generations succeeding the Baby Boom will probably require some background explanation (how many kids today have actually seen Magoo?), but the smaller fry should enjoy Magoo's antics.  The Baby Boomers will enjoy many pleasant memories...this one needs to be added to your holiday viewing archives!
