Thomas Wolfe said it best: You can't go home again. And for those who fondly recall Friday nights or Saturday mornings of their youth spent glued to classic horror and sci-fi on the TV, I suggest: keep those memories untainted by reality and avoid movies such as It! Terror from Beyond Space. If you can't resist, that's fine, but prepare to have your beloved memories deflated.
For me, I remember watching Alien and immediately recognizing the connection to some movie I loved as a child. That old B&amp;W flick was chilling, with nothing but a few hatches between the poor people and the unstoppable creature. And when it came out after years of searching for it, I bought it gladly. Sigh.
Here are the facts: The cast has some recognizable actors, but the acting is rather campy. The special effects are poor. The monster is at times scary, but at times much more cheesy. The makeup effects are laughable. 
That being said, there are a few decent scares and some claustrophobia associated with bottle films (i.e., trapped with no where to run). Shadow and low lighting is used to minimize creature budget constraints, and it works in several places. And some of the initial ideas are fairly interesting. But ultimately, a bit too dull.
If you're a fan of period sci-fi, you might want to give it a look. You're probably used to camp and you might actually enjoy it. Truthfully, I do on occasion; it's a nice diversion when I'm cooking, for instance, or in the mood for a few sci-fi chuckles. But if you have fond memories of this film in the recesses of your memory, my advice is: keep them there.
