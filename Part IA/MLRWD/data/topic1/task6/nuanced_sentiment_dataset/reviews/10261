That is right, if you are in for camp, general bitchery, and overplayed melodrama, the Joan Crawford Collection is a must have!

This collection put together five of Mommie Dearest's most unforgettable performances; capturing La Joan in all of her steely determination and yet the woman still can project soft vulnerability.

The best of the lot is "Mildred Pierce" in which Joan gave an Oscar-winning performance as the title character who would do anything for her spoiled rotten self-center daughter even if it meant murder.

Then it is followed by "The Damned Don't Cry" in which Joan plays a woman who would do anything to leave her humble beginnings for the big life, even if it meant being the mistress to a crime boss.

The third best movie is "Possessed", in which Joan plays a slightly screwy private nurse who would do anything for the love of a man who doesn't return her affections, even if it meant marrying another man she doesn't love so she can be near him.

Coming in fourth is "Humoresque", in which Joan plays a socialite who would do anything for the love of a violin player whom she had taken under her wing even if it meant her reputation. This movie is different from the rest (and a little disappointing) in which Joan didn't have to fight, claw, or sleep her way to the top.

Finally, "The Women", a catty bitchfest in which Joan plays a perfume counter girl who would do anything to climb the social and financial ladder of high society even if it meant breaking up a man's family (with all due respect, she really should have considering the man had an obnoxious oh golly gee wiz daugher).

However, the last film "The Women" seems out of place in the collection because Crawford is barely in it; it belongs more in  a Norma Shearer collection.  I would much rather prefer "Flamingo Road" or "Johnny Guitar", both of which featured Crawford in her fabulous neurotic glory.
