Airplane is one of those rare movies where you are glad that your DVD player has the capability to pause the film, thus saving you from missing anything when you get up for any reason.  I originally saw this movie in the theater and laughed myself into a near coma, but it is the ability of video and DVD to allow the viewer to repeat the film infinitum that makes you appreciate its brilliance.
There always seems to be something happening in the foreground, background, or even over the loudspeaker in the airport.  It challenges you to pick up on all of the jokes.  This isn't as easy as it sounds.  You will find yourself concentrating on the blatant jokes, puns, and groaners, but missing the subtle jokes that go on in the peripheral areas of the screen.
The use of well known "Dramatic" actors in the film adds to the hillarity.  They deliver the jokes in a way that makes you believe that the absurdity is normal.  This film, of course, made Leslie Nielson's career.
I own this movie on VHS and DVD and I strongly recomend that everyone who owns a DVD player add this movie to your collection.  The enhanced sound quality will ensure that you will hear all of the subtle jokes.  I rank it as my number 5 favorite comedy of all time, and my top five are very close.  Get it, you won't regret it.
