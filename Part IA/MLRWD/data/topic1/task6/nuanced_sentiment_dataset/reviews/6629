INTRODUCTION

Reno 911 is about a group of Cops always causing a problem one way or the other. This show is themed like COPS but it is ment to be dumb and funny at the same time. To make it short this is a Fake reality show. The Actors are trying to make somethng as funny as this seem real. In every episode they travel around RENO looking for the bad guys. Or at least they try.
