What to say about Almighty Thor that hasn't been said by other reviewers? The questionable effects? Try making an effects based movie with zero dollars. The acting? The Asylum only ever has one "real" actor in any of their flicks and all that budget apparently went to Richard Grieco's hammy villain Loki. The plot or story? Has an Asylum movie ever really had a script to speak of? Having seen several of their other films, I sometimes think that the crew arrives on day one and starts filming immediately, working out what is going to happen on an improvisational whim. All are hallmarks of classic Asylum films.
So on to this specific movie. The effects on Thor are obviously inferior say to the big-budget Thor movie that was "co-incidentally" released the same week-end. But what direct to dvd/ made for Syfy channel movie would pass that litmus test? While certainly not awe-inspiring, the CG in Thor is not jaw-droppingly awful either. A definite step-up when compared to prior Asylum features in my opinion. The actors are serviceable for the profile of the movie. Wrestler Kevin Nash as the wise All-Father Odin? Stunt casting to be sure, but fun. The main protagonists are a bit wooden and stilted (particularly Cody Deal's Thor who was obviously cast more for his look and was saddled with a very uneven character.) Sometimes bad acting is a by-product of poor scripting and a low-budget movie is usually saddled by a confluence of both as is Almighty Thor.
Thor at least seems to proceed along a linear path to its final confrontation between Thor and Loki. One bad plot point as others have mentioned is Thor's bull-headedness, which is in character for the headstrong Thunder-God. Thor is portrayed as very weak during most of the film which is not so in-character. When rating movies such as Almighty Thor, I try to compare it to its Mock-Buster brethren rather than the "blockbusters" from which they take their inspiration.  Not bad Asylum!
