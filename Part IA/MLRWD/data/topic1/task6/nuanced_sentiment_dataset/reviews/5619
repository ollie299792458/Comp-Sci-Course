The original movie that this film remakes wasn't really all that great of a movie.  That's probably why a generation of filmmakers saw it and said "I can do this, but better."  Well, Miike did it, and he did do it better than the original.  He deserves credit for adding a unique touch to a thought-to-be dead genre of film.

If you like either westerns or offbeat Japanese stuff, you'll like the aesthetic of the movie.  The strokes of Japanese culture painted across the pseudo-itialian set make it unique visually.

If you've seen the original film, you'll get a bit more of a kick out of it than today's youth, but not much.

That's about where the joy of the film ends.  At no moment in the film will you really worry about what's going to happen next.  I laughed at 2 jokes, one verbal and one visual.  I was impressed with the final 30 seconds of fighting in the film.

It didn't leave a sour taste in my mouth, and it wasn't particularly bad, but I didn't think that it was worth going out of my way to buy either.  I re-sold my copy.  Worth 1 viewing.
