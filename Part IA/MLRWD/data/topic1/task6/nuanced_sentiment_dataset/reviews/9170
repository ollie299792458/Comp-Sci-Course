After finding a copy of the animated version of The Phantom of the Opera, I still felt in the mood to watch other Phantom-themed movies. I can't say I'm a phanatic, but anything with a tormented disfigured person seems to get me. I stumbled upon The Phantom of the Paradise. I read up on it and thought, "What the heck?"

After watching it tonight I have simply determined it to be a definite cult film. I've seen my share of cults, and it says cult all over it in my book. Since it was done in the 70s, I cannot say I was into the music and the era's style was really hard for me to get used to.

It has potential though. If it were ever remade, given more up-to-date tunes and had better acting that would actually move my emotions... Yeah.

I didn't receive a feel for the setting, the characters, anything. All through it, I thought, "This could be so much better if it was revamped." But, hey, this movie came out around a decade before I even existed.

For me, it was just another movie. I don't feel like I wasted an hour and a half of my life like some people complain, but I do think it was an okay watch-once movie that could really have been something I'd enjoy better if worked on harder, better or in a later decade or so.

All in all, my views on it are the following:
It is made for cult status.
Die hard Phantom of the Opera phans might add it to their collection.
Some might go nostalgia or are 70s fans.

Vote from very bad, bad, okay, good to very good...
I give it an okay.
