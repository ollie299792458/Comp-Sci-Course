One of the best anmaited Batman movies, Mask of the Phantasm brings history to the characters like no other movie has. It begins with Bruce Wayne foiling some robber, but he they weren't afriad of him, so he tries to come up with a way to do that. He goes through alot of ways to do this too. He just dosen't come up the bat first off. But along the way he meets the lovely Andre Beoument, and falls in love. He then tries to get our of the vow he made to his parent's to stop crime. But she leaves him and he finds the cave under his house and comes up with the Batman persona. Fast foward to the present and we see Ms. Beoumont comming back into town, a Phantasm killing mob members, Batman taking the blam and The Joker blowing up have the city. With out a dought a buy. I bought this when it first came out on VHS and it came with the graphic novel adaptation. If you can find that it's intresting to see how them compare. All the actors from the TV series are here, with Mark Hamill giveing the best performance of his life as The Joker. The only person who can best Jack Nickleson in the role.
