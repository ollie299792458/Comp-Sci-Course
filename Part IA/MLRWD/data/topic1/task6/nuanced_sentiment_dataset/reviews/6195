It's been a while since I've read Chuck Palahniuk's "Choke," but based on what I remember, the movie seems pretty faithful in both tone and plot.  Like most of Palahniuk's work, I found "Choke" entertaining, if a little thin on character and story, and I feel the same about the film.  As a first-time director, Clark Gregg does a good job of translating the book to the screen, bringing it to life rather than just reenacting it.  The only time he somewhat falters is toward the end with two climactic scenes involving pudding and poo.  I was both surprised and disappointed that these scenes were kept intact.  They worked in the book, but even as I read them, I thought they would be too off-the-wall to work in a film, and I was right.  They just seemed odd and lacked the emotional punch that they had in the novel.

"Fight Club" is another of Palahniuk's books that I thought was merely enjoyable, but David Fincher pumped it full of style and energy, taking a decent book and turning it into an unforgettable film.  I can't help but wonder if "Choke" could have also been pushed to greatness if a more experienced director had handled the material.

Bottom line: Chuck Palahniuk fans will be satisfied, but probably not blown away.  Those who haven't read the book might find the film mediocre and unsatisfying.
