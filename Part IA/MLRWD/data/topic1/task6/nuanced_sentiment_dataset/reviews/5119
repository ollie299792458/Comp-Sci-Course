First of all, I love Donnie Yen. The man is talented enough to have convincingly stood up against Jet Li in 'Hero', and he has the ability to hold a staring role.

Second, 'Kill Zone' is a horrible movie. It's strange how such a simple premise as "cops investigate mob boss" can be executed so poorly in this day-and-age. The main issue is that the protagonists are all horrible people. They falsify evidence, beat witnesses to support their claims, murder suspects, steal money, and love every second of it. And rather than being antiheros, we're meant to believe that these are our noble heroes

Sammo Hung's character is far more interesting and compassionate, and his story of juggling his life as a brutal mafioso with his wife and newborn son is by far the best part of the movie.

However, what everyone wants to see is Donnie Yen. Well, he isn't in it. About 20 minutes in, Donnie just comes out of nowhere to join the team, and then all but vanishes until a little over the hour mark. His fights are very good, and are iconic of his style, but there are only a grand total of four in the whole movie, and only two that are more than 30 seconds long. Really, just look up the fight clips on the internet, and avoid this horribly cliched and botched movie.
