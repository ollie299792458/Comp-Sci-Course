The strange part is, that I actually tried to like this movie. I'm a big fan of Oliver Stone's work. He picks the most exciting and intelligent subject matters to tackle. You don't have to agree with the man's politics or artistic psychology to like his movies. His movies have helped to open the hearts and minds of audiences to events,subjects, and themes that  would normally go unnoticed or unheard of. Even if you don't agree with his opinions on those things, if he made you want to find out about those things for yourself, mission accomplished. So I tried my best to see what he saw in this absurd and excessively violent script. I watched the movie like five times (twice with Oliver Stone's commentary), and I still failed to see his fascination with it. The characters and events in this movie are as unpleasant and offensive as hell! There's not even a real political,social, or moral message to justify all this sadism and carnage. What was Stone trying to say? That deep down everyone is just as violent and depraved as Mickey and Mallorey? The fact that I hated this movie proves that theory false. I took no pleasure in the movie's savage violence. It was tasteless and completely pointless. What else could he be trying to say? That the media is responsible for creating and glorifying mass-murderers? Well if it does, then this movie is no better than the media it attacks. Oliver Stone practically makes Mickey and Mallorey out to be heroes! He even gives them a happily ever after ending! I think someone should tell Mr. Stone to not go pointing the finger of accusation at anyone or anything until he reflects on his own actions to see if he is really any better than the people and institutions he's attacking. He really fumbled the ball with this artistic disaster. All the more sad, because the guy that made JFK,Nixon,Alexander Revisited,Born on the Fourth of July,Wall Street,Talk Radio,Any Given Sunday,Platoon, and World Trade Center should have known better!
