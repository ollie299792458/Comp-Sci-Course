This is a well-made low budget virus movie which looks and feels like a much larger budget film. Chris Pine (destined for great things in Star Trek) does a sound job in the lead role with an excellent supporting cast.

Suprisingly well filmed, the script & story are solid. We witness the journey of 4 survivors across the US heading towards an almost mythical beach location. Everywhere they find the dead & the desperate. The journey brings some hard decisions & one strength of the film is that the characters refuse to fall into the classic good or bad category. As things get desperate, the thin line disappears.....what's right & wrong anyway when the world is dying..

I can't understand some of the very negative reviews here. This is a solid post-apoc film. It's not going to win any prizes but it's a realistic & gritty portrayal of the 'end times'.

Expect few special effects apart from grisly corpses...this is more of a sci-fi/viral horror than a slasher or zombie flick.

I really enjoyed it & think it deserves better recognition.
