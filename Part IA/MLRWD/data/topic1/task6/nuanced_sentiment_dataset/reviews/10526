Ok, I hope you read my review first because I saw some reviews that said this movie was the best thing since receiving oral sex.  I will give you the scoop on this movie - the true scoop.
  This movie truly starts O.K. if you like wild Hong Kong action in the tradition set forth by people like (but not limited too) John Woo and Ang Lee.  I thought that this first scene would continue on until the end of the movie (which would have been fine by me had they thrown in a gratuitous sex scene to give you a breather from the action every now and then) but to my disdain it did not.  The movie slowed way down.
  Now I may have missed something in the story line that was interesting, but I don't think that was the case.  Some kind of character development does take place, but not enough for me to think that I needed to hit the pause button while I go to the bathroom (for a number 2).  I other words you won't miss much if you skip 20 minutes or so during the middle of the movie.  
  The ending - don't worry I won't give it away - was an odd event.  I did feel my spine tingle in anticipation of the final action sequence.  The action portion of this finale was up there with the best of them.  You will have to re evaluate your thoughts on the movie after you see this because the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  If you thought Dusk 'til Dawn took a fast flip flop of plots this ending will leave a spinning feeling in your head for at least an hour.  Had this ending been on another movie where the plot had something to do with it, it would have been great. Even though you walk away shaking your head, you also come away with a feeling that the ending was great on some weird level - maybe the primal level where we all find violence and needless destruction interesting and a worth-while cause in life.
I am sure the followers of the movie will disagree:
This movie was an exercise in how to make a great ending suck.
