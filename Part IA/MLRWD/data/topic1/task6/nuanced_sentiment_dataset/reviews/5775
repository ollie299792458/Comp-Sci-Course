This is nothing more than a film about a guy named Beethoven who happened to live at the same time and in the same place as the composer. Please don't let this movie be the source of your image of the great composer. The "Beethoven" in this film is a characature of the real man. It's obvious that historical fact wasn't a concern while making this movie. The writer and director had a story that they wanted to tell and never worried once about the truth of their story. If Beethoven were alive today he would have excellent grounds for a lawsuit. I recommend "Beethoven Lives Upstairs", while based on a fictional encounter between Beethoven and a young boy, at least serves as portrait of the composer consistent with historical accounts.  
At least the film Amadeus had a good literary excuse for the liscense it took with Mozart's life. Not this film.
I recommend a good book or two on the composer instead. "Thayer's Life of Beethoven" and another book, whose title escapes me, but something along the lines of "Beethoven, recollections by his contemporaries (published by Dover books). Pass on this movie !!!
