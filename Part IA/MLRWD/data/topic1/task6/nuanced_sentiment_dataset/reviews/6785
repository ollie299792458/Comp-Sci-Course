Regarding TB Season 4...mmmm...it's watchable and had all of the right elements to be a great season but...uh...it was like a soda that had been shaken to much before consumption.

There were many subplots being explored and it came across as TB trying to capture/retain viewers that may normally keep up with Vamp Diaries or Twlight. The actress who played the antagonist of the season (Marny/Antonia)was STELLAR and well developed but the writing staff failed to fully utilize her prowess as a formidable threat. The writing and plot twists for both MaryAnne and Russell Edgington were captivating but Marny just came across and a mid-level wiccan that just got lost in her quest for purpose. Perhaps, that's the genius in the writing as Marny was only human whereas MaryAnne and Russell were technically supernatural beings. It was just disappointing to see her accumulate the power to inflict massive damage yet most of it was underutilized. It was like having all of your friends gather during the 4th to watch a firework that only fizzles out. :(

If you are a TB diehard and you haven't seen this season; I'd still recommend watching it. You'll enjoy the same TB special effects, vamp antics, quirky comic relief, and Southern sazz the series is known for!
