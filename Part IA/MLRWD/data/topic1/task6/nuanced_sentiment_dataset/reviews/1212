After watching Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning, my brother and I spoke on the phone to compare thoughts.  We both agree that, on it's own, The Beginning is not a bad horror flick, we also agree that in the Ginger Snaps line of movies, it doesn't fit.  The writing was the most disappointing part... especially Ginger's line toward the beginning of the movie "We haven't lost anything Brigitte, it's lost us."  After hearing that, we both knew right away it was all going to be downhill from there.  The addition of so many new characters seemed to make it difficult for the writers to come up with good lines for everyone.  The hair stilist however, did a wonderful job on Ginger and Brigitte's locks, and their costumes were nice.  The most redeeming scene, in the eyes of my brother and I, was when Ginger comes back to the fort to claim Brigitte and she has brought with her all the werewolves.  Standing in the entrance to the fort, while the werewolves pass under her raised arms, ginger appears so beautiful and powerful.  Finally, Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle are the only two competent actors in the movie and when compared to the first two Ginger Snaps movies: The Beginning fails miserably.
