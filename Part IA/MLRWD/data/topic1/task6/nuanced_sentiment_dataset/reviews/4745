Disney's "The Rookie," was a true story based on the life of Jimmy Morris who had inspired to play professional baseball since he was five. Jimmy had always played in little leagues despite the instability of his life as his dad was in the military and they had to move constantly. Finally, they settled down in West Texas. Unfortunately for Jimmy, baseball was not popular at all in that place as football was the main interest of the locals.

From that, the movie soon jumped to the current time whereby Jimmy was the high school science teacher as well as baseball coach. Jimmy had a supportive wife, and three children. His eldest child, Hunter was also very much interested in baseball and looked up to his father as his role model. The high school baseball team that Jimmy was coaching was losing constantly and for the previous two years, they had only won one game in each of the year. Soon, the coach and the players made a bet; if they win the district championship game, their coach should go for a tryout. Sure enough, the team won every game in that season, including the district championship and Jimmy went for a tryout. The rest was history.

I really enjoy the movie a lot as it's extremely inspirational. It deals with a man's dream and the moral of the story is that, no matter how old you are, it's not too late to make your dream come true. In addition to that, the movie also dealt with relationships; the hostile relationship between Jimmy and his father, the relationship between Jimmy and his wife, which was very moving as well as the relationship between Jimmy and his son, Hunter. On top of that, I enjoy the extras that came with the DVD, particularly "The Inspirational Story," whereby we get to meet the real Jimmy Morris, his mother as well as the producers and screenwriter of the movie. It helps to gain a deeper understanding of the movie and just Jimmy himself. A highly recommended movie!
