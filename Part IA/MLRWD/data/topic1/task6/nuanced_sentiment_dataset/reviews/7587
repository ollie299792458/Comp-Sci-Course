this man may very well be the grand interpreter of the mass consciousness of the dumb half of the united states. on top of that, it's brutally unfunny. his set on the blue collar comedy tour seems mercifully short and might as well be "citizen kane" compared to this gala of idiocy. comedy this dangerously insipid, brain-dead, and not to mention totally unfunny should be outlawed. no one is as dumb as larry the cable guy professes to be; true. however, everyone i know who comes close votes republican. what does that mean? who cares. now click "no" and tell me my review wasn't helpful. sorry, but if you like larry the cable guy in the first place i think you're most likely beyond help.

all told, if you're into the mean-spirited rantings of an inbred jackass on the mentally challenged, gloriously naive and simplistic views on politics, ignorant critiques of immigrants, or banal and crude sexist humor then be my guest and lose a few brain cells while you're at it. it's not like you were using them anyway. this guy should have headlined the republican national convention; he would have killed.

and before you call me a sissy or a "girly man" for not finding this dolt hilarious like california cretin already did, i can definately deal with gay bashing and racist humor. i love south park, family guy, and chappelle's show; all of which have employed all of those comedic elements in one way or another. however, those shows are satiric in nature and avoid rolling in their own molasses-thick vitriol, unlike ol' larry. i've lived in the south all my life and his hometown is a day trip away...as such i think i can offer my opinion with much more authenticity.

my review of the blue collar comedy tour goes much deeper into why i can't stand this guy.
