Benjamin Bratt stars as Miguel Pinero, a Nuyorican poet-playwright and habitual criminal who is credited as a seminal influence on East Coast hip-hop and boriqueno salsa culture.  The acting throughout is excellent, but the episodic, disconnected narrative and style-heavy editing ultimately undercut the film.  It's not simply that the presentation is nonlinear; rather, it's that the film is ineffective at explaining Pinero's relationships to his friends, lovers and his art, all of which are hazily outlined, and difficult to care about.  The poet's triumphs and failings abruptly emerge then melt away, as the director and editor try to infuse their film with the same intensity and explosive, rhythmic charisma as its subject.  They also seem to assume a high level of audience familiarity with the Pinero's work, and thus fail to frame him as effectively as similar artist bioflicks such as "Basquiat" and "Before Night Falls," which more clearly defined their subjects.  This probably is a brilliant film, but I found myself irritated that I had to work so hard to maintain my interest, and while I found the performances magnetic and absorbing, many other aspects were irritating and pretentious.
