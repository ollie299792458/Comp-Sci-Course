I rated a 1 star because of her horrible personality and because of her show. Paris Hilton is a snob, she is a racist bigot who cares about nothing but the Manola Blaniks on her feet. She had the nerve to call two African American men "Stupid Nigg**s". She is a horrible person who puts on a front for the media and fans. I hope her show gets cancelled for this incident. Today in this day of age, stars lose endorsement deals just for speaking their mind about politics, Janet Jackson has had to apologize and may even have to pay a fine for the accident that happen on live television. In that respect I think Paris Hilton will have to do the same thing. She will have to reconcile what she has said one way or the other. She has to understand that, behavior in that sort ins't acceptable. I am asking all who read this to help take a stand for right and wrong. If you still choose to buy her this DVD I hope that you know that you are only supporting a selfish, rich girl who has absolutely no morals.
