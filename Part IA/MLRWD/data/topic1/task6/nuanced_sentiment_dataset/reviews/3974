The story has enough promise: A zoologist wants to return a captive gorilla to Africa.  Along the way his expedition gets taken over by a communications expert (or is she?), runs into an international war, hostile wildlife, etc.  While there's enough action, the script and story suffers.  Cases in point:
1) The gorilla uses a special glove that translates sign language into spoken words.  Unfortunately there's only one glove and you can't communicate sign language using only one hand.  Also, the gorilla (or, the performer, as the case may be) just basically waves their hand about.  One gesture means about ten different words.
2)  The special effects were produced by Stan Winston.  If you can't get ILM, Stan is the next best thing.  But he could have done better.  The gorillas aren't very convincing.  And the matte work looks like it was done twenty years ago.
3)  Many attempts at humor in the script just don't fit in with the general script.  It's as if the adapter threw one-liners in haphazardly to lighten everything up.
If this movie peaks your interest, definitely rent it first.
