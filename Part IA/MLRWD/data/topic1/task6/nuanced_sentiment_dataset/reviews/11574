In many respects this is art house depression porn at its worst. This movie has a wonderful cast wasted on a contrived mess of a script. Too many forced or contrived scenes manufactured to demonstrate the sheer hopelessness of our educational system. At times scenes were so contrived they seemed right out of an amateur art house stage play. This is a shameful over-saturation of events that seem wholly unrealistic as presented. Shameful because I've witnessed or been aware of my fair share of depressing events in high school, hostage situations, petty rivalries, fights, hostility, snobbery, clicks, drugs, rapes, a system that tends to the needs of either the gifted or severely challenged but leaves the vast middle population adrift.  My experiences were 30 years ago at what was supposed to be one of the best public high schools in the country.  But you can't compress so many separate events into a two hour movie and expect to have any real perspective on reality, just the magnified view we see in the media.
