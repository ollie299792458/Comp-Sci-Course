By any normal standard, this is a terrific movie.  The two lead actresses are brilliant; production, makeup and costumes are gorgeous, the scenery is the best I've seen since 'Lawrence of Arabia', and several exquisite moments in the film rival the best of Kubrick, Godard, and Stillman.
This is a Hal Hartley film though, and it doesn't get judged by any normal standard.  Fact is, after 'Unbelievable Truth', 'Trust', 'Simple Men', `Amateur', `Book of Life', and 'Henry Fool', a Hal Hartley movie is expected to offer breathtaking, unbelievably distilled plot, dialog and wit, hilariously deadpan philosophizing and commentary, and characters that snap to your attention with their uncompromising honesty, honor, and relevance.  And compared with Hartley's masterpieces, 'No Such Thing' just doesn't deliver.  Having a reasonable budget and a truly professional crew for the first time let Hartley make his movie efficiently, but the late-night beer-and-honing sessions that were part of how the earlier movies achieved their brilliance never happened here.  This movie got made from his rough draft, smoothly and professionally and just as it was, and before he could even do anything about it.  Buy the other films first, this is for fans only.
