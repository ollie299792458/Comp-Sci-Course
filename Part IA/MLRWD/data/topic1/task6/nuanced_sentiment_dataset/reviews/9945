This struck me as a sick joke. There is utterly no rational for a release this tawdry. The images are soft and look as if they came from a VHS master. Compared to other releases from the same general period (e.g. "Casablanca") this hardly qualifies as high definition. It is more like no definition. I couldn't watch past the first several minutes, so I can't really confirm that it doesn't improve as the film progresses, but I doubt that greatly. A real waste of money. Stick to whatever format you have as this release will not be an eye opener.

An update to my review posted on January 25:  I've noted that several customers had written some positive reviews about the Anchor Bay release of this title. In many cases it was deemed superior to the Criterion release of "Notorious", this despite the fact that Criterion is considered the Rolls Royce of home video producers. I don't own the Criterion release, but I do have the Anchor Bay and I've just checked it out. It is superior to this Blu-Ray release in every way, with solid contrasts, deep blacks and image acuity. Unfortunately, I can't return my Blu-Ray fiasco to Amazon since it has been opened and played, but I will give it away to a Blu-Ray user friend, (though with friends like that, who needs enemies?). When I want to watch "Notorious", Anchor Bay will provide the viewing experience.
