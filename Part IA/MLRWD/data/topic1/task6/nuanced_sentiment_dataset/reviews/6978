Like other reviewers I saw the Reality show live (5 times), so the Reality Tour DVD is more of a souvenir of the experience than anything else.

His performance with the band is nothing short of brilliant.  Lots of great song choices, enough hits for casual fans and plenty of rarities for hardcore listeners as well.  One gets a great sense of the depth of Mr. Bowie's writing over his 40-year career.

Unfortunately, the editing of the DVD is pretentious and too trendy.  Quick cuts, shaky cameras, slow-mo, and other visual effects only serve to distract from the great performance happening on stage.  Like every trend (remember the psychedelic "amoeba" projections of the late '60s?), this will look extrememly dated within a short period of time.  Ironic, since Mr. Bowie and his music is anything but!

At least Tony Visconti's 5.1 sound mix is top notch.  You can close your eyes when the visuals become too irritating and just enjoy the sound recording.

I also was really hoping for more coverage of the video screens behind and above the stage, one of the highlights of the live show.  Mr. Bowie always uses video in new and inventive ways, but you wouldn't know it from this DVD because you barely get a glimpse of anything other than closeups of Bowie's face.  That's certainly easy to look at but more shots of the band working their magic would have added to the overall concert experience.  It looks more like a music video now.

Overall, a great tour worth watching on this DVD (especially at the cheap price), but if you want to know what it was like to be there, look for one of the bootlegs (Mohegan Sun, for example).  I'll be watching the boots more often than this official release.
