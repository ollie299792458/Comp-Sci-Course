Overall I enjoyed the film, and kudos to Forest Whitaker for his portrayal of Idi Amin.  I had two problems with this film:  First, the story is more about Dr. Garrigan that it is about Idi Amin, so I question the awarding of Best Actor to Forest Whitaker.  However, Idi Amin is so central to the story that it would be implausible to award Best Supporting Actor instead.  The second problem I have is in the transition of Dr. Garrigan from spoiled right hand man to his realization of the horrors committed by Amin against his own people.  This took place in one scene, when the man from the British Consulate showed Dr. Garrigan the photos of the murdered citizens.  Until this point, the audience only saw mild imperfections in Amin, as opposed to gradually being introduced to his brutality through the eyes of Dr. Garrigan.  I believe the script to be lacking in continuity in the way it told us the story.  On another note, the excellent cinematography and music both painted a realistic picture of life in Uganda.
