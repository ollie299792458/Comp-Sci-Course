It's funny I don't like cats, but I do love this movie.  It is an adorable tale of a two cats and adventure.  A millionaire leaves her inheritance to her cat, Duchess and her kittens, and the greedy butler decides he wants the money so he kidnaps Duchess.  An alley cat, Thomas O'Malley, and his friends jump in to save the day.  There are fun songs, adorable kittens, and just mischief in this movie.  It is a classic Disney movie and makes me laugh everytime I see it.  It actually reminds me of 101 Dalmations but with cats!

With the new Blu-ray edition you both the DVD and a Blu-ray disc, which I love because I keep the DVD in the car and Blu-ray in our family room.  The animation and sound have been remastered to update the movie, but it still has the classic animation from when it was originally released in the 1970.  There are also lots of Bonus Features available on the discs, which we haven't even had a chance to check them all out.  Overall, this is a great Blu-ray/DVD set to add to your collection!
