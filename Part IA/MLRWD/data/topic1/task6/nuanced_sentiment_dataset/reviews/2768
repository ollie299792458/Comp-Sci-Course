Now, I may not be the best critic in the world, but i've seen better movies than this while having a bowel movement. I love Bow wow very much but WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS??? you could tell that a white man wrote this s***. The music was great but that was it. These boys, Nick cannon, Bow wow and all the other little boys did not know what went on in the 70's and neither did the director. It wasn't funny and the skate moves were so wack.

  Bow wow looks like a monkey with all of his hair cut off, Nick cannon looks like a played-out pimp with his "Stylish outfit" Mike epps just looks freaky and Charlie Murphy needs to take his dark ass to a tanning salon. He get tanned so bad that he'll end up white (just joking).

  If you didn't see it already, don't see it. You'd have more fun watching a sidney Poiter film if you must  see a 70's movie.

  Any way, Bow wow isn't a good actor. he should stick with singing before he gets booed off the stage for his crappy work.
