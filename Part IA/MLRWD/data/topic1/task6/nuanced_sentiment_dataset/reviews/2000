I remember watching the ads from for this film and thinking, "What a piece of crap."

Despite this, and starved of an intake of cinematic vampires, I decided to go along on my birthday last year and hope for some redemptive value to it.

Funnily enough, my initial instinct proved correct. In fact, the film actually managed to be *worse* than what I expected from it.

Its opening sequence alone warns you off pretty quickly - we are "treated" to one of the - surprisingly worst - portrayals of Dracula I have ever seen. Very odd that it was delivered by the normally rather capable Richard Roxburgh. His moments of fury just make you want to laugh.

We also have an Incredible Hulk-like Mr. Hyde, culled from the interpretation featured in "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen." The character is rather ludacris - helped by the fact that he also smokes...giant cigars.

Frankenstein's monster is no better: he has a sort of glow-in-the-dark fishbowl in his skull in which his brain resides, barely covered by his scalp...which unfortunately tends to slip off once in a while.

The plot is a monster mash that nearly exhausts Universal's canon of monsters, and wastes any potential they might have had for carrying the story.

Still, the sappy part of me did feel *something* for the tragic, "Ghost" inspired ending.

Not much else to recommend on it, though.
