I'm a 36-year-old male who owns every DVD of the 1992 Batman: The Animated Series, as well as every other Bruce Timm / Paul Dini animated superhero production.  So, I guess that means I'm required to HATE the new animated Batman movie and series?  Hell with that.  Director Michael Goguen and his talented team have made a very exciting and visually stunning movie that defies expectations.  Batman vs. Dracula may sound like an odd premise, but they really make it work.  On top of the slick and dynamic animation, they create a story that is scary and intense while keeping itself rooted in the level of reality we've seen in Gotham City (check out the DVD extras with science vs. superstition documentary).  They've even kept it watchable for children.  My 3-year-old daughter adores the movie and I don't feel guilty showing it to her since (little spoiler ahead) The Batman cures the vampire victims near the climactic ending.  I'm not a plant, just a middle manager living in Florida, but I wanted The Batman team to know they're doing a good job from someone in the demographic who is most critical of their work.  I adore the Bruce Timm Gotham Knights-style animated series and would love a lot more of it (JLU nothwithstanding) but Goguen, Capizzi, Romano, and company are doing a great job and I'll be getting all their DVD sets to put on the shelf with The Animated Series from the 1990's.
