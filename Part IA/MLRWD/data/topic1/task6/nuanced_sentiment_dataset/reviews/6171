Though having had a lukewarm reception in Japan, director Mamoru Oshii's film adaptation of Masamune Shirow's manga was hailed in America as one of the most groundbreaking animated movies of its time and has made anime itself a staple in mainstream pop culture.  But whether the relentlessly hyped "Ghost in the Shell" still maintains its beauty rests in the eye of the beholder.

In a world where technology dictates everyday life but fails to erase nations and ethnic groups, the agents of Section 9, a secret organization, are on the hunt for the Puppet Master, a mysterious hacker infiltrating the digitized brains of government officials.  As "Major" Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg soldier, delves deeper into the mystery, what she finds leads her to question her own existence, as well as the bond between man and machine.

Among the first films to use traditional cel animation with computer animation the visuals, while nothing new to most of us, were quite a feat in the film's heyday.  From the creation of the Major's cybernetic body to her wandering through the inner-city streets, the results simply speak for themselves.  As for the story, one of political intrigue, espionage and spirituality, is actually simple to follow once you get pass all that jargon.  Like the manga, eye candy is also prevalent here; since Major's body is completely prosthetic, she doesn't seem to mind showing off all that (fake) skin.  But if anything complements the film to perfection, it's the soundtrack composed by Kenji Kawai, featuring a haunting Japanese wedding song which goes well with the image of the "marriage" of man and machine.  The DVD itself features interviews, credits and an English trailer.
