If you loved the film "Juno" - which is from the same writer and director, you'll love "Young Adult" but the rest of us non-hipsters will be scratching our heads and kicking ourselves for wasting our money. It's about a woman who writes young adult novels, and goes back to her hometown in a funk and tries to seduce her old high school boyfriend, now with kids and a wife. She is an annoying, snarky character, much like we've seen in Cody's other films. I won't spoil it for you, but the characters are dull and lifeless. The worst thing a movie can ever be in my opinion, is boring and this film committed that. This film was beyond atrocious. Everything Diablo Cody does is trying too hard and this is displayed in this movie, canvased on-frame in just about every scene. Look at the pink cover trying to look like a book! How ironic since the character writes young adult novels! Please. It's practically JUNO II. I would have liked to have seen a warning like this before I actually watched the film. 1/10 stars, avoid.
