There were many things I did and did not like about this documentary regarding ageism, women, and the double standard in Hollywood.  I remember reading an interview with Susan Anspach about ten or fifteen years ago complaining about parts drying up for women her age, yet the male actors she acted with at the start of her career were still going strong.  It was terrific to see Theresa Russell again, a wonderful and beautiful actress who never got a really big break.  Far and away Whoopi Goldberg was the strongest and most honest of all the interviewees, but since her career was never based on her looks, primarily on talent, I'm not sure that the challenge of ageism in Hollywood affects her as much.  My main complaint is that already this documentary seems dated and why not also reach out and include actresses who came before these leading ladies and also faced age discrimination and on a much broader scale.  Elizabeth Taylor and  Debbie Reynolds from the 1950's, some of the great actresses of the 1940's.  They aren't all dead and I believe that would have made this film stronger and packed a harder punch.
