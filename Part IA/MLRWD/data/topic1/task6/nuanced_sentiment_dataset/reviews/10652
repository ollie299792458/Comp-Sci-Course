This is a fantastic war movie. I wish someone would use the computer graphics to fix up the tanks to make them more authentic and call it "Attack revisted" or something. The actoring is with out par. I really know people with personalities like these.

This movie has so many good points that alot of others lack. Alot of war movies the enemy soldiers don't even bother to hide or duck. Its pretty laughable when that happens. I suppose they are just actors and don't know any better. The enemy are just so stupid they run out of a perfectly good hiding spaces to be shot on cue. I wish movie directors would play paint ball shoot ups and see how after a while people learn how to move around because paint balls hurt. You make use of any cover you have. I dont expect the war movies to teach military tactics or really even want to see them. In this movie its good that the soldiers plan and then worry that they don't have any cover. You would think Band of brothers ( band of actors) who go for a walk in the park while in france would of learned from previous movies.
