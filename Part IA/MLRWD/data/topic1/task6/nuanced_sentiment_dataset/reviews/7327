As I was thinking about what to write on the review, I realized the glasses of the "bad guy" are modern-style. Ie, this movie takes place in the 70s but his frames weren't thick plastic or the lenses didn't seem to be large plastic lenses (compare to the Superman I Clark Kent image of him wearing his glasses).  That's not a complaint but for some reason I thought I'd mention it for trivia or something.

I thought this movie might have a tearjerker ending, but I went through with no problems.  In fact, the ending seemed kind of anti-climactic, not the typical ending that a movie that presents a mystery might end with.  Especially when the movie has a girl who can see dead people, but the fact that her ability didn't affect the movie's progress makes me wonder why it was important to have this character in the movie.  Perhaps the book goes into better detail and spends more time with her skills.

The other strange thing in this movie is that, as several people experience some kind of supernatural moment, none of them freak out.  The little brother mentions several times about seeing his dead sister, and the adults in the house don't even correct him or try to find out if it's true.  The dad and boyfriend-interest see things that should surprise or shock them at least, even if they later accept it, but their reactions are different from what I had expected.

I think it's a movie that you could see once, to see what it's about.  I enjoyed the soundtrack.  As a film that seems like it might have some shocking moments or tearjerker parts, I didn't experience either of those emotions.
