The novel Exodus by Leon Uris was by far the better experience.  The 1960 version did not dare to touch upon the deep morality of the book, nor the fact that Ari Ben Canaan was an unsympathetic hero.  Mark Parker was greatly reduced, Dov Landau turned into a cross-section of Holocaustic horror, and Karen Hansen Clement (by far the book's most compelling personality) was glossed over by a platinum blonde with far too few lines to be of interest.  
  Dov Landau's redemption through the arc of Exodus the novel was a tremendous story in and of itself, and perhaps there is too big a story to be made into film... but I pray that it can be done.
  Only one major plot was followed once the boat gets to Palestine (Kitty and Ari), and without the other vibrant relationships to color the story, the power is lessened.
  None of Uris' Thucydidean talents were represented by the limited scope of this version.  There are great and terrible issues in Uris' book, and they were not done justice in this film, I urge you all to read the book.
  Also, check out "Cast a Giant Shadow" with Kirk Douglas and John Wayne for a more compelling story of the Palestine mandate.
