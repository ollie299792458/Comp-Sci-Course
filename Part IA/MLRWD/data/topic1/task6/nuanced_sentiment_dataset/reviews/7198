I looked forward to this DVD release for months and snagged a copy the first day it was available.  My excitement turned to dismay, however, as I began to watch it.  From the moment the birds open the curtains to reveal Cinderella in her bed, it became painfully obvious that Disney truly had "enhanced" the picture to within an inch of its life.  Instead of restoring this beloved classic film, the images have been changed; this is NOT Cinderella as she was first seen in 1950.  Just to make sure I wasn't mistaken, I did a comparison between my parents VHS tape (the original video release) and the DVD.  True, the picture on the DVD was much sharper and the sound was crystal clear, but Cinderella's hair was NEVER that color of yellow, and lines that were part of the original animators drawings, faithfully inked and painted onto the original cells, are no longer visible.  For instance, right at the beginning of the film, when Cinderella turns over in her bed to shut out the sun, there were originally clearly drawn/inked lines in her blanket to show the drapery of the fabric.  Those lines, obvious in the VHS version, are now only visible if you zoom in on them.  Similar editorial decisions on the part of the DVD authors are evident throughout the film, though they decrease in frequency as the film progresses.  It could be said these changes don't matter much, but they truly affect the look of the film.  I often found myself thinking it looked like a Scooby-Doo cartoon, a far cry from any Disney classic.  Although I understand that Disney owns this intellectual property in the legal sense, I don't understand why the've chosen to disrespect that very property, especially in light of their excellent work on Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Bambi, etc.  Hopefully, this is an anomaly and Disney won't continue to offer us disfigured films.
