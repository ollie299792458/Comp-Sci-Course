I was excited to see The Grey.  The premise of the movie sounded awesome and I waited a couple weeks for it to arrive on iTunes as a rental.  When it finally arrived I happily rented it.

The movie was pretty formulaic from start to finish and the actions of the wolves seemed a bit exaggerated to me, not realistic, which took away from the film.  The way each person gets picked off one by one and all of them had or acquired injuries that made them easy kills, it was just too cliche in my opinion.  The movie should've been called "Bad luck strikes repeatedly, then wolves attack."  It's basically a horror movie in the snow.  You can't even get away from the cheap scare cliche with this movie.

Other items that just made it worse...  When you spend 5-10 minutes in freezing water, you're dead.  Instead of immediately building a fire when he got out of the water, Ottway just sat down.  In the next scene he's dry.  The watch with the beacon only seemed to beep when it was given attention by a character (I can't stand the momentary beeping timer/countdown/beacon cliche, it drives me insane).

The movie was predictable from beginning to end and was chock full of cliches.  After muddling through the whole film (plodding through cliche land) and getting to the end, we're left to decide who won, the alpha wolf or Ottway.  How frustrating is that?!

I had high hopes, but I thought it was terrible.  You've seen it before many times, just in a new package.  One positive note... Liam is a great actor and makes you believe in the character.  The rest is forgettable.
