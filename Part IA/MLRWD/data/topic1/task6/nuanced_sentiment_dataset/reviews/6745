My review is just going to focus on the Blu-ray quality of this movie.  The original presentations of A Nightmare on Elm Street, theatrically, on VHS, and DVD, have all been pretty bad.  A lot of the movie takes place in the dark and most of the time everything looked muddy and barely visible.  The Blu-ray version really fixes this and provides tons of shadow detail, nice black levels, and no noise or snow in the dark areas.  The day scenes are also great with nice flesh tones, punchy colors, and crisp detail.  It's like your watching a whole new movie, and for big fans of this movie, this is huge.  The audio also sounds really strong, and you have the option to be a purist and listen to the original soundtrack in it's mono format.  There are some nice extras, but nothing definitive.  Two great commentaries, some alternate endings, and other assorted stuff.  The big thing here is that the audio/visual presentation is absolutely awesome and makes rewatching this classic so much more fun.  Hopefully all of the Wes Craven classics will ultimately get this kind of treatment!
