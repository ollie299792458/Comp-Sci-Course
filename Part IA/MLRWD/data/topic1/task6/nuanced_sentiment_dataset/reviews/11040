I completely agree with those reviewers who give this series top marks for creative content, and just about zero for the quality of the DVD transfer.

Because we've got a region free DVD player and the price was agreeable, I bought a Region 2 disc set. It was released by the BBC itself (or rather, 2 entertain), not by Acorn, and appears to have exactly the same content. For the record: the quality is total crap. Acorn merely passed it on.

It looks and sounds like a deliberate attempt was made to "age" the program. Not that I believe anyone would do that. But it's that bad.

The BBC has a long history of not giving a ding-dong about its own best work after the fact. Kinda weird. At least they didn't completely destroy this one. To me, Alec Guinness is even more of a pleasure to watch here than in TTSS; he brilliantly communicates the new and almost demonic urgency in Smiley without changing his basic nature. The obssessive implacablity of the character becomes an event in itself.

There are also a number of superb one-on-one scenes between Guinness and various other cast members - particularly Bernard Hepton as Toby Esterhase (or whatever his name is at the moment). And a greater variety of characters, also, which was dictated by Le Carr&eacute;'s book.

TTSS is, for the most part, about ponderous public school types. Yes, there are a few exceptions - and it is, start to finish, a brilliant piece of work - but on the whole it's got one tone throughout. In Smiley's People, by contrast, we get to see George in delightfully varied circumstances. I will always like that about it, and will always relish the contrasts between the two productions.
