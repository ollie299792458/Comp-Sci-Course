I noticed that some of the reviews says it wasn't "Christian enough..."

-One thing to remember, is the movie is not based on salvation... It's based on forgiveness and grace. This movie demonstrates on how to love your enemies, how to forgive those who have hurt you, how to give grace when it may not be deserved, etc.

This movie really gives you a good look at what some families go through, in the movie "GraceCard" it talks about drugs, racisim, bitterness, and death of a loved one; among more topics.

This movie handles more then just "loosing a loved one." It handles lossing a loved one, that was murdered. -There's a big difference to loosing someone to cancer vs. getting shot... You know?

In the movie, (don't worry, you find this out in the begining, I'm not giving anything away! ;) Officer McDonald looses his son when an undercover drug deal goes bad. -The suspect in this deal flees the Police and basically runs over Officer McDonald's kid. (It does not show anything)In an event like this, comes along with a great deal of grief, confusion and bitterness.

Officer McDonald was told he was going to be working with a new partner. -A Christian partner. Over the movie his partner eventually get's down to Officer McDonald's heart, and that's where the word "GRACE" blows up in the video!

-It is a very good movie, if there are any LEO's out there wondering "how realistic is the Law-Enforcement half?" -It's pretty good. LEO family and humor is there, and the reality of the calls are okay, you'll notice on a few calls you tell yourself "Umm... That wouldn't happen for real." But for the most part, I'd give the "realness" of the LEO half a 80-90%.

-It's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone!! If you have any other questions, ask me and I'll do my best! :)
