i'm not going to go out and defend the novel source material from it's obvious shortcomings.  These being Grisham's often paper thin characters, pedestrian plotting and occasionally awful character descriptions - Locke must have been described as the most evil looking man ever too many times and in that very language.  The movie lapses further into elementary land.

While Mitch was often a silent partner in the story, at least he wasn't perfect.  Grisham made McDeere very human and never tried to make this brilliant lawyer honest, but the movie goes to agressive pains to make our hero very sympathetic and I think it was a stain on the entire story.  Much is preserved and creatively compressed, Sydney Lumet's direction is deft and Dave Grusin's inspiring music is deeply in search of a better movie, but the Firm on film is still entertaining.  They changed the tone, but surprisingly the story does stay in tact.  I just wish it had more of an edge of humanity.  Mitch cheated his clients, cheated on his wife and cheated his employer - don't try to make this crooked souther lawyer out to be more than a that.  Mitch was crooked, but he was smart and that is why the novel succeeded.  The film is slick, if dated, but it also is painfully neat.
