Warner Brothers did a fantastic job creating these films in a Hi Def format. I am not a huge fan of Batman Forever or Batman and Robin, but the movies are a spectacle to behold. The first Batman is classic, there is no topping "Jaaack" as Joker, sorry Ledger fans, he cannot be compared to Nicholson's talents, nor his movie to the original story of Batman. The Blu Ray disc enhances every detail on the movies so well you will notice things that you have never picked up on before. Ahhh.....the beauty of Blu Ray.

 Amazon priced this set nicely, and the price for the set of movies ($84.00) is fair to me. It equates to $21 a disc which includes all the special features on each disc. Not to mention free two day shipping. If I were shopping for these separately, I would end up driving to every retail chain in town selling Blu Ray discs to find the four because the unpopular Batman movies will be the only ones available. Don't forget to include the fuel cost for driving all over the county and tax on each disc. And you probably will not buy them at $21 a pop.
 Another good thing about this set is the price is not marked up by including a gimmicky "box" or "tin" or whatever the "container of the week" is. This set is bundled in a cool little three piece cardboard sleeve that encases the four discs in their respective Blu Ray cases. It is easy to open and select the movie you choose to watch, and it will display nicely. All in all I feel Warner Brothers did a quality job with this release and Amazon has a price that I will not complain about.
