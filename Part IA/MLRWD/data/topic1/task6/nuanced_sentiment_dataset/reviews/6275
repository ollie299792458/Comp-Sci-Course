Be careful doing this workout! After a month of doing it regularly, my knees and calves were really suffering. Luckily, my husband told me how to align my joints differently so that I could continue without injuring myself (he studied martial arts for 20 years). But THERE IS NO HELP FOR YOUR BODY ALIGNMENT FROM HEMALAYAA!! There is almost no teaching from her at all. "Bend your knees, if you need" is the sum total of her advice. This is my major criticism for this DVD! I have done Pilates and running for three years with no injuries, and this workout nearly had me in trouble, because you can only get so far without help on proper posture, muscle use, breathing, etc. And moves like these dance moves involving prologed use of the same muscle groups have to be done properly or you will just strain yourself. Even since I have corrected my alignment, and have no more pain, I find that the overall effect of the workout is to make me feel tired, and somewhat drained. It is not well-planned exercise, such as Tai Chi or STOTT Pilates, that leaves you feeling better off (even if tired) than when you started. This video is fun for the music, pretty clothing, and bouncy moves, and it will get your heart-rate up, but I would not recommend it as a body-toning exercise (I had better results with toned behind, arms and belly after one week of Pilates and light jogging, than after a month of this video)or even as a healthy heart workout, because the moves are not planned carefully enough to give you an envigorating warm-up or VERY IMPORTANT cool-down. Limited expertise on the part of the video creators, in my opinion! Proceed with caution if you purchase this!
