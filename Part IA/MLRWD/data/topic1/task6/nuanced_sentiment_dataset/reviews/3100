I was a childhood fan of the original series back in the 70s. It was campy, fun and an innocent tv show for kids. This movie made a mockery of the series. It seems like every "TV-Based" movie lately has modern day humor such as poop, fart, urine and sex jokes. The Land of the Lost movie was no exception. I don't ever remember Will talking Rick Marshall into kissing Chaka or Will's mouth next to Chaka's groin while they sleep.

And the movie industry is wondering WHY most of the movie theater seats are empty these days. It's constant sex humor. It's just not funny.

They should've kept it retro and keeping the 3 characters a family just like the series. But no! They have to have Rick and Holly fall in love at the end JUST LIKE A MILLION OTHER MOVIES!

Shame on Sid & Marty Krofft for allowing this movie to be made this way. I know their names were stamped on it as producers but they sold themselves out to the movie studio because I'm sure the studio pressured them to make the move this way.
