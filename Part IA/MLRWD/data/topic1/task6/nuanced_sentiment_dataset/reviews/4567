I was glancing at the other reviews and noticed some reviewers wondering what became of the missing scene in which the audience is asked if they believe in faeries.  The fact of the matter is this scene, which was vital to the original play, was purposely omitted by Walt Disney is his animated version.  In fact, when the Disney version appeared in 1953, many reviewers who were great fans of the Barrie play complained about this, among them, Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, and Herbert Brenon, a British director who made a very popular silent film version of Peter Pan in 1925.  Why would Disney do this?  Crowther speculated that Disney assumed that Americans were more literal minded in 1953 than their British counterparts were in 1904 (when the play was first staged), and so wouldn't buy into all that faerie stuff.  Also, Crowther sardonically added that perhaps Disney was afraid that Americans would find it simply too embarrassing to deal with too much "pixiness."  Go figure.  Anyway, that's the story behind the missing scene.
