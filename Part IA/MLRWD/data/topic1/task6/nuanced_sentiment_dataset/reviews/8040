There is no THE version of this film. Even though many consider the British'European version, "Confidential Report," to be the definative one, that is simply not true. The original release was in Spain with Spanish actors--actors who didn't appear in the English language version--in several key roles.
And, even though it came out years later, Welles has been quoted as liking the American release version, the one on this disc,titled "Mr. Arkadin", better (although it was a best fo two evils situation for him).
Welles was never allowed to complete this film. While he was (endlessly) editing, the film was taken from him by his European backers and completed without his participation (he found out the hard way that Hollywood didn't have a monopoly on raping his art). So there is no definitive Welles version.
"Mr. Arkadin", which we have here on this disc, has a more linear storyline. "Confidential Report" (available on a better-quality VHS than this disc) opens with a "flashback within a flashback" which was obviously imposed on the piece in postproduction. The dubbing here is not just odd, as it is in all of Welles' European productions, which were filmed silent with all sound added in postproduction. In "Report" it is obvious that the actors dubbed in totally different dialoge so that the 2nd flashback would work. Compare the scenes with protagonist VanStratten and crazy old criminal Zouk in "Report" with those in "Arkadin" and you can tell the Arkadin scenes contain the original dialoge, unaltered. So, despite being a few minutes shorter that the available "Report" version, I consider Mr.Arkadin superior in many ways. Too bad it's a crappy print.
In any case, for $5, I think this Arkadin is a good buy, despite the poor picture.
Perhaps Criterion will release a DVD with a 3 major versions: Spanish Arkadin, Confidential Report, and American Arkadin.
Now THAT I'd pay 39.99 for!
