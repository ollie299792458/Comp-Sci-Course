You seen him , you heard him, he is knockiong at your door. Don't open it unless you like flaming Listerine!
I am teasing but this film is a true classic!
For trivia buffs, when the film was released in North America, the scenes with Raymond Burr were edited in to make it more appealing. Notice you never see him with original actors.
I have a warm heart for him because he was from BC Canada, but more significantly &lt;I don't have to drone about him because he became more famous for his Perry Mason role but he was a true gentleman and philanthropist>, this movie made Samuel Z Arkoff stinking rich.
He made B movies part of our culture and he has a biography that I highly recommend! But back to the movie...almost forgot...
THis is by far, in my thoughts, the best &lt;first> Godzilla movie!
It was generously made with high speed photography, making the monster mo ve more slowly . THis cost a hell of a lot of money but this film was taken very seriously.
 The story hints at nuclear devestation and while the dubbing is distracting and far from perfect, that is all moot.
Godzilla is truly King of the Monsters &lt;don't forget this was made 50 years ago before computers> and reigns today! Awesome for the whole family with lights out and sound turned up !!!
