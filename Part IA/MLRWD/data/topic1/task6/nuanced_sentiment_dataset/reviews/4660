In another classic example of RCA/MGM's attempts to give fans only portions of songs and performances, this DVD, while adding new concert footage, also cuts several songs from the original film. Why? You have to feel somewhat insulted by the fact that the DVD version still features a nervous Elvis talking about forgetting the lyrics to "I Just Can't Help Believin'," and then doesn't include the song! It's almost insulting.
We all know DVD is capable of much longer footage, yet this release barely outruns the original. Even songs that are included in the original are cut for this version, such as the shortened and sadly missing "Hut-two-three-four, I learned that in the army" seque in "Polk Salad Annie." They could have included everything here, they simply chose not to. Probably so that a "special, special edition" can be released later, or for a new product named "Elvis Live In Las Vegas," for which we'll all have to shell out another $...
Put this together with the original concert footage, include the original version on Side 2 of the DVD (which they're perfectly capable of doing) and you've got something. But why do that when they figure no one will know the difference?
