What an amazing event that took place in 1980, and what an amazing story.  I was only six years old when the game took place, but was unable to watch it on TV.  The Cold War was still at its height.  I recall as a kid we sometimes played a war type game and usually the imaginary enemy was the Soviets.  I'm sure the kids growing up in the Soviet Union where playing war against the imaginary American enemy too.
This movie shows how Herb Brooks molded this group of young men from different colleges and backgrounds into the US Olympic Hockey Team.  Not just a group of men that would play hockey in the Olympics, but a true Team!  At the same time the movie gives us a since of what political events where taking place, and the low moral that Americans felt at that time.  The action scenes on the rink really made us feel that we are there, not only in the stands watching, but actually on the rink.  They used awesome camera shots.  Although we know the outcome of the game, watching it can put you on the edge of your seat.  And when the final buzzer ends the game, you can really feel the pride and happiness that people at Lake Placid and also people at home watching felt back in 1980.  What a moral boost!
Winning a hockey game can seem very trivial, but this win was something we Americans needed.  The pride and moral boost that it gave us was a very welcome gift.  And maybe, just maybe, this hockey game was what helped start the thaw in the Cold War.  Today the Soviet Union is no more, and Russia can be called a friend.  Maybe this game did have a small role in that.
