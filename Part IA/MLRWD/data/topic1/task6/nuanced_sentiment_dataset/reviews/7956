I have to admit that I picked up this movie mainly based upon the cover art which portrayed it as being an anime that was set in a vivid, beautiful, and imaginative world... and that it was. The scenery within this movie is amazing and the animation pretty darn good. Sadly, beneath the surface the end result is somewhat lackluster. As a couple of reviewers have touched upon already, it's all been done before. Throughout the entire film I could not help but think that it felt a little too much like Nausicaa, Green Legend Ran and Princess Mononoke with a splash of Akira here and there. Adding to this drawback there really is little in the way of character development and the whole thing felt like it went by a little too fast, especially in the major turning point for the main character. A scene which should have at least taken at least 5 to 10 minutes to play out ended in around a minute and a half with little emotion or explanation. By the end of it I honestly felt like I accidentally skipped a chapter of the DVD. Still, this movie does have it good points. As I mentioned, the settings and backgrounds are amazing, the characters a likeable, it has a nice amount of well executed CG and the animation in general was pretty good. Still, this movie could have seriously benefited from an addition 20 minutes of story telling. When all is said and done I'd have to say that unless just looking for a movie that lets you escape to a different world you might want to consider passing this one up until a price drop. I'd say it would be a good buy for around $15 dollars but anything more and you might find yourself wishing you had looked into something else. I personally don't regret buying it, but I wouldn't have minded waiting a while longer to pick up this title.
