This is such a subtle and beautiful film, and subtlety is something I really appreciate in French films. The story doesn't slap you up along side the head with MEANING. There's a lot of important symbolism that helps in understanding Mathieu. Water plays a key role in this, as does the darkness. His family mirrors the emotional fragility inherent in him - it's not about being gay, it's about being human and the things all of us try to hide from ourselves and others because it's easier somehow. The nudity is not gratuitous, and frankly it's not something that would stand out to a European. The scene on the beach is important, it shows just how much C&eacute;dric is feeling Mathieu in every way, so connected and so into what he's experiencing along with him, and then in the next scene is Mathieu's revelation of his true feelings, so unintentional, so unknown even to himself. My feeling is that if you're looking to label this as porn, you can find a way to do that; if you're looking to classify this as another emotionally unsatisfying portrayal of gay relationships, you can do that, too. But it you immerse yourself in the pace, in the quietness of the story and in all of the ways that seemingly meaningless things interlock to create a very palpable, very solid story, perhaps the true nature will stand out.
