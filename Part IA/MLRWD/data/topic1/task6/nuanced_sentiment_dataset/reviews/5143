After watching this movie I was left wondering who the monster was---Hitler-the-failed-artist-misfit or the effete hoity-toity bourgeois art community that was depicted.  If the point of the flick was simple character assassination of Adolf, then it fails by presenting him in such caricature as to be hardly recognizable.  The producers of this movie should have read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006LWEAFW">The Young Hitler I Knew</a> or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081541191X">Hitler in Vienna, 1907-1913: Clues to the Future</a> to flesh out AH's character with some reality.  Instead they create a straw man, buffoon, fool, an utterly untalented artist loser who desperately seeks approval.  Of course, such a one could never have risen to the dizzying heights of power that his real counterpart did.  Except for the tirades and the hair, and of course the later speeches, one would hardly know who was being portrayed.  It would have been far more effective had they sought to present a realistic study of Hitler the young bohemian postcard painter (a period of his life that predates the one falteringly portrayed in the film), showing his early fanaticism and unflinching determination.  But that would have been much harder to pull off without the risk of appearing sympathetic.  Instead, it takes the lazy route and goes for stock moralization and easy answers.

Of course I realize that this is fiction, but when using actual historical characters one should take pains to present them true to life, and not be tempted to rewrite history.  Or else why use them at all?

This movie could have been an interesting study of contrasts, of art versus politics, of art as politics, and is not a total failure in that regard.  As an idea it had promise, and is worth seeing once, but it fell far short of what it could have been.
