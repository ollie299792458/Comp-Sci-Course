First I would like to thank the other critics for finally giving me a way to refer to this type of movie, which I usually detest. Now, the movie- it was Really well done, and most of the time the way it was done didn't keep hitting you in the face.

A lot of the critics talk about the power corrupting the 3 teens.  I don't agree.  The power just gave them more ways to bring out what they had inside already.

Andrew was in an abusive situation, so he was feeling hurt, helpless, angry, and no way to strike back.  The power gave him a way to do that.  Unfortunately, it takes a LONG time for that emotional trauma to heal, and the power was fueling his anger.

Matt, although he seemed popular and outgoing, we start to see that he has a more introspective nature.  When he sees harm to others, he backs away from causing any of it.  And at the end, you can see how much he loves his cousin and tries to help him, but ultimately he acts to save the "world".

Steve I don't feel was affected too much.  He seemed a light-hearted kind of guy, up to pranks and fooling around with stuff, but not intending any harm.  The thing with the car in the parking lot was funny.
