When do I "Press Play to Begin"? In 2001 "Final Fantasy: The Sprits Within" hailed a new era in film making. The CGI world took a giant leap towards the vitual realism we were all expecting to see from "the latest advancement" in technology. We knew that after that, anything was possible. And WETA! Serkis' Gollum came alive and we all pitied Sm&eacute;agol because he was so human, or halfling-ish. Roughnecks: The Starship Troopers Chronicles took that mo-cap edge and brought to the little screen what we just knew could be, one day, brought to fruition on the Big Screen. And I waited 12 years for This?

So the movie opens with an almost direct quote from the Heinlein classic. Almost false advertising. The remainder of the script was more like "Starbucks Troopers: The Napkin Chronicles". I am a diehard fan of Heinlein's original, Paul Verhoeven's Fascist Indictment treatment, and yes, the Audu Paden and company's Roughnecks. I have bought-in to the franchise and drank my fill of the Kool-Aid. In other words, I HAD to see this. Did I HAVE to buy it too? They were all out of Catcher in the Rye...

I give this 3 Stars because it is a worthy effort. It did move the ST Universe story-line along. (Though the Roughnecks already fought one Earth invasion.) It was a nice nod to both the live action and previous CGI versions. And, as bad as most of the dialogue was, it wasn't much worse than "Marauder". Is that a plus? The new team of Troopers carried the weight of their gear as well as could be expected. Good thing the plot was so light. Could you call this a classic too? No, but I read one.
