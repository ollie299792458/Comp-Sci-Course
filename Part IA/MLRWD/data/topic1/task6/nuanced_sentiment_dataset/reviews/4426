This is just bad.  If you are contemplating buying this film on blind faith, I'd recommend renting it first just to make sure you won't want to hang yourself in disgust at the thought of $20 dollars and eighty minutes of your life you will never, ever, ever get back.

Problems with the film, hmmm, where to begin . . .

I do believe it boils down to the studio in this case.  If you give a listen to the commentary track on the DVD you will notice a certain sheepish guilt, as those involved with the film are aware it is dreadful.  But you will also notice recurring references to entire scenes the studio had excised from the film for pacing purposes.  Judging from what is said in the commentary, it sounds like maintaining pacing was preferred to any semblance of a coherent plot and story in the film.  The resulting film was so chopped down that it actually has to have extra-long, slow scrolling credits just to earn "feature" status, since the MPAA has a minimum running time criteria for that designation.

So what you are left with is zero build up and all bang.  Something like, say, "Die Hard" with a demonic tooth fairy playing the role of the heavy in lieu of Eurotrash terrorists.  Of course, that analogy ignores the fact that Die Hard at least had a plot, however simplistic, that was not so burdened with holes what you could strain pasta with it.  Darkness Falls . . . well, it might come in handy if you are making spaghetti for two or three thousand people.

I suspect that if this movie had been allowed to run for another twenty or thirty minutes it might have been much better -- possibly not, but it certainly could not have been worse for a little time to establish a story and build a little suspense and tension.  As it is . . . just dreadful.
