While this film makes some valuable observations and may prove enlightening for some (the reason i gave it two stars instead of one), it is also based on flawed assumptions, spurious logic, and a total re-imagining of history.  A cornerstone of the film is an assertion that poverty began about 500 years ago with European imperialism and expansionism.  It asserts that certain nations grew wealthy and powerful by exploiting the peoples and resources of other lands.  It further asserts that this lead to the creation of slavery and poverty.

While there is a liberal amount of truth in that, it is also a gross distortion of history.  Slavery and exploitation of foreign lands didn't begin 500 years ago.  Nor did poverty begin then.  Poverty was alive and thriving centuries prior, during a period we call the Dark Ages.  But it has been around a lot longer than that.  It was certainly around in Biblical times.  It was around during the Roman Empire.  It was around in the time of the Pharaohs.  It was around during the great Chinese dynasties.  Undoubtedly, poverty has been around since the dawn of civilization, and is likely as old as the human species.  So too for slavery and exploitation of foreign lands.

While i agree that much pain, suffering and exploitation came about as a result of European imperialism, the same can be said of the campaigns of the Vikings, the Romans, the Huns and the Mongolians, to name just a few.  The imperialists didn't have an exclusive on tyranny, nor were they the first.  Nor are they the last.  History is always repeating itself.  The problem of poverty is far older, more complex, and endemic than this film suggests.

Aside from educating viewers about the some of the atrocities of the imperialists, this film really has very little to offer.  Unless you enjoy attempts to promote a philosophical agenda by a distortion of history and spurious reasoning.  I actually agree with much of the filmmaker's agenda.  I just feel it would be more powerful if it were arrived at honestly and accurately.
