Okay.  First, there's nothing scarier than an evil clown.  Just look at Carrot Top.  Frightening.
Clownhouse attempts to exploit that popular fear by giving us three escapees from the mental institution dressed as clowns, terrorizing three young brats.  Casey is really afraid of clowns to begin with.  He has some pretentious explanation at the beginning of the film so I won't go into it.  Let's just say he freaks when he sees them.  His oldest brother is a bully and the middle brother is the understanding, bookish one.  They are left alone on a night that falls somewhere between Friday Oct. 13 and Halloween.  Scary.  After several Halloween-worthy cat-and-mouse moments, Casey must face his fears and beat back the clowns.
If it seems like I'm being overly impudent here, it's because the movie just hasn't aged that well for me.  I remember seeing it on cable about twelve years ago and being scared to death.  Now, I just find myself irritated at the oldest brother and his witty banter with the others.  I also found myself wondering how long it took to do the clown make-up and did one psycho help the other psycho put his on.  Otherwise, how would you know if you got the back of your neck white enough?  Ahem.
This one is a really good one to start with if you want something bloodless and scary, but it doesn't hold up to repeated viewings like Halloween does.
Mild recommendation.
