I don't like to disagree with the friend who lent me the DVD of this movie.  I always appreciate the foreign cinema.  Since I was stationed in Germany for six years with the U.S. Army and had a few German friends who would occasionally visit me, I was always looking for good German-language films.  Belonging to a family of people who appreciate films, I knew the major classics of the German Expressionist period and the Sternberg-Dietrich collaborations, but I needed something newer to keep young German friends interested.

Run Lola Run is very showy, but it lacks depth.  Now, I don't disagree with other people who like this movie very much--the last thing I want is for people to think of me as hostile--but needs something to care about--a reason to exist--where the zippy photography and inter-cut animated segments would ultimately mean something.  Run Lola Run seems to me to be a very shallow film.  Except for this, the film was very good.  The film is successful at adapting a certain aura of contemporary German society, the same side that, like many of us Americans, watch a lot of daytime television; I only intend a deduction.

As always, I recommend the following German films: Rosenstrasse, Das Boot, Wings of Desire, and Faraway so Close.
