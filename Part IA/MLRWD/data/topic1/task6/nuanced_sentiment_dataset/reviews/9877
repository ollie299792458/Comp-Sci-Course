First of all, note that this DVD is underpriced. A few things I can add to the other 5-star comments:  I defy anyone to get past "Che gelida manina" without hitting the back button at least twice.  (8 times for me)  Also, if you have any doubt that David Hobson poured himself completely into his "Rodolfo", then check out the extended curtain call at the end.  He never does seem to compose himself.  Totally believable. (Men, you may not want to let your wife see it.  This guy could steal her heart!) And, delightful to see an attractive Mimi (Cheryl Barker)  Though this charachter was sickly, the background history of the book says she was based on an attractive model.  The higher priced Met version features a normally attactive Teresa Stratas' eyes made up to look quite frightening.  Was it a special Halloween edition?  To believe Rodofo could have fallen in love with HER eyes was impossible.  On the contrary, in this version, Barker masterfully balances the combination of ill health and beauty. And, the appropriately youthful cast doesn't short you at all on voice quality.  The other players were consistently excellent, and lovable.  Like the Lyon version of "Figaro", a great one to get a friend started on opera.  Bravo!
