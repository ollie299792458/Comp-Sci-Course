Wild Things is the story of a high school guidance counselor (Matt Dillion) and the two high school girls that accuse him of rape; one is a rich, spoiled girl (Denise Richards) and the other is a troubled young woman who has spent time in a mental institution (Nerve Campbell).  Dillion hires a sleazy lawyer (Bill Murray) to trial his case and soon holes appear in the girls' accusations.  But is there more to the story?  A cuthroat police officer (Kevin Bacon) seems to think so and begins an investigation that uncovers a story full of surprises.

As I said, the movie starts out optimistically with lies deception and surprises.  Unfortunately, there are too many surprises and two-faced characters than can possibly be contained in the movie.  After the first 45 minutes to hour of the movie, I wanted it to end because it had already used up all of its good material.  But it didn't end; the surprises kept coming but seemed more out of place and the twists later in the movie did not fit well in with the plot.  The movie tries to cover up for this missing story during its ending credits, but this is a bad place to put such needed information because most viewers would simply just turn off the movie after it was done.  Basically, the film went too far with the suspense and plot twists and unfortunately ruined itself at the end.

I have a few more comments about Wild Things.  If you watched this movie to see steamy scenes of Nerve Campbell and Denise Richards, there is one nude scene and a few kissing scenes but that is about it.  Unfortunately, there is also a frontal nude scene of Kevin Bacon there serves no purpose in the movie and lets face it, nobody really wants to see that.

In conclusion, the first half of Wild Things is suspensful and intriguing, but the later half drags on and, in my opinion, poisons the plot.  It is a decent movie, but could be better if more creative planning had gone into writing the story.
