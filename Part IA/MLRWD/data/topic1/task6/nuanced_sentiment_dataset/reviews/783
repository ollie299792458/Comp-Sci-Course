I am ever so greatful to the Director and the actors (and the wonderful tigers that were in the film). This movie was absolutely beautiful. Another great plea to save these magnificant animals from mans evil doings. What I loved is (just as in "The Bear" which was another great movie) that this story is told more through the eyes and feelings of the two tiger brothers. The scenery was just as beautiful. I loved the ending because it was happy as well as educational. Although I find it heartbreaking that only 5,000 remain in the wild and are in serious threat of loss of habitat and (the greatest evil of all) POACHING. Yet, 10,000 are alive in capativity in North America alone. I wish more people would see this movie and write to governments of India, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Russia to save these animals because extinict means forever. I plan on buying this movie once it is released. I would love to hug the director for making such an enlightening movie. Hollywood needs to be making more movies about like "Two Brothers" so it can educate people more about the plight of our animal brothers/sisters.
