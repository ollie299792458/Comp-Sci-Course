Dark City seems to me to sum up an entire universe of sci-fi and third-stream movies in which reality is not what it appears.  This movie brings in influences from Blade Runner (the most obvious influence), Barton Fink (whence the seedy hotel), The City of Lost Children (the "strangers" are VERY similar to the "cyclopes"--I could almost picture their leader saying "j'ai vu un monde qui &eacute;tait un monde de chien!"--and they even use the phrase "lost children" at one point; also, the vials that contain synthesized memories look a lot like the probosces of Marcello's robotic fleas), Brazil (possibly the origin of Dark City's lost-in-time feeling), The Crow (same director, thus a similar direction style), Twelve Monkeys (one man manipulated by a faceless committee...), The Nightmare Before Christmas (Tim Burton likes spirals too), and even to some extent Lost Highway (notably in the cinematic treatment of half-remembered images), although that only came out a year earlier.  There are also hints at earlier things--film noir, Peter Lorre.  So while it's not original, and certainly not perfect, this movie seems to combine all those aspects into a single coherent whole, which is rather impressive. The plot is revealed well, and doesn't have too many holes in it. Certain scenes when John starts to figure out what's going on are really chilling.  And the movie manages to have a happy ending that's not stupid! I couldn't believe it. And of course, the cinematography is beautiful.

I'd also like to mention that the Matrix is very clearly a rip-off of Dark City, using the same basic concept (a group of superior beings that control our perception of reality), a lot of the same imagery (people who don't rely on gravity), and a very similar pre-climactic scene.  The Matrix, however, undermines itself with a lot of pointless fight scenes, truckloads of inconsistencies, revealing everything too soon, and Keanu Reeves.  Dark City is a far better movie.
