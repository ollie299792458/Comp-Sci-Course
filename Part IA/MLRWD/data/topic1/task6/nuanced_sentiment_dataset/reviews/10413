After 17 years since its release I've got to see and own this movie for the very first time.
I liked it a lot, and laughed a lot. If Elvis Presley was a king of R'N'R, Woody Allen has to be a king of American Comedy.
His humour is just hilarious and most of the times you really get confused asking yourself whether you're watching a true
life story or just an imagined one. Anyways this movie is about three sisters: Hannah,Holly,Lee.
An accountant by profession, Elliot, Hannah's husband in a Thanksgiving dinner makes the first moves towards Lee,
his wife's sister. He's in love with her and Hannah's sister happens to feel the same for Elliot as she's sick with her lover.
And Holly...falls in love with Mickey (Woody Allen) a TV producer...who all in a sudden is not able to hear with one ear. The doctor suggests for more tests and he's sick worried after he get's to know that one of the possibilities may be "He has a brain tumor". Hilarious and a must see movie...
