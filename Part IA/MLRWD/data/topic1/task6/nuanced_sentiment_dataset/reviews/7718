I'll keep this brief -  Great sound quality, great multi-camera shots, incredible musicianship, wonderful orchestration!  I loved it!  
I would challange anyone not familiar with YES or only vaguely so to sit and watch this without becoming a fan.  That would be impossible unless you were deaf.  
For a fan, this is far superior to any other filmed recording YES has made and is a must have.
I really enjoyed the longer pieces (Close to the Edge, The Gates of Delerium, Ritual) and I thought the new songs (Magnification, Don't Go, In the Presence Of) were well done.  The drum section in Ritual was FANTASTIC!
I suppose if I could change anything about it, with this line-up I would have left Owner of a Lonely Heart off the song list, but you must figure that it was such a successful and recognizable piece in the 80's they have to play it now.  And besides, Howe's solo at the end of it was well done.  
I would have also liked to see Awaken in this symphonic format, but it was well done on the House of YES video.
Buy this DVD!  You won't regret it!
