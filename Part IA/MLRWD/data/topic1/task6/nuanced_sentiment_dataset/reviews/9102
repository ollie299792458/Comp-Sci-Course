By 1981, The Rolling Stones had lost a lot of the magic. Their singles were hardly making the top 20 and their albums still sold high ("Black And Blue" was number one for nine weeks in a row) but were not as good as "Sticky Fingers", "Exile On Main Street" or anything from the peak period. Also suffering was their live shows. Once a group whose concerts were full of energy and theatrics, they now are boring and don't even do most of the songs that good.
The main problem I have with this dvd is the songs themselves. They don't sound like Stones songs at all. "Beast Of Burden", "Shattered" and "You Can't Always Get What You Want" (to name a few) could have been done by any hack tribute band. Their performance of "Jumpin' Jack Flash" is good, but you can tell by the way they just jump right into  the second verse when you go to it that it's been edited. "Miss You" is bland despite some great sax work, and "Let It Bleed" (a song I was intially looking forward to) doesn't work live. If you want to see a great live performance of this song, buy the "4 Flicks" boxed set, watch the Madison Square Garden concert (which I happened to attend). See how well they do this song in an indoor venue rather than an outdoor stadium.
The only redeeming momenst in this film are "Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)" and the models on "Honky Tonk Women". Otherwise, this dvd is a total waste of time and money. Also, I advise to stay away from "Still Life", the 1982 live album that was culled from the same tour.
