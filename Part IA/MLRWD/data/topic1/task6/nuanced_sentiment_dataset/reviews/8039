I can't say this wasn't a moving picture...however, it was not a masterpiece by any standard of mine.  First, I believe you have to be Asian to fully appreciate an Asian film.  Otherwise, the cultural differences just out weigh the content.  I did enjoy certain aspects of this "Buddist" themed movie.

I was disappointed in some of the scenes and highly disappointed in the lack of dialog throughout the film.  I think its impossible to send a clear message (in today's culture) if you are not willing to verbalize it in some ways on the screen.  Otherwise, we could have all bought the book...and not watched this film!

If you do watch this film you will learn why I said in my review title "I'll take Summer".  Its in the "Summer segment" of this four segment film that the young teenage "monk in training" experiences his first sexual desires and then acts upon them.

I am "Capt.Freaky" after all!  Before you get too excited fans...the sex scenes are very tame (PG-13) and show almost nothing...unless you like to watch a young Asian man's bare ass pumping up and down on some girls spread out legs?  Its a far cry from any kind of real sexual "turn on" .....but given the rest of this films "excitment quotent"....you take what you get!

Seriously film fans...it is a high quality film with a serious spiritual message...but only to those who understand this Korean culture better than us European/Americans can.  We think think the original "Emmanuel" film is a "religious event"!
