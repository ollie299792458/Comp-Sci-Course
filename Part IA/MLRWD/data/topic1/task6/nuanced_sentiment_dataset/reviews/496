Awful. Horrible. Terrible. I could go on.
Maybe you have to be a computer science major (or former one, in my case), or just know the slightest bit about computers to know that hacking isn't some virtual-reality trip through pretty graphics on a huge hologram display. Or maybe it's just common sense.
The "hacking" is totally unrealistic and it hurt me to watch it. The culture, I'm sure, is probably also 180 degrees off from what they show in the movie. Seriously, people, who dresses like that? Who wears their hair like that? And certainly all hackers are not skateboarders.
Were there any good points to this movie? Matthew Lillard was outrageous in every aspect, and I enjoy his acting (however ill-fitting it was). And, of course, Angelina Jolie, one of the main reasons I bought the DVD.
And speaking of the DVD...it's all about computers and technology, so it'll have some cool high-tech special features, right? Well, if you consider a trailer and scene-selection to be high-tech and amazing, then you got it. And you also probably thought the hacking in the movie was "cool."
