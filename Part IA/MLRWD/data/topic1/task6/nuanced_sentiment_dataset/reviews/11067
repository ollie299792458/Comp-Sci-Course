First of all the DVD is packed with annoying commercials for other Hollywood movies, at the cost of sacrificing sound. Dolby Digital 5.1 is only average, compared to the much richer PCM on Neil Young's other products.

This video is very polished. The stage performance is perfected in every little detail. It is glossy and expensive, and every musician and singer delivers precise rehearsed moves, feet in exact position, and every single step calculated. Which makes it a little dull. Neil Young is clearly the emperor in total control. Ben Keith though, seems to have his own thing going on steel guitar. And Neil Young's wife Pegi has a nice voice which can't be completely controlled. Overall the Prairie Wind songs sound more or less exactly the same as on the cd. No surprises, aside from the talk inbetween.

The best performance, I think, is The Old Laughing Lady, where Neil Young delivers wonderfully creative guitar playing.
One Of These Days is also good, even if Young is overacting his singing here, which makes it a bit contrived. But he really gives it all in this song, and that is enjoyable to watch.

From all other raving reviews below, I get the impression that people have a tendency to easily become lured by the flashy and expensive, and have a difficult time separating that from the genuine of depth and quality.

The Silver And Gold dvd is much better. It's not as commercial, and free of ads. Has PCM sound. The stage is simpler, Neil is alone, without a fancy suit. But every song is alive with creativity and rapture. And that's what counts.
