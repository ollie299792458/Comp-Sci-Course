Was this movie supposed to be another intriguing installment of the Legally Blonde series or was this actually supposed to be a genuine attempt at an original movie? If the answer was the latter, congratulations on a complete and utter failure cuz this movie was a hack!

The only people who could possibly enjoy this movie would be annoying, pretentious, self-rightous women who think they can do anything they want in this world without any consequence....in other words, American girls.

This is another joke of a movie where the main character (a woman) lies to, steals from, cheats, and uses everyone and everything throughout the course of the movie...and in the end what happens, yea that's right, everyone comes back and gives her everything she ever wanted, although she never once apologizes or deserves these things. Its movies like this that are blurring womens ideas of reality and destroying the fabric of America.

Lol. Go ahead women, keep thinking the world exists to serve you. There are plenty of waitresessing jobs and strippers poles waiting for you when you find out it doesn't.
