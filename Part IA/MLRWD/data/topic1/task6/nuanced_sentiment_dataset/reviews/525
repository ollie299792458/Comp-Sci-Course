Paired for the first time these favorites, Bullock & Grant, are a treat for the eye and mood.  What's not to like when you see Lucy, Bullock, play her playful off-kilter, eccentric impassioned character as she and a couple decide to stop the demolition of a historic landmark.  Bullock comes equipped with wet wipes, mats and protective eye gear so demonstrating is less hazardous to their health.
  Rubber-faced, laid back Hugh Grant, a feast to the eyes, plays a likable albeit; slightly inattentive CEO who needs lots of guidance and tends to hire female attorneys with a law degree from some tropical island.  He commanded by his brother, the behind the scenes power to hire someone with a real law degree, like one from Harvard.
  Lucy happens to have the necessary degree and while pestering George, the Grant character, lets it slip she has graduated from Harvard.  Grant asks her to join her in the limo to discuss her current project and Lucy ends up employed by the Wade Corp.  She works for, indeed, baby-sits George for about a year then decided he is too dependent and gives notice.
  Lucy's replacement, makes her slightly uneasy, is this jealousy?  Add to the mix the droll English Grant wit, great scenarios, and prat falls and you have an enjoyable movie.
