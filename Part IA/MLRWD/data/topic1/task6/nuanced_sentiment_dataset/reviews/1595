The DEER HUNTER deserves neither the fawning praise nor the Academy Awards people have lavished on it. Despite the remarkable cast and the performances they turn in, the DEER HUNTER is lacklustre at best, a meandering and sloppy piece.

The film is supposed to be about deep, solid friendships forged in the fires of a blue-collar steel town, and how the savagery of war rends them apart. OK, sounds good, but the film does not focus enough on this. Instead, we get a PBS documentary on Russian-American wedding rituals, and gratuitous Vietnam "this was the worst, most immoral war in human history" scenes.

Why are these guys friends in the first place? Why are de Niro and Walken so especially close? Why is Cazale's character so insecure? And what, exactly, is so special about deer hunting? I realize that the intention was to demonstrate the deep spirituality and respect for life that is often associated with hunting, but it was so superficially treated in the film that it seems like an afterthought. It's the title of the film, for chrissake, and it's hardly dealt with.

None of these questions are answered. The cinematography is fantastic, and the acting is even better. God, how do I love Meryl Streep. But this movie is a failure. Forget the roulette, forget its alleged "slowness," this movie is bad on too many other levels. Best director? Do people know what it means to direct?

On paper, DEER HUNTER could have been one of the greatest movies of all time. In the hands of a self-indulgent director however, it ends up being shallow and unsatisfying. It's status as "best picture" of '78 illustrates more the political nature of the Oscars than its mission to publicly honor true art.
