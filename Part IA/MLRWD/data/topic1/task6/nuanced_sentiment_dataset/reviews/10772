I am responding to a plea from Amazon to buy this waste of time and money. The actual filming,  color and settings are excellent, but the story line, plot, directing, acting are poor if that. The historical accuracy is zero, and any attempts to compare it to Band of Brothers is laughable. It is an insult to the Black combat units it is suppose to represent. As a previous reviewer stated, it is a total loss of two hours of their life. I am only writing this review in hopes that other people will not fall into the same trap. By the way if you can believe an infantry man would carry around a marble head that would have to have weighed about 50lbs just for the hell of it,through the Italian mountains, for the duration of WWII, then you would believe just about anything. Most soldiers threw away their gas masks because they (certainly less then 5lbs)were too heavy. Give me a break! This movie belongs at the bottom of the 99cents bin and it would be almost criminal to be asked to pay that for it. The miracle was that it ever made it to DVD.
