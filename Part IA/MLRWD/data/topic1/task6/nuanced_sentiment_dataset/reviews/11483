This is a genuinely interesting effort, but it falls apart for me as soon as the secret of the killer is revealed.  Frankly, I was vastly more interested in the real story of Vidocq and the history the movie keeps alluding to than in what the main plot serves up.  And the cinematography people keep gushing over is bad video game cutscene quality, with a lot of obvious CGI, quick cuts, and extreme close-ups of people's noses.  Gerard Depardieu and the rest of the cast are good here; I just think they get lost a bit under the director's ham-fisted attempts at stylishness and horror.

My main objection to this movie is that at some point they give up on the detective genre and just say, "Screw it!  He's magic."  It's like the 2009 "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes" low-budget cash-in where Sherlock Holmes fights CGI dinosaurs for some reason.  The actual Vidocq was a really interesting guy living at a really interesting time, and 3/4 of this movie takes advantage of that.  Then the last quarter kind of undoes all that by abandoning any rules of reason or physics and making the villain an immortal Matrix-ninja who eats people's souls and can't stand mirrors.  Weird.
