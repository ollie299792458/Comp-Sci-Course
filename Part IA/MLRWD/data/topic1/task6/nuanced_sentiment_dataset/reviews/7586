I loved doing this dvd during my first pregancy! I was sad that during my second pregnancy because I was unable to do yoga due to breathing problems, but I defiantly recommend this work out to any one who wants to feel amazing while pregnant! The collection consists of three work outs and a relaxation section. Although Shiva Rea is not pregnant, all the models are pregnant and represent the three trimesters. The yoga moves are designed to accommodate your growing bodies need during the trimester. Do I feel that this helped with child birth...no, but it help through the uncomfortable portions of pregnancy, especially through the hot days of summer. Her focus is on staying healthy for the baby. There is never any reference doing yoga now to get back into pants latter. This should be how all prenatal exercises programs should be! Sadly, so many tell us how we should look based on the medias distorted representation of body image.  But I guess that it what sells. Do this work out for yourself! Continue to do Yoga after your pregnancy is over, because it will help your body recuperate. Do not go crazy with your postpartum weight loss, it is not good for you and not realistic. Yes, the starlets are losing tons of weight with in months but they trainers, nutritionist, and full time nannies helping them get red carpet ready. Is this realistic? No. Eat healthy, stay strong, and losse weight for yourself.
