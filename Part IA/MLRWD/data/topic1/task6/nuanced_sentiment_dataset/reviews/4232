As a long time fan of Elizabeth Goudge, I was hoping to introduce my grandson to her work through video.  He already was a fan of Tim Curry's recent characters through films of Terry Pratchett novels, so I thought this would be a good introduction to other favorite literature.

Forget it!

This film might have been inspired by EG's novel (which is reportedly a great favorite of Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling) but the story is all but unrecognizable.  The characterization is all messed up and everything that is inspiring and special about the novels of EG is completely left out. About the only thing about the film that I could find praise-worthy is the costuming which is quite whimsical and unexpected.  It is the only thing about the film that I could find magical and appropriate.

Specifically and first of all, I was disappointed in the portrayal of the uncle as a young, hostile, domineering misogynist. Not at all the character he was described in the novel.  Although Tim Curry usually likes to play villains these days, I could see him playing the uncle more convincingly than the actor who was finally cast. Juliet Stephenson was well cast as Miss Heliotrope. Messing up the other various relationships among the characters was very off-putting for me as a fan of the novel.  I suppose the film was okay as a fantasy, but it was not what I was led to expect as an adaptation of the work of a favorite author.  In that way it was a major disappointment.
