I first saw this film upon release and I agree that this version of the opera is not for the purist officionado. However, since my first viewing I could not forget the film.  The production is wonderful compared to many  "on-stage" productions trasferred to film, if you consider the  audio alone. The soundtrack is fabulous on its own, and Julia is  outstandingly sensual in many of the scenes, especially the one where she  rolls the cigar on her thigh.  Although the film is in subtitles, I think  the criticism toward this fact is ineffectual since the opera is sung in  the original language. I do not know anyone who enjoys foreign films who  does not cringe with the gratuitous dubbing of the original films.  On its  own merit, it has style, beauty, location, great opera stars, and inherent  qualities of educating children of the performing arts --if not adults-- at  the very least.  The overall acting notwithstanding, this full length  feature film version of a timeless story should be considered as a  wonderful addition to anyone's musical film collection.
