You know there are bad movies that leave you wondering....Can I get my money back?!Then there are movies that leave you wondering,I must be the only one that thinks this movie is okay.Well,guys...this is that movie.Sure the acting is sub-standard,the special effects look like they were done in somebody's garage,but damn,this movie is okay.One of the disappointing things is the creature,boy,I've seen and read somethings about the chupacabra,but this thing on the screen looked nothing like it.Yeah,alright,I get it,scary monster,confined area,victims and heroes,BUT COME ON!at least make it resemble the beast with the title of the bloody movie mate!You should know what to expect from the sci-fi channel by now gang,bad scripts,over rated spfxs,and bad acting.Overall,I must say this movie kind'a grows on you and you get use to it.If you over look that bad acting,etc;etc;this movie could be watched with the family to a point.Gory blood,fleshing ripping monster,etc;etc.John Rhys-davies is still pretty good enough to get the movie to its climax.In short,I must say this is one of those movies that you can watch on one of those slow,rainy days.
