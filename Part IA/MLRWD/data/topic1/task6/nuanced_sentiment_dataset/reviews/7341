This is the quintessential Hammer Horror movie. And this is the greatest Dracula movie of the series, Christopher Lee is magnificent here and definitely Dracula's never looked so terrifying and gruesome! Recently hearing that Hammer Horror Productions have started up again i am exited to bits..but whether or not they could ever create something like this again is hard to imagine.Times have certainly changed and what you have here is a horror film from the golden age of British cinema.rarely does a film so much these days captivate a sheer undergoing of things that go bump in the night to such dramatic effect. As the steering protagonist and nemises of Christopher Lee's Dracula is 'Doctor Van Helsing' Played by none other than Peter Cushing. Who plays again in this role as a perfect counter part to Lee's shadowly stranger of the night.Peter embodies every bit into his role as the the opposition serving for the light in the darkness of this ungoing battle between good and evil. I picked this up recently, and thought to myself is this going to be as good as it was as a child? Had it lost it's lustre and worn with time? Not atall, surprisingly! The music and the two main leading men hold it togeather perfectly and still works in truly horrorfying effect. Thats why they call these classics.

Pros- Brilliant Acting, Scares, music on screen performances by counterparts.

Cons- ???! They should have been given oscars for this! Horror deserves more.
