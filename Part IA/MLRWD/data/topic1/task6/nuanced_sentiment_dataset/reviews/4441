This cult classic from 1957 still holds up very well on several levels. It can be viewed by people like me who love to ride motorcycles and enjoy seeing that "inner rebel" on the screen that we sometimes find within ourselves and are drawn to, or it can be viewed from the standpoint of a study of peer pressure and mob psychology.
This movie brings me back to my teen years when I first saw it on tv in 1966. Three months later I rode on a motorcycle for the first time.I've been riding a lot more in recent times and still think back very fondly to this film that is more effective in black and white than I think it would be in color. Perhaps it makes all that black leather stand out more.
Marlon Brando gives a very strong performance as Johnny by bringing out the contrasting personality traits of a man who wants to be tough but is also very vulnerable and sensitive in ways he doesn't know how to handle. This inner conflict is brought out by Kathie, well played by Mary Murphy.
All of the minor charactors are also well played and natural looking, especially the police and town officials. One can see where Lee Marvin as Chino would be sought after for many more acting jobs after his fine work in this film.
If you are a wanna be biker or have the boots, leather jacket, but no bike, watch this movie and maybe your dream of being able to "LIve to ride" will eventually come true as it has for me. I may not have become a biker at all if I hadn't seen this movie.
