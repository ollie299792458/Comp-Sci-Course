Another Ken Burns documentary, and God help me, I really do love them. But I think The War is his least realized. The topic is really too broad to make the kind of assertions he wants to make. The Studs Terkel influenced "Enlisted men Good...Officers Bad" mentality or the judging of the past from the limited perspective of the present. It is definitely a "Howard Zinn" social history, which makes it a very narrow history. To Ken's credit, the vast majority of the coverage of WW II is pretty varnished stuff, so it doesn't hurt us to be reminded that all was not completely well at home or abroad regarding the comportment of the Allied nations. But what I came away with was not a "grayer" vision of the War, which was what I think he intended. What I came away with was a terrifying realization that if we are ever called to fight another war with stakes as high as those of WW II, we will not win. We will not win because of journalism like Ken Burns'. We will not win because we will never be allowed to take our eyes off our own navels long enough to see a greater evil, and shoot it.
