Vastly overrated entry in the Nightmare On Elm Street series, NOES3: Dream Warriors is barely passable for an evening's rental.  Gone are the dark overtones that set the serie's standard with the original NOES.  Instead we  have our villian showcasing bad one-liners and losing what little aura of  fear he sustained after the last sequel. Even the attempt here to bring the  NOES series into more of a fantasy/horror realm is filled with many missed  opportunities. The film's greatest selling point,  that the Elm Street kids  can fight back against their nocturnal assailant with their own  personalized dream powers,  is filled with great promise.....but ends up  taking a backseat once the bodies start piling up.  The performances are  passable at best,  with the returning Heather Langenkamp coming across as  shockingly ineffective after her great performance in the original  installment. Still, it is great to see John Saxon and Craig Wasson  exchanging blows and glances.  The special effects sequences are varied in  quality. Some of the effects,  like the Freddy Puppet are ingenious and  well-done.  However, the showdown in the junkyard with Wasson and Saxon  dueling with a stop-motion skeleton looks, unfortunately, just like  that....two actors miming a fight with a superimposed stop-motion creation.  Still,  for all it's faults, NOES3:DW is worth a night's rental to catch  some of the better special effects of the series and to recapture some of  that 80's nostalgia (Dokken on the soundtrack!). spg2@earthlink.net
