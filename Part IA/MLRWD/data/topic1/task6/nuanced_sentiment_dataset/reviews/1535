There are quite a few reviews for this movie, so you probably dont need another.  But I'll mention two things that I found interesting.  Its surprising how many of Hitchcock's trademarks are right there from the beginning- his cameo appearance, suspense (as opposed to mystery), a feeling of dread, a sympathetic perpetrator/victim, and a high profile (britsh museum here) chase at the end.  I'll expound upon one of these.  The blackmailer is a dreadful character who makes you feel very uncomfortable the way he inserts himself into the normal characters lives, their pocket for the glove, their comfortable parlor for breakfast, their wallet for a fine cigar- very creepy!  However, I have felt this feeling many times watching Alfred Hitchcock movies.  The other thing that struck me was the acting by the girl after she kills her rapist.  I'm surprised she did not become more famous- because she was very good.  You really felt sorry for her and cared for her right until the very end.  But right after the murder- her expressions of horror and guilt and almost insanity were very unsettling.  It seems that actors in the silent era simply knew how to act better than today's actors.  They had to act with facial expressions versus dialogue and that is real talent.
