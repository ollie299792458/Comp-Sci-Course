I rarely write reviews for products although I purchase most of my DVD/Blu rays (used)from various sellers on Amazon so hopefully readers will understand how so truly dissapointed I felt to compose this review. First, The Fugitive is amongst my top 10 movie favorites of all time (I'm 40 years old). My wife surprised me with a Blu Ray player for father's day and I've purchased 13 Blu Rays and this movie as BY FAR been the most dissapointing. I have proably watched this flick 50 times. I know the dialogue almost word for word and know how scenes will finish before they complete so I was shocked at the added dialogue and longer scenes that accompied this version. Perhaps this is a special addition, although it's not labeled that way anywhere on the packaging. Also the (so called) video upgrade is nearly nonexsistant. Of the 13 movies I now own this is the worse (barely above DVD quality) of the lot. With all of the dissapointment I ejected the movie out of my player and put it on the shelf thankful that I still held on to my old reliable DVD which I will turn to when that feeling to watch Harrison, Tommy and company do their thing again for the 51st time.
