Cheri is not who you think, by the cover of the film. Cheri is the son of Charlotte (Kathy Bates)and archrival of Lea (Michelle Pfeiffer),which Charlotte wants Lea to teach Cheri a spoiled 19 year old boy about women. Lea and Charlotte are a couple of courtesans (high class prostitutes); Lea is thinking of quitting the profession until Charlotte asks her to teach her son about women. Lea invites Cheri to go with her for a weekend to get away from his mother in order to teach him about women and how they should be treated. Cheri and Lea end up being together for six years. Cheri's mother arranged a marriage for him with a young girl. Cheri got married and didn't realize till after the marriage took place that he was truly in love with Lea. Lea realized after Cheri got married she was also in love with Cheri. Both Lea and Cheri were very miserable without each other. Lea tried to go on and let Cheri fade out of her life but she was unable to succeed in that; she tried to have relationships with other young men ,but was unable to let go of her feelings towards Cheri, and was very miserable until she heard Cheri left his wife. Lea was happy to hear Cheri left his wife and hoped to get back together with him. Cheri went to Lea and spent the night with her, but the next morning when they arose the situation had changed between them, Lea tried to arrange for them to go away ,but Cheri did not like Lea treating him as if he was twelve years old. Cheri and Lea had a discussion about their relationship and Lea told him to return to his wife and be happy since she was and old woman and him so much younger than her. Cheri went back to his wife reluctantly, still wanting Lea ,but also knowing she was the only woman he could ever love. Lea had never been in real love before Cheri. Lea was devastated and realized she was and old woman. Cheri committed suicide after returning from war.  This was a rather bitter sweet movie, as to say it was a tale of a love which could not be.
