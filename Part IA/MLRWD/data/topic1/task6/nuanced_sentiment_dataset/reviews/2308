(Old review: I pride myself on loving bad movies, but this one is off-the-charts awful.  Save your money and watch The Howling instead.  Anything would be an improvement.  Including Teen Wolf...
What did I expect? Something a bit unique and cheap, like Jeepers Creepers, Cabin Fever, or The Descent.  What did I get?  Something that can't decide if it wants to be a werewolf movie, a western, or a messianic free-for-all.  That's a shame since the acting is decent, given the material.)

***Update***
I don't normally do this, but I keep getting "unhelpful" notes for this review, so I am hereby revising it a bit...

The Navajo and Hopi believe (or used to believe) in humans who could take the shape of any animals they wished - these people were known as "skinwalkers" and the name is easily understood if you have seen a ceremony whereby someone dons a wolf skin and dances around in ritual.  The movie takes liberties with this tradition and starts with its share of dream-catchers and the like.  As we learn early on, a boy is prophesied to end the 'curse' of the skinwalker and the prophecy is nearing fulfillment.  Unfortunately for the boy, many of the 'cursed' enjoy their power as werewolves, revel in their bloodlust, and will do anything to stop the prophecy from being fulfilled, starting with killing the boy.  Enter a tribe of "good" werewolves to help the boy survive and you end up with 91 minutes of good-versus-bad warring for the future of the werewolf-kind.  Werewolf-on-werewolf action - when will the violence end?

Rona Mitra is one of the main characters, which should be reason enough for 90% of males between 13 and 90 to watch this movie, especially if they can get it as a direct download on Netflix.
