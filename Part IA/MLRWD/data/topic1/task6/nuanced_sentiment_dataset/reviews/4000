First of all, I really liked the movie, despite that fact that the science could have been tidied up a bit. I liked that it showed things from the POV of the manipulated dead, which gave things a neat twist and kept the movie from getting stale. As a fan of "Donnie Darko", I had my reservations about this movie, because often sequels fall short of expectations. Still, it was a pretty good movie to rent on a slow night. The cast was surprisingly good. Had a different actress been cast than Daveigh Chase, I don't know if the story would have held up as well, though.

The music was okay, but it did not serve as a cohesive element like in "Donnie Darko". The plot at times was a bit predictable, but that did not take away from my enjoyment.

There was one subplot which never got resolved once time reverted to "normal", which made the ending sort of harsh and disturbing. (Much like how, in "Donnie Darko", the fire never happened, thus one character's secret was never exposed.) Other than that, though, the movie was good, as long as I didn't measure it up against the original.
