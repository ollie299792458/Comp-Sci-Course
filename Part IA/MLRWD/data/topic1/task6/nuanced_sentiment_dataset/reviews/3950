A fun summer film that is (mostly) for the whole family. A few dead spots but most scenes do click, with memorable characters, pratfalls, and sight gags. Some basketball teammates (who were about 12 in 1978) re-unite when they attend the funeral of their beloved coach. They bring their own families to a "lake house" and soon find that the free-spirited goofiness of their childhood hasn't faded, even if they are supposed to set good examples for their kids.

Filmed mostly on Boston's North Shore at Chebacco Lake in Essex MA (it was fun to see the basketball game at the end, which took place at a park quite familiar to me--home to a long running folk music festival--last year's fest got moved due to the filming but a tropical storm wound up cancelling it anyway!). May-December romances and spoiled kids; "fugly"-looking teammates who father gorgeous daughters (well, two out of three...); using a bug zapper to fry bacon, and daring stunts at a water park, this film is a goofy, enjoyable romp that shows some boys who become "grown ups" but don't forget their inner kid.
