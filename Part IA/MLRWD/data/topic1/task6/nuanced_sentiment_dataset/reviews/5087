I had heard a few things about the movie "Gummo" in the past: "really gross", "disturbing", "f#*$ed up",  etc., and I guess I feel the same way, but the film holds a certain allure  that can only be compared to looking at an accident scene: you don't want  to look, but you do anyway. Aside from the killing of cats, retarded  prostitutes, and wrestling of chairs (yes, that's in it), perhaps the most  disturbing part of the film is that it's hard to tell who's acting, and  who's not. The film plays like a documentary, and it gives the film a  realistic feel that's really creepy. For instance, the scene in which the  two ex-Jehovah's Witness brothers beat the living crap out of each other  looks absolutely real. These guys are really hitting each other as hard as  they can--no camera tricks can simulate this. The scene in which the kid  with the weird head, Solomon, is sitting in his filthy black-water bathtub  eating spaghetti and then drops his chocolate bar in the water, fishes it  out and eats it, made me want to puke. This film will definitely make an  interesting addition to your collection, but it's not something to watch  for fun.
