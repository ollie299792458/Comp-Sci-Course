THE COMPANY is a wonderful film in the tradition of Robert Altman's best films (particularly NASHVILLE, also MASH, McCABE & MRS MILLER, and SHORT CUTS).  When Altman is really "on his game," no one can equal his ability to create a unique microworld which simultaneously captures its defined subject but also points out its universality.  In this case the spotlight is on the Joffrey Ballet Company of Chicago, so there are tense rehearsal scenes followed by gorgeous performance scenes.  Daily life in "The Company" depicts the universal desire of all artists to "get it right" -- the effort they go thru day in & day out to perfect each tiny detail so that the end result looks "easy" to the audience.  The film challenges its audience to understand that this quest is just as true for the filmmakers making this film as it is of the dancers that the film embraces.  In other words, it looks like a "documentary" but it's actually tightly scripted.  Each time you watch it, you will see more & more because each of the character's specific arcs will become more & more clear to you.  Is it worth the effort?  Well, if you are someone who's seen NASHVILLE multiple times, then yes.  The first time I saw NASHVILLE, I watched to see WHAT would happen.  The second time, I wanted to know who did it.  (If you know NASHVILLE, then you'll know that the "what" is an assassination.)  It wasn't until the third time that I actually understood why one particular person X killed another particular person Y.  Same here - although the plot elements are more delicate (as befits the milieu).  Suffice it to say that you'll know you've mastered THE COMPANY when every act in the Christmas Roast makes you laugh as hard as the dancers in the scene are laughing.  Final Words: See this at least once on a big screen if at all possible, because the dance numbers are truly magnificent!
