From reviews I expected a pretty decent movie.  Surprisingly, it was even better than I expected.  I liked all 3 original movies, btw, and I really have to say this was a much better quality movie still.  Good casting and acting.  Good story.  Great introduction to characters and tie-ins to the comic book universe.  Also didn't do anything to upset the time line with the  original movies, which I appreciated.  It was also neat to see actors I didn't even know would be in this movie, plus a ton of good actors who are somewhat recognizable but not enough that I could tell you who they were.  Some things in the story didn't fit 100% with the comics, but just pretty insignificant things, and  I really didn't mind at all.  For instance, it would appear that Scott Summers' brother Alex was older than him?  Aah, that's alright, Havoc was never that big a deal anyway.  And I have to say I liked Banshee in the movie much more than I ever did in the comic.  Not that he really had any lines, it was just really fun seeing him fly and do his scream thing...it always seemed a little lame in the comics.
UPDATE: Just wanted to add that it's been almost a year since this was released and it's now continually playing on cable and I find myself getting stuck watching it every time I flip by it.  I really don't think this movie, the story, the casting and acting, all of it, could have been done any better.
