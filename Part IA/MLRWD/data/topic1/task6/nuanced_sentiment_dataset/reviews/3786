Nice Costumes, very clean, neat and tidy Kazaks fight evil, wicked, bad, and nasty Poles.  But how many times can you see the happy Kazak brotherhood dance, drink, whack someone with a sword from horseback before you want to say out loud, "Okay, I understand, I get it."  This movie appears stuck in the afore mentioned rut and no amount of "Star Power" can pull it out,(not Yul Brynner, and/or Tony  Curtis), or pretty scenery or horseback swordplay can change it.

This movie is about 30 to 45 minutes too long to be boring.  There are many nicely filmed cavalry charges, (do forged steel sword blades sound like aluminum blades when struck together? Perhaps some sound effect improvement are also needed.).  Yul Brynner sings something `Kazaky' sounding and it doesn't help The special effects for making the hole in Tony Curtis's Breast Plate armor was nicely understated and it doesn't help.  The Kazaks don't loot the city after they defeat those bad Poles (that dealt with them treacherously) and it doesn't help.  What might help is re-editing the entire flick.  It might become a short subject but there is a lot of beautiful camera work, costumes, and scenes.
