Christopher Smith is definitely a director to watch. TRIANGLE takes what could have been a tired premise and draws it out to (and beyond) its logical conclusion. Melissa George stars as a young mother who takes a boat trip with some friends. When the boat capsizes, they take shelter on a seemingly abandoned cruise ship, and soon discover they're not alone.

I thought I was ahead of the movie, successfully figuring out "the twist," but wasn't prepared for what came after. Smith's film has a premise that demands certain things to be true, and he follows his own rule to the letter. By the end, he's executed the premise with impeccable conviction, letting the movie wrap and twist around itself far more than I would have guessed. It's remarkably effective. The final act is an extraordinary payoff, giving us a sisyphean tragedy that actually felt complete.

I've been recommending this to friends and they've all enjoyed it just as much as I did. A real surprise, and I think this movie deserves a lot of attention.
