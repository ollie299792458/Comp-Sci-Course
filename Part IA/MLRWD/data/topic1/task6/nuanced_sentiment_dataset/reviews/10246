The most profound thing written in this book is when he informs us that breaking the strongholds of the enemy require an encounter with truth, not power. So often I have been waiting for the "right preacher" or "right prayer warrior" to pray over me. When I learned this truth that the lies we have believed must be conquered with the truth (by believing/speaking/meditating on) rather than some power encounter, my breakthrough happened. As the enemy tries to creep back with the same old lies, I have the weapon of truth ready now.

While some reviewers feel this book focuses on the devil too much, I believe that it's important to know who your enemy is and to have his war tactics exposed so you are adequately equipped to handle the encounter. We are in a war for our minds. The Bible says the devil seeks whom he may devour, that he is out to steal, kill and destroy and this book simply points us to the truth in God's Word about who we are in Christ, how to win the battle for our mind. I highly recommend this book to anyone struggling with negative thoughts/voices that come from our enemy. There is hope...you are not alone and God can help you through this book.
