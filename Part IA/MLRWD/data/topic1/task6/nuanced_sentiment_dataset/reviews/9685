This really is a bad, bad film. Not only does it have little to do with Street Fighter (other than character names), The Legend of Chun-Li has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It's not entertaining or enjoyable in any way whatsoever and the only thought involved while viewing is how could so bad a film have possibly been made. The characters from the game that actually DO appear in the movie are completely ruined. At least the first one had actors that kinda resembled their video game counterparts. This one might as well have a different name entirely, several of which I would have to censor in order to have this posted. So why bother with this review in the first place? Good question. Watching the film was a waste of time, yet writing about it was satisfying in the sense that a film as bad as this sort of puts things in perspective when you're having a bad day or something. Then again, it may also make you pray for nuclear holocaust. Watch the anime versions instead, but avoid this one.
