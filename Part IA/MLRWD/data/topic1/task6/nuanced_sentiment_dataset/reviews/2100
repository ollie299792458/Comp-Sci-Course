"Mamma Mia", I think needed a more seasoned film director. Many of the jokes fell flat, and it felt sluggish. The play was meant to be light and feel-good. The director, Phyllida Lloyd, I have read is an acclaimed theatre director, but the "tricks of the trade" known only by those who have a passion for film making, could have made this work.

It is not that I can't enjoy a film about weddings and Abba's music, I found the use of Abba's music absolutely magical in the darker comedy "Muriel's Wedding".

Some have said just the island scenes in this were wonderful. I didn't think so. The island scenes in this film felt like nothing more than a pretty backdrop. The film could have been shot in Blue Screen. You never really feel the islands effect on the characters, It could have been shot indoors. Paul Mazursky's The Tempest, set on the Greek Isles, might not have been a great film but is a good example of characters in relationship to their environment. Films last year like "Vicky Christina Barcelona" and "Bruges" really knew the importance of location. The characters in those two films where facing comic dilemmas like the characters in Mama Mia, But I felt the the magic of the environment much more in those two films.

The story just needed to be told by a better story teller.

I was disappointed. I know you are still going to rent or buy it, but hopefully if my review lowers your expectations, you will might enjoy it more than I did. :)
