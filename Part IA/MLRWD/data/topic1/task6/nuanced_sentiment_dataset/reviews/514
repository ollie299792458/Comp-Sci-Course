Biopics are usually very dull and drag their feet getting to the core of the story that matters rather than what the director uses to assume credibility or closeness to the source. This is not one of those movies because you never connect with Ian to feel like you have any connection at all, nor do you get a sense of chronology by music, lyrics, or anything else that made us drawn to the movie.

You watch a very beautiful picture show. At times unflattering to the 90 seconds we get of Sumner's dialogue, and in general, the actors seem a little peeved they are even in the movie, but honest to a fault since given the writer's apathetic take and connection to the subject, "that is what it was like" we are left to assume. There are many things missed and the band aspect could be substituted for just about any job, as the music and gigs are atmosphere and not plot with the emphasis on Ian only showing up to sing, and not pouring out emotions in to writing his lyrics. I am left wondering what was left out or what the writer was thinking some 20 years on leaving the cast and story to be told out of memories that were not so clear or maybe the director, an extremely talented photographer, was making a movie out of a romanticised notion going over at 24 frames per second shots he wished he could have taken at the time.

Simlarities to the Doors can be made, but here, Ian's life is not made glamorous. We do sort of miss the point though, you feel as shut out by him as his wife must have felt, and yet even some more token performances and chronology could have helped us fans put the songs in to perspective since if this was a movie about some steelworker, we would not have watched it. We watched this because it was about Ian, the lead singer of Joy Division, but yet I appreciate that it was not a music video with liner notes stitching his life together.
