(Note: This review does contain a spoiler.)

My husband and I have been watching Bollywood movies for several years now, and we like Shahrukh Khan, which is why I picked up this DVD from our library.  I knew from glancing at some of the reviews here on Amazon that this film wasn't going to be like the "fun" Bollywood movies we'd seen, but I was not prepared for how different it would be.  We don't mind films that are artsy or unconventional, so those aspects of "Dil Se" weren't a problem for us (though we did have quite a few "What the heck?" moments when we couldn't tell where this story was trying to go!).

The main problem we had with this movie was the level of violence, specifically the flashback scene where a 12 year old girl sees her sister getting raped, only to be chased down and raped herself. Though the scene was not graphic from a visual standpoint, it was extremely disturbing and seemed to go on forever.  The emotional impact of this scene was bad enough to outweigh any of the good aspects of the film.  By the time it was over, we wished we hadn't watched this movie.

This "Why, oh why did I watch that?" feeling is a major reason why we don't watch many Hollywood movies anymore.  We've enjoyed Bollywood movies because the ones we've seen have not left us disturbed at the end ... that is, until this one.

I understand that the rape is a pivotal event in this story, and I know many will argue that we need to see this scene in order to understand the choices a main character has made.  I'm not interested in making any analysis of the artistic merits of this film, or protesting filmed depictions of violence against women, or complaining about violent films, etc.  I believe people are generally capable of making these sorts of judgements for themselves.

My point in writing this is to inform other sensitive viewers that this film may present problems for them.  If I had seen a review like this one, I would have skipped this film.
