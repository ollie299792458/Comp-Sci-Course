I was drawn to "The Governess" because I found it on the late Ofra Haza's site. It seems that everytime Rosa/Mary goes further from her Jewishness her conscience manifests itself in Ofra's chants (which are NOT Sefaredi, but Yemenite, and NOT the same).  The attempt to recreate Sefaredi lifestyle seemed totally unrealistic (Ashkenazi Torah scroll, prostitutes who use Yiddish instead of Ladino, men and women dancing right next to each other). I read that the author of "The Governess" has a Jewish father and Scottish mother. Apparently he assumes that a Sefaredi woman would easily give her virginity to a Scottish gentile and then have relations with his son who is even more disgusting than him, though historically Jewish women have chosen SUICIDE rather than do so (most recently in Sana, Yemen w/a young Jewess jumping off of a high cliff rather than marrying a Yemeni gentile and during the Holocaust in Europe when Jewish girls ingested poison rather than submit), yet suddenly our Jewess is SEDUCING an INNOCENT SCOTT! And where do those Jews in London live? Right next to a brothel of course! Also, why does Rosa reveals her breasts to those prostitutes (and that's BEFORE the pressure for her to marry $ even arises)? Is that her competition? Maybe that's how the author views Jewish women? Even though the soft, pastel colours were rich and pleasant both in Scotland (what dramatic lighting in his lab!), the synagogue in London and their house in London, I felt disgusted by the movie's cheapening of Jewish women (and NO, I don't see it as a playing out of the Esther model since her people are not a risk in Scotland, Rosa/Mary just wants to be an actress, which I think is a play on prostitution).
