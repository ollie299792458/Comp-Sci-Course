The tagline for this film tells you everything - "all clues, no solutions." It never does clearly reveal which parts of the story are reality and which parts are merely the products of Dan Dark's fevered imagination. This is frustrating on some level, but it also spurs a lot of questions and post-viewing conversation.

Robert Downey, Jr. uses his unique intensity to good effect here; who can doubt Downey as a tortured but brilliant man on the edge? It's fun to see well-known actors in the other parts, especially Adrien Brody, although Robin Wright Penn seems out of place - she's too spare and sharp to have the right noir look, especially in the sexier scenes. Carla Gugino, on the other hand, is absolutely perfect in each of the roles she plays.

I haven't seen the original British mini-series, so I can't offer comparisons there, but I will say that this film makes me curious to see the other. I don't think that the film is a "failure" outright, but it does leave the reader with so many clues and so few solutions that I can see how it would have had a lot of trouble finding an American theatre audience. Still, I think it draws the viewer in with its strange fusion of plots and genres.
