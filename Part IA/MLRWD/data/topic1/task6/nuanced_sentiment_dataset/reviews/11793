This film had a lot of potential. Beautiful cinematography, PERFECT mood settings, very nice acting (with the exception of this one crazy chick... who was incredibly over the top.) Even the music kicked. The story would've been a lot stronger with a little more explanation. "The Curse of the Vortex" tells me pretty much nothing. Who put it there? Why? What IS it?? None of these questions are really answer. Perhaps hinted at, but never answered. I know some things are meant to be open for interpretation, but this was just a bit too much. Plenty of crazy and bizarre stuff happens. But why? Because it's the curse of the vortex, duh. Gee, thanks. This could've easily been my favorite movie if it hadn't ignored the fact that it was leaving me completely freaking clueless at every turn. I feel the film may have been an excuse to make a lot of weird stuff happen and show off some nifty effects, of which there are many. If you like your movies to have good strong stories, stay away unless you like crazy stuff that goes unexplained.
