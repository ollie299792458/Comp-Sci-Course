Originally filmed in 1994, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation was written and directed by Kim Henkel, who co-wrote the original film with Tobe Hooper.  Originally set as a re-make of the original, the film was re-edited and re-distributed as a sequel, although there are still many a similarity between this film and the original.  The plot is nothing new; four kids get lost in the backwoods and eventually get caught and hacked up by a maniacal family, but there is an overly campy humor that is present that makes this otherwise dreadful film worth watching.  This film also features pre-fame Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey; both of which give great early performances, especially McConaughey who is laugh out loud hilarious and gives a maniacal performance that almost serves a precursor to his memorable characterizations in Frailty and Reign of Fire.  Although I wasn't too fond of the ideas with Leatherface, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation is so bad it's almost good, and if your a fan of the series but missed this installment then it is still worth checking out.
