Don't get me wrong, there are several really good episodes in the Ninth Season. Even at its worst The Simpsons is better than most of the drivel that gets put on TV anyway.

My least favorite episode on this set would have to be The Principal and the Pauper. After watching that episode I knew the inevitable downhill slide for this series had begun.

In many places, it felt like the writers were trying too hard, or in some cases not trying hard enough, and they started with a few story ideas that weren't all that great to begin with. In any case, the finely tuned situations, impeccable timing, spot-on delivery, and humor from the previous seasons is often lost. The series feels off-kilter in a number of ways.

There are a lot of cracks that begin to show up in construction of these episodes. First, a lot of the writing is subpar. The animation also begins to suffer. And a lot of the dialogue seems forced, as if the actors no longer care as much about their product, they're just there for the paycheck.

Now, that being said, there are a number of real gems in this set, including: Realty Bites, Trash of the Titans, The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson, and Bart Carny.

Overall, I'd say its still worth purchasing, but as the quality of this series goes downhill starting here with the Ninth Season, let's hope the $40 entry fee will also start to go down a little, too. This is the first time I've bought a Simpsons DVD set that left a hint of a bad taste in my mouth.
