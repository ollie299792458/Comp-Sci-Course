This 'documentary' is a passable introduction to black hair culture, but I found it to have a quite biased and shallow take on what is actually a very deep and complex subject. Chris mainly concentrates on women (and men) who use relaxers and weaves, his commentary on these subjects is often derogatory in nature, and he barely -- if at all -- mentions the notable amount of black women who wear natural hair, braids, dreads, etc. resulting in a very narrow perspective. Rock blatantly ignores anyone who does not contribute to his thesis: Natural black hair is not considered 'good hair'. Minus one star.

There is also far too much (somewhat boring) footage of a hair show in Atlanta that very loosely relates to the documentary topic. Minus one star.

What really rubbed me the wrong way about "Good Hair" was that Rock makes no mention of the fact that MILLIONS of women of all races and income chemically alter and change their hair with dyes, irons, relaxers, straighteners,  blow-dryers, bleach, rollers, extensions, etc. It is simply part of being a modern woman. Rock chides black women for using "dangerous" chemicals to change their hair and "look white", when the truth is that most women use some type of hazardous tool to seriously alter their hair -- whether it be the hydrogen peroxide in bleach, 300 degree flat irons or a bit of hair relaxer. When used in a careful way these products can have stunning results. There is nothing wrong with using lab-tested chemicals with common sense and caution if that is a personal choice. Minus one star.

It is good to talk about these issues, and the documentary is worth a watch if it is a topic of personal interest, but take it with a grain of salt. I kept hoping Chris would show some more positive clips of people who loved and enjoyed their natural hair -- I never saw it.

Two stars for bigotry. If I showed this to a friend who knew nothing about black hair culture, they would leave with the wrong idea.
