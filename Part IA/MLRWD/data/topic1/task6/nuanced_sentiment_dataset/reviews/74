"Frantic" was released in 1988 and quickly disappeared from theaters, which is a shame because it's a great little film. Acclaimed director Roman Polanski has crafted a wonderful mystery/thriller. Unfortunately, Warner Brothers doesn't seem to care much about giving this movie the treatment it deserves. It's not widescreen, there are absolutely no extras (not even the requisite trailer) and it doesn't look like there was any effort in restoring the picture. The price is quite good compared to the average DVD, but you get what you pay for here.
Harrison Ford stars as an American surgeon in Paris for a convention and brings along his wife (Betty Buckley, who played the mom on the TV show "Eight is Enough") in order to make the trip something of a second honeymoon. They barely have time to settle into their hotel room when the wife mysteriously disappears. A "frantic" Ford spends the rest of the film looking for her and along the way he encounters mysterious Arabs, inept U.S. embassy bureaucrats, missing luggage, a dead drug dealer, and a young female party animal who ends up being his main source of assistance in tracking down his wife. It's an engaging thriller that gets a little contrived toward the end, but still a fun ride. 
This is not a masterpiece on par with Polanski's "Chinatown" or "Rosemary's Baby," but still quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, the DVD is basically VHS quality. Shame on Warners. Still, if you want to pick up a disc cheap and don't mind sub-par quality, this is nice one to get.
