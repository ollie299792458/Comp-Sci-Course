This movie wasn't that great but it was a good Jackie Chan movie. Jackie Chan stars as a buisnessman named C.N. in this movie. You can skip the first 30 minutes nothing really happens. That girl C.N. likes in the movie is annoying. The fight scene with the bats is awesome. He takes 4 bats from 4 people. Some people would have got one or two but C.N. got all of them.

I like the fight scene with that small guy named Alen that was hired by C.N.'s best friend to defeat him. Well his friend didn't want him killed but he knew C.N. was going to get defeated and he wanted to show him that he has to get back into training instead of buying stocks all the time. There is really no enemies in this movie. Nobody really tries to kill anyone. There are no guns, blood, or knives in this movie. When C.N. and Alen fight they use boxing gloves. When Alen first beats C.N. he asks him if he's okay. There is no bad language. This movie could've been rated PG.

The second fight between Alen and C.N. is really cool. Alen is kind of like that guy from Legend of Drunken Master that can move his foot really fast. It last for 8 minutes but im not going to tell you what happens.

There are many special features including a 30 MINUTE MAKING OF FEATURETTE, a 4 minute music video, A commentary by Jackie Chan, and talent files.

OVERALL- a neat movie with 3 great action scenes, good because Jackie Chan is in it. If you play it in English Jackie doesn't even dubb his own voice. Good for any Jackie Chan collection.
