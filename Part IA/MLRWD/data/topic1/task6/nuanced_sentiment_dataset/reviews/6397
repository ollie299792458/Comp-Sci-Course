I have to agree with other reviews of this film and join the chorus of "It's not the worst movie I have ever seen." It's also not a bad performance by Madonna. I think unfortunately this movie was swirled with controversy (remaking a CLASSIC foreign film with politicial and feminist messges, lawsuits from another star who said HE wanted to remake the film with Madonna first, and Guy Ritchie directing his wife, and of course, Madonna's acting ability) before it was even made. When it came out, people were just downright MEAN. I would have loved to have seen it on the big screen, but it never opened here due to the bad press.
When you think about all the clunkers that many popular actors or actresses make, why does everyone act like it's the end of the world when Madonna makes less that a 5 star film. Isn't she entitled to some fun as an actress? Does it all have to be EVITA? I, for one, loved her performance in WHO'S THAT GIRL? I think it's a funny film and a good time. 
I think SWEPT AWAY is a hoot. It's not brain surgery, but it's not meant to be. I agree that Madonna is over the top in the beginning, but during the subtle scenes later in the film, she is very convincing and dare I say, powerful. I think the film is a must own for a Madonna fan and the MTV special with Madonna and Guy is TOO CUTE. 
Anyway, take time away from your finger pointing at the Material Girl and give Swept Away a watch. It won't change your life, but it wasn't made to.
