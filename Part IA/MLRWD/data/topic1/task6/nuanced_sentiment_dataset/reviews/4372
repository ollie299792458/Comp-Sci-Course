Tomb Raider, considered in and of itself, is an entertaining action film with a confusing story and one dimensional characters.  It maintains, however, absolutely no allegiance to the video game which gave it birth. Director Simon West admitted that he wanted to distance the film from the game because Lara Croft is an interesting person all by herself, but this is way beside the point.  The point is, this is a Tomb Raider movie, so it should have remained loyal to the game.  When the costume designer was asked why Angelina Jolie was not sporting Lara's traditional duds, she said that was Angelina's decision, because she doesn't like bright colors.  Excuse me, but since when do the capricious whims of slightly crazy actresses determine how a multi million dollar license is treated on film?  I was very disheartened at how the game was completely disrespected in this movie, not only in the outfits, but in little things like names and character histories.  If, however, you're just looking for a good action flick with a very attractive female lead role, then Tomb Raider will fit your bill.
