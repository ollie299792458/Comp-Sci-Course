Into the Blue was not a disappointment. The best part about INTO THE BLUE was the direction. Seriously. There were actually some scenes that looked like Walker and Alba maybe just learned their lines THAT DAY. Other scenes seemed smoother, but you could actually tell that the actors were not familiar with the material and the dialogue seemed stilted and like... well... being an actor myself... it seemed like they were struggling to remember what they had to say as they were talking.

Otherwise... the movie was actually really good and I credit the director, John Stockwell, who is also known for acting stints in Top Gun, Christine & My Science Project. FOR ONCE!! A DIRECTOR TREATED US LIKE WE ARE INTELLIGENT BEINGS AND DIDN'T CHEAT US! No, movies most important job isn't to inform, but they are supposed to be realistic. After watching INTO THE BLUE, I had a better understanding of the DIVE trade and it was completely necessary to move the movie along.

Stockwell did his homework. He cared about the audience and cared that they know what was going on. He didn't preach or bog the story down with diving lessons, he made diving and what they had to do part of the story.

Stockwell shot a beautiful movie with wonderful underwater scenes that are engrossing and sharp. Not to mention, necessary story movers.

Not only did he deliver the goods with the diving scenes, he delivered with a sharp story about modern day ocean pirates, club life, drug life and WHAT TRULY MAKES A person successful? Is it money? or is it Love?

You know what. I hope Hollywood stops giving these great idea movies to the Emmerichs and Bays of the worlds and starts giving more of these movies to people like Stockwell. Directors that don't insult our intelligence, do their homework and understand that movies have to be more than just an explosion here and there. It has to be sensible. Fine job and I'm looking forward to owning this one on DVD.
