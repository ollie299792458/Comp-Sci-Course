NOTE!!!..I'm reviewing the Saw Trilogy Box Set...not the Saw movies themselves!!!....Why buy this set????...Saw IV is playing on the big-screen as I speak...thus...you will have to buy it seperate from these 3!!!...or...you can wait about a year and buy the ultimate saw collection with all 4 movies included...probably while Saw V is in theaters...lol.!!!!!...because everyone knows that they will make as much money as they can off the 4 films...why do you think the director's cut of Saw 3 just released!!!!...instead of releasing it when the saw 3 first released!!!!...same with Saw and Saw 2....the uncut versions released later after the original releases...forcing those who already bought the dvds when they first came out, to sell their copies to buy the new un-cut versions!!!!...if you want the saw films....buy them seperately!!!! or else you'll be spending more money than it's worth...plus...if you buy Saw IV when it releases..it will not match the rest of the films!!!...and wait a year after saw IV comes to dvd to buy the uncut version of it..lol!!!
