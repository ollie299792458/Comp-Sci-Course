Weaver and Moore are the standouts here, especially Moore. The husband, played by David Strathairn, is an ineffectual, cardboard character to whom one cannot relate well. Although the film holds one's attention, it is not especially fulfilling when one reaches the end. I believe this is because there is no clear relationship between the elements of conflict (the drowned child, the false charges of child abuse brought by a parent against Alice, who is the school nurse, and her jailing as a result), and of resolution. We are allowed to experience very little of Alice's feelings of guilt and remorse (maybe she didn't have them?) over the death of a child in her care, and the interplay between Alice and the child's mother, who is also Alice's best friend, is limited mainly to a single intense confrontation. The friend goes away for a while and returns to read in the papers that Alice is in jail. She's a bit too ready to come to Alice's defense, perhaps; yet she remains the most human and believable character in the film. 
The film is also too long and drawn out, with zero comic relief. At the end I was exhausted but unfulfilled.
