I know it's just a movie, but I find it hard to believe most of the things in this movie could actually take place.  How could Amanda carry all her victims to their demise - How could she kidnap many of them in broad daylight - Who builds, maintains, and gets materials for all of the machines - how can Jigsaw install cameras in peoples' homes and also know everything about them? Amanda stated she built the shotgun bullet trap - yeah, sure.  Everything seems to work out perfectly and timed.  The husband must have a very low IQ as he is so slow to save any of the victims, by the time he does anything, they are dead, often standing there like an idiot for some time.  His wife is dying on the floor and he takes his sweet time to do anything.  Why couldn't she warn him that killing Jigsaw would result in her death? Many things happen in this movie that are scripted badly just so the story can come together in a neat little package.  P.S. I didn't know that getting your face smashed against a concrete wall 3 or more times is no big deal.
