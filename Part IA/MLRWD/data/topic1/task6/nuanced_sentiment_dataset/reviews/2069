The script and acting in this movie is boring and not worth watching.  Production quality is definitely up to par, but watching a competently staged and filmed movie that isn't well written or acted is not worth the effort.  It is especially sad when you compare it with its 1974 original which is funny, suspenseful and very well paced.  I love old movies, but often new productions are much easier to watch because modern production standards are really superior two those of most movies made in the 1960s and 1970s.  It has to be a really good movie to remain superior to later production with all the bells and whistles available to current producers and directors.  I can watch the 1974 Pelham 1 2 3 over and over again.  This 2009 version I refuse the watch again.  I can't understand why the 2009 version didn't use the best line in the 1974 version, "What do they expect for 35 cents, that they'll live forever?"  There's more humor in that line from the 1974 film than there is in the entire 2009 version.
