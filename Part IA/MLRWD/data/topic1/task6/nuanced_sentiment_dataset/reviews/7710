Fairly decent adaptation of the classic Greek saga, "Jason" tries to find an even balance between special effects,  dialogue and pacing - and succeeds for the most part. The CGI FX are actually impressive  to a degree as the winged Harpies look very menacing. With the inclusion of  an African and a women, the sailors of the Argo reflect todays Politically  Correct environment, not the actual historical world of Greece (I'm  surprised they didn't include a Hispanic, Asian and Homosexual). Anyway,  director Nick Willing ("Alice in  Wonderland") and writers  Matthew Faulk and Mark Skeet establish the journey's  purpose very  quikly, never allowing subplots to interfere with the quest.
  And  the voyage itself is exquisite. From rich Turkish locations, fertile  landscapes and  crystal bodies of water to elegant sets at London's  Shepperton Studios, "Jason"  takes nothing but lush routes  and vibrant paths. As the  maniacal monarch with an evil past,  Hopper is electric; MacFadyen and Williams  are naughty as the gods  who display ulterior motives; and the rest of the  supporting  players, especially Thompson, shine. Jason London is  tough and  handsome, but he often seems out of his league, sparring with vet  thesps like Jacobi and Cirian Hinds. Still, his boyish charm goes a long  way in  establishing sympathy for a motivated ruler-to-be.
All in  all a pretty decent film for Television.
