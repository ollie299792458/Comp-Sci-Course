The show is awkwardly charming at times, but William Shatner's greedy need to be a superhero with all the lines and all the action scenes drags the show down. I'm surprised he didn't demand the ability to fly on the show. Everytime a bad guy needs to get caught, Shatner sends his underutilized partner Adrian Zmed to do some menial chore, so he can be the hero (EVERY SHOW!). If this weren't bad enough, all the stories are basically the same; very uncreative. The show opens with the bad guys doing something bad, then Shatner and Zmed chase and lose them, then Shatner's superhero police skills slowly but surely lead him to the bad guys, then he tells Zmed to call for back up while he singlehandedly jumps on buses, grabs onto helicopters, uses sharpshooting skills, ju-jitsu skills, and his holier-than-thou speeches to get the "scumbags" and "maggots." If Adrian Zmed is lucky, he gets an action seen where he gets to tackle someone, or he gets shot in the arm by the bad guy. The show is totally ridiculous, totally repetetive, and simply a vehicle to propel William Shatner to Clint Eastwood-like status. I love the 80s, and I thought this would be good (I have good memories of it)...but it's pretty bad. Watch the pilot (it's very good), maybe the first 6 or 7 episodes (they're decent) and then move on to Airwolf or something.
