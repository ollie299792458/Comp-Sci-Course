Really really really!!! If we were to believe all that this man goes thru to be with his wife one would have to assume her eh "assets" are pure gold!!! having said that the move does hold you at times but then does sit there too. I found watching this movie I was screaming at the scream "alright already", just do it!!! The plot could have provided 2 paths that could have made it much more exciting. Instead of just trying to break his wife out of jail, he could have also tried to investigate who murdered the woman. His wife or someone else. This way as the day get closer that he is going to break his wife out of jail, at the same time he could be learning clues about who killed that woman. This would provide a better twist. He might be more torn if he finds out she did it or didn't do it, should he still break her out. but instead it takes too long for this pathetic fool to :"Get R Done"!!! I also kept wishing his character had a little more spine. I me talking about being 'P whipped"!!!

I would have been able to give this 4 stars if they cut it down to 1 hour 40 minutes instead of just over 2 hours. So far a 2 hour plus movie it gets a good 3 stars. Could have been much better.
