My little guys 4 and 2 were excited to watch this when it arrived.  We love to watch movies around our house.  They liked Marty the monkey and Gerard the giraffe the first few times but then the interest was gone.

The three short episodes portray three different parables of Jesus (The Workers in the Vineyard, The Wise and Foolish Builders, and The Lamp under the Bowl).  The stories were cute but seemed very vague for the small children to understand.  They might be great starting points for conversation with your children after reading the Bible passage and watching the video.  However, I think that by the time my children are really old enough to fully understand the passages and see the parallel with the video story Marty and Gerard will be of no interest to them.
