It's a fairy tale. But I really like this soundtracks that eases me.

Pippar had hair on entire her body when she was born. It might cause that her mother has been a drug addict.
She was raised like her mother's posession like Barbie.
When she was teenager, she eventually found that her mother was druged.
She was temporalily adopted by her aunt.
After that she was addicted by drugs, turned to be tramp and never went back home.
When she was at a party, she met Gilbert who is much older than her.
She fell in love with him.
After his wife left by using a gun, she got married to him.
She could quit druging and she tried to be a good wife for him.

After a few decades, the couple moved in a retirement communitee where a couple who both (Sum & Sandra)are their friends live after he had a few heart attacks.
They live with his son, Ben who's working hard to be a lawyer. Their daughter is a photographer.

Gilbert still can't accept that he's been getting old, he still tried to work hard after heart attacks.

One day her neighbor's son, Chris who is 35 came back home with a pitty reason. Pippa happned to see his tattoo.

And another day, Pippa found her awful behavior while she's been sleeping.

When she went to the office earlier than usual Pippa found Gilbert had had relationships with Sandra for long.
She was upset, she impulsively brought Chris's room with snacks.

Gilbert was soon unconsciously dying and hospitalized.
She could have an emotion to let him go with Chris's help.
After he died, she left her house and other heritages for somewhere with Chris by his car.

I couldn't see any agony to quit druging.
And it wasn't described that how she's overcome that her mother wasn't what she believed.
And I doubt she can stop being a tramp even after the marriage.
I can't see any realistic in this story, although Chris has been the sweetest.
