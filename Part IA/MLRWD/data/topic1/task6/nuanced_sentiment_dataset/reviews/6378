This is a very special five dvd set of Little House.If you enjoyed all the nine seasons that was on tv you will love this. I do recomend you watch the nine seasons first and the viewer will get a good understanding of this collectors edition. Its very warm ,sad indeed,and frustrating. Fate is a funny word to all these three movies that I saw. The first one is the story of Albert whos future is backed off when he wants to become a doctor is encounterd of a physical problem. The second one is when something happens to Amonso and Lauras little daughter Rose  when they by acidently leave it behind. The last one called the last Farewell is the ending of what happens to a town we all loved seeing becomes taken away. Its a real unplesant feeling when you put these three movies together. But it tells you something what could happen with out knowing. The packaging of the box set is really nice. Good photgraphs of the characters. It opens really nice.Comes with two bonus DVDS theres a quiz of Multiple choice questions to test your knowledge.There tricky! You should  think of the questions sometimes twice before answering. But there fun. I do recomend this set to all the Little House Fans.You will also love the interview of Melisa Gilbert very well presented how she talks about the program.Im glad I ordered this set it sure gave me memmories .
