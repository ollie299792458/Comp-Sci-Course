This film is a blatant rip-off of "Taxi Driver.' Like that film, we have a confused, sociopathic main character that lives outside reality, attempting to grasp any sense of the world around him by trying to save 'the girl.' He lives in a different time where a demented chivalry, like that of Travis Bickle, consumes his plight in life. The scene where Norton (Harlan) is getting drunk and stoned, talking to himself, flashing his gun, round and round, swishing about in his mind, is straight 'You talkin' to me?' The scene is over-played, and now over-done: 'You talkin' to me! I'm the only one here!' The only original and interesting sequence is when Harlan accidentally walks on to a western film set. His reality now comes to life as we are, (for a moment before the big showdown) transported back when men courted ladies and dosey-doed around their partner. It's a terrific scene where dream merges with reality and reality emerges from a dream. Norton is always compelling to watch with his subtleties as a great actor. I think his finest work can be found in '25th Hour' and 'Rounders.' Haven't seen 'Illusionist,' still waiting for 'Motherless Brooklyn.' If you haven't seen 'Taxi Driver' (and if you haven't you should be deported), watch that original film before settling on this.
