I went to see this movie with low expectations and found I was happily amused for the 2+ hours. It was fun, pure silly fun. Sure the plot wasn't really great and a lot of questions went unanswered, but I didn't really find myself caring. Hugh Jackman seemed to enjoy himself in the part even though it didn't really strecth him as an actor, David Wenhem had some of the funniest lines and Kate Beckinsale looked pretty. Dracula was quite decent, campy, but still enjoyable. There was a lot of CGI, but since this was directed by the same guy who did The Mummy/Mummy Returns I wasn't too surprised. The sets, costumes and locations were all gorgeous as well. I did find the accents a bit dodgy, but after a while it didn't really matter and besides, some of the old monster movie accents were equally as dodgy - perhaps this was a homage?
So, if you want a plot with all questions answered then you'll probably hate this film. But if you want an entertaining couple of hours on a rollarcoaster ride of a movie then this will probably fit the bill.
