Overall, I'd say it's worth watching. I bought it used, and am glad I did because now I own it and didn't have to pay the full price for it.

The book was, of course, much better, and that may be why I was slightly disappointed. The visual effects were kind of... well... they kind of sucked. The flying horse thing was ridiculous and I think it was the worst part of the film.

The Happy Medium was pretty bad too. I did like the three Mrs. W's, they did a surprisingly good job. Meg and Calivin did awesome as well. Charles Wallace, however, was kind of creepy at times and for the most part came off as a weird kid, even around his family. In the book, he seemed more cute and just quiet, not at all weird.

Instead of just skipping over some details like most movies based on books do, they also added things that didn't belong. I really wanted to see them make the stop on the 2-dimensonal planet, and was disappointed t osee that part missing.

The Tesseract could have been better, too. They explained it well in the movie, but I had imagined it a lot different. The way they showed it in the movie just looked like someone was on shrooms or drugs. The one where they were going through "IT" was kind of cool though.

Still, it was worth watching and I'd still recommend it, if at least for the sake of having a visual of the book.
