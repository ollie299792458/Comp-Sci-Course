Like the people on this site, I was anticipating the release of Shrek 2.  I was at the video store right when it opened to rent a copy.  I went into the movie thinking it was going to be better or at least just as good as the first.  I wasn't really content with the movie overall.  This sequel lacks what the first Shrek had.  I didn't find this movie funny.  I thought a few of the things said and done were clever, but nothing to make me laugh so hard that my sides would hurt.  I didn't care for the fairy godmother stuff.  That's used in tons of movies and in better form.  I was also ticked off about not being able to fast forward through the previews.  It's becoming tiring to have to sit and watch company movie advertisements all the time and not having the option of skipping them.  That option should never be disabled.  In my opinion, this movie was overrated and overhyped.  I can't believe the number of reviews on this site that claim it is so much better than the first.  I'm not seeing it.  I think it's average at the most.  I honestly can't see myself viewing it again, there's a slight possibility, but I would rather watch the first Shrek.  My mother loves Shrek and has viewed it numerous times, even she didn't like this sequel very much.  The positives to this movie would be the Far Away Idol in the DVD extras, the characters sing and then the viewer gets to choose who will become the next Idol, I thought that was cute and interesting.  I also liked the addition of Puss.  I really wanted to like this movie, but the negatives outweigh the positives here for me, sadly.  I would recommend renting this first since you may feel the same way as I do.  I wouldn't want to spend almost 20.00 or around there for a movie that I wouldn't view more than once or twice.
