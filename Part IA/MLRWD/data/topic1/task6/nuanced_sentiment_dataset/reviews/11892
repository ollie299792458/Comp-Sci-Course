I read the book, and then watched the movie. The movie was good, with a good portrayal of the book. Older movies often do, more so than more modern ones. In some cases this movie gave a more realistic portrayal than the book - an improvement. This was by not having anachronisms, like a clock striking, and wearing not hats but hoods. So, the movie gives one a good visual of the book's contents.

This movie has been colorized. There has been dislike and controversy about that. With broadmindedness and not being conservative about it, I don't see what's wrong with that. It's also an improvement on the old movies. (Just not of silent movies.) That's like the improvements on e.g. the 3 original Star Wars movies. I'd prefer to watch the colorized version of a movie. I did actually watch that version of this movie, which I have. It also looked like it was originally filmed in color. This DVD should also contain that version of the movie. The individual viewers could then decide for themselves which they want to watch. It's the same with other colorized movies like 'Scrooge' (1951), Casablanca (1942), etc.

I also read the book in modern English. These have been done by 'Shakespeare made easy' and 'Shakespeare 2000', of some of his plays. This is also an improvement, so that the plays e.g. can be enjoyed just as much today. The modern English is next to the original. The readers can again decide for themselves which to read. There could be this movie in modern English, if it was filmed recently. The original English makes me lose concerntration very easily.
