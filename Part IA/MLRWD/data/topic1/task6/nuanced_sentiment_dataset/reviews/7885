This movie has good points and bad points.  First the good points - Brendan Fraser, Keri Russell, and the young actors who portray their children in this film do a great acting job.  The movie leaves you with hope, inspiration, and applauding the determination of an extraordinary family.  The bad points - Harrison Ford quickly gets irritating.  In almost every scene it seems like he is yelling.  Also, the storyline is predictable - just read the title of the movie and you can figure out the ending.

The premise of the movie evolves around the Crowley family who have two children born with Pompe disease.  They are not expected to live past age nine, and the Crowley parents are desperately searching for anything that will help prolong the lives of or cure their children.  Enter Dr. Robert Stonehill, a research scientist from Nebraska with the potential answer to their problem.  Joining forces, the Crowleys and Dr. Stonehill battle the medical community and seemingly insurmountable obstacles to race against time and try to save children suffering from Pompe disease.

This movie has many uplifting moments and feel-good scenes.  The fact that it is also based on real-life circumstances helps makes the movie inspirational.  However, as you watch the film, you will already feel like you know everything that is going happen, which makes the movie slightly dull.  Even so, it's definitely a watchable film.
