I received the first copy of this on December 8th, and observed the packaging was poor, very flimsy and the plastic trays which were not fastened to the underlying cardboard well were already working their way loose or had popped off completely.  I loaded disk one and sat down prepared to be impressed by this latest incarnation of this collection of films and selected the DTS version of the 2003 version of Alien.  On the first chapter in the scene at the table during the heated argument about the change in course of the ship to intercept the Alien ship beacon, the DVD locked-up.  I did a fast forward and it locked up again later in the next chapter.  I had Amazon.com send me another copy, this time 4 plastic trays had already worked their way loose, and fell on the floor immediately after I removed the shrink wrap.  I loaded the first disk again and selected the DTS version of the 2003 version of Alien, same issue, same chapter same scene, this disk keeps locking up.  
Mind you I have the industry acclaimed Denon 2900 player ($1,000.00 list) which has performed flawlessly on the hundreds of movies; not one issue ever.  Couple that with the fact that I have now gone through 2 copies with identical flaws has lead me to conclude that this set is not worth it.  There is clearly a technical issue at least with the first disk, coupled with the fact that the packaging is cheap junk.  Avoid this boxed set until each movie is released separately from what I have read that will be in 01/2004.
