I was a little leery about buying this import title from Amazon because I was not sure where it was from and if it was all region or not.  Well, let me tell you, it is a fantastic Blu-Ray all the way around!

This Blu-Ray version comes from:

- TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT SOUTH PACIFIC, AUSTRALIA
- ALL REGION

It comes in a slightly wider Blu-Ray case than the US Blu-Rays but basically looks the same.  It is the same height and depth as all of your other cases, it is just about 1 1/2 times wider.  It also comes in a cardboard style slip-case.  I also have "Almost Famous" from the UK and that title is in the same slightly wider case.

The picture was just fantastic and as good as any Blu-Ray I have in my collection or that I have rented.  The sound was also really great.  The DTS-HD MASTER AUDIO is pristine and one of the best sounding soundtracks I have heard yet.  Plenty of clean LFE especially in the music scenes.

The video and audio included on the disc are as follows:

- English DTS-HD Master Audio
- French DTS 5.1
- German DTS 5.1
- English Commentary DD 2.0

The video is presented in the 2.40:1 aspect ratio and I don't know for sure but would assume AVC.

It is a BD-50: Dual Layer Disc

There is a second disc of special features.  I did not put this disc in because I personally don't care about most special features.  But it is a two-disc set.

Great movie (5 out of 5), (10 out of 10) or (4 stars of 4 stars).  Whichever method of rating you use, this is as close to a perfect biopic as you can get.

If you want to wait for the US BD version... go ahead.  If you love this movie and can't wait to see it in the best available format...

I can highly recommend this Aussie Import version.
