This beautiful sentence, spoken by beautiful Claudia Cardinale, is the key to the entire movie. This is the story of a sweet, and yet intense madness. Fitzcarraldo (a splendid Klaus Kinski) wants to bring the Grand Opera to the Amazon river, and wants Caruso to open the new theater. The task is impossible, and yet as the movie develops we discover a kinship with this great, mad character. He is not the only dreamer in the movie. His girlfriend Molly shares the dream, and even his old employee, still tending to an abandoned railway station in the midst of the forest, is a dreamer. The movie is about the strength of desire, and as such we all feel connected to Fitzcarraldo, as he actually tries to move a mountain to build his opera house. At the end, he won't be able to build the theater, but he will come home with a victory of sort. The final, moving, scene sees Fitzcarraldo and Molly coming home on a boat which has been transformed into a floating theater. As Herzog writes in the script to the movie "[Fitzcarraldo] is entering Iquitos, a royal entrance, and he brings with him the Grand Opera. AND THIS MAKES HIM HAPPY." The happiness is clear on the face of Kinski, and concludes one of the most touching, and impressive movies ever filmed. The music (mostly by Popol Vuh) is a great companion to the majestic scenes in the Amazon river. The dialogue is tight, and no sentence is superfluous. The intensity of the characters will captivate any viewer. Definitely, a movie to see over and over again.
