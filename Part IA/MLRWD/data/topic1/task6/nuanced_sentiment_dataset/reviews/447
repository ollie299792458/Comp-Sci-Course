executive decision was a very fine movie.i saw it in the theater three times. so i remember every thing and every scene. especialy the one's with halle barry. oh what a woman but!!!!.
wait a minute isn't the director supposed to say cut when the movies being filmed not when it's already been shown in theaters all around america. this is the most chopped up film i've ever seen! it's a shame. there are about five key scenes cut out of this movie shortening it's lenth by about 12 to 16 minutes.they are very important ones.like when they setup the infrared lighting system. that's cut. or when they have to move the leader of the team "joe morton' after his back is injured and they have to carry him on a strecher through the plane to get to the device they cut the part out where they actually move him. all of the sudden he's at the device.there are too many cut's in this film to justify a purchase but if they do come out with a full lenth version of this film i will for sure be inline to get my dvd.
