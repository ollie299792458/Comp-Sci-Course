Yes, the DVD's sound could have been better. It should have had subtitles and widescreen too.

I first saw this on PBS. My roommates and I were mesmerized and couldn't wait for the next episode. I love Livia - what a woman! I understand why the historical Augustus was mesmerized by her (and he wasn't a weak man by any stretch). That woman is got to be one of the best actresses I seen ever. Derek Jacobi plays a perfect bumbling/stammering/doltish/club-footed Claudius (and he fooled them all to boot!) and John Hurt the perfect psychotic Caligula.

I loved the Senator's wives being used as prostitutes scene where Claudius is the gatekeeper. It truly was absolutely hilarious.

Again, this is one of the BEST series I've ever seen. No action, just fantastic acting and script. For those with an IQ above room temperature mind you.

Finally, if you're into constant stimuli like a ADHD 10-year old and with the attention span of a gnat this won't be for you.
