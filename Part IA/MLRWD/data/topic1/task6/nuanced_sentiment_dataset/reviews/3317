I had the privilege of seeing Trick 'r Treat at the Portage Theater in Chicago just under a week ago.  Previously, I'd seen the trailer.  I'd seen a sneak peak of the scene involving Sam and Mr. Kreeg.  So, going in, I knew this was going to be great but I had no idea just how awesome it would end up being.  Folks, this is an instant classic.  This is going to be the one you watch every Halloween (along with Halloween).
Trick 'r Treat keeps you guessing and most of the time, you're going to be wrong.  Every so often, I'd lean over to a friend and lay out a prediction as to how a scene would play out.  I was pleasantly surprised and happy to be wrong.
It's becomes clear pretty early on that this movie doesn't pull its punches.  It's rotten to the core but also lots of fun.  You will believe these characters.  You'll be pleased at how seamless Trick `r Treat comes together.
Do yourselves and writer/director Mike Dougherty a solid--pick this up on October 6th.  Show Hollywood that this is the kind of creative output we want from the slasher and horror genres.  That we're sick of Saw.  That we want something more real, more appealing, more original.
