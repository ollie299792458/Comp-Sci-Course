I went into this movie expecting it to be really bad from the reviews I had read in the newspapers, but to my surprise I found it to be a sweet, funny and tuneful film.  Yes, it's no Some Like it Hot or Victor/Victoria, it's obvious influences, and lacks those movies witty dialogue, but it's quite fun to watch. Vardolos and Colette are picture perfect as talented performers stuck in a bad lounge act at a local airport, until they witness a mob hit and have to go on the lam. They end up auditioning as drag queens at a neighborhood bar in West Hollywood and winning over the audience with their performance. Their act takes off, and soon they're the hit of the local gay cabaret circuit. Along the way they fall in love, talk the bar owner into turning the bar into a dinner theater and finally foil the killers. One of the runniest running gags in the movie is the hit man the mob sends out to find C & C goes to every dinner theater he can find and it seems that every one of them is performing the show "Mame".  Another great bit is when Connie and Carla perform their rendition of Don't Cry for Me, Argentia, the whole bar erupts into the chorus with them, complete with the Evita arms.  Very funny. Anyway, just watch this movie for it's sheer enthusiasm and energy. It's delightful.
