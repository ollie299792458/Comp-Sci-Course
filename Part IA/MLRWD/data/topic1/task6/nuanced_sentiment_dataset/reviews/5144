For anyone who has ever seen HIGH ANXIETY, the review title instantly brings to mind one of the most brilliantly funny scenes in this or any Mel Brooks comedy.  I refer, of course, to Brooks' masterfull spoof of the famous "shower scene" from Hitchcock's PSYCHO.  For those who have not experienced HIGH ANXIETY, if you purchase this movie to witness that sequence, you will not regret it.

HIGH ANXIETY features Mel Brooks and his familiar cast of comedy allstars in an intelligently written, hilarious spoof of the Alfred Hitchcock mysteries.  From PSYCHO, to THE BIRDS, NORTH BY NORTH WEST and VERTIGO, few Hitchcock classics are spared from Brooks' reworking.  It's all spun together into a nice little murder plot.

HIGH ANXIETY is a must for any fan of Mel Brooks, or of intelligent comedy that makes you think.  I am somewhat at a loss to understand why one of Brooks' best films is not available in the DVD format though.  But, this VHS version is very affordable and has good picture and sound (for a VHS).
