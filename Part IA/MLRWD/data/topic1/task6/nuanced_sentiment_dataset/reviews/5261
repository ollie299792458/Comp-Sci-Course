First of all, all anime fans should delve into the world of Card Captor Sakura.  It's an absolutely brilliant series filled with cute, charismatic characters who immerse you into this surreal world of magic with a touch of realism (in terms of the settings, of course).  Put it simply, it's great for any anime fan-especially the shoujo anime-phile (like me).
These four episodes continue the embryonic stage of the series and introduce a new character-Li Syaoran-in the process.  He poses a greater challenge to Sakura, but remains a dark cloud in Sakura's ambiguities.  It's just the beginning of something much, much more.
But, with all the praise I'm giving this series, the way Pioneer releases the DVD irks me.  Pioneer adds little to take advantage of the technology.  For this DVD, they only added a non-credit ending of "Groovy" as a "bonus feature."  And in the same section, you select the subtitles (wow, having the option of having the subtitles on or off is a grreeat bonus).  It just doesn't give you much incentive to buy the DVD and fork out an extra 5-10 dollars.  But then again,we don't buy DVD's for the bells and whistles (at least I hope so):  We buy them for the movie (ooo, innovative concept).  It's just that I'm the kind of guy that wants a little more on the pricier plate.  But, I'm such a DVD-phile, it's doesn't really matter.  I'm only pointing it out because these DVD's have so much potential to elevate it's status even higher.  I'm disappointed with that only.
Well, if I had to pick between a VHS or DVD version, I would pick the DVD version without hesitating.  However, it's basically the same whichever media format you choose.  Just don't expect much with the DVD version.
