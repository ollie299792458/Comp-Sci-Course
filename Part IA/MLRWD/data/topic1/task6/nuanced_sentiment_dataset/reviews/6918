The stories are great, I couldn't stop watching until they were over. However, the packaging sucks. It was very difficult to get the discs out of the package, and I had to keep them in a disc sleeve until I was done watching each disc. I got the blu-ray version because, when I did, the blu-ray discs were cheaper than the regular DVD's. The discs would hang up fairly often and the only was to back the disc up, or cut power and re-start, then skip to the point where it hung up. This would not happen at the same spot twice, so the problem may be with my player. However, the navigation on the discs is very poor. I would think that a company with so much experience with DVD's as Universal would be able to create good navigation.

I will buy season 2 when it comes out if the stories continue as good as they seem to be now, but probably not the blu-rays.

I will give this an overall review of 3 stars, although the stories rate 5 stars, but the packaging and navigation don't.
