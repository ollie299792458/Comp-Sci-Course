Others have commented on the decent quality of the DVD's in this set. The copy I just bought, has four movies on the first DVD and a single, Golden Earrings on the second. When I opened the container, before even removing the second DVD, I saw some light scratches on the playable side, which was face up. They appeared to have come from a defective plastic holder, which had four slightly raised small bumps at the four cardinal points of the circle. I think these protuberances rubbed against the disk itself during shipment and marred the surface. However, the movie at least played OK, which is good because that was the movie I really wanted to see again, having first seen it when it was released in 1947.

Another sign of cheap production was the complete lack of any information about contents on the DVDs themselves. The producers spared no possible cost cutting to put these out. At least there was a list on the DVD box itself.

I would return this to Amazon, but I suspect that the same defect exists in more samples. If you do buy this set, check carefully for scratches before playing.
