LOL.. I'm a 41 year old, single mother of 2 young boys and probably NOT the target audience of this movie. I went into this movie when a friend misread the movie times for "Hollywoodland" (okay, stop laughing ;).  So we decided to see this on a whim.

Yes, there is tons of violence, drug use, public sex and an unnecessarily placed ditzy girl in this film but all I could think of after I left the film was that, even though I was unsure if I really enjoyed the movie or not, it was undeniable that I had just left a movie that was a the first of a new genre that we'll probably see more of in the future. It will be interesting to see how this may all evolve in the future.

So yes, this is worth watching... if at the very least you are interested in being educated on the source that started a new genre of film. Although IMO.. DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS.  I am a mother that does let my kids (ages 10 & 15) watch certain R rated films, but this is NOT an appropriate film for anyone under 18, and I believe should have been rated NC-17.
