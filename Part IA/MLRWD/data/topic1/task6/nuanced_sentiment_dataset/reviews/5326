there was no need for this movie.  While i like LL Cool J and liked him in this movie and Chris Klein (as Jonathon Kross)  was pretty good, the rest was pretty mediocre.  a story of the new sport of rollerball where our hero Jonathon, played by the previously mentioned Chris Klein, is resting his hopes that the NHL will call when he runs into Marcus Risley, played by LL Cool J.
  Jonathon gets talked into going to the fast rising sport in Russia called rollerball and not only does he join but he becomes the top star and posterboy.  to further boost ratings the league starts promoting violence.  of course jonathon fights this and there in lies the point of contention.
  i felt the editing fo the movie was choppy and most importantly they never really explained the rules of the game.  i never knew anything about rollerball as a sport.  it was the heart of the film (and the title) and yet they never gave it a minute to show the audience what it was all about.
  part hockey, part lacrosse and part sci-fi fantasy future sport that had crowds to their feet on screen but managed to bore me.  if this sport is so good, why not explain it.  draw the vierwer in and make him love it.  the writing was bland and the flow of the movie was anti climatic.
  i see most other reviewers did not like it.  how did anyone like this movie?  believe the naysyers and seek greener pastures elsewhere.
