The two stars are for the Blu-ray, not the film itself, which I love and would happily give 5 stars.

Other Blu-ray reviewers have referred to a "soft" picture. Actually it is literally *pixelated*.

If you take a close look at high-contrast edges, like the names of the actors during the opening title sequence, you can plainly see big blocky pixels that are far too large for 1080p. Based on that, and some occasional frame-blending artifacts, it is clear that the source transfer for this disc was a standard-def telecine (60i) like what would be broadcast on cable networks. The authors of this disc took that old SD master and did an inverse telecine pass to remove the pulldown/interlacing and get a 24p SD master. (Unfortunately there were a few errors at edit points, causing the aforementioned frame-blending.)  Then it was upscaled to 1080p, but they didn't even do an interpolation algorithm, it's just nearest-neighbor pixel doubling. Yuck!

I will give it an extra star because (1) it's usually very cheap and (2) it's way better than the DVD. There are none of the old compression artifacts or edge enhancement here. But for a Blu-ray, it's very disappointing. It's barely worth the 8 bucks I spent on it.

Also I have to disagree with those who complained about the black levels. The contrast is fine, it's just that the film itself seems to have been shot in a run-and-gun medium-budget style that did not emphasize rich cinematography. There might be a little bit more range to eke out color-wise from the original film negative, if WB will ever break out the wallet and pay for a new transfer, but I'm betting there isn't much more depth to be had.
