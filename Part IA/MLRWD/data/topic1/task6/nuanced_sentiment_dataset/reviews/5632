Season Two of Star Trek: The Next Generation shows glimpses of greatness but It's not until Season Three that TNG really caught its stride. The Borg are Introduced in Q Who, one of Season two's finest episodes . The Measure of a Man is also a great episode foreshadowing much of the Character development Data would undergo throughout the Series.  The Emissary would help flesh out Worfs background and give us some much needed insight into what made him tick. Jonathen Frankes was given a greater amount of leeway in his portayel of Riker. Which brought about a more colorful and humorous character instead of the stoic Riker of Season One. Riker also greaw a beard which also helped add warmth to the Character. Of the More notable additions Whoopie Joined the Cast as the memorable Guinan. The shows sets started to evolve as the budjet grew which resulted in a less sterile look. 
I found this Box set to be good but not great. The Box set contains more extras than season one but thats not saying much. I enjoyed seeing the props and going through Star Trek's vault but what you see is all to brief. The Other Features suffer the same fate. They take what could easily be an hour feature and split it up into tiny pieces so that they can give you the Illusuion that your getting a lot more than wahts really there. The Features I would like to have seen include commentary tracks, deleted scenes, bloopers and Episode preveiws. I guess beggers cant be choosers but I hope that Paramount does a better job with the later season box sets in the Features department. As For the visual and audio quality of the disks, not bad. The Audio has been remastered in 5.1 Surround Sound ( applause here. ) All in all a good set but with definite room for Improvement.
