Man was I ever excited when I learned that this Harryhausen classic was coming out in color. I wished for years that it would happen.When I learned that the Master himself was supervising the color scheme of his own film, I was estatic! Simply put, the color version is spectacular! Legend Films did a tremendous job with their computer colorization technique.This is the best transfer,in terms of depth and clarity I've seen. I have the Criterion laserdisc version and the most recent black & white DVD version.The 50th Anniversary Edition blows those away! The color looks so natural and exact that you'd think it was shot in color.What's really amazing is how much more Alien the Ymir appears.In B&W the Creature blends with all the other life forms..In color It stands out as truely not of this Earth.Another cool effect the color brings out is the blood on the elephant during the clash with the Ymir.It creates a real viceral feeling as opposed to the black color in the original version.The bonus disc does not dissapoint.Wonderful interviews and commentaries from Ray's many admirers and the fantastic recollections from Ray are worth the price of admission.I can't wait to get ahold of his other movies now being colorized.I noticed that many reviews point out that there is a toggle icon that stays on the screen.I don't get that on my screen at all.Maybe because I have a Sony DVD VCR recorder combo player.I guess Sony rewards customers who play their DVDS' on their equipment. I have to go now so I can watch it again.Only 19 Million times to go!
