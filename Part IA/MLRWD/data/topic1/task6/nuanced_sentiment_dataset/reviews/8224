Some scenes in this movie were really funny and Katherine Heigl is a beautiful, great actress and the guy is funny, his friends are hilarious but other than that I really did not like this at all. Successful beautiful career lady meets funny laid back loser at night club, one night stand, "knocked up". Then the rest of the movie is all this utter dreck about bringing the bastard child into the world. The two women turn completely psycho, the two men go to Las Vegas to have the time of their life with magic mushrooms and strip clubs (wow what fun) and a graphic birth scene at the end (such comedy) People need to stop bringing unplanned unwanted children into the world because it is already 10X more overpopulated than is sustainable and humans are destroying all of it, they are destroying everything. The married couple with 2 kids are miserable, why didn't they learn from their mistake. Well if they got an abortion then no movie I guess.  So couples if you get knocked up right after meeting the first time and a night of passion, don't be irresponsible, TAKE CARE OF IT, get an abortion, Mother Earth will thank you, the other animals will thank you and maybe in the next century there will still be blue skies, clean water, trees and animals left for WANTED children to enjoy, kids brought into the world on purpose by parents that are married and really love each other.
