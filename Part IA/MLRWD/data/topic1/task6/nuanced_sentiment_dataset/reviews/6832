I know Robin Williams isn't everyone's favorite, but I've always been drawn to his quick-witted style.  I didn't have high expectations for this film, primarily because it didn't do so well at the box office (I think it closed before I even realized it was out in theaters!).

But, since we were in the doldrums between the end of the new spring TV shows and the start of the summer season of new offerings, I figured it was worth $3.95 to pass a couple of hours.  I wasn't disappointed, but I definetly won't be adding to my permanent DVD collection either.

The storyline had so much potential to be a political satire loosely based on a Jon Stewart-type personality becoming President, that I actually caught myself enjoying it.  But just when I thought they'd bring down the house, the pulled the rug out from under me by ruining it with computer-election fraud.  C'mon people, were you afraid someone was going to take you seriously? As if!

I won't give any more away lest I spoil it for someone else (if I haven't already), but if you want to see it, don't let me discourage you.  It's worth $4 bucks, but I'd wait until Target knocks it down to under $10 to buy it...and only buy it if you absolutely have to have every single movie Robin Williams has ever been in.  Otherwise, you won't miss it.
