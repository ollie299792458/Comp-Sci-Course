Sibling rivalry can often start from the very beginning. A new "bundle of joy" comes into the family and unknowingly creates competition for attention with their newly christened older brother or sister. In this case, it's a brother named, you guessed it, Joshua. He seems to be taking all the changes really well, though! I mean, Joshua could easily skip two grades as he continues to excel in school. He proves his piano lessons have paid off tenfold by busting out a Beethoven sonata at ya. And he always acts so mature and well-mannered... shall I emphasize on the word "acts" now or later? Whoops, already did. Yep, Joshua's got his own ideas about the family unit most suitable for him, and he's willing to make the changes himself... You may have to wait awhile to see what the evil little rascal attempts and/or accomplishes, as different subplots take center stage a little too often, though it does add to Joshua's feelings of being ignored, even unloved (of course, when you see him, say, prepare a stuffed animal for mummification, you ponder if he should be ignored a bit). A decent off-shoot of the "Bad Seed" type subgenre with a few creepy and unsettling moments, but the "downbeat" storytelling card may have been laid on the table one too many times. 5.25/10
