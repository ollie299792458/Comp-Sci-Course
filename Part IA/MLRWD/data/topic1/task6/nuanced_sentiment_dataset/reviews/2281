As a big fan of Guy Ritchie's earlier films, Revolver was a let down.

The plot was well thought out, and most of the cast did a superb job.  This might be one of the best performances by Jason Statham.  I would give this move a good recommendation with reservations.

There are a couple of things that ruin this movie.  Ray Liotta seem out of his element in this role, he just doesn't come across as real as the other characters in the film.  In the middle of the film there were a couple of action sequences that cut to animation and this really distracted from the feel of the film.  When I got to the end, it unfolded just like I thought it would.  The big surprise at the end of the movie was really easy to figure out.

If you are a fan of Jason Statham or relly like dark films about gangsters, you will probably enjoy this film.  If you want something with a little more substance, skip revolver and check out Snatch.  It is another Guy Ritchie film and much better than Revolver.
