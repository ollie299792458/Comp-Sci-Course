I bought this because I only was able to watch part of the series when it aired, I wanted to have a complete set (I had Season 1 on DVD) and this set was on a spotlight deal at good price from Amazon.  I had hoped the packaging problems reported in reviews had been corrected.  Sadly they have not been corrected.

This is a problem I have seen several times with DVD's.  The "Art Department" designs a great looking package for the complete series offering, but forgets that people have to be able to get the disc's in and out of this package without damaging them.  Instead of plastic holders for each disc there are very tight paper pockets for each disc.

What I found when the set arrived is that every disc had scratches on it, 6 had glue on them (which is a 3D contamination that could easily damage your DVD or bluray player) and two of the paper pockets that hold the disc were torn.  I am returning this set (another trip to UPS) and have purchased the individual seasons (2 thru 8) for about the same price as the complete series cost.  If any of the individual season boxes have a problem I will just return that season for a replacement.  I lose out on the bonus disc, but I get much better packaging of each individual season.  Why can't the companies that make these things learn that they must be disc and user friendly?
