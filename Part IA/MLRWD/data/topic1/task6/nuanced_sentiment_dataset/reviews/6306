I have wondered for so long why the classic 1930s/1940s Universal monster films were out of print. These are (to try not to use an overused description) really classic films. These were mainstays of my Saturday afternoon monster features on TV when I was a kid. Well, finally we're seeing the re-releases, and a great set of packages, too.

The true gem of the Mummy series is the original. No modern day photo trickery and CGI can compete with the truly scary visual of Karloff's illuminated eye close ups as Ardeth Bey! The entire story is wonderfully compelling, and has remained one of my favorites of the Universal series over the years.

The Kharis mummy versions are fun, no doubt about that, but a foot dragging mummy surviving on tana leaves while searching for his lost princess Anaka pales to the Karloff interpretation of love lost and life sacrificed. Still, I was very pleased to see the inclusion of these films in the package, along with the bonuses, and really a very attractive sales price. My video tapes from over-the-air broadcasts of these films can finally be retired.

As for some of the other Universals, I held back on Dracula as I have the prior DVD which includes the extended groaning at the finale, something missing on the re-release. And I paid a slight premium for Frankenstein on an out of print DVD; but I may add these collections at a later date.

If you're a fan of the Universal monster machine of this time period, there is no reason not to add them to your collection.
