Finally the DVD documentary that Flair fans have been waiting for! Well, not quite... The documentary part leaves areas uncovered and focuses more on the successes of Flair rather than exploring many controversies surrounding his career. Case in point:
-The reason why he didn't have a real program with Hulk in 1992
-His riot matches in Puerto Rico
-His opinion on Bret Hart
-The nWo Horsemen skit
-His 'feud' with Scott Steiner
-His fallout with Bischoff
-etc, etc
All those things are NOT properly covered in the DVD. Now the matches... Part entertaining, part laughing stock puts it best! A match with Jack Brisco in front of 30 people? Yes, they got that! Hahaha On disc 2, Ric wins one match out of 6! Ric Flair is the greatest just because he was the only one who would do jobs for anybody in a period when egos were overinflated! Ever heard: 'He could have made a broomstick look good'? Impossible! A Ric Flair match is 40% stalling and 55% selling... He couldn't amount any offense if his life depended on it! And I don't see him pretending to be hit by a broomstick! Oh well, I can actually (and he'll probably get color too)! Granted he's been in a lot of 60 min broadways that happened to include 15-20 minutes of wrestling spread throughout the stalling, but this is no Bret/Michaels 60-minute type match!

On the plus side, watch the Harley Race/Flair match on Disc 2 and try not to laugh... I defy you!

So 2 stars out of 5 for historical and camp value! Whoooo!
