Well, just got thru watching the signal and now I understand why it never came out in theaters. The story goes like this: a strange signal from who knows where(we nver find out)begins emitting thru the T.V. and phones around the world(we assume)and starts making people go crazy and killing each other.Sounds like a good story and could have been alot better but here our the movies flaws. First, the movie starts off being a straight up suspense/horror movie then for some reason half way thru turns into a comedy/horror then goes to a straight horror. It was like the director(or in this case directors) did not know which direction they wanted to take the movie.I guess thats what happens when you have three different people directing one movie.Second, you never see whats going on in other cities or places. This movie could have been much better with a deeper plot.And third, the ending really sucked. I won't give it away but lets just say it leaves to much unansered and ends way to fast. So all in all, I cannot recommened this film.I would of gave it one star but I gave it two because I like the part where he puts the guys head in a vice grip .I thought that was funny as hell and the only part that was entertaining. I really don't understand why some people think this was such a great movie? I guess they have yet to see a really good horror movie.
