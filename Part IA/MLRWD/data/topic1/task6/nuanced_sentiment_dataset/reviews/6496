The good: A cute host and beautiful camera work in exotic locales.

The bad: The entire narrative that is presented with each episode is fake.  Verifiably fake.  Admitted-to-by-the-crew-fake.  There is an official crew of 32 people, not counting consultants, and including *four* directors.  In the Sierras ep, their survival consultant said that the "wild horses" that Bear tries to ride were shipped in from Nevada.  On the desert island, his raft was built by a survival consultant, not him; it took her a week and a half, and she used rope.  When he was "alone" on the raft, according to director Graham Strong, "we" beat on the raft to scare away the sharks (they also had a diver checking for sharks when Bear jumped in).  Bear has admitted to wearing a life jacket under his shirt in a Rockies river (the camera work tries to hide it, and he removes it before and after the swim off-camera), and to learning his survival skills 2 days before the ep (unsurprising, since he usually does them wrong).  It goes on and on.  The narratives presented are simply not real.

Furthermore, the advice is often quite bad.  If you doubt this, go to a survival forum and mention "Man vs Wild".  Be prepared for tirades against the show.  He advices you to do things like drink urine, which is advised against by more experts than you can shake a stick at, including the head of a urological organization and even the US Army Field Manual.  He claims things like coconut oil protecting you from the sun (it provides so *little* sun protection that it's used in tanning lotions).  And on, and on.

If you want to see a cute guy eat gross things in beautiful settings, this is the show for you.  Otherwise, it isn't.
