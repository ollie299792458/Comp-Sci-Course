What a wasted chance. The first 15 minutes of Untraceable are professional, authentic and eye-opening. You really feel as if it is going to be a good movie. Diane Lane is a great actress and has demonstrated this in plenty of films. The killer's set-ups are terrifying and the way his style of killing implicates our neurotic voyeuristic culture is profound. Unfortunately, the police aspect of the investigation is terribly bad. After watching shows such as Criminal Minds with their professional profiling techniques, the blundering police, naysaying superiors and immature language and behavior of Detective Box (whom you may remember as Gary Matheson from Season 2 of 24) really bring down the quality of the feature. If the film makers wanted to make a comment about the difficulty of FBI/Local Police Cooperation, they should have fleshed those angles out better than hope that the quality of the killer's little cyber dungeon would carry the day. It's gut-wrenching to think of what might of happened if the writers had put just as much energy to the investigative methods as it did to almost glorifying the killer's methods by dedicating so much film time to him. If you watch this , make sure it is 99 cents for 2 night at your local rental place. Otherwise you'll surely feel robbed.
