The dark comedy "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" is by far one of Bette Davis's best performances, gaining her an Oscar nomination.  The movie starts in 1917 as child star Baby Jane Hudson is singing for her  many fans an eerie, yet amusing-sounding song entitled "I've Written a  Letter to Daddy," and also shows some of the behind-the-scenes events  that take place with the child [and her family].  The next scene is in 1935  when Jane's sister, Blanche (played by Joan Crawford), has evolved into a  beautiful woman, and also the new talent of the family; she has become a  very successful actress.  However, There is an accident, of which Jane is  held accountable, and Blanche is crippled for life.  The final jump in  time is to "Yesterday" (as it is called in the movie), with  Blanche in a wheelchair and Jane as her caretaker.  They live in an old  mansion where Blanche is blocked off from the rest of the world, and Jane  terrorizes her, apparently as revenge for having to take care of the sister  she hates.  This current week, a television station is having a  "Blanche Hudson Marathon," making Blanche more and more desired  by the public to be seen.  Enraged with jealousy, Jane terrorizes Blanche  more than ever, starving her and taking the phone, her last  "window" to the outside world, away from her.  As all this  unfolds, Jane goes from an old, cruel, drunken woman to a childlike maniac,  trying to relive the days when she was famous.  "...Baby  Jane" has many turns and surprises, right until the very end.  The  chemistry between Davis and Crawford is, peculiarly, almost real (hmmm...).  The film is not rated; however, some scenes are objectionale for  children [crude language (not often) and semi-graphic violent images/sounds  (often)].
