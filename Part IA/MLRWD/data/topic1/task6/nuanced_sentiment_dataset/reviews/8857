The film isn't awesome but it's not that bad.  What I find annoying is most of the geek Batman fan base seem to forget that this is a COMIC BOOK SERIES not some indie flick or gritty feature film.  That being said, I do agree the script sucks a lot of the time and as much as I love Uma, her take on Poison Ivy isn't awesome, same with the Bayne character but it is a comic book and the Bane was fairly true to the comic book.  Nolan's films also benefit greatly from CGI, which was still in it's infancy when this film was made.

I personally liked Arnold's take on Mr. Freeze, I felt he did a great job even if the film was lacking at times and I'm not the biggest Schwarzenegger fan.  I also like Alicia Silverstone's take on Batgirl.  It's not really her fault the story line sucked at times.

I don't buy Clooney as Batman that much but I felt he really delivered as Bruce Wayne.  I find he and Christian Bale to be the weakest Batman out of any of all the films.  That being said, Clooney blows away Bale as an all around actor and his body of work buries Bale's and I actually like Bale in a number of his films.

It's not an awesome film but it's not that bad and if you have kids, it's a great film for them and you to enjoy together.

The Nolan films while decent, I have found to be greatly over hyped.  His films have benefited from a lot of technology that wasn't around in the late 80s and early 90s or as I mentioned previously, was in their infancy stages.
