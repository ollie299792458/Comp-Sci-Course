In George Eells, book " Final Gig" , he talks about Gig Young Finally getting that coveted Oscar for " They Shoot Horses..Dont  They" For a normal person this victory would have been a new episode  in a career. For Gig Young it was just a footnote.
The casting of Gig  Young in this film was a great break . The nuance he brought to the  character of Rocky had all the fatalistic ingredients.
The cast is  uniformly superb..and I think this is Jane Fonda,s best performance. She is  a totally cynical and self destructive person on her way to tragedy and  could care less. Her moments with Young are priceless. Their ineteractions  and facial close ups are devastating. Bruce Dern shows again another very  eccentric job in his role and Michael Sarrazin is fine as a free soul who  is wandering through life.
Staging and Cinematography have yet to be  matched in a film like this. The dance of life and the dancers plight are  bared to the audience culminating in both a shattering conclusion and an  unending shallow promise to the audience..for the continuation and lunacy  of life in that period ..Brilliant Film
