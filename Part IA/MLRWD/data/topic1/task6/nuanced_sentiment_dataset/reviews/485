Finally a dvd version depicting both the director's cut and theatrical versions of this fine film. It starts off as kind of sequel to Evil Dead 2, with Bruce Campbell's character Ash trapped in Medieval time after narrowly escaping with his life after fighting the deadites in Evil Dead 2. What follows is him being captured at first by the villagers, then helping the villagers to fight the deadites. Using his knowledge of 20th century weaponry and science makes him able to give the dead what for.

This is an alltime classic, hilarious scenes involving Ash's sheer ignorance towards vital instuctions, his confrontation with his evil self, and the last scene in the theatrical version at the s-mart.

Bruce Campbell as always is fun as the chainsaw/shotgun wielding hero, who is short on brains but makes up for it in bravery and skill; who uses quips and one liners on the deadites as well as force. Embeth Davidtz is really good and believable as Ash's medieval love interest.

The Director's Cut has a few additional scenes and an apocalyptic ending which will shock you and make you laugh at the same time.

The only other thing I can say about this movie is as Ash would put it "GROOVY".
