Spell-binding, beautiful, aware, really took my breath away. I know this landscape -- not as well as the people in the film, but I've been through it more than once. Sheep, as Ivan Doig (Montana writer) mentioned in one of his books about Montana sheepfarming around the turn of the century (Dancing at the Rascal Fair, I think), "Sheep reach their peak of intellectual development three minutes after birth and it's all downhill from there." This film kind of illustrates that wry observation. Sheep are not Einstein.

One of the loveliest shots in the film is before it even starts, when a ewe looks straight at the camera, straight at you. Great filming throughout this piece. It does what film should do more; it tells the story without a lot of talk and manipulation and phoney build up to some point someone wants to make. It's the anti-Herzog documentary, if you will. (I like Herzog, but he does preach.) This documentary lets the landscape, the animals and the men and women working tell the story.

I don't think this film was meant to entertain. I think it was meant to preserve on film a way of life in its final moments because it is gone. I'm so glad they made this film. One of the most touching parts is the collection of "fan pictures" you can look at. People all over the US and Germany sent in their sheep-herding photos out of love for the life.

The Beartooths are fantastically beautiful -- and the film shows them -- but they are a true wilderness with grizzlies, mountain lions, wolverines all of which prey on sheep at NIGHT. It's not easy to take film at night, but one of the film's most amazing shots is of the sheepherder's light reflected in the eyes of a bear and the hundreds of eyes of the sheep all around it. I really love this movie. I would venture that if you don't love it, it's because you just don't get it. That's fine. That's why god created shopping malls.
