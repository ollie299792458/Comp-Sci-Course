Shark Tale is a story about a fish named Oscar (Will Smith), who wants to make it to "the top of the reef" and finds his chance by pretending to be a "shark slayer". His friend Angie (Renee Zellweger)discovers his secret after discovering the shark Lennie (Jack Black) is discovered and tells her exactly what Oscar is up too. Oscar then realizes his true feeling for Angie. He goes to tell her at the place where they work (the whale wash), but she is taken by "The Don"(Robert DeNiro), Lennie's father, and all seashell breaks loose.

A cute kids' story, but not to watch twice, and especially not over and over again. Many "cute" things in the movie rarely get a laugh twice, if even a laugh at all. Lines that are supposed to be hilarious only get a grin, and scenes that should have you doubled-up in your seat only get a small guffaw. Good thinking, not so good follow-through. Good things, however, are excellant voice actors who match the feeling of the sea animal quite well, and animation was astounding too.

A good try and a great rental, but not to be bought for home.
