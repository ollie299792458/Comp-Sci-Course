...especially if you actually get to see and hear the band (not just the concert attendees).  Allow me to elaborate:
Ok, I know that this review will probably get a lot of negative feedback.. but this is how I feel.  I think that the Dead were GREAT during the nights they were filmed in concert.  They all were amazing.  It is great to  see the dead live during their prime.. '74's STEAL YOUR FACE tour.  The concert was great.  5 stars definitely for the concert itself.
However, I am very disturbed about the people who made this film.  Yeah, it's ok to see behind the scenes and get audience shots sometimes, but the audience is shown more than the band!  I bought this video expecting to see and hear the Grateful Dead.. not a bunch of spaced out hippies.  The audience is shown WAAAAY too much.  Also-- there are very few songs here in their entirety.  It seems that when a song starts gettting good.. when the boys really start jammin', they cut to an interview with some spaced out Deadhead (no offense to spaced out Deadheads...) talking about how great the concert experience is.. OF COURSE SEEING THE DEAD LIVE IS FANTASTIC.. THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT THE VIDEO!  I wasn't around the first time to see the dead live, so I was hoping that I would get a no-nonsense concert flick.  The concert, or what we hear of it, is fantastic.  If you want a no-bull$h!Â† concert, check out STOP MAKING SENSE... these filmmakers should take some notes from Johnathan Demme on how to shoot a concert.  For God's sake, all I wanted was to see the dead.. not the Deadheads.  
If you love the Dead, I still recommend buying this.. I don't really regret it, per s&eacute;, but I was very let down by the cinematic technique used in the filming of this.
