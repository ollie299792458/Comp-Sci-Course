If you like the music of the 1960s and you enjoy a non-complex story of a young girl who wants to be popular and works so hard at it, you will love this movie.  John Travolta was simply tremendous as the mom.  His makeup is as great as Mrs. Doubtfire's and his humor with Christopher Walken as the straight guy who really loves his daughter and mitigates the strong influence of his "wife" make this movie totally believable.  "Her" (his) line of "being big in not this family's problem" still leaves me laughing.  Michelle Pfeiffer's character, the producer of the dance show on TV, is simply aweful.  She is a biggot, totally arogant, and has the agenda of promoting her daughter as as star to the expense of all else except her own ego.  Michelle does a superby job in her role. Queen Lativa could not have done a more outstanding job in her role as the organizer of the "black dancers" on the American Bandstand knock-off TV show when she and her group are occasionally put in front of the cameras when the white kids are given a day off.  It is a wonderful "rebellion movie" when kids defy the cultural restriction of race and untimately join together and have great fun together.  The DVD also contains a terrific movie about the production of Hairspray.  Your toe will be tapping during the entire movie.
