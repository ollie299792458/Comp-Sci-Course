I'm going to be upfront here. A lot of the reviews on this page paint the movie in a positive light, and deservedly so. If you haven't read the book, then this movie is quite good. There's a decent plot, and the producers have stuck to the original story to some extent. Al Pacino & Johnny Depp both shine in their respective roles.

Where I distinguish my review is on the basis of me having read the book. I do agree that my qualms with the movie are probably a common issue, where viewers are disappointed with the extent to which the movie does not represent the book. However, one has to remind oneself that this is a true story, and I felt a few things were lacking in the movie (warning plot spoilers may be ahead).

- When I first saw the movie (without reading the book i.e, I saw the movie twice), it gave me the impression that it wasn't that difficult after all for Donnie to break into the mould and forge a friendship with Lefty. In fact, a similar view has been expressed by another reviewer. The reality is totally different. It took months and months if not a year, for Donny to be trusted by different street guys, and finally gaining enough respect and a reputation in order to break the ice with Lefty.

- Most painful, Joe Pistone was never conflicted in his role as Donnie Brasco. I wish Hollywood didn't add this element in for drama purposes. For those who've seen the movie, it's evident that towards the end, Joe expresses mixed feelings towards his role as an FBI agent and almost seems reluctant to leave the Mafia and return to his normal life.

- In real life, Joseph D. Pistone didn't change his values, attitudes and focus throughout his six year 'tenure' with the mafia. He was proud of what he achieved, and proud of being an FBI agent. True, he felt some remorse for decieving Lefty, but Pistone expressed the view that he was doing his job, just as Lefty and Sonny were doing theirs.

- Last but not least, I felt the movie was a bit too rushed in certain aspects. An example would be the first comment made about the misleading impression that Donnie broke into the Mafia quite quickly. On deeper introspection, it seems there could have been greater character development with regards to Lefty and Sonny.

Still, this is a well-directed and interesting movie, if quite misleading in quite a few aspects. I must say, those who are not familiar with mafia jargon and street talk will find it quite hard to follow! To sum up; A lot more could have been acheived with such a great book. Therefore, it's a solid movie, but not up there with the classics.
