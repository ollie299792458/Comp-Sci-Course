This movie was SO enjoyable!!! If you were a Stargate SG-1 fan, you will have a very good time with this movie - and it WILL be over WAY too soon.  The writing for the "Continuum" script was EXCELLENT - action-packed and an interesting, clever story line. I liked the bigger budget effects - direction and production were a notch above what TV has time/money to do (and, by the way, the "Stargate SG1" TV series is WORTH BUYING - really wondered what SciFi was thinking when they cancelled it). I wanted even more cast time in the "Continuum" storyline (there were places which could have used it, but the budget didn't permit, I've read).  I LOVED having snippets of all the characters old/new (so good together) - especially having "Jack" back. It would have been great to have Jack in much more of the movie. I always get laughs from the writing for Jack's witty sarcasm. I realized with great nostalgia, how much I MISSED the SG1 TV show (with these characters - so great to have them all together in "Continuum" - the regulars Samantha, Jackson, Teal'c, Vala - Jack's return, Landry, Hammond, Hays, etc.). I think Ba'al is a wonderful bad guy. I wish the $ people (MGM, I've read) would decide to do more SG1 movies this well done or even better with a bigger budget (maybe do 2 films at one time) - if they can fund scripts this clever and well-written AND with the full cast which includes Richard Dean Anderson.  Even though they'd have to film around everyone's schedules - leave no wo/man behind!  All characters are needed (we've grown to love them altogether) - to be REALLY GOOD - as this movie is - would make me want to spend my money to buy it - as this movie did.
