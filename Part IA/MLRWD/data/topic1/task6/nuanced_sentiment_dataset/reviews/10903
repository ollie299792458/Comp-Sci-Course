In recent years, there have been many bad teen movies made.  But Crossroads, along with 10 Things I Hate About You, Clueless, and Bring It On is one of the best ones in recent years.  Britney Spears may have been the only reason it managed to attract an audience, but even non-fans could probably find something to like about it.
The basic story is of three girls who are best friends as little kids and end up drifting apart by the time they graduate high school.  On a whim, they all decide to take a road trip together, along with a strange guy who may or may not be a murderer.  Throughout the movie, they find out things they never would have thought were true, and become the friends they never thought they would be again.  It's a simple non-complex movie, but a sweet movie that actually rings true to people in many ways.  It deals with things such as sexuality, broken hearts, and following your own path.
Taryn Manning and Zoe Saldana, who play Britney's best friends, show they have a lot of acting talent and will be a force to be reckoned with sooner than later.  As far as Britney goes, she isn't exactly what you would call a good actress, but she isn't torture to watch the way Mariah Carey is.  Nonetheless, she gives a respectable performance, as flawed as it may be.  And ironically, she is the least interesting character of them all.
This movie is a very good one, and will surely tug at your heartstrings.  No, it isn't exactly oscar-worthy, but it is still a very entertaining, well-written, and fairly well-made movie.
