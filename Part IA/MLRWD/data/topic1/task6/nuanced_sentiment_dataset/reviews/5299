I enjoyed this movie. It had some good entertaining action sequences, gun fights and martial arts. Vince Vaughn was his usual motormouth funny self as Brad Pitts sidekick. I liked the concept too. Two spys/assassins from different companies who are living a cover of happily married people with neither knowing the other is what he/she is. I also loved the fact that they were boring, bored repressed married people who when they found out the truth found out they had a lot in common. One of those things being that they got a rush and sexual thrill out of taking out their frustrations on each other while beating the *ell out of each other. And while this is all going on they find that they are more attracted and turned on than they have ever been to one another and that they are secretly soulmates and they didn't even know it.

Brad Pitt does his usual good job and adds that little goofey funny stuff that is just hilarious along with his maniacle strange laugh that is just great. Jolie is perfect for the role in that she can play the button up frustrated tight *ss house wife who has the evil, wicked, sex kitten underneath. I heard when this movie came out that Pitt and Jolie had no chemistry. I think that may have been from the overhype by the paparazzi cause I thought they were great together and they seemed to be having a great time making this movie.
