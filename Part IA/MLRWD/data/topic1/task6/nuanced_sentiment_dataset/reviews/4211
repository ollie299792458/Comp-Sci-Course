The Movie is a five-star masterpeice that must be seen by anyone who can. There is no better living Film director than Miyazaki and with every feature it grows truer and truer. Totoro is a wonderful film the whole family can enjoy and it has the incredible ability to lift spirits at all times.

The Fox edition of this DVD is shabby and worthless. There are no special features, it's in Full Screen (which is not it's original theatrical aspect ratio), and the english dub A. Blows and B. Is the only available viewing option. This is a travesty and a diservice to this great film. Fear not however because Disney is releasing a new two-disc special edition in the same veign as Porco Rosso, The Cat Returns and Nausicaa.

If you can't wait to get your Totoro fix then i reluctantly recommend this DVD, but it's not a fair representation of this beautiful film. I bought it for five dollars at borders (After I used a coupon that gave me 25% of the purchase.) Other than that sort of circumstance do not buy this DVD...especially not so close to the Disney release (They did a spectacular job with the afformentioned films and Spirited Away..hopefully they will be re-dubbing Totoro with better actors.)
