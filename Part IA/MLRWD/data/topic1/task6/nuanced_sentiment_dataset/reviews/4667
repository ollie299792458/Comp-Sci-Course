This is a great collection of WWII movies. They are individually packaged movies. The Big Red One: Great movie with Lee Marvin, this version is the extended edition more like a directors cut. They did a very good job on bringing the old footage back into the movie and cleaning it up so that everything looks like it belongs. Excellent movie captures the flavor of surviving small infantry group during WWII. The Battle of the Bulge, great action movie. Not Historically accurate but a good blend of action and adventure. The Dirty Dozen, great movie worth owning all by itself the fact that you get packaged with other movies is just gravy. Battleground, maybe the original Band of Brothers from 1949. Won 2 Academy awards. A good movie that shows the hardships of being a soldier.
Where Eagles Dare, you may have to watch this one two or three times just so you don't miss all the surprises and plot twist.
This is one of the better WWII sets. Lots of action and fun to watch. Maybe get your kids interested in history of what happen durring WWII.
