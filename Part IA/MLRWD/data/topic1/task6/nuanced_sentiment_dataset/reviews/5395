I am 14 and have pink hair on weekends listen to rock and saw this on the History channel! I am one of the most unlikely people you would ever find to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I find it surprising even to myself.  I have an obsession with it now. I have never been into older movies at all  but this has given me a new outlook on the creativity and genius of drama  before my time. I even went to the trouble of looking up articles on the  real Bonnie &amp; Clyde. This is a rough sketch of the way their life  really was but the outline is great, but how can it be expected to be  completely accurate on people who lived their lives like that? I think it  is so intrigueing the way they were always on the run and looked after each  other. They had a lot of struggle and she ran away with a stranger to live  a different life. GOSH this movie is so good! There were some hollywood  effects that are there to bring you more into the movie (their inncocene  driven out by rebellion of the depression, their amazing passion, Clyde's  ummm impotency)but they work so well! The love between them was so  beautiful I was amazed. My favorite scene is when Bonnie runs away to see  her mom and he chases her down and begs her never to leave his side again.  It is so sweet. Who wouldnt adore a love like that. I guess I like it so  much because it is so uncommon in a world like this. Besides the movie the  actors are great. Warren Beatty may be a little old now be he looks totally  sexy in this movie and Faye Dunaway is a really gorgeous woman. Everyone is  the movie does a great job.I am about to buy this movie I haven't been able  to get it out of my head. Now on nights I find myself watching the history  channel and AMC.
