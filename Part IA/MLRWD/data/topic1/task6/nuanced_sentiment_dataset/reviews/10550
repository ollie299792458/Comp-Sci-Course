This movie is for any one, child or adult, any one who is a Batman fan or just likes the series will enjoy this film. In my opinion, the movie is a pure acid-trip! The return of the Joker is just the best idea they ever had in the making of the new series and for all others. This movie answers all the questions you ever had about the Joker and Batman, including what happened to Harly Quinn, Robin and the Joker. Very graphic for an animated cartoon, the violence is sort of sutable for kids and to tell the truth the Joker in this movie isn't at all like the one in the Batman &amp; Robin series or the first movie. In those he was crazy and funny but this time he's just scary and cruel. Lots of emotional damage between all of the characters, and heart stopping moments. When we first see the Joker he's creepy and haunting! The music is perfect, the voices of the characters are very good. Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Melissa Joan Hart and all others are well done! If you're a Batman fan and the Joker is you're favorite villian see this movie!
