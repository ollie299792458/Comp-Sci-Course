This is an excellent collection of the "horror" titles produced by Val Lewton for RKO.  Note that despite some confusion over the contents, this set contains all nine of the titles contained in another box set currently offered by Amazon.  The difference is the inclusion of the Scorsese documentary in this one.

Modern horror movie fans may avoid disappointed expectations by keeping in mind the adage to not judge a book by its cover...or in this case a Val Lewton movie by its title.  "Ghost Ship", for example, contains no supernatural elements, and the "zombie" movie here has no resemblence to its modern and gory counterparts.  In Lewton's movies, a colorful title is depicted as a series of ambiguous events that may be the result of characters' perceptions rather than a blatant monster rampage.

Don't compare these to either modern horror movies or the classic Universal-type monster movies like "Dracula" or "Frankenstein".  These movies are moody psychological thrillers and seem more closely related to the Film Noir crime genre...and indeed the directors of several of these titles went on to make Noir classics.

That said, these movies are, for the most part, extremely well-made.  Other reviews give good descriptions of the individual titles, but my personal favorites are:
Cat People (the closest to a traditional monster movie, great cinematography);
I Walked With a Zombie (a very eerie setting with a Jane Eyre-esque story);
The Body Snatcher (wonderful showpiece for Boris Karloff who is all malice in this one); and
Isle of the Dead (Karloff delivers a memorable character again and another eerie setting to savor).

Not all the movies are winners, and sometimes the acting gets a little stiff.  Nevertheless these these are unique movies that emphasize mood and subtlety rather than explicitness, and this is a teriffic box set.
