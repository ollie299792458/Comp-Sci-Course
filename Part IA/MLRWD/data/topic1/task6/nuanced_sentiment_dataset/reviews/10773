Simply using the word "bad" to describe this movie cannot convey to you exactly how horrific it actually is. "Bad" is a severe understatement. It's profoundly bad. It's atrocious. I wish I could get a lobotomy to erase this horrendous piece of cinematic fecal matter from my mind. It is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. I originally wanted to see this movie because I love the fantasy genre and I'm a big fan of the real brothers Grimm, but I was sorely dissapointed. I mean, what's with the kid getting swallowed up by mud, turning into the gingerbread man, then biting her hand and exclaiming, "mmm, I taste good!" all about? Was that funny or something? A cobweb-spewing, child-eating monster horse? A villian who is in the movie for all of 5 minutes? Lame, lame, LAME! And don't even get me started on the completely unlikable, boring main characters. If, despite my scathing review, you still want to see this movie, here's a little money saving tip: Forego the trip to the video store and opt instead to continually bash your head into a wall until you bleed profusely and require medical attention. A concussion is far more entertaining than this godawful piece of garbage.
