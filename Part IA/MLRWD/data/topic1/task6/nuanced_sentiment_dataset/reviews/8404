Okay, I goofed by not reading the reviews here before I bought this title. Please, don't make the same mistake I did. All of the glowing praise for this film is for the VHS version, if you noticed.
The DVD transfer is, in  a word, terrible. Whatever film stock was used for the low-light shots  (which is most of the film) was pretty grainy, and the DVD just accentuates  that to an ALARMING degree. Add to that the pixelation artifacts, and the  way certain backgrounds in shots don't move or change their appearance AT  ALL with foreground movement, giving scenes a plastic, cartoonish look.  This is a cheap way to cut down on the DVD's data size, but it shows. I've  seen indie films shot on 16mm that looked better on a VHS dub than this.  Maybe they were shorthanded at the mastering lab that week and let an  intern get a "big break", I don't know. The THX certification is  definitely NOT deserved, as the mix on the sound is equally bad, with FX  stomping on dialog in key places.
Having said that, if you are bound and  determined to buy this, Russel Mulcahy's strong grasp of the visual at  least doesn't disappoint. Some of the best match dissolves and scene  transitions to be found anywhere. The DVD should be shown to aspiring film  students:What TO DO with a camera, What NOT TO DO in the mastering lab.
