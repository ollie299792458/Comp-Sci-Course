While "The History Boys" cannot be said to be anything like a typical classroom--it is still an fascinating literary journey.  I am a school teacher by trade and should be appalled by the disconnect between this film and the students I see every day.  But for some reason I am not.  There is something in all of us, put there by the likes of Goodbye, Mr. Chips,  The Dead Poets Society and other films, that wants cinematic depictions of any school life to be larger than life.  Perhaps this has to do with the fact that everyday school life IS larger in many ways than anything that exists in the public consciousness.

  While I have had students every bit as witty and fascinating as the "boys" I certainly have never had 8 or more at one time.  But enough said.  Richard  Griffiths and Stephen Campbel Moore as the two competing educational philosophers at the center of  Nicholas Hytner's film verson of Alan Bennett's stage play make for a great intellectual slugfest. And Frances de la Tour as the one female colleague in the film is a wonder unto herself. Dominic Cooper and Samuel Barnett as two of the central student characters are worthy of attention for  themselves.  Never again will "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered" be just another song for me!

  Alas, I am a hopeless fan of the writing of Alan Bennett and he has never been, in my estimation, any better than he is in this production.  Enjoy, Enjoy.
