I saw this file in a Second run theater that smelled like the sewer overflowed and flooded the place.  But it didn't matter because the movie was so excellent that I didn't even know I was there.  
I can't even  figure out what it was that I loved so much about the movie.  I expected it  to be some stupid romance chic flick.  But at the end of the movie I just  couldn't get over the feeling that it had touched on a part of my soul that  I rarely get to see.  It's a long movie and if I had my way, all movies  would be 3 to 4 hours.  There are times in the movie that are a bit slow,  and there's not really any major action in it.  There is some history  (though I don't know how accurate it is)  Mostly it just the feeling I got  that endeared me so much to this movie.  It's so charged with emotion  throughout.  The feeling of loss and acceptance becomes your own when you  really put yourself there.  I think that's what makes this movie great- the  ability to be there riding in that plane as it crashes, walking across the  desert with the knowledge that everything you care about is depending on  you.  
It's a beautiful story and though I don't usually care a bit about  awards, I would give this one my award for superb execution of a story that  tore at my heart and pulled tears out of my cold and controled exterior.
