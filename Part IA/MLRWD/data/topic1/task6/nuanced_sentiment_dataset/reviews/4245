I heard bad things about this movie but it wouldn't have been the first time I like a movie that was getting bad reviews, but oh boy was I wrong. This movie is horrible, not funny at all. I didn't like any of the Scary Movies, haven't seen the last one and I'm not planning to, so when I saw they were promoting this movie as been brought by 2 of the masterminds behind the Scary Movies I wasn't expecting much, but still I gave it a chance, and now I hate myself for it. Where there any writers involve in this? They just throw parts of other movies randomly and they didn't even try to make it funny.

I really can't explain what's happening lately with all these Teen Comedies coming out from Hollywood, hardly any of them are worth watching. Last week I watch the Korean teen comedy "Sex is Zero" for the second time and it was hilarious, why can't they make a movie like this one? If you are planning on watching "Date Movie", won't, save your money or better yet, get "Sex is Zero" and have a great time.
