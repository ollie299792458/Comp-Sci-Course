I don't know why it took me so long to buy this video. I was a devoted fan of Adam Carolla on LA's KLSX right up to day the station canned its talk format and descended into the depths of mumble music. Carolla demonstrated rapier brilliance from day he showed up on KRLA as Mr. Birchum, the hilarious gravel voiced shop teacher that you would never want your kid to spend an hour with. From there to Love Line, bouts with TV's Man Show, and finally to the morning radio slot vacated by the vastly self-over-rated Howard Stern. Although he takes wicked pleasure in detailing his misspent youth--how do you flunk out of junior college really?--Carolla has impeccable creds to make a movie about a struggling carpenter taking one last shot at boxing glory. Carolla has carpentered and he has boxed, both for real. "Hammer" is an inspired concept that captures both pursuits in a single word.

Since taking possession of the DVD, I've watched it with various groups of people. Everyone without exception has enjoyed it. You don't need to love or even approve of boxing to get caught up in the story, which has an ending that is fitting but not predictable, moving but not gooey. Carolla has gone on record that he never expects the Hammer to make a dime of profit. I'm happy to have contributed a few bucks toward reducing the deficit. And I can't wait for his next venture.
