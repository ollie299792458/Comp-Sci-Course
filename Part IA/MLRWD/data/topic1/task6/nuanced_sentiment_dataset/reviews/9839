First off I am a Linus Roache fan.  There was not enough of him in this movie.

It is however a great movie with a Hollywood love story between Jolie's, and Owen's roles.  Its sparked as Angelina in her way is moved by the death of a black child who froze to death as he slipped through deportation from England.  She goes off to many global locations as a UN person to where aid is being doled out.

Linus Roache plays the stay at home city boy of London.  Its obvious early in the movie Jolie's, and Roache's characters are due for parting of the ways.

It will move you with realistic glimpses of the struggle to feed the global populous.

We need not forget there are people right here in the United States living close, or at the level of starvation, and homelessness.  Many are victims of many sorts here.  As Americans we tend to forget Appalachia, and treatment of American Natives.  This movie will not let you forget the plight of those less forunate.  Even those less fortunate in the struggle for a true equality across the board for all.  The way the world is now are any of us not far from the third world?  The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.  As petrol constantly hovers in the US at/near two dollars a gallon; I still feel the wrong man got back into the White House.  You see this movie wakes you up to a number of things.

Sorry I added my political spin.  Felt like exercising one my rights, too!!!!
