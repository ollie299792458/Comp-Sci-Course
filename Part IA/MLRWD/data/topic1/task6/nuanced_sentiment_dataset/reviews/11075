I do not like Jillian (she's annoying), but I do love her kickboxing workout. It's packed with tons of cardio, and you'll be sweating after the warm-up.

I like this workout for a couple reasons. First, everything is easy to do, but you really work up a sweat doing it. She also repeats each exercise (various times). Each exercise is about 30 seconds so it's not too long either, but she moves right to another exercise, which brings out the cardio. You are ALWAYS moving in this workout.

The only tiny downside is that there's no punching combos or anything like that. It really is cardio but with kickboxing mixed in (I still love it though!). Jillian's new kickboxing DVD (coming out this March) looks like it has combos so I'm REALLY excited to try that one.

I'll usually do this workout 2 days a week (by itself), and it's usually in the middle of the week to mix in with my other workouts. You could definitely add this on to another workout though. It's 30 minutes, but it goes by quickly.
