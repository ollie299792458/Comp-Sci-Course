I read the reviews from both ends of the spectrum on this one.  The low ratings seem to be for the language mostly, and the sexually charged themes.  I can agree that the language was a bit harsh and crude, however this is to be expected with this movie given the actors, summary and rating.  I was just glad it didn't have pointless nudity and there were some wholesome themes too.  It wasn't all bad.
The high ratings are given because this is a movie in comedic similarity to "40 Year Old Virgin" and "Superbad".  I was not impressed by either of those movies, I thought Superbad was just painful, but I personally would not compare this movie to those given the themes.
Overall, I would say this movie is at the C grade level.  It wasn't great, it wasn't awful.  It is entertaining if you are looking for filler type of activity.
Don't get this movie if you expect great things or if you are offended by very rough language.  Definitely NOT a movie for kids.  I will still keep this movie in my DVD collection, it just won't be one of my top recommendations.
