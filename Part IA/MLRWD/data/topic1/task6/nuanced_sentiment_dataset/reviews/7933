If I could give this movie 6 stars I would. The movie is truly made for someone like me though, as I am a chef and have a philosophy similar to Objectivism.

The movie is basically a tug-a-war between two different philosophies. Tony Shalhoub's character Primo represents the uncompromising visionary, who believes that you should just make the product exceptional & in everyway perfect regardless of the ends. His work is his reason for being. It is everything that makes his life worth living. He says, "If I sacrifice my work, it dies. It is better that I die."

Stanley Tucci's character Secondo represents the business-minded approach of giving the customer what he wants. It doesn't matter if you sacrifice your work, if that is what will determine your success. Work is only a means to an end. You feel his stress of being so close to bankruptcy the whole movie. You feel his desire to be successful, to have the beautiful women and the nice cars.

Even though these two philosophies are at odds, you sympathize with both. You understand both. It is noble and filling to be ideal, though it can be very hard and lead to ruin. And being pragmatic makes life easier, though it gives you no meaning.

A truly excellent film.
