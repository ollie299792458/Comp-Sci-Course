As a huge fan of the original games I came to the first Resident Evil movie with fairly large expectations.  Was I disappointed, a little.  As a horror movie it had its moments, as a movie based on a game it wasn't very great.  Although, to lend it some credit, Paul Anderson has said it was more of a prequel to the games rather than based exactly on the games.

Luckily Resident Evil: Apocalypse is based on the games and is a lot better done than the first one. First off, there's a lot more action. To me the first one was far to slow, with not much going on. This one was almost pure action through and through. It had great gun fights and well thought out fisticuffs.

It also played out like the games, with different scenes from the game actually in the movie, which I enjoyed. The Tyrant was well done and didn't look too cheesy like I thought it would.  The zombies were good, although the moments where the director chose to slow down the film to show groups of zombies moving was a total waste.  I couldn't help but think, "cheesy TV movie" during those times.  The dogs and lickers were well done, and there's nothing like a creepy classroom filled with zombie children to get some chills wrung out.

Milla Jovavich's character Alice was a big improvement too.  Jovavich had a better grasp of the character this time around and played her with some good old camp too.  She seemed more confident in the role, which worked for the movie.

My only real complaints about the movie where its lack of constant good scares, only one new addition of the monsters from the game(the Tyrant) and lack of gore. For a horror zombie movie you'd expect a little more gore.  Even Shaun of the Dead has more gore than this. But overall, it's a step above the original, and a gigantic leap over other zombie movies based off games.  Yeah, I'm talking about you House of the Dead.
