...and got exactly what I expected. I was mildly curious about it from reading some reviews here, so I picked it up on sale yesterday (I won't say where), making it that much easier to, well, if not exactly enjoy then at least sit through. About the only things that I got out of it were very few laughs (and not uproariously loud ones at that, either) and a wish that I could have the masseuse abilities that Lars had. The director, playing Putnam, did about the most godawful fake British accent that I've ever heard. I could do better than him! Ok, with a bit of practice, but still.

Anyway, there also is nowhere near "enough female frontal nudity to give Girls Gone Wild a run for its money" as Amazon's review above would have you believe because there really just wasn't a whole heck of a lot of it. The biggest number of nude or topless females that you'll see is one scene towards the end where all the guests are cavorting around the pool area but it's such a short scene that you don't see all that many females for very long. At least the girls were all, of course, pretty cute.

However, even with all the red herrings thrown around, it's still pretty obvious that the killer is...

*gack!*

*gasp!* The killer is...

*swoooosh!*

*thud!*
