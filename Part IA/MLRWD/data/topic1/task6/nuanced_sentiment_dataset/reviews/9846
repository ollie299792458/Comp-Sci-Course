As I sat through Once, I didn't really know how to take it. I could barely understand the leading lady's accent. I didn't really know where the story was going. At the end of the film, I was dissapointed. Was that it? Were they not going to consemate their love for each other? Did they love each other? Wait, the lead characters were never given a name?!

 Maybe I was a little slow the night I watched it, but it took a little thinking afterwards to completely understand the movie, or at least take it the way that I did.

 The story of Once can be summed up by saying that Guy meet Girl and they make music together. That's what it was the second after viewing, but an hour or so later, I realized that their love was shown. It was shown the only it could have been shown, and that was through the music they made together.

 After it clicked for me, I smiled. John Carney has written a sort of forbidden love story using music. The interactions given by our leads, Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, are near perfection. The whole vacuum bit had me sold for Girl.

 In the end, the whole tone of the film left a bittersweet feeling. I felt for Guy and Girl. I felt for the lack of their love. They'll always have their music. And great, great music it is.
