'Snatch' is comparable to 'Unbreakable'.  Not in the sense of storyline or content, but negativity. If you walk in to see 'Snatch' expecting another 'Lock Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels', you will be dissapointed, just as those hoping for another 'Sixth Sense' were.
'Snatch' is primarily the story of Turkish &amp; Tommy, two illegal boxing promoters who get caught up in the world of underworld figure Brick Top, when their bare knuckle boxer Gorgeous George is incapacitated by One-Punch Mickey (Brad Pitt in his best role to date), over a caravan. Now short of a boxer, and seriously in debt to Brick Top, the boys arrange to have Mickey take his place, but Mickey is not going to throw a fight the way they all had planned, which leads to more trouble for the boys.
It also features a bunch of pawn shop owners attempting to 'Snatch' a diamond stolen by Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio DelToro).  Unfortunately, the diamond is also wanted by Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina), Doug The Head, Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie 'The Man' Jones) and Boris The Blade.
To those naysayers out there, let me tell you this, don't expect a sequel to 'Lock Stock' and you will love this film. Full of great camera action, absolutely brilliant performances all around, a clever, very funny script, add Brad Pitt's unintelligible Mickey, and you have a cracker-jack of a film experience.
By the way, the final sequence at another boxing match is one of the most brilliant scenes you will ever witness on screen. One reviewer described it as "'Raging Bull' meets 'The Matrix'". This doesn't even begin to cover it, trust me.
See 'Snatch' the second it opens, and then pre-order the DVD the second you get home.
