The finale was decent- alot of zombies- and they finally got off the farm. If they spend next season only at the prison it will get drawn-out though. Outside of Rick, Daryl, and Andrea however the other characters are weak. It's not a good thing when you don't really care if most of the cast gets killed-off. Now they will bring Michionne in, but seriously wt heck is she doing out in the woods with hundreds of zombies around? And old man Herschel with that 100 round pump shotgun was too funny. Rick needs to get serious and give Carl a good ol' fashioned butt-whooping for all the mess he's caused and Lori is a bipolar biatch who needs to be served-up as zombie chow. T-dog -what the heck good is he? He's always wanting to go off on his own, and never does squat. Just kill him-off already. Carol, seriously-- Sophia was more useful. And now that we know everyone's infected already, who cares if you turn into a zombie upon dying and not by being bitten/scratched. Maybe they will introduce a new twist here. Well, let's see what season 3 brings. I'm hearing talk about the Russian army invading(the Spetsnaz forces were underground and not affected) what's left of the USA and shooting it out with our heroes... now that would be epic!
