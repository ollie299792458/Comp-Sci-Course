The new DVD release of "Gojira" and "Godzilla..." is disappointing in terms of video quality. White specks of all sizes almost continually pop up, giving the effect of trying to watch the film through a "shower curtain" of video "noise."

If I had not seen and did not already own an "unofficial" DVD of "Gojira," perhaps I wouldn't have been so let down. But the picture quality of the "bootleg" DVD (possibly from laserdisc, I don't know the source for sure) is MILES above Sony's new release.

Had Sony Video spent ONE-TENTH as much money cleaning up and restoring the print they used for the DVD that they must have spent on the fancy (admittedly very nice) packaging for the set, they could have given this classic film the kind of treatment it deserves.

The Japanese version of the film ("Gojira") is a MUCH more atmospheric and "artistic" experience than the Americanized Raymond Burr version. It is unfortunate that poor video quality mars that experience, particularly as better-quality versions already exist.

Even with all this said, if you've never seen "Gojira" then by all means buy this set. I promise you, you will love it! I usually watch it with no subtitles, and I don't speak a word of Japanese. It is still an experience almost unmatched in the world of sci-fi and horror.
