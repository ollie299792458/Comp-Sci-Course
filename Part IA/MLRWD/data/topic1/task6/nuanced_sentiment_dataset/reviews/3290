Originally brought to the United States by PBS, the BBC series is on par with Sherlock Holmes (Jeremy Brett) and Hercule Poirot (David Suchet).  Whoever is selecting the actors for the main character has a penchant for selecting the right person for the right part.  Derek Jacobi IS Brother Cadfael.  Just the right blend of self-assertion, self-effacement (with difficulty), curiosity, and tenacity, Jacobi helps transport us to a time long ago when life was cheap and justice could be too blind and too swift.

Superlative technical direction.  Well designed sets.  Outstanding acting by Jacobi and his supporting cast.  For period pieces and murder mysteries, a must for the afficionado of the genres.  The only disturbance in the entire series is the change of actors playing Hugh Berringar, the sheriff.  Other than that minor interruption in continuity, a most excellent series that is worthy of anyone's collection.  These episodes can be watched and rewatched with increasing enjoyment over the years.  Enjoy!
