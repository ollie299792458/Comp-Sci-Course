I was shocked after watching this and realizing that, gasp!, I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.  Granted, it's not stellar.  The story of resurrection has been done a million times (think Pet Semetary).  But seeing an innocent child brought back to life only to slowly turn into something sinister was a lot of fun to watch!  I thought the fact that the entire town was in on this tradition of magical rebirth was a pretty new twist, and the specific rules given to each chosen family made it actually seem like a rather realistic situation that could occur in any town.  The acting was pretty solid.  The grieving parents make their pain known once they lose their child, and I love when they finally realize that, yes, their resurrected daughter must go back where she belongs since she is no longer the sweet child they knew before her accident.  And for such a frightening tale, there's really not that much blood or acts of violent horror shown, which is something a lot of viewers may enjoy about this movie.  However, I wasn't crazy about the end.  I was left asking way too many questions.  To sum it all up: definitely worth your time to wake up and watch this one!
