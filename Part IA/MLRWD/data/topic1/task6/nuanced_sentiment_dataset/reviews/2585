This movie was painful to watch.

In this soulless, toothless followup to the hit Lost Boys, Corey Feldman portrays a caricature of Edgar Frog that made me wince with every word he said. Edgar and Alan were, as I interpreted, a couple of posers with some knowledge of the undead, yet who'd never actually staked a vamp in their lives. The tough guy attitudes a charming mask for a callow lad.

Played straight however, it can only be what it originally was: fake.

Edgar Frog is also saddled with the same hardship as Burt from the Tremors franchise: exceptional as a supporting character, he simply cannot carry a movie.

Ironically, The Lost Boys may have starred children and youths, but the vampires were truly deadly and the viewers were in fear for characters we genuinely cared about.

It took phenomenal courage, luck and turning their house into a vampire deathtrap for humans to defeat two vampires at night. In this presumably `adult' movie, the vamps melt like butter on a hot plate, killing and being killed by characters for whom we have no regard, every bit as scary as a cartoon villain in a kids show.

Then there's theme. As many reviewers have already pointed out, vampire literature and movies excel when the vampire serves as metaphor. In the Lost Boys, the theme was alienation, the dissolution of family bonds and the need for connection. Even the vampires are driven by this motivation to create their own twisted family.

This movie does not know what it wants to do or be, other than make money from the original's name.

So what are the good points?

We get to see Tanit Phoenix in lingerie and a bathing suit.

That's about it.
