First of all it does look like some time and thought went into this one, just not enough. Secondly, what's with the cover? DX - Shawn and Hunter have never even won a tag team title! WWE still can't get over itself and put out a quality product without trying to push themselves as the best in the history of the sport.

BTW Michael Hayes can eat it! First he gets into the WWE WrestleMania Legends video game and now on the cover of this?

I know there has been hundreds of pairings to make a tag-team. Some not so memorable to those that were formidable.

I want to talk about the good ones we missed here (keep in mind I mention these because they were really pushed as top tag teams during their time in the WWE/F which means a lot to me).
WWE/F: The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon), The Blackjacks, The Wild Samoans, The Smoking Guns, APA, The Quebecers, Rhythm and Blues, and The Godwinns, Too Cool/Too Much

WCW: The Minnesota Wrecking Crew (Ole and Gene Anderson) and DOOM (simmons and reed)

AWA: The Crusher and Dick The Bruiser

SMW: The Heavenly Bodies

ECW: The Eliminators, The Impact Players, & Sabu/RVD

If you are going to make the COMPLETE Worlds Greatest Tag Teams do it right!
