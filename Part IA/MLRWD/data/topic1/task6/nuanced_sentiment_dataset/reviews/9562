This really is a dreadful movie, the obvious product of an aging genius who, while he could still direct actors and tell cameras where to point, should have relegated scripting to a genuine writer.  The introductions of the characters and circumstances are so choppy, one can only hope large pieces ended up on the cutting room floor.  Hopefully the spectacle-style set-pieces that characterized David Lean's work over the years were shot off authentic events and not staged, as it would be pathetic for so many extras to have been paid for such meaningless effect.

I love Alec Guiness as much as the next guy, but isn't it a bit of an oxymoron to have a White guy play an Indian in a movie that deplores how White dominate Indians?  Guiness is another cinematic gem, but in this film, he's a bug-eyed embarrassment.  And with all due respect to how apparently childlike Indians are, did the lead Oriental characters have to be such parodies of humans?  Poor Dr. Aziz - he seems like a complete moron until after his ordeal, by which time the viewer may well have found him guilty of dreadful acting.

I purchased "Out of Africa" at the same time as "A Passage to India", obviously in the mood to do some virtual travelling and hoping for something resembling an authentic love story (since I'm a chick).  I'd suggest you buy "Africa", as it's far better crafted, beautifully acted (in spite of Streep's phlegmatic accent) and a more satisfying journey in every way.
