I would just like to inquire about a few things: what happened to Liz Baker, Dr. Tsosie, Diane Kramer (now a man?), Ms. Gomez (and her head), the mill, the green chapel, and, not in the least, the 'multiverse' (remember, it wasn't really time travel)?  Probably due to the compression of the travelers' schedule (37 hours to 6) there wasn't enough time to follow what I think was the most interesting part of the story and gave continuity to it: the evolution of Chris Hughes' character, from that of a 20th century wimpy yuppie scientist to a man of responsibility for his and others' survival (a little like Peter Evans in State of Fear).  Through Chris's eyes (in the book) we could feel the actual horror of the violence and the paralyzing fear, that reflected the stark cruel reality that the archaeologists met head on, in the past they thought they knew so well.  Crichton went into great detail of all this and much of the book was absolutely frightning, but the movie makers completely neglected the intensity and magnitude of all the near death events that were integral to the mood of the story.  Also, Lady Claire's character was all wrong in the movie.  Missing was her sinister and promiscuous, yet seductive, behavior.  I guess there wasn't enough time for that either.  It seems there wasn't time for development of any character for that matter.  How can any screenwriter miss the significance of this?  I was really looking forward to seeing this all play out in a film at the level of Jurassic Park but what we got was closer to Robin Hood.  Michael, you must be totally frustrated with this version of your epic adventure.  Please somebody do this again, this time with sincere interest.
