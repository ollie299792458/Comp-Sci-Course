I was deeply moved by it.  I couldn&#65533;t help myself not thinking about it all day.  This movie is rich; it carries layers of layers of emotions.  The love, joy, fear, anger and sadness that everyone would experience in life (regardless one's sexual preference, mind you) &#65533; are all embedded in this masterpiece.  The story is about an old man who was once brilliant but was unavoidably losing control of his mind and eventually his livelihood to the darkness of death. It is about a rootless young man who was too nice to live up to the tough guy's image that was imposed upon him by many people including his new friend and finally found his confidence in life through his good heart. It is about a brave woman that loved her master so much and was willing to do anything to protect him even after he died.  Ultimately it is about compassion.  I found compassion in the characters of Clay Boone and Hanna.  Their affection to Mr. Jimmy is pure gold and it touches my heart with its mighty power.  Mr. Jimmy was indeed a lucky man.
