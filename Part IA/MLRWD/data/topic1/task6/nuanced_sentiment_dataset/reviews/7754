The Paltrow version is really quite nice and enjoyable, but I can't help feeling that something is slightly amiss, a bit out of place. As if the actors - though very good ones at that - couldn't wholly identify with the characters they played. Sometimes they just seemed to be telling their lines without their hearts being in it. There is one exception and that is the excellent Jeremy Northam. Although his Mr Knigthley is certainly not as charismatic as that of Mark Strong in the other version of Emma, he was great.

Toni Colette, though a very good actress, was really miscast as Harriet Smith and not just physically. She is a modern actress and couldn't fit into this period drama. The same is true for Ewan McGregor: a great actor, but not one for period drama, or at least not for regency drama, I fear.

The film is not strictly faithful to the plot, which in itself wouldn't be a problem, but it weakens the performance even further altogether. Still, if you do not have too high expectations, you may enjoy this film without further ado.
