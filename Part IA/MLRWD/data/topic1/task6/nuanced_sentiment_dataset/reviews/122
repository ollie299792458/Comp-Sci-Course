While the re-mastered video gets a big thumbs up,  the audio couldn't be worse.  The ramped up sound fx are tolerable and in some cases an improvement on the original.  However, they (sound fx) are too 'in your face'.  All audio sounds very compressed.  It seems they tried too hard to make sure you noticed the changes.  The music tracks are a different monster.  They are terrible!!!  The original tracks are not simply re-mastered.  Many additional audio tracks have beeen added.  And badly I must say.  The reverb's used are stupid big and overbearing.  The many additional layers of instrument tracks tends to bury the lead vocal on some tunes!  Surround sound is stupid over-done and exaggerated.  You will need to turn up your center channel alot to clearly hear lead vocal parts or better yet, turn off your surround sound and watch in stereo.  Even in stereo, this is the worst audio re-mastering i've ever encountered.  New instrumentation sounds very generic and electronic and clearly was laid over a complete 2-track recording,  sounds a bit like karaoke instruments, not 'in the mix'  but on top of it.  Like one guy with a pc/sequencer re-did the whole soundtrack.  And some songs were changed alot,  Olivia's 'Hopelessly Devoted to you'  has drums and full instrumentation from the very beginnig,  it doesn't 'kick in' on first chorus, like the original.  They took a 1970's movie,  set place in the 50's, and now has music that sounds like 1990's bad pop.  I assume this was an attempt to sound modern.  This re-master clearly misses the mark from an audio standpoint.  The video is superb and the DVD extras are a nice addition.
