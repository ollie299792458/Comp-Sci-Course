Bug is less an example of what's wrong with cinema and more an example of what's wrong with modern theatre. Screenwritten by the guy who wrote the play, it's a pretentious story made to mess with the audience's mind. Are the bugs real? Are the people crazy? Why are they together? What are they getting out of it?

The plot holes are numerous - what happens to some of the supporting characters who should be bigger players in this? Things come out of nowhere, there's no real development of characters or concepts. It's a one-trick, one-act piece of mud that collapses under it's own absurdity.

I guess the core concept of this piece is the story of people who are co-dependent in the most perverse way possible. There's a much better handling of the idea in the fabulous, underrated movie "Night Porter" with Charlotte Rampling and Dirk Bogarde. In the ending sequence of bug, where the two main characters have locked themselves away and are spiraling a self-destructive path, I was really reminded of how fantastic the Night Porter handled it.

On stage, Bug might have been more interesting, but I probably would have laughed at the absurdity in the hushed confines of the theatre, like I did watching the movie. Most viewers will feel cheated that this wasn't the horror movie it was marketed as - for that movie, check out Slither. Somehow Friedkin thought this was a brilliant movie to make, but as a director he is capable of so much more. I mean, this is the guy who directed the Exorcist! Wow!
