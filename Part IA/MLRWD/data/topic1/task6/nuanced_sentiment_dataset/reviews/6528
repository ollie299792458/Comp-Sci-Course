And so we move on to season 3 of Buffy, doing the impossible and pretty much topping season 2, or close to it, with even better stories, new characters--hey--come on, who is as hot and as evil as Faith? while ringing more emotional turmoil out of us Buffy love slaves!! Oh and lets not forget our first intro to Anya, Xander's soon to be love demon no longer a demon love interest. The entire town is turned upside down thanks to Cordelia, in what is to me one of the top three episodes of all time "The Wish." when she makes her desires known to Anyanka. If you havent' see it, wow--perfect television. Other episodes to watch "Band Candy" which will continue to have hilarious reprecusions and come up as an in joke for the next few seasons regarding Giles and Buffy's mom, "Faith, Hope, and Trick," which showcases Faith for the first time in a wicked intro for a tv series, and of course, the saga of the mayor of Sunnydale. To me it is still one of the all time best story lines on the show hands down. Terrifically acted, and played by all the characters with ease, if you were not hooked by season three you are not human!!!! Great great television. No one does it better then Joss Whedon and his crack writing staff.
