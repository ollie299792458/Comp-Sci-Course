While this movies has moments of fine performances - Helen Mirren as the aging starlet, Olivier Martinez as the handsome gigolo - there are too many flaws to give it more than 3 stars.  To begin with - the chemistry between Olivier and Helen runs very hot and cold - mostly cold - you see the Helen Mirren character questioning over and over his intents yet she ignores all the signs and continues to recklessly fall in love with the gigolo even when she knows what he is.  The Gigolo, while devastatingly handsome, lacks charm and at times seems almost bi polar (I think this is supposed to be italian passion but it just comes off as moodiness). The Contessa played by Anne Bancroft was not fully developed - we learn she is bitter and impoverished which I think is supposed to explain how she became a pimp to all these young men however I didn't feel any sympathy for her character and kept wondering why in the world Mrs. Stone even opened her door to her - not explained.  The unwashed and mentally disturbed young man who follows Mrs. Stone around an urinates and masturbates in front of her - she also opens her door to but the audience is left wondering what the outcome is.  I just found it very hard to believe that the Mrs. Stone character would go from happily married, celebrated screen star to trolloping around Rome with a known giglo and his pimp.  The constant theme of Mrs. Stone aging, grieving and losing her beauty could possibly explain a mid life crisis of some sort - however for me it falls short of explaining how or why she would ruin her whole life over this lot of losers.  Won't be a total waste of your time to watch but if you are like me you will come away feeling half full.
