Well, to keep this brief for those who are tire of long rants, I liked it.  Rent it, if you are an HPL fan.  It stays fairly true to the Call of Cthulhu story, but throws a ton of cheesy 70s style flower children prenteding to perform "unholy rituals" action scenes.  Well, you get a few [...] shots, so, for some that may redeem these cheesy attempts at scary rituals, which ran amok in that era of horror films.

The guy from Quantum Leap does a decent job of being the moody, evil sorceror descendent, carrying on the "family business", and yo get to see a little skin from the one time wholesome actress, Sandra Dee.  yes, that's right, Sandra Dee.  She either wanted to change her image or needed some cash.  At any rate, if this movie would have been made in more recent times, it would have been awesome.

It was nice, dark, and creepy, and is worth a watch, by old Hammer, Arkoff, and Corman horror buffs as well as he usual HPL fans.

Uh oh, I ended up making a short story long...oh well.

Elder god-o-meter gives it two tentacles up.
