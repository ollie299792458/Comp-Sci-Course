First off about one-third of the negative reviews are about the packaging of the DVD, an issue if you wish to purchase the DVD, but not just to rent the film.  As for the other substantive criticisms raised--its boring, too dark, no story, anti-religious--I personally did not find any of these valid.  The opening twenty minutes had me engrossed both with the brutal life led by these men, the flimsy contraptions used to extract oil, and the introduction of the Plainview character.We see his gritty determination, ingenuity, and even tenderness adopting the son of a man killed at the oil field.  All of this is done wordlessly.  Then we hear the first words--Plainview's sales pitch to a community that has just discovered oil.  And soon after we meet Eli Sunday, a young man whose ambition equals Plainview's.  In the scene where Eli and Plainview haggle over selling the Sunday ranch, we can see that his interests are not purely spiritual, but more power and control.  The two characters begin a dangerous and ultimately tragic struggle for the upper hand.  The dramatic tension comes from the struggle of these two characters to achieve their ends, and from the relationships between Plainview and his son, Eli Sunday and his father, and Eli and Plainview. Several parallel scenes highlight the impact of one on the other, leading to the tragic conclusion.  The acting throughout is first class, especially Daniel Day Lewis, and the cinematography is wonderful.  I do agree that the score is intrusive particularly in the middle of the film, surprising given how well PTA has used music in the past.
