This review is going for what the other reviews, which would take 5 years to read, didn't say.
Yes it did seem longer than Dr. Zhivago.  No it won't make you laugh out loud (well, once in
a while I DID, but then, I'm easy).  This movie uses as theme songs the LESS WELL LIKED
Van Morrison songs.  Either this director was working hard at low expectations, or this is a
new form of uber-snobbishness.  Besides, how many of the audience will actually know both
Van Morrison and Wham! (?)  Perhaps it IS all a social psychology experiment designed to make
you, the audience, feel like you are no more in control of your life than the main characters
in the movie are, and that's the message.  Dramatic peak of the film: Jason Segel's impassioned
donut speech.  Most prolongued cute scene: the two sisters arguing in Elmo and Cookie Monster
voices.  Emily Blunt is very cute; Jason still has his man-boy thing going on.  Watch the
movie and all of this will make sense.  It's OK but it helps to lower you expectations going into it.
