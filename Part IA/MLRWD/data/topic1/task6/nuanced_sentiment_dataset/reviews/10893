I was one of the LUCKY ones who did not buy this. I did however have the UN-Pleasant experience of seeing this "Butchering" of a classic. I saw the 30th Anniversary edition on one of the movie channels and said "Hey I haven't seen this version before, Oh look the added stuff to it I wonder if it will be any good" Well it isn't. The stuff they added in as plain of terms as I can think of SUCKS and in fact they actually cut other stuff in order to add the new stuff...Is anyone else having a hard time with this? Well the new stuff isn't restored or anything in fact it was re-shot and poorly added in. I work in a movie theater as a projectionist so while I notice some of the smaller stuff..this stuff is noticable by everyone. In fact I'm going to say that the only people who would like this piece of garbage are the ones who have never seen the original. I'm not going to go into what they've cut since so many already have. I sadly don't own any addition on dvd but when I do I WILL NOT BE BUYING THIS VERSION. I have heard good things about the Millenium eddition. Glad to see someone got it right. How do you butcher a film this badly and then sleep at night. I would almost go as far as saying that you could remake this movie and use digital zombies and it would be better than this. So if you see the 30th anniversary on the shelf LEAVE IT THERE!!! Go find the newer Millenium edition. I didn't even complain about the "new" soundtrack yet because it's nothing someone who has a basic knowledge of a computer program that can make midi files couldn't do. IT'S GARBAGE AS WELL. Maybe I've been to hard but I don't think so. If you must watch this sodomizing of the original by all means RENT IT or do as I did and see if one of the movie channels need about 2 hours of filler so they decided to play this.
