This movie has some redeeming features.  The reporters are comical, the action sequences are excellently staged, and the plot is a little more complex than you would at first expect.
But as a Desert Storm veteran who  fought in Iraq very close to where these events supposedly occured, I found  the film a little hard to swallow.  Events just didn't ring true.  Reservists who never saw action throwing wild parties at the conclusion of  the war - I doubt if it happened.  My unit - which did see combat - never  celebrated very much unit we returned to the United States (the end of the  mission was never clear cut - most of our fighting occurred after the  cease-fire).  A colonel yelling at a major as if he's a recruit in basic  training; soldiers in combat zones not wearing headgear; soldiers calling a  superior officer by first name; a career officer risking his retirement and  reputation (not to mention his life) to pursue some hairbrain plot with a  group of soldiers he doesn't know from Adam; soldiers running around  without the slightest hint of military discipline or training.  The list  goes on...  Virtual none of the characters in the movie behaved like any  soldier I ever knew.  (Oddly enough, the Ice Cube character was probably  the least unrealistic).  I didn't check the credits to see if any military  advisers were hired for this movie but - if they were - they certainly  weren't heeded very much.
Then there's the problem of geography.  Somehow  our intrepid stars manage to reach the Iranian border without crossing  either the Euphrates or Tigris rivers.
To give credit where credit is  due: much of the American and Iraqi uniforms and equipment were accurate.  But it wasn't enough to capture my imagination and make me forget that this  was anything more than a wild David Russell fantasy.  The characters were  so unreal to me that I never became involved in the story.
