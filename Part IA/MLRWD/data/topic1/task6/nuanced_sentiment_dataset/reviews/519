As someone who wanted to get into better shape without paying for a gym membership where everyone looks at you if you are not in perfect shape I thought this would be a great workout.  Please note that I am a beginner at working out.  Talking newbie all the way.

The DVD is broken into 10 segments.  These are easy to search for on the menu if you want to go back to one or go forward.  Each segment has a Level 1 and Level 2 depending upon how much you can endure.  Needless to say, I struggled with Level 1 workouts and only made it through the first 5 segments before my body was screaming at me to stop.

It does recommend that you have a pair of 3 lb and 10 lb weights.  Also you need a mat and a chair.  You wouldn't need a mat if you have carpeting where you are doing your workout.  Any kitchen chair will work.

When I first read the meal plan book included it made me want to forget about any type of meal plan and go eat some brownies.  The 4 recipes included were 3 chicken meals and one protein smoothie.  I made the Pepper & Chicken Stir-Fry and found it to be quite good.  The protein smoothie however wasn't liked by anyone here, but maybe that is just us.  I really think it was the protein powder that we used that made it not taste good.

RECOMMENDATION:
Beginners - NO (get something less demanding to start with)
Intermediate or Experienced - YES
