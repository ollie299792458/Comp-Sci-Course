I've read several reviews below that say "From Hell" does not glorify violence, and most of the killing is done off screen.  I beg to differ!  I'm a huge horror movie fan, and I almost had to leave the theatre.  The murders start out relatively tame:  a woman is pulled into a dark alley, and we see the glint of a knife as it comes up and down repeatedly.  Not too gross, but definitely effective.  As the film progresses, though, the murders and their aftermaths become more gruesome.  Another victim's body is found disembowled, and little is left to our imaginations at this point.  A third victim's murder is shown to us in graphic detail--a woman is held while her throat is slashed.  Notice how I say slashed and not "cut"--blood spews in every direction.  The next victim's demise is almost just as bad--a shadow seems to step in front of her, and when it leaves, blood is bellowing from her throat.  And the FINAL victim?  Well, if you've ever seen pictures of the real fifth victim, you'll know that the Ripper didn't leave much to be identified here.  And the film doesn't hold back in this depiction of violence.  Perhaps it's not the grossest movie ever made, but in such a realistic environment and tone, the blood and gore seem very horrendous and hard to watch.
