While this film did somewhat show that Jackie Chan is a very good actor and the photography was exceptional, it proved to be too disjointed to be,concerning the subject,"entertaining". Whoever selected the cast went out of their way to find an "American" that either was naturally pathetic or was inclided to betray American's as pathetic. The first hint this was a Chinese Comm. propaganda film was the reluctance to show the revolutionary army's battle flag fully extended. The very last line in the film claimed the whole revolution was the effort of the Communists who,truth be told, did not exist for many years after the fact and had no role in 1911. This may be the reason it seemed so much was cut out. Perhaps the ChiComms deleted all materiel' that was contra to thier propaganda. The quality of the sets and the action scences are first-rate, however. The effort,on a whole,resulted in a waste of time and money when anything Jackie Chan and/or Joan Chin should be at least worth otherwise.
