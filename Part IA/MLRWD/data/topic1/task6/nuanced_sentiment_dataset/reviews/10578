When I look back on the decade that I grew up in {The 1980s} afew things come to mind.Bad Hair Styles and Great Movies.
I know most people who think of 80s movies usually think E.T.,Gremlins,Ghost Busters,Back to Future,John Hughes and Nightmare on Elm Street.Myself being one of them...but ontop of all those I think MONSTER SQUAD!!
The MS came out when I was 12 years old {pretty much the same age as the squad themselves} and it instantly became apart of my childhood that I will always cherish.The film just has Movie Magic,it has memorable kids,funny lines,good special effects and all the classic universal monsters,what more could a kid ask for in a fun adventure movie.
Its too bad this movie never got the respect that the goonies got,it does have its core audience though,but I rarely hear anybody say MS is one of there favorite 80s films.
Welp since I never hear it Im here to say it:THE MONSTER SQUAD IS NOT ONLY ONE OF MY FAVORTIE 80S FILMS,ITS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS EVER AND this DvD is a blessing.TMS Kicks alot of Monster Butt!!
