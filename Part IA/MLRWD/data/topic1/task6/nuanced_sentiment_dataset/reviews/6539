This is not the first interview that Fra. Junge has given. View the sensational 1974 documentary, "The World At War,' narrated by Lord Laurence Olivier, and you will see a much younger Junge musing over her tenure with Hitler. Most of the information that she provides in this documentary was given in "The World At War." The 1974 documentary is filled with footage of Hitler. Having had relatives who were in Germany at the time, and personally knowing former German soldiers and officers, I find it difficult to believe that Junge did not know of the Nazi Death camps as both rumors and hard evidence surfaced while they were going on. I believe she knew but because of the fact that she was so taken by Hitler, perhaps she did not want to believe the rumors. My mother personally met Hitler when she was 15 and was totally mezmerized by his apparent charm and grace. At any rate, "Blind Spot" repeats "The World At War" interviews, and is a "talking head" that would have been better produced with raw footage with voice-over. The three stars is for effort, minus one star for "nothing new" and minus another star for German and not English (English sub-titles). The younger Frau spoke good English in 1974 but is lost in "Blind Spot."  SG
