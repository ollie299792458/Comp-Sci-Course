Yes, the year was 1983 and Connery, Sean Connery, was back - back in action as James Bond, secret agent 007. Well, the movie, in and of itself, was certainly better than its official franchise competition "Octopussy." However, it could have and should have been even better. A long and difficult project from the beginning, it had the good fortune to have Connery as its main attribute. And here he is in fine form looking much fitter, in fact, than he did in the 1971 "Diamonds Are Forever." The initial half hour is a breeze that unfortunately the movie cannot sustain in its entirety. There are many fine moments interspersed thereafter but the overall translation of storyline to screen suffers a bit in the execution. Nice touches abound but definite improvements would have been welcome in the way of certain character portrayals along with tighter editing as the film progresses. As previously noted, the Michel Legrand score does not even approach the quality level of John Barry's work. However, with the exception of a few lame and inappropriate cues, it really is not all that terrible. An interesting note is that the original theme song (as sung by Phyllis Hyman) had to be shelved due to legal reasons. A very catchy and Bond-like tune, it is not available as a special feature in this re-release. Try an Amazon.com MP3 download if you are interested. Overall, "Never Say Never Again" is a fine entertainment that seems (now that the official franchise has eschewed many of its trademark trappings) more in sync than ever before with the entire series.
