I have not much to comment on the movie itself. It'll be excellent for those ready to accept a surrealistic film and be poor for those looking for hight tech effects &amp; true plot. I have to admit that I personally very much enjoyed it. I saw this movie first when I was some 14 and it had a considerable effect on me. Actually I could never forget the scene with the rotting body at the "basement" (and was careful enough to avoid stepping on any sewer top for years...). Since than a good 15 years has passed so I was a bit sceptic whether the movie could still have the same effect on me. It almost could. But there was something completely disturbing: the dubbing. During the whole movie I saw the guys standing next to their microphones, with pages in their hands, reading a text. As if it was a kind of a penalty for them. This never happened to me before but it almost ruined the whole atmosphere of the film. I'll switch to Italien the next time I watch it -not understanding a word-  only to see if there's a difference. I won't lose much anyway since the movie is more built on visuals/sound rather than on conversations. I frankly don't understand how come a dubbing like that gets released.
