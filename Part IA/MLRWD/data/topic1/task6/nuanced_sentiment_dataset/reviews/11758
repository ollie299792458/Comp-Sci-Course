Totally unoriginal, many of the scenes and most ideas are rip-offs from any zombie flick, Mad Max movie, medieval chop-fest, Bruce Campbell b-movie - you name it.  Can you say 28-Days later clone?  Even the music was cheesy - third rate talent just repeating the same lyrics over and over and over. Imagine being tortured with the words "When two tribes go to war..." - yes, just those five words - so repetitiously (not to mention poorly and off-key) that you have to mute the volume. Apparently they think screaming the lyrics louder and pounding the guitar make up for the lack of talent.  The heroine? Clone of Resident Evil.

Explosions: I swear, rocks explode. Billboards explode.  Anything that is involved in a crash explodes.  I'm honestly surprised that the horses did not explode as well.

Nothing about this movie makes any sense. Zero. Zilch. Nada. The writer (If anyone would claim this drek as their own) was probably on Meth while watching parts of Camelot, Dawn of the Dead, Army of Darkness, Resident Evil and 28 days later.  When he regained consciousness he probably thought he dreamed an original gore-fest.  Not even close.  I can't think of a single scene in this flick that was not ripped off from other movies.

You'll notice ideas also stolen from: Escape from NY, Coneheads (yes, Coneheads), Beyond Thunder Dome, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Demolition Man - too many to list. They all did it much better.

I watched it once.  That was MORE than enough for me.
