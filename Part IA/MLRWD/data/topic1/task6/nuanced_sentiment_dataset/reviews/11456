come and see is a good soviet era film with the usual anti-german propoganda. upon watching, several points immediately come to light. 1) this is a very realistic story of the horrors on the eastern front by the ss, wehrmacht and especially the totenkopf and einsatzgruppen. the desecration of civilian populations during barbarosa are legendary and this movie accurately (and graphically)brings these horrors to life on the screen. make no mistake about it; this is an emotional look at the loss of families, villages with complete and utter destruction. you do feel the emotions. 2)this movie is not an action-packed "war" film in the winter war or cross of iron tradition. you do see parts of partisian camps "behind the scenes", villages being ransacked and small bits and teases of action but that, unfortunately, is as good as it gets. if you want strictly action, look elseware. this ain't gonna do it for you "oh my god they're using patton m-48's for the panzers" folks. if you want a rare look from the partisian and civilian viewpont of the german withdrawl...look no further.
