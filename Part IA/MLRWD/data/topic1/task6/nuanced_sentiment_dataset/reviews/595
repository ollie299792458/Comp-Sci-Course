First off, no one would deny that the CEO of GM was a greedy old white man that only cared about making a profit for his company and shareholders.  The thing that irks me about this movie is how poorly it defends the side of capitalism.  Essentially, capitalism has no voice.  Moore has obviously never taken a course in economics.

Why doesn't he make a movie about a socialist society?  Go to Cuba and film how awful the living conditions are there.  The people there will never live to see the day of 5% unemployment.  In case you didn't know, most European countries have well over 10% unemployment.  They'll never have any of the opportunities that even poor people enjoy here.  How would it be to live under a politburo where a bunch of old men sit around a table and decide what job you do, where you live, and how you live?

Capitalism gets a bad wrap because it's based on a theory that men will only do what's in their best interest.  It's interesting that this crazy theory, when applied in it's most purest form, has resulted in the wealthiest country in the world.  Make no mistake about this either, no one cares for their and the world's poor better than the U.S.

I do feel bad about those individuals in Flint that lost their GM job.  What's great about this country is how determined our people are to rise up and find better lives for themselves and their families.  They also have their freedom to do so.
