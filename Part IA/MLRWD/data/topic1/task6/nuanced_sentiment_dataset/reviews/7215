A while ago I remember this movie being hyped pretty badly, about how great it was going to be.  Finally got an opportunity to see it the other night at a friend's house and... it was okay.  The biggest strength for the movie was the whole camcorder viewpoint thing and it's also what makes it such a pain to watch.  It's shaky, you'll end up looking at peoples' shoes, and the guy holding it comes off as a buffoon.  He gives his stupid little comments through the whole movie.  The monster is big and weird-looking enough, but there's no reason given.  Just shows up and starts knocking over buildings.  Even at the (subpar) finale, theres no insight given, no direction.

The characters aren't interesting, they're all just the same yahoos.  And the first twenty or so minutes of the movie are you being forced to watch a bunch of teen drama coming from twenty-somethings that's supposed to show some insight into the people you're supposed to care about, but it fails and is just boring.

So far I've said nothing good about the movie, so I, too, am wondering why I gave it three stars.  Well, it's not terrible or anything, it's just not at all good.  There are plenty of worse ways to spend an afternoon, but... rent it, don't buy it.  You probably wouldn't want to see it twice.
