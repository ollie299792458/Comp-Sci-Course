I would recommend this film for the outstanding imagery, acting and directing. Since socialism collapsed in Russia and a new wave of "commercial" Russian films came out, it became a rear occasion to see a work of such high quality and culture. This film holds a unique place and certainly belongs to the best movies ever made worldwide. The film shows the reality where God is omnipresent, and people who have established their own connection with the Universe. They receive this gift not for being virtuous. Just like everybody else, the chosen people carry their own sins. The story of the film is about Anatoly, a holy man living the life of his repentance, prayer and service. Anatoly betrayed and shut a man. During long years of repentance at a small monastery in the Northern part of Russia he gets the gift of clairvoyance and spiritual healing. His prayer acquires the power coming only with real faith (I would not confuse faith with church going - real faith is just as rear in a church as it is anywhere else. However, a religious ritual can be very powerful when conducted by a believer). Anatoly's visitors who come a long way to ask him questions do not always understand or appreciate his answers. God's ways are often incomprehensible. Even more difficult for our mind, brainwashed by logic, is to accept God's way and follow. In my opinion, this film though staged at a monastery, is not as religious as it is spiritual. It is also not as fictional as it seems: everything I saw on screen I had witnessed in real life. This is why it is important for me that the viewer does not just get a chance to watch the story - the viewer becomes a witness and a participant of the most powerful and sacred experience - a prayer. Miraculousely, the viewer's soul, if there is a grain of faith there, responds to Peter Mamonov's prayer and the gate opens.
