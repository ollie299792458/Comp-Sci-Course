I don't know why I'm doing this. There is this longing for finding something deeper in life. I want to be without prejudice and hope that perhaps I find something, or fear I might miss something if I don't watch a movie like this one. But again I ended up in embarrassment to have actually watched this entire movie. I won't tell a friend that I watched the whole thing because it was the most hideous pseudo spiritual kitsch I've seen in a long time, and I should have been able to see that when I looked at the cover of the DVD. It was about as bad as one of the propaganda movies about Joseph Smith that you can watch when you visit the visitors centre of the Mormon Church in Salt Lake City. Scratch that, that Joseph Smith movie had at least some informative value. Other than that, it was a similar story: scrolls provided by angels and translated with divine help. Think of those Sunday school books for children for a $1.00 at Ocean State Jobs lots, or for a dime on a garage sale, with Moses and the Lamb and God making a fancy light show in the sky. If you really want to watch this movie, wait until you can get it for a dime on a garage sale. The one star is for the music, that was OK.
