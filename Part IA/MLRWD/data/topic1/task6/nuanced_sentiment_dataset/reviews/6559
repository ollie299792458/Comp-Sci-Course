Like most movies based on "a true story", this one is well-done for many reasons on its own but as far as who the main character is and what they do or did in real life, I think it may mislead people. (Erin Brokovich, etc.)

I've read Borstal Boy at least 10 times (along with "Confessions of an Irish Revolutionary", "Brendan Behan's Island", etc. and all of his plays, two of which I have participated in) and I feel the movie doesn't even come close to the enjoyment that you can find in the book, which usually seems to be the case in movies based on books. What bothers me is there are only small hints in the book to Behan's so-called homosexuality and speculation on its importance in his life in general. Maybe he was bisexual because it is sure that he liked women. But who cares, really? To play up that angle and make this a "gay" movie was a mistake. There are so many interesting issues in Behan's telling of the story about friendship, flirtation, loyalty, disloyalty, the law, being Irish, honor, work, having fun as a young man, being funny in general and singing. The "real" story (or at least told and intended by Behan in the book) is so much richer, more beautiful and interesting. To believe that the movie reflects who he was and his life reduces him to an object in a "politically correct" flick which, I think, cheapens his memory. Long live Breandan O Beachain!
