I first saw From Here to Eternity at a theatre that shows classical films on the weekends about 20 years ago.  I saw it on a Friday and then came back the next day to see it again.  I purchased the video about a week later.  And probably watched it three or four more times before finally tiring of the repetition.

The acting is superb.  Especially the performances of Burt Lancaster,Frank Sinatra and Deborah Kerr.  It has been said that Sinatra's performance resurrected his career and Burt Lancaster has always been an excellent actor.  But Lancaster's role as the tough but fair company top kick was mesmerising and that role along with his performance in Go Tell the Spartans at the end of his career are my two favorite Lancaster roles.

This film is in black and white and justifiably so--this color emphasizes the darkness and ominous atmosphere leading up to World War Two. As well as the conflict and tension percolating in the hearts and minds of the film's main characters.

I wait a couple of weeks or maybe a month and then I'm anxious to experience the tension and drama of this terrific film again.  I'm surprised that it only placed number 51 of the top 100 films of the 20th century.  It deserves better.
