Se7en is a taunt and relentlessly intense thriller that will have you talking about it for days.

It tells the story of two inner-city police officers, Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) and Detective Sommerset (Morgan Freeman). Mills in a young, inexperienced detective who is starving for come real action.  Detective Sommerset is ready to retire, until a case comes along that changes his plans.  Soon, both are working together to find a killer who kills his victims according to the seven deadly skills (gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, wrath).  Each crime scene gets more grousome, and each time they come closer to catching the real killer.  I would of course never reveal the ending, but let me just say that it will shock and impress you with its intelligence.

It is the second film under the direction of David Fincher, but his first was Aliens 3, so I prefer to consider it his first.  And what a debut.  The whole film seems to have a sinister atmosphere, and one that leaves a foul taste in your mouth (it's a good thing, believe me).  Each scene is well angeled.  Despite how gory the deaths are, most of the blood and bodies are kept off screen, which shows maturity on Fincher's part (sloth is pretty hard to watch, though).  Unfortunately, one thing that brings the film down is that it has a few scenes that seem to linger and have little to do with the main part, and that might take an anxious filmgoer out of the movie.  But remember to be patient, because it will all be worth it.

The acting is very memorable, especially on the villian's part ( I won't reveal the actor).  Freeman and Pitt also do great jobs, and demonstrate why they are where they are.  Gwyneth Paltrow also has a small role in the film, and she does a decend job, but is mostly on auto-drive.

Overall, Se7en is one of the most memorable thrillers for its intensity, acting, and of course, the ending.  A must-see for anyone interested in seeing how to make a sophisticated thriller.
