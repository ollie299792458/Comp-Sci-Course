Well, our young kids liked it...

But for adults, it wasn't even close to being as good as the original Hoodwinked.

There were a couple funny movements, but the original was packed full of them.

The movie had some of the same voice talent from the first movie, but not all. Red is voiced by a different actress.

I wondered how well this movie did in the theaters compared to the first, and the Internet Movie Database showed that the first movie opened to 16 Million USD while this movie opened with only $4 Million USD the first week in the theater. Hoodwinked Too had terrible earnings compared to the first which is a reflection of how movie goers felt about the film.

This movie didn't have the charm or surprises of the first. There were new elements, but no new magic (which is hard to achieve in a sequel, but it can be done...the Toy Story sequels for example).

The references to Star Wars sure seemed out of the Blue. Other Gags in the movie seemed contrived and didn't gain the laughs I'm sure they were hoping for.

The goat was pretty funny in the first movie, but in Hoodwinked Too, it's hard to understand why he's in it at all.

The one thing they could have used more of was the evil bunny.

For parents, this one may be harder to watch. It did make me want to watch the first movie since it was unique and fun.

The kids liked it, so that stands for something. They didn't laugh a lot throughout the movie, but it did hold their attention.
