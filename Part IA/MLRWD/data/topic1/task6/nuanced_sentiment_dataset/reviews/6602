I have never written an online review before, but I've taken the time here because I am baffled by the critical acclaim that Junebug has received.

I am a film junkie, a writer, and I was born in the South.  I hated Junebug on EVERY LEVEL POSSIBLE.  With the exception of Amy Adams, who was outstanding, the entire cast was flat and uninteresting.  Perhaps this is because there is no logical  character development and the relationships are all jumbled or ill-defined.  If the characters were developed, that develepment contradicted things we learned earlier or just made him/her less sympathetic.  Are we supposed to like any of these people?  Also, the director felt it necessary at least four times during the film to let his camera wander for 2-3 minutes, for absolutely no reason.  The result is total confusion.  I could go on for an hour listing complaints, but suffice it so say, I left the theater confused, unsatisfied, angry, and wondering if a nation-wide sydicate of film critics had conspired to play a joke on America: Can we trick people into liking a terrible film just because we said so?

Most of my beef is with the screenplay.  What is the point?  Where is the emotional impact?  Where is the promised humor?  Where is the climax?  Where are the sympathetic characters?  I understand that Independent films are supposed to break with convention.  But the result has to be somewhat enjoyable.  Junebug does not deliver.

My final word... Don't believe the hype.
