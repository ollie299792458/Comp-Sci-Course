Sam Fuller's classic, White Dog, is about a dog that was trained to attack Black people--a "white" dog. The film is based on Romain Gary's short story that was published in Life magazine in 1968. It was released to a limited theatrical run in 1982 and was never released on tape until 26 years later when it was released on DVD in 2008.

The story is definitely disturbing and much of that was relayed successfully in the film. I thought the quality of the picture was superb! The acting teetered between mediocre and good, however.

I'm sure the film had a much greater impact back in the early eighties when it first came out. Racism was still a raw subject in much of America. The fact it had a limited theatrical release tells me that America was not yet comfortable with the raw message of the film: Once a racist, always a racist.

The reason I chose to watch this film was because I find Sam Fuller's film intriguing and relentlessly disturbing. The strength in this film is in the message, not the quality of filmmaking.
