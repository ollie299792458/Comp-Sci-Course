WWE SURVIVOR SERIES 11.14.04 CLEVLAND,OHIO

A good Survivor Series with lots of action from start to finish.

Opening Match:

1. WWE Cruiserweight Title Fatal 4 Way Match

Spike (c) vs Kidman vs Rey Mysterio vs Chavo Guerrero

Great opener with lots of action.  Spike gets the pin on Chavo to retain the gold following a Kidman Leg Drop.7/10

2. Intercontinental Championship Match

Shelton Benjamin (c) vs Christian

Good match only thing I didnt like was all the interference from Tyson Tomko.  Admist all the interference Benjamin still retains with a T-Bone Suplex on Christian for the 1-2-3.6.8/10

3.8-Man Survivor Series Elmination Tag Team Match

Kurt Angle,Luther Reigns,Mark Jindrak, and Carlito Carribean Cool

vs Big Show,Eddie Guerrero,Rob Van Dam, and John Cena

Similar to 2003s Smackdown Elimination Match with mutiplr people being the survivors.  Big Show,Eddie, and Cena are the only 3 left with Show getting the final elimination on Angle.5.7/10

4. The Undertaker vs Heidenreich

Worst match but not a horrible match.  'Taker has proven in the past that he can have great matches.  But we all Know that Heidenreich is no Bret Hart.  Ends with 'Taker scoring a Tombstone to get victory.3.6/10

5. Womens Championship Match

Trish Status (c) vs Lita

I wouldnt count it as a match as it didnt last 2 minutes.  Trish retains following Lita chair shot causing a Disqualification.

0.9/10

6. WWE Championship Match

JBL (c) vs Booker T

Good Match.  Ends with JBL getting help from Orlando Jordan to retain the title.7.3/10

7. 8-Man Survivor Series Elmination Tag Team Match

Triple H,Gene Snisky,Edge, and Batista vs Randy Orton,Chris Benoit,Chris Jericho,and Maven

Good match with Orton Being the sole survivor last pinning Triple H.  I will always remember Snitsky and his bloody eye.8/10
