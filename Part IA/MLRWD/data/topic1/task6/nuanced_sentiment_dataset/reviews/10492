So I saw this movie when it was in theaters way back yonder, and thought it was a pretty interesting flick.  Some aforementioned comments speak of how absurd it is, the military chasing down arabs and/or preaching about racism, but if anyone really checked their history book, it wouldn't have been the first time the US military imprisoned people because of their ethnicity; just look at the Japanese Internment camps.  Granted, we all learned our lesson since, but the point of the movie was a big "what if" in modern terms.
Now fast forward years later in a post 9/11 world.  This isn't such a bizarre movie after all.  Matter of fact, during the aftermath of it all, this movie did in fact pop into my head.  Terrorism in New York (in different fashions, but similar meaning) by Islamic extremists and the reaction of such events as seen from a couple different aspects.  It wasn't too far off.  There are some very cinematic elements thrown in, but the really subtle stuff that didn't pertain to the story is really what bled through.  If anything, just watch this movie to compare our view of terrorism then (which we obviously underestimated) and now.  Sure it's not an Oscar caliber flick or anything, but it's a good one to watch on occasion.
