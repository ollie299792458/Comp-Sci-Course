I love Star Trek. When I first saw it, I really loved "Star Trek: Insurrection". Unfortunately, the film has not held up in repeat viewings, and this is quite often a good way for me to objectively view  something I otherwise really like.
"Insurrection" is not a bad  movie. It is fun, interesting, and visually high quality.  The problem here  is that it is a small and derivative plot that would be much better suited  as a one hour television episode. I know that a lot of negative reviews out  here have said the same thing, and at first, I was in total disagreement.  Looking at the movie now, however, I can't help but agree.
Star Trek  movies need to be big and exciting. They need to have excellent stories,  interesting villans, and good special effects.  Insurrection's story was  slightly above average, but it has way too many flaws. The villans are poor  at best, and I am not a big fan of computer-generated starships.
It seems  to have also gotten to the point where "Insurrection" has token  action scenes. I like space battles and blazing phaser guns, but the  Enterprise space battle was useless to the story and came across EXACTLY  that way. If a scene like this can't be done purposfully, then save money  and don't write it in.
I liked "Insurrection", so please don't  take me for an anti-trek person. I feel it was a very good movie. I just  don't think it makes a very good STAR TREK movie. I actually like 1 and 5  better.
