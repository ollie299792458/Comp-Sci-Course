Wkrp in Cincinnati may not be high art, but it is arguably the finest comedy series ever produced.  Everyone involved deserves far better than this shameful, mutilated insult of a DVD release.  Can we say ripoff?  What a surprise.  Yet again, the consumer is being treated as a mere commodity, accorded absolutely no respect.  It appears that the music industry prefers to gnaw its own arm off rather than be reasonable about anything.  And Fox assumes that nothing matters, people will buy any old thing, so why bother crafting quality products.  Given the popularity of "reality" shows and other appalling silliness, such cynicism is almost understandable--but that's a separate complaint.

Such flagrant  contempt still makes me furious.  I must admit I was tempted to buy this set, despite its egregious substitutions and omissions, because I've always loved the show.  But no, I just can't bring myself to do so.  If we will stand still for such shlock, shlock is all we will ever get.  Anybody have a good WKRP bootleg available?

UPDATE:  Obviously, I did break down and buy this product, but I bought a used set -- purposely -- to eliminate or minimize any positive reinforcement for the producers. I hope the creative folks who did the show haven't gone hungry as a result, but it still makes me angry that this business, like so many others, evinces absolutely no regard for the public that keeps them prosperous.
