Here's another of those movies that the public went to in droves.  And, as with Armageddon, Top Gun, Godzilla, and so many others, it is a big waste of film.  I can't say I hated this lame story as much as I absolutely loathed Armageddon, but it's close.  Why, oh why can't they have a script before they start cranking out fast food tie-ins? And why do I keep thinking just maybe *this* will be the blockbuster that actually amounts to something other than frequent eye-rolling at the endless cliches and overall BADNESS of it?  God awful stuff, especially all of the characters and the horrid dialogue.  And that Randy Quaid character...jeeez. 
OK...I'll admit to liking one scene in the film.  It's where Will Smith gets up in the morning and goes out to get the paper, still half asleep, and finally starts to notice his panicked neighbors fleeing, and finally the huge spaceship looming on the horizon. A cool shot, and it gave me a little tingle that "wow, wouldn't that just blow your mind?!"  Too bad those 5 minutes are basically it.  Please people...just because it will sound cool in your home theatre is no reason to buy a DVD of this junk.
