For want of trying to avoid a little girl two stories emerge. Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) either catches or misses a train. The two stories then interweave as both Helens interact with many of the same characters. She has a boyfriend who is unfaithful (and is something of a wretch to boot) and she meets and dates a man who is her soulmate. Other reviews have commented on the unfaithful boyfriend being such a schlemiel that it is an insult to her intelligence for her to stay with him. Folks: LOVE IS STUPID SOMETIMES. I found the awkwardness others complain about to be part of the charm. Love does work like that. But - the humor is snappy - very British and laugh out loud funny (I can sit stone faced through many so-called comedies, so take this as a complement of the highest order.) - and the movie is good fun. This is a chick flick, but trust me guys - you'll enjoy it too. Awkward in places (I would have had the divergence scene split on screen and maintain that split screen to parallel the scenes until the train leaves.) but a great first effort by writer-director Peter Howitt. And props for one of my favorite Warren Zevon written songs being included. I'll let you find it. Enjoy!!!
