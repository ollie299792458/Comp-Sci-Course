To the script writers of the movie "The Vow":

Way to take an epic, real-life story of heroic Christ-like love and strip the heart and soul out of it.

I know you Hollywood types are chronically incapable of comprehending anything remotely resembling true, unconditional commitment that never gives up for any reason, but just because you can't understand it doesn't give you license to pull it down to your level. This movie proves that Hollywood really can't tell true love when it's staring them right in the face in the form of the real-life couple that this movie is (barely) based on.

In summary: Deeply disappointed.

If you want to know the REAL story, Amazon.com sells the book authored by the real couple that actually went through these events AND chose to stay true to their vows, regardless of how difficult it was.  Kim and Krickitt Carpenter had a very rough beginning to their marriage, but Kim (the husband) never divorced Krickitt, there was no pressure from her father to do so, and there was no schism between her and her family.  This movie takes the real-life drama of a painful and difficult situation and replaces it with artificial made-for-Hollywood drama that was far less interesting.  And worst of all, they stripped out the very faith in God that is the core of their love for one another and which made it possible for them to work through their tragedy.
