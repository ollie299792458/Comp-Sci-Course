This movie is clearly not the best of the Alien legacy, and is maybe the worst, knowing that we cannot really compare it with "Alien" that appeared about 10 years before. My preferred movies are clearly "Aliens" and "Alien - Resurrection". The screenplay of "Alien 3" is correct but is disappointing. Indeed, the beginning of "Aliens" is completely in adequacy with the end of "Alien" and the beginning of "Alien -Resurrection" is completely in adequacy with the end of "Alien 3". For "Aliens" and "Alien - Resurrection" the screenplay was constrained to respect some important facts from previous opuses (an unknown planet - with hundreds of eggs - to be explored, the death of Lt Ripley) but the scriptwriter had (in my opinion) much more freedom for "Alien 3", the only constraint being that Ripley had to be found in a spaceship with her misfortune comrades (see "Aliens"). So, I was waiting for something really new: the idea of the prison was not too bad but badly exploited in my sense. Something else that was weird: there were 2 parasites in the spaceship, one had impregnated Ripley and the other did nothing !? Was it waiting for the landing ? It should have tried to impregnate Newt or Hicks during their sleep. This is not explained in the movie, where only 1 egg is shown in the spaceship whereas there were 2 creatures ! Something is missing somewhere or I missed something.

Maybe I am a bit too critical, this is an interesting entertainment movie, at least to understand "Alien - Resurrection". However, I cannot give more than 3 stars to this movie since I think the movie could have been much better and somewhat vitiates the Alien legacy.
