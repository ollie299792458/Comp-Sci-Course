If you loved "The A Team", you'll love this movie. Cartoon like characters, dialogue straight out of "He Man", zillions of rounds fired with the good guys relatively unscathed and girls who dig it when a fella can put the smack down on a small gang made me look for B.A. or Face to show up in the black van.

  The plot was of course ridiculous. When first you, like me, find yourself saying "wait, that can't happen ...", understand this will occur to you untold more times and let it go man, just let it go.

  The 40 to 65 year old characters' personalities and actions would embarrass any self respecting pubescent teen. "Granddad why are you getting a skull tattoo"?

  As a complete movie "The Expendables" is sub par, 2 stars at best.

  To be fair, if the plot, characters, dialogue and believability are not important to you, and your demands are impervious heroes full of machismo ducking thousands of rounds while things go boom, this may just be your kind of film.
