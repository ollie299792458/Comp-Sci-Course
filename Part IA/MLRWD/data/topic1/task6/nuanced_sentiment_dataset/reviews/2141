I was a junior in high school when this film came out.  I went to see it on a school holiday with, of all people, my mother and grandmother.  My grandmother enlightened the entire audience at the beginning of a love scene by leaning over to my mother and stating, in a loud, stage whisper, "He's gonna get a little!"

I loved this movie at 15.  Maybe it was my teenage infatuation with Barbara Parkins, the hit theme, the fab, keen, neato, psychedelic sets.  Maybe it was just being a part of the swingin' 60's.  This film IS the epitome of the 60's, for sure.

More recent viewings have changed my perspective, however.  Patty Duke is so awful it's painful to watch, even all these years later.  Sharon Tate is so beautiful it's painful to think what might have been.  As for Barbara Parkins - what happened?

Anyway, driving home from the theater that afternoon in 1967 an old man in an old Chevy pulled into my lane, hit my MG in the front fender and knocked me up onto the sidewalk, barely missing a telephone pole.  I will always associate those two things together - that car wreck and "Valley of the Dolls".  Kinda ironic.
