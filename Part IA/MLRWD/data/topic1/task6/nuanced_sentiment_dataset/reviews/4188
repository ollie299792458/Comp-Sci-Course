This one was different from the rest. There was a lot more drama, and talking, mixed with some action. I guess I had high hopes for even A LITTLE more racing scenes is this whole movie.  It was more of an action movie with guns and muscles than what the original The Fast and The Furious started with.  Even though the director said they're trying to "evolve", get away from the racing stuff. It was a little disappointing to only see one real race, which wasn't exciting at all.  Then when you think there's going to be a race, they edit it out completely.  Probably because we know whose going to win in the end, sure, but it's still fun to watch.  "The Rock" (Dwayne Johnson) was a great addition to the movie. His character in this playing "Hobbs" was hunting down Dom, Brian and the team.  Also bringing back some of the other characters from the four movies before his one was a great addition.

I don't know, you be the judge.  If you like action movies with guns blazing mixed with some standard cars and destruction. Then you may like this movie.  If you only liked the other other fast and furious movies before this because of the street racing, cars, or feel of it.  You may or may not be disappointed.
