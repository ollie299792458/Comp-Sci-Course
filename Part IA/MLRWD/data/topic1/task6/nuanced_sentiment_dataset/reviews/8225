This is an enjoyable film, make no mistake about it, but Besson seems to be a little too directionless.

The film meanders between being a profound statement on the future and the human condition and being a cult b-movie style sci-fi flick.

 It shows flashes of brilliance in both genres, but ultimately it is just a little disappointing. The ending feels too emotional to be part of a comic film, but just too pat and cliche for words. There's also a cringeworthy moment taken straight out of a Bond film. Not that there's anything wrong with Bond, but in parts the Fifth Element strives to be so much more.

 The visualisation of the world of the future is clever, quirky and stunning in parts, especially since this film is a bit old as far as CGI goes. Jean-Paul Gaultier's wonderful costumes deserve a mention too (yes, Bruce Willis does wear a vest!)

 The story has lots of potential, with aliens galore and the rise of an evil power, and there's plenty of action and a few suspenseful moments too. Ultimately though, Besson's characters are stretched just a bit too thin for this film to be truly meaningful, and there's too much serious content here to play it strictly for laughs.

 Some wonderful  moments, but this film probably won't change your life, or have you laughing in the aisles.
