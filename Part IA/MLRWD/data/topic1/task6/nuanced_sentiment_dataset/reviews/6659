Plain and simple. When it came time to replace my VHS cassette tape version, I bought this one- the director's cut.

....I was disappointed after watching it.

I found it very distasteful when Solieri extended his contempt for Mozart to Mrs. Mozart. It ruined the film.

  In the theatrical version, Solieri simply misled Mrs. Mozart in order to spy Mozart's works. He became a liar. It revealed or highlighted Solieri's inner conflict, his lying to himself. To me that is what gave the characters believability  and tension.

In this director's cut Solieri made Mrs. Mozart strip to gain his influence and considerations, but then called in the guards after she stripped, to publicly make a whore of her.

....To me it did ruin the film, and changed the character of the film. The characters went from tense and suspenseful to lewd and ignorant. It ruined the film!

I am shocked that these other reviewers didn't feel the same thing. Look for the theatrical version.
