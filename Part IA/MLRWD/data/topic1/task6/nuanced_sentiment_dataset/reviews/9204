This movie has two things going for it, in my opinion. First, it has Dennis Quaid. Who can help liking him? Second, it is only 90 minutes long, thankfully. More than likely you will be glad you didn't spend two hours or more on this disappointing movie. The premise of the movie, i.e. the four horsemen of the apocalypse being used as a motivation for murder, was intriguing, but ultimately it was frustrating and disappointing because the storyline was too incoherent. There was just too much of this movie that didn't make sense, and you're kind of left scratching your head. I agree with other reviewers about the graphic violence, too... it was very, very disturbing, with many scenes involving bodies suspended by large rigs using fish hooks. So this movie is not for the squeamish and certainly should not be seen by young children. Perhaps many or most modern viewers have become accustomed to seeing such graphic bloody images and it doesn't faze them. But if so, is that a good thing? It's very sad in my opinion.

The best part of the movie was the storyline involving Dennis Quaid as the emotionally distant father and the way he and his kids deal with the loss of their wife/mother. But that part of the story was not explored enough, in my opinion. I recommend you pass on this movie.
