I saw "Heaven's Gate" in the original 4 hr. version in a tiny theatre in Blacksburg, VA, shortly after it flew in and out of the mainstream. I was on vacation and this was a box of Godiva cocoa candy for me.It is a story within a story - the point that most people have overlooked. And it IS only a movie.The friendship between Kristofferson and Hurt lingers due to common bonds (i.e. money, background, societal mores of the times). Kristofferson sees the dichotomy of what is really happening and acts. After seeing Sam Waterson in that part I can't watch him even in a commercial.That's how powerful the characters are.Ella is an indication of what is to come for women, the right to vote. Independent, fierce, she creates a space that is the apex of the triangle with the two men.Nate dying in the burning cabin penning her a love letter in death is in direct contrast to his focused killing of the immigrants. This is a chromograph paen to a time that few today can truly understand.  People want their movies in fast food bites with very little to do but nod their heads today sadly. This movie brings you straight into that time. Slower paced,more deadly than you can ever imagine, only the triumph of the human will survives. Yes, it is long. So is "Gone With The Wind". Art is not always popular nor truth. I fell in love with this movie having grown up in the West.Inaccuracies are inevitable in any retelling of a story.But "Heaven's Gate" shows the robber baron attitude in the latter part of the 19th century that was a preamble to an accepted form of behavior even to this day.And the score is available on CD."Heaven's Gate" is worth a watch. Along with the "Wild Bunch". And then you might understand how the West was really won.
