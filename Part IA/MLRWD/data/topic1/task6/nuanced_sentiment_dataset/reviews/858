I just watched "The Cowboys" starring John Wayne again for research, and I'd forgotten just what a great movie this is.  This was Robert Carradine's first film, and in the special features of the DVD, he says he thinks this was John Wayne's best performance, and he may be right.  If not, it is up there among the best.  Wayne was getting older, and his health wasn't the best, and that added to the tired Wil Andersen that he portrayed, but he still had the toughness to him.

Bruce Dern did a great job as the villain, and Roscoe Lee Browne's performance as Jebediah Nightlinger added much to the film, as did the fine young cast of cowboys.  Mark Rydell did a fantastic job of directing and the scenery was magnificent but not overbearing.

It's a story about growing up, the importance of being a role model, of doing what's right, and getting a job done.  All qualities The Duke stood for, and in this film, they all ring true.  It is a great western with a great performance by one of the most legendary tough guys, John Wayne.

The extras on the DVD, especially the interview with the director and some of the cast years later add to the package.  A must for fans of John Wayne, and also great for those who like a good western movie.
