I know mine is not a popular opinion, but I do not understand why Spider-man 2 is praised as being one of, if not the best comic book movie ever made.  Spider-man 2's plot is profoundly flawed.  The worst of these flaws is the "spider-man no more" premise borrowed from the comics. I found the idea that Peter's mysterious loss of his power was a physical manifestation of his psychologically desire and that his power's could be completely nullified by his will alone to be "very thin" (To quote Riggs from Lethal Weapon). It would have been more meaningful (and believable) if Peter simply made a conscience decision to be spider-man no more with powers intact.
Another flaw is the movie version of Doc Ock. I think it is sad the writers decided to use the tired and overused idea of "evil A.I.," reducing Doc Ock to a victim technology, instead of a truly menacing villain like Willem Defoe's Green Goblin. Alfred Molina is a gifted actor who deserved better. It would have been better to have Doc Ock driven into madness by the death of his wife and swear vengeance on Spider-man, who he blames for her death. Doc Ock could then regain his sanity by coming to terms with his role in his wife's death.
The last flaw I will discuss here is the fact that Spider-man appears unmasked in the presence of every major character in the movie, not to mention half the city of New York (unconvincingly portrayed by the city of Chicago).  The reactions of the New Yorkers who filled the train car as they peer on an unmasked Spider-man are more unbelievable than a teenage boy being bitten by a genetically altered spider and receiving super powers from it.
Thankfully, it is clear that the actors have comfortably grown into their roles for the sophomore film. Additionally, the visual FX in this film have trumped its predecessor. Lastly, the film does a decent job of continuing the character relationships of the previous film.
