Mike Sale (the British black guy playing an American) is the worst thing in this movie. Apart from being hopelessly miscast (ie: the English accent and about as tough as a powder puff) he cannot act his way out of a paper bag. Apparently he is an artist - well hopefully he is better at that than acting.

I struggle to see why he was cast in the role. The cast interviews on the dvd show him saying he disagreed with the director and was accused of being a diva on set - so why on earth didn't they fire him and get someone else?!

Mike Sale ruins every scene he is in and if someone else had been in the role, the movie might have been much better than it is.  Sure it is your typical cliche prison movie (shower nudity,pack-rape scene, etc) but Marcel Schlutt is gorgeous and plays his role convincingly.  (Be sure to watch the cast interviews as he looks much sexier in those with his short hair!)

The other thing I found a bit odd was that the "big sex scene" that the two actors talk about in their interviews is actually cut from the movie!  It is there in the deleted scenes, but I can't see why the director left it out - its abscence leaves the final farewell lovemaking scene look like something out of some sloppy Danielle Steel miniseries - especially the dreadful after sex cuddle!

If you buy this as part of the 3 movie 'Guilty Pleasures' set it is great value for money and there are some nice cock and body shots in the movie (especially the masterbation scenes), but don't set your expectations too high - because of Mike Sale it is pretty bad!
