Awful songs and plot.

I stopped it halfway because it was so bad and then finished it about 6 weeks later.

Phil Silvers is supposed to be funny, but his character is just pathetic.

Rita Hayworth's songs (not really her singing) are done in a style which thankfully hasn't lasted.

The love triangle: will Rita Hayworth's character choose riches by marrying a Broadway producer and dancing on Broadway, or will she marry the Gene Kelly character and dance on his stage in Brooklyn instead?

She never discusses just working with the Broadway producer while marrying the Gene Kelly character.  The movie just treats it as a given that she needs to choose the same man for her romantic-and-professional interests.

I didn't even like how Rita Hayworth looks in this movie.  Wearing 1940s makeup with lots of blush while being shown in Technicolor, isn't flattering for her.

"Singin' in the Rain" was great because the Donald O'Connor character was admirable and the Debbie Reynolds character was appealing.  Their counterparts in "Cover Girl" (Phil Silvers, Rita Hayworth) not so much in this movie.

The only scene I liked was when two images of Gene Kelly dance together.
