I watched this picture last night on the Family Channel. BF is embarrassingly bad. Compared with the latest two releases (Hollywood's apology for the first four), Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, Forever doesn't hold a candle of any size. It's so over the top stupid and colorful that it resembles the campy Batman TV series of the late 60's. Jones' Two-Face/Dent has little substsnce; Carrey's Riddler is total Carrey, which may annoy viewers; Kilmer's Batman/Wayne is quiet and pretty much Kilmer playing himself. Often the viewer can't suspend disbelief because Batman's stunts are ridiculous. He drives the Batmobile up the side of an apartment building, for instance. I don't know what happened since the first, semi-serious, semi-goofy Batman picture (directed by weirdo elite Burton), but the Forever's director turned the series into something too campy to be believed in. Anyone who's seen Batman Begins and Dark Knight will appreciate my words here, because they ditched all the glitz and camp for a real Batman picture, filled with an oppressively dark atmosphere, sadistically vile enemies, and an actual story that threads its way from Begins to Knight and beyond. I'd skip this flick (and don't even start on Batman and Robin) in exchange for the awesome job done on the series reboot.
