For the third time in 10 years, I have purchased another copy of "The Wild Bunch". And for the third time in 10 years, I have been utterly disappointed. I don't know what all of these other reviewers watched in 1969, but what I watched was a much, much wilder bunch with much more grusome footage at the old Majestic Theater in downtown Dallas. Someone, apparently do gooders, had the film cut back to the bland piece of work that you see in this DVD. Someone should sue Warner Bros. for false advertising. I am still looking for the original film and would pay good money for it, if it even still exists. In the killings in the original film the bodies struck by bullets, immediately went to slow motion as a stream of blood shot from the bullet hole in the beginning murderous scene. There is only one brief shot of this type and the rest, a least a couple of dozen were cut out and are still cut out. Save your money, if you think your getting the original.

I have recently learned that the movie was prescreened in Dallas and Houston before wide release. Due to the input from, conservative movie goers in those cities, at least according to my Hollywood contact, the film was butchered. The original out takes are now in an LA landfill and apparently the original prints no longer exist as Sam Peckinpah had little if no control over the second editing. If an original exists, it was squireled away sereptitiously, by some editor or confederate of Peckinpah against the wishes of the producers and studio. Maybe it will surface one day. "Profoundly disturbing" does not begin to describe the only movie that sent a girlfriend of mine running to the restroom to throwup.
