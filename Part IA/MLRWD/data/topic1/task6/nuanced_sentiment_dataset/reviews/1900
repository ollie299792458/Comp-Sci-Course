The initial symbolic drumbeat for "Algerie Francais" is a marvelous opener.  You are immediately drawn into this all too human political morass. France, under Charles DeGaul's leadership, relinquished control of its colony , Algeria, after great human sacrifice.  Extremists, (ex-military) decide to try to reverse the situation with the only viable plan possible, hire a foreign born contract killer, the "chacal".
On so many levels, the movie is great entertainment: the unfolding of the plot with almost journalistic detail, the characters involved, the pace of action, the scenery. My favorite is , of course the jackal, played by the English actor, Edward Fox. And Cyril Cusack's portrayal of the armorer is pure perfection. No one lets the viewer down. Even the automobiles used are great viewing, i.e. the Alfa Romeo and the Citroens. Incidentally the term used in the beginning of the movie, "queer the pitch" is a British idiom for "spoil it for everyone else". One is left with great empathy for all the characters portrayed
Adjudged even 40 years later, Forsyth and Zinnemann set a great standard!
