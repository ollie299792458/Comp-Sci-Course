I loved this movie the first time i saw it, which was after i bought it, unlike the Blade movies which added a new spin onto Vampires this movie also adds a spin to werewolves- looking into other supernatural beings, givingthe film more depth to it. I was glad that the film didn't over empathise the feelings between Selene and Scott, it would have totally ruined the movie and turned it into a cheap horror/romance flick when it was so much more than that.I do agree that a bit more of the lore of the Werewolf and Vampire link coulfd be explained, but on those occasions when it was delved into it was focusing more on the personal history - adding substance to the plot. But the link was explained, you just have to listen! Besides in the Sequel no doubt more of the past will be explained, hopefully more about Selene and Scott as their own histories are only ever hinted at, never fully explained to us, except maybe Selene but i digress, keping them in mystery. i cant wait for the Sequel as i found this movie fantastic with it's skew on the supernatural, i thoroughly recommend it to anybody who likes films that take a new spin on sometimes cliched ideas.
