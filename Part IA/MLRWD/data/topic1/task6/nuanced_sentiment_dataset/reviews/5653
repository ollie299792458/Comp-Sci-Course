Like many who watched the most recent 'Oscar's' show,

all we kept hearing about, was this film, 'Million

Dollar Baby.' It  kept upstaging it's rival,'The Aviator,'

at every turn. I was skeptical that a film could be that

good, and thought, oh it's just because Clint is up there

in age, etc, etc. Let me say that, I'm also like the worlds

biggest Clint Eastwood fan, but boy was I wrong! This film

is brilliant. It begins with a beautiful narrative by Morgan

Freeman, introducing us to the main characters in the

film, 'Frankie Dunn,' played by Clint Eastwood, a semi-retired

trainer in dusty rathole of a gym called 'The Hit Pit.' This

gym is filled with all kinds of likeable and not so likeable

fighters and wannabe fighters. Morgan Freeman plays 'Scrap,'

a long since retired boxer who helps 'Frankie' run the day to

day operations of the gym. One day, out of the blue, in walks

'Maggie,' brilliantly played by Hillary Swank. She's drawn

there by an insatiable desire to be a boxer. She is determined

to have 'Frankie' train her and will not take no for an answer.

'Frankie' has trained many great boxers but is hesitant to

train a "girl," as he refers to her. From this premise, one

might say okay, sounds familiar, "I can guess how this turns

out." You would be wrong! This film begins one way and takes a

swift turn southward, and never lets up. It explores what

motivates people, their background, and their eventual success

or failure, and the ramifications of this. The characters are

perfectly cast, the script is entertaining, and the acting is

exceptional. If you don't cry during this film, you just may

not be human. I won't spoil it by revealing what happens but

just to say, that I haven't seen a film this brilliant since

'Titanic,' and 'Shawshank Redemption.' I would dare say

you may not see a better film this year.
