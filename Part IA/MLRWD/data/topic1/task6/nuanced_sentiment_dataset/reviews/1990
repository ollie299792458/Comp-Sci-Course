I'm not particularly a fan of cartoon movies, but when Tinkerbell was released, I decided to sit down and watch it with my daughter and son. I'm so glad I did!

Tinkerbell is by far one of the best movies by Disney. Finally, Disney made a movie with a really important theme and message: Everyone is special and unique; there is nobody who can do what you do, like you do it. I walked away after watching Tinkerbell, feeling better about myself (and I'm 32 years old!). If I felt that way, then I know both my kids did as well.

This movie has a great message that every child can benefit from. I especially recommend every mother watch this with your daughter(s). Even my 5-year old son enjoyed it and watched it 3 more times the first day after we watched it together!

BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF MOVIE: Tinkerbell wants to be just like all the other dust fairies. She watches them bringing beautiful things to life and she wants to be just like them. But Tinkerbell is a tinker fairy, so when she attempts to bring spring things to life like all the others, she ends up creating mass chaos instead. Because of her wanting so badly to be like all the other fairies, she destroys all the hard work everyone else has been doing to bring spring to the Mainland.

Tinkerbell finally has an "AHA!" moment, when she understands that even though she isn't like all the others, her unique talent (fixer-upper) is exactly what is needed if the fairies can save spring. She quickly puts a plan into action, gathering all sorts of "stuff" and tinkers her way into creating tools all the fairies can use to save spring.
