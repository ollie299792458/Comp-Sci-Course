With a big budget, some great effects and some well known actors I had big hopes for this movie. My God was I disappointed. Jeremy London as Jason pulled the movie down. He had no charisma, no sense of leadership...I can't be bothered to go on about him. He just spoiled the movie from the start. Apart from him, I have no problem with the rest of the cast, more with the script. Sure there are plenty of encounters with monsters and the like, but  no sense of danger of excitement. Half the cast never use swords, they just walk around and hope large clumps of rocks will fall on their foes. I think I can compare the movie to someone who has just woken up in the middle of the night and is dreamily performing functions like making a drink, but not really aware of what they're doing. I think my faith in Hallmark Entertainment is waning after the dire Journey To The Centre Of The Earth and now this...
So why three stars? Well for Tv, its watchable enough. It could have been so much more, that's all. Jason's search for the golden fleece is classic storytelling and has everything from action to drama, personal tragedy to triumph...but in the hands of Hallmark it has been reduced to great looking scenary and some nice props...
If you liked the original 1963 movie, you'll still prefer it and leave this movie feeling like you've been cheated. Please someone tell Jeremy London to start acting when the director yells ACTION. I don't think the director ever yells WALK AROUND LOOKING MISERABLE AND BORED...not unless he is making a movie about people who saw this one.
