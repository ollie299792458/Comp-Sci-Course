Kill Bill - The Whole Bloody Affair by Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Lucy Liu:
yes, the studios have famously lied to us again. they hyped up the arrival of Kill Bill: the whole bloody affair for late November (just like they did for Cool Hand Luke: Special edition) (Yes, I'm aware they are two different studios, hence the plural in premier sentence) with no payoff and with no notification at all that there will be either delays or cancellations. But my question is to you people: do you even remember anything you hear or read? Why don't we all get together and just boycott buying anything from these double dippers. Break them at the knees. Stand up and shout "We're mad as He'll and we don't wanna take anymore of your ship!". Let's just stop buying any of their "SPECIAL EDITIONS" if they aren't released simultaneously with the single disc bare-bones, if that's the preferred nomenclature, editions. I, for one, won't be buying this set and I encourage the rest of you who were thinking about buying it to stop thinking and stop buying. And they complain about piracy? If the studious wouldn't false advertise, hype us up and lead us on and let us down, piracy would only be places like China. Boycott this item and boycott any double-dipping, late-releasing, not forth-coming dvds that were falsely advertises!
