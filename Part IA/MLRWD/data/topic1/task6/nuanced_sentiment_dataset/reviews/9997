With a little intellectual restraint, Michael Crighton's book "Congo" is an enjoyable summer read. In the book, various groups were working to find and seize the blue diamonds of the lost city of Zinj, deep in the Congo. The book had corporate espionage and ruthless characters to balance the gooey relationship between the primatologist and his gorilla "Amy." The movie has no such balance. There is no race to the jewels to provide any urgency to the expedition and no identifiable reason for Laura Linney of a communications company, the primatologist and a fortune seeker (with a terrible Romanian accent) to throw in their lot with one another; they just meet surreptitiously on the tarmac before departing for Africa. No scene is connected to the previous scene or to the one that follows. It's as if the director is making it up as he goes. It is so unbelievable that it borders on painful.  Amy is at best annoying. When the "bad" gorillas kill a character, it is a relief, rather than a loss. It is too bad that Amy escapes the fate of the lesser characters. Linney is a fine actress and just what she is doing in this bad a film is inexplicable. In such a script, that she was able to create a likeable and human character is a credit to her acting skills.
