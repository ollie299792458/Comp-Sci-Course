The guys who posted the first review probably don't like horror movies to begin with. Who cares about good reviews by critics. The movies that have good reviews by critics are the movies i don't like anyways. But yes this Hills have Eyes 2 (2007)sequel was boring and dreadful. I really wanted to like this movie but it just dragged. Most of the time, nothing happens in this movie other than the victims exploring this cave or that cave or this mine or that mine. The director stated in Fangoria magazine said that this movie will be more of a horror action movie. Yeah right! The Hills 2006 remake had much more action sequences and stunts than this movie. This sequel is not to be confused with The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 released in 1985. The 1985 sequel was an 80's slasher flick which is better than the The Hills Part 2 2007 turd. In the 1985 sequel, A group of teens on a bus get stranded in the desert and are killed off one by one like the Friday the 13th movies. The main female victim who happens to be blind and her boyfriend are the only ones left. If you're one of those people who like classic 70's and 80's horror movies than you'll enjoy The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 from 1985, especially if you're a slasher fan. This is on DVD under Image distributions.
