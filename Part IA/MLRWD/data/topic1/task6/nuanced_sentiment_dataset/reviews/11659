Latter day hippie communes populated by aging white progressive types, led by an all-knowing "Prophet" who happens to be a black Rastafarian type, an Evil Corporation, a Luddite anti-tech POV...all of your old favorite politically correct memes in one place!  If that's not enough, you also get - wait for it, you'll be shocked - an evil conspiracy involving the US Military and the aforementioned Evil Corporation!  Who'da thunk it?  It gets even sillier from there.  The progressive black Rastafarian dude is actually a rich old white dude, and...well, as I said, it gets sillier.

There are decent enough special effects here and there but wholly unbelievable outdoor action sequences as this "futuristic" world is loaded down with brand new looking Ford Crown Victoria cop cars and lots of 2009 Chevrolets.  There is the occasional shiny new Toyota Pious as well, and fashion seems not to have changed at all from, oh, I don't know, yesterday.  This futuristic world is about as futuristic as your trip to the grocery last week.

I'd have given it three stars for overall entertainment value (I did actually stay awake, always a plus), but had to subtract a star for its pathetic adherence to politically correct formulae.  It's par for the course these days, but that course has become annoying, stale and tired.  I hope Hollywood figures this eventually.
