Watching Clive Owen in Croupier and Arthur, I looked forward to viewing this movie even though I knew it was a bad sign that I had not heard of it.  Ebert's and Roeper's "two thumbs way up" also sold me on renting it, but I wonder if we saw the same film.  Boy, what an incomplete storyline!

  At the conclusion, I immediately went to see if there was a director's commentary to discuss what happened.  My main complaint is the lack of explanation why Boad (Malcolm McDowell) committed such a heinous act.  The reveal never came, nor did the desired backstory delving into what drove Will into isolation.

  On the plus side, I enjoyed the British dialogue and the setting.  We are indeed two nations separated by a common language.  This however is not enough to recommend this film.

  Here's hoping that Clive Owen will finally get a role that lets him use more of his facial muscles and a script that doesn't need an accompanying Cliff Notes to understand the plot.
