In the DVD extra features the director talks about the basis for this film, an article on street racing - on the sub-culture of men and women who live for speed and souped-up cars.  He talks of how he and the producers were fascinated by this sub-culture.  Why then did they make a pointless, appallingly written, admittedly technically deft piece of drivel?  If they were fascinated by this world, why didn't they make a film about the depths and details of the people inhabiting it, rather than a drab rehash of every bad undercover cop movie we have ever seen?  There were no characters, simply puppets at the service of the lame plot.  The police scenes were particularly stupid.  And I haven't seen a film in years where you could virtually hear the director call "Action" before every scene.  There was no truth, simply a bunch of actors moving into frame and saying their lines on command.  The film also contains some of the least convincing extras acting I have ever seen.  And very bad over-dubbing for extras rhubard mumbling.  The writing hit the biggest lows in every scene where the characters supposedly opened up.  Vin Diesel's BIG speech about Dad dying was like a laughably bad acting class audition speech.  Get the idea I hated this movie?  Too right I did.  And how depressing that it actually made money.  I was also appalled in the extra-features featurette about censorship to watch the director and editor quibble about a few frames of blood.  Okay to show characters of total moral bankcruptcy as supposedly cool and emulatable dudes, but perish the thought that we should see a few frames of blood.  This film is a classic example of the warped values of the Hollywood dream factory.
