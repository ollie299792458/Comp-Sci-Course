"The Untouchables" is one of few R-rated movies that I have seen. It is a great film, even though there are some things I don't like about it. I'll start with the good.

MUSIC: The composer should have been given an Oscar. The opening credits is one of the best things about this movie because of the haunting score demonstrated for nearly four minutes. There is no actual person in the entire sequence, just music and credits.

ACTING: Sean Connery and Robert DeNiro were the best as Jimmy Malone and Al Capone. Though Al Capone's role was small, it was well done. Jimmy Malone pulled at your heartstrings and stole the show until he got shot.

PLOT: The story gets the audience cheering when a villian dies, and weeping when heroes die. It's not just the story though, but the acting already mentioned.

That aside, I'm going to cover why I didn't give this film a higher rating.

GORE: There is lots of blood and gore-typically of post-Code Hollywood. This is a classic example of one of my favorite "what is Hollywood coming to?" arguments-the bloody the better seems to be the message displayed at modern theaters.

LANGUAGE: Because of constant uses of the f word, the four letter s word, taking God's name in vain, and the d word this movie is not for those who feel like hearing profanity is like having a boxer hit their ears repeatedly.

The gore especially is over-the-top and there is no mention of Al Capone's nickname "Scarface" probably because there is no scar! All that aside, this is a well-done movie.
