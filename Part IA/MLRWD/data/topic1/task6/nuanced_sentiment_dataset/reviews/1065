This film is a bit like the Ealing Studio comedies of the 50's. It is character-based film whose jokes depend on situational comedy. The nub of the plot is that the main leads do something a little bit wrong, but not so wrong that they stop being lovable wags. It is set in a village that is on the Isle of Man and in real life is preserved as a tourist attraction. The actors are almost all old comedians and character actors. The movie creates the feel of an Irish village that lives only really in people's imagination. However in dealing with a film such as this one is not concerned with anything else but whether the elements come together as an entertainment. 
This film does succeed and was a great success when it was released. The plot is centred around a village trying to get the prize that would have gone to one of the villagers if he had not died on the night of the announcement of his win. They have to convince a not to sceptical lotteries inspector that Ned Devine is still alive and well. 
The cast is impressive although apparently a number of the actors have died. The film is good in that it depends on cast of people in their 70's to propel the story rather than a number of 20 year old models. One of the funniest scenes in the film  in fact involves a nude motor bike ride by one of the older male actors. Well worth watching.
