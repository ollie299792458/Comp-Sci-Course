Y'all are smoking crack.

Beautifully shot, well cast film about a French family wondering what to do with all their museum quality furniture when the matriarch dies.

**SPOILER ALERT**

(they end up giving it mostly to a museum due to tax liability issues)

(no, seriously, heartbreaking scene talking with the family's estate tax lawyer about the pros and cons of allocating their gynormous estate.  Whoa, and I thought "The Hurt Locker" dealt with the tragedy of the human condition.  Now we can go and tell those GIs to stop their whining as, although their left foot has been blown up into their arsehole, at least they don't have the agony of having to decide what to do with grandma's $1.5 Mil armoir.  Because, you know, that's like a symbol of losing your culture and stuff.  I'm just glad "Precious" was spared the tragedy of the "Summer Hours" family as she just might not have been able to turn it around if she had THIS kind of weight on her psyche. I mean to be PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE for losing a writing desk that's been in the family for 2 generations.  Wow.)

**END SPOILER**

And dudes, Juliette Binoche is my personal goddess, ok?  Kieslowski is my favorite director.  I'm down with tons of cool Euro art films.

This one... how can anyone fracking relate unless they are:
A) Hyper Rich and
B) Have never had real trauma in their lives
