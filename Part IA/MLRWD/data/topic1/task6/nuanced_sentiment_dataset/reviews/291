Avengers 2 contained all the elements of the first movie: fast paced action, daring heroics, snappy dialogue and vivid settings. Unfortunately, those elements were not enough to keep this second installment afloat in the face of one iceberg of an implausibility. I'll elaborate. It is highly implausible for a country that is supposed to be technologically advanced to have soldiers equipped only with spears, bows and arrows. Yet, Wakandia, the Black Panther's homeland, billed as one of the most advanced countries on Earth, can't put clothes on its soldiers or arm them with automatic weapons? This advanced nation can construct energy beam batteries capable of shooting invading alien attack craft out of the sky, but can't supply its military with tanks and armored vehicles? Sorry, but I wasn't buying it. The makers of Ultimate Avengers II suffered from a major deficit of vision when they conceived this contradictory, half baked portrait of Wakandia. All they succeeded in doing was churning out the same stereotype of Africa, replete with the same jungle and primitive native motif that has dominated traditional Hollywood perceptions of Africa for decades. Modern African militaries, even the most ill equiped, possess tanks and planes. The creators of the second movie could have equipped Wakandia in similiar fashion, albeit with much more cutting edge versions of those weapons. Only then would I have been convinced of Wakandia's ability to remain isolated and independent, while the rest of Africa was carved up with a colonial knife. Ultimate Avengers II would have been a better movie.  But its creators chose to to make a concession to sterotypes instead of logic.
