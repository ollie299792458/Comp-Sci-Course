Possession contains contrasting parallel love stories where the contemporary characters discover love as they research a previously unknown love affair between two Victorian poets.  The two contemporary characters, Maude and Roland (Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart) share an unwillingness to become involved with one another based on past romantic experiences.  However, it is the journey they take together uncovering the secret relationship between Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte (Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle) that ultimately leads them to the discovery of themselves and one another.

As contemporary literary experts unearthing a more romantic past, the film appropriately textures Maude and Roland's relationship in a modern milieu.  The love story between Randolph and Christabel is portrayed with the whimsical romance one would expect from the Victorian period.  This structure allows for two completely different types of love stories to be told simultaneously.  The present day story is consumed with internal conflicts in search of resolution, while the story of the past is driven by external factors including deceit, disloyalty, and tragedy.

The film is enjoyable, but far from outstanding.  The most entertaining aspect is uncovering what happened between the two past lovers.  The modern love story is predictable and rather ordinary in it's conventional  use of the fear of pain to create tension.  Randolph and Christabel's story contains more passion and intrigue than that of Maude and Roland's.  The treatment of interchangeably telling two love stories is carried out well, but it just so happens that the one story is much more interesting than the other.  The score and the tidbits of poetry are definitely two of the best components of the film.  All of the performances are well acted, but still the ones that are the most enjoyable to watch are those of Northam and Ehle.
