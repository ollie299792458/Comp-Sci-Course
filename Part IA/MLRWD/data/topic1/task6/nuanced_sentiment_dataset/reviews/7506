American Pie, which was released in 1999, is a wonderful depiction of youth culture today. Four friends (Jim, Kevin, Finch, and Oz) have begun to feel the pressure from society to become "men." They make a pact to have sex before their high school graduation. Deciding that the prom is their best chance to score (since most teens feel that having sex is a part of the prom experience) they pick their dates and prepare for the big night. When prom night finally arrives, the teens decide that having sex doesn't define them. It won't make them "men" and it will not make an impact on their social lives.
 While some aspects of the movie are unrealistic (ie. the pact itself) as a whole this is an accurate representation of teenage life. Young adults are constantly bombarded with images of sex and are told that it is for mature people. There is immense pressure to grow up fast, and kids now think that having sex is the way to do that. But American Pie sent a good message to them, showing them that yes, there is a sexual culture out there... but having sex completely your choice. Don't let society dictate your next move in life. The movie, even with its overwhelming use of sexual humor, uses old fashioned values to show the value and importance of sex.
 I highly recommend this movie. I enjoyed it a lot. It is very entertaining and better than a lot of other teen films that I have seen. It has a wonderful cast (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Eugene Levy, Mena Suvari, etc...), excellent humor, and delivers a good message to the audience in a subtle way. You will get so wrapped up in the plot and the development of the story that the ending is a great surprise. After all of the crazy things that happen to the characters (the pie, Nadia, etc...), in the end you say "Oh yeah... but it's not THAT important..."
