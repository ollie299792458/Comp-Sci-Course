An interesting event, but not particularly well told. While this is "inspired" by a historical event, as the film itself proclaims at the beginning, the overly sharp contrast in the film between the "Gentiles" in the doomed wagon train and the Mormons seems overdrawn to the point of propaganda. The Mormons or at least the church leadership are essentially evil while the wagon train folks, gather a lot at the river, sing a lot of hymns and do their best to just get along with one and all, sort of Little Wagon Train on the Prairie, before being literally led as lambs to the slaughter. It just gets to be more than a bit too much after a while. I don't know if Lolita Davidovich's liberated pistol packing Western Woman in Pants in particular is based on any historical personage or not, but she seems more like a device to contrast with the Mormons and give them something more to dislike about the immigrants. Terrance Stamp as Brigham Young is interesting to watch, but most of the acting, along with the script and direction is more on a TV movie of the week level.
