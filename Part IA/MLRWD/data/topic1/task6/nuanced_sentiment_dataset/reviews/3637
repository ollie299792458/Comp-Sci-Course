I've read alot of the reviews of Grease2 on this sight and must say I agree with most of the bad ones,It is a pretty badly acted,badly written movie,Not to mention the dumb songs But the one thing that I've read alot is about the ages of the cast being too old,butif you look at Grease1 John Travolta was 24 and the youngest of the leads. Olivia Newton-John was 30 at the time Jeff Conaway was 28 and most laughably Stockard Channing was 34 yrs old.and looked like a high schooler like I at 46 look like a high schooler.But the most laughable part is that Stephanie looks at the "Cool Rider" in the face albeit while he is wearing goggles and doesn't have a clue????as to who he is.The music is pure 80s kitsch and not anything 50s or 60s. Lorna Luft WTF she sucks and blows at the same time .she can't act can't sing and she's 30 yrs. old and looks 40. Maybe there wasn't a script at all and they told the "actors" to act like people would believe they were a tough gang.And the girls to act like they were empty headed bimbos who all the other students at Rydell would respect and fear.or maybe the script writers were high  and or drunk and it sounded good at the time.
