The musical nature of this movie fixes it in a time of national transition. Sam Peckenpaw may have had a vision of what was happening as the classic America Western was being supplanted by foreign 'Spegetti Westerns' of more violent exploits. In this sense, this little movie says a great deal about the America of the 1970's. It was and is almost phophetic in its' depiction of the death of ideals as new technology advances on a society.

The acting is intentionally bawdy as were the people of the times for which the movie was created. It may leave some feeling a bit unclean. I beleive this fact contributes to the comedy, This movie, as literature, is an indispensible aid to understanding America and the people who inhabit that nation. The stylization is pure Americana of the nostalgic variety that reminds us what the potentials of freedom are. It speaks volumes about issues of concern in our modern society; (privacy, security, personal relationships, social responsibility & technology; to name a few).
