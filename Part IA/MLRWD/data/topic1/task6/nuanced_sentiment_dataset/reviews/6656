Well, I really had high hopes for this one.  Being a lover of western films, I decided I needed to go back and watch all the ones I had never seen, especially the old staples, i.e. The Wild Bunch, Magnificent Seven, etc.  Having never watched one from this series, and being a moderate Eastwood fan, I was excited to get it home and watch it.  All I can say was I was not impressed.  I thought the musical score was annoying, screechy, repetitive, and not very interesting. It seemed Sergio Leone's greatest camera technique was extreme close-ups, or panoramic shots.  While you can never criticize a beautiful panoramic shot of the West, I tire of people going on and on about the cinematography of this film.  So we got a close-up of these guys eyes, wow.  It's all a bit over dramatic.  Many of the scenes were long and drawn out. I was so annoyed with unnecessarily drawn out scenes, that I fast forwarded towards the end when they were searching the tombstones.  It was like Leone was trying way too hard, and everyone is buying it.  Hate to criticize something so well liked, but when compared to other movies of this genre, it really doesn't stack up.
