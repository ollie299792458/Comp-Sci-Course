edge vs eddie guerrero
last year i wasn't really big fan of either of them until i saw this match and their no dq match on the following smackdown and their gained my respect BIG TIME and is just getting better and better in the ring with each other they both have different styles though but you combine thoughs to different styles you will get a hell of a much even though their must at smackdown is better than this they still put on a great and exciting performance at uniforgiven.****
angle vs benoit
these two always put on a match of the year candidates and this matches was one of their best matches toghter but when i saw their royal rumble i think it surpass it but in a way it didnt they did some awesome mat wrestling reversals alot close pinfalls and little high risk move their matches always tell a story even though it is not their best match one of the best matches of 2002 or probably even the best of 2002 if it wasnt for that tag team title match a month later this would of been match of the year and their match at royal rumble is just a little bit better than this about l/4 better that all no big deal.****1/2
