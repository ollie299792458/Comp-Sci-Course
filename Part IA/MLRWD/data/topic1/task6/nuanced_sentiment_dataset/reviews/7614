First of all this isn't a good movie, in the whole 80-min. span of it there is no real plot, nothing asmirable about the filming, nor one witty joke, but that doesn't mean I didn't have a good time. Steve Oedekerk has concocted some of the most idiotic stuff ever to be filmed (Ace Ventura, the Thumb series, Jimmy Neutron) but this reigns over all those things. Kung Pow is cross between Modern footage of Oedekerk and a select few othe "actors", and footage from an old Chinese kung-fu movie called "Tiger and Crane fists", blended in with each other. Oedekerk has muted the dialogue spoken by the Chinese actors of the original movie and dubbed in his own voice, or maybe I should voices, (he plays several ridiculous characters.
As far as the plot goes basically an evil Chinese uh.. guy named Master Pain (later he calls himself Betty) has killed an entire Japanese family looking for a member of it called the Chosen One, who is the infant of the family. After a stupid and not-so-funny sequence of the baby kicking his ass they flee, and the baby winds up on his own. He travels and grows up and fights people on the way, all in search of the man who killed his family. He goes to a weird old man named Master Tang to train him and help him find Master Pain. He finds him, there are many pointless scenes following- inclding one spoofing the Lion King, and then a big battle between the Chosen One and Betty. Using his sacred gift (a tongue with a face on it) the Chosen One defeats Betty and that is the end of that. Stupid yes, but I promise that if your not a real tight-wad, you'll be amused by this movie.
