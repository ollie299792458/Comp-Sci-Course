The movie is, of course, a 5-star. I gave the blue-ray version 3-stars and that is being generous.  The problem, I believe, is the blurry background and an attempt to compensate by over adjusting the sharpness. I don't know if the problem was due to an inexpensive lens, wrong focal lengh, wrong point of fucus, or, a camera man that needed glasses.  The background and distance shots all lack clarity and definition - as thought the movie was shot in 16mm.  I also believe that durng the transfer the sharpness was over adjusted to compensate - over accentuating the highlights. Having watched the DVD a number of times, I found the Blue-ray hard to look at and uncomfortable.

Is the blue-ray sharper than the DVD? Yes, but sharper isn't better if it is uncomfortable to watch and calls attention to limitations with the movie. Also, since I do not have a separate sound system, I like the dynamic compression built into the DVD soundtracks - I don't have to adjust the TV volume for soft speech or loud sound and music.
