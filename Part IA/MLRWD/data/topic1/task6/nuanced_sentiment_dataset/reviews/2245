it sure is great to see nichelle nichols (best known as star trek's Lt. Cmdr. Uhura) looking SO good. pick up a copy of Star Trek. yes, the Alaska terrain is breathtaking. may i suggest renting the spectacular 1996 documentary "Alaska - Spirit of the Wild"? yes, the dogs packs are really something and the mutt, anna, is adorable. visit your local animal shelter. adopt a stray. train for the Iditarod - for certain it will be less painful than sitting through Snow Dogs. 
i saw this movie on a plane recently - the experience improved dramatically when i switched the headphone jacks to my cd player and watched the rest of the movie while listening to the new Moby cd.
about the director...it would appear Brian Levant's earliest work, including the afffable and popular "beethoven", provides his professional high point (in a career that sprials downward - sharply! - with the flintstones, jingle all the way, and  the flintstones rock las vegas). here, mr. levant has crafted a film that somehow manages to be vigorously noisy and slapstick , but plodding in pace to the point of moving backwards.
similarly, the studio should can the writer for creating a predicitble screenplay that is too childish for children.
cuba gooding, jr. (who truly deserved his Best Supporting Actor for the 1996 hit Jerry Maguire) and james coburn (who won a best supporting actor oscar for his fine performance in "Affliction" from 1999) should both fire their agents without hesitation. 
if nothing else, Snow Dogs serves as proof that getting good work is tough, even for the best actors in the business. apparently, it's much easier for lousy directors.
