Traitor is a very sucky slow motion flick with a storyline that will keep viewers yawning to the very end.... Much harder to see coming is the film's denouement, but that's only because of its extreme silliness.

Cheadle is a decent enough actor, brave in going after the movies that has a pretty depressing message, but his range is limited and he never seems comfortable enough when he's serious giving off a flat affect that reduces his aura. Pearce is the most interesting as a decent "religious" FBI agent who acts as counterpart to Cheadle's "religious" double agent.

Unfortunately the pacing was too slow for my taste. The were going for a realistic feel so I understand it was more of a character / social commentary film as opposed to a Rambo type feel where the good guy goes in guns blazing ready to take out every terrorist with a bow and arrow and a .50 calabur machine gun.

While I have tried to get past the negative aspects of the film, it becomes quite apparent that the film just isn't anything special. Traitor leaves a lot of strings untied on its way to an unsatisfying, Hollywood-ish ending.

Any way if you like Religious crap movies with very little action, then this might be for you.
