This movie, "The Ice Storm", is completely powerful even in it's quietest of moments. The ending scene is completely... revolutionary. I don't know.
It is almost perfect in every shot - either with the  beautifully cinematographed kiss scene between two teenagers, or the scene  where a young boy balances on an icy diving board, where we sense tragedy  coming.
It all makes sense in the end. It's a powerful film about  confusion - confusion about marriage, confusion about adultry, confusion  about who we are, confusion about what we do - and the way director Ang Lee  handles it is so sad.
It's sad because it was completely underrated. It  had an amazing cast - so amazing I was completely stunned. Christina Ricci,  Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Elijah Wood, Tobey Maguire, Sigourney Weaver,  Katie Holmes...
It is a great movie on many levels.
And most ultimately  it will be different for all viewers; because it's tone isn't for everyone.  Rent or watch on TV - but for me, it's a definite buy.
