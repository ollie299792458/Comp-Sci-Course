Yes I'm a Trekker, Yes I love this film.  But it is not my favortie because I love for the phaser blasting duos in space, which if you are  looking for you won't find here.  What you will find is something quite  different and entertaining.  Bringing whales into Star Trek seems like  something you'd never expect, but I like it.  A probe has been sent to  communicate with the humback whale, which is extinct in the 23rd century.  Humans would expect the probe be sent only to communicate with people, but  this nice showing that there are other forms of intelligence on Earth.  As  for humor, ok Star Trek is no Austin Powers or Ace Vetura, but gotta admit  this one's funny.  Scotty's "Computer scene" as well as Chekov's  scene get me every time.  There is even a scene where I heard a candid  camera was used.  Chekov and Uhura are on the streets of San Francisco  asking around for help to find the naval base, and the officer seems as if  he were lifeless, it is funny.  But then when I found out it was a hidden  camera and these people didn't know they were being filmed, that makes it  all the more amusing.  Too Bad Kirk and Gillian didn't have more of a  "relationship", it would have been nice.  Kinda like the episode  "City On The Edge of Forever" where Kirk falls in love with  someone from the past.  There is a difference here, but you gotta see for  yourself.  Oh yeah, and it neat to see the crew commanding a Klingon vessel  rather than your usual Federation Enterprise, just something different.  Overall, it is a very good film, just not one for me.
