Gigi. *sigh* What is there to say about this movie that someone else hasn't aready reiterated over and over again? This is the last of the lush MGM musicals. It is the end of an era.

The Vincente Minnelli directed pic was lovingly crafted. Every frame of the movie seems to be carefully planned. He uses the camera deftly, understanding what will make an artistic movie. His scenes are beautifully set up, almost handcrafted to perfection. They filmed on location in France and most frames are beautiful.

Unfortunately, while Vincente was a wonderful artist, he was terrible at directing actors, giving them little or no direction, which is quite evident in this film. Leslie Caron was used to having more direction than she received in this film, which comes across on camera. At times she seems lost. Her character goes all over the place. I suppose she did not know exactly how or what Minnelli wanted. Minnelli, probably feeling bad about his ignoring of his young star, praised her highly in his autobiography. He said that she played a lovely girl and that's what she was supposed to be.

Curiously, although Gigi was supposed to be about the French, Minnelle cast two extraordinarily English actors in two of the main roles--Hermione Gingold and Isabel Jeans. But somehow it works. Somehow the whole movie works.

Gigi is beautiful. It is a smart film. I've found as I've gotten older, I appreciate this movie even more. I have never laughted harder than hearing Aunt Alicia's line "Wait for the first class jewels Gigi. Hold onto your ideals."  There is nothing like 'holding onto' your ideals, especially if you're about to become a paid courtesan, a mistress.

But somehow Gigi does.
