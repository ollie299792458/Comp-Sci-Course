I was very interested in viewing this indi film because of the previews I had seen, and although I like Marilyn Manson, his part in the movie was not the draw.  It seemed from the previews that it would be something in the area of Hedwig and the Angry Inch.  Hedwig was a bit edgy and off color, but  the overall movie was really great (if you haven't seen it, you should). However, much to my dismay, the story in The Heart is Deceitful was even more disturbing in ways that I personally couldn't get with. I do not like child molestation/rape; it makes me physically ill even to think about it.  I was not happy with being bombarded with it in this film. Marilyn Manson was in the flick for about 5 minutes.  He played a trailer park-type guy who also had a go at the child.  The child's mother is played by a Courtney Love-type character, who is the most dispicable excuse for a human being let alone a mother.

I guess if a film or music makes you feel - one way or another - it has accomplished its mission and has made you live through an experience whether it's good or bad.  This movie did make me feel.  I watched it once, and will not watch it again.  This is just one opinion, and there are probably many, many others that would be opposite of mine.  You may adore this movie, and if you do, I'm glad for you, it just wasn't my cup of tea.
