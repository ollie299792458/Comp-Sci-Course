This set gets my "Thumbs Up" stamp of approval.  Sony did a great job with this. I'm surprised that they put bonus commentary and a documentary. I never saw any of these non-Stooge Columbia shorts before, so it was a real treat to watch them. I enjoyed watching all of them... Even the weaker ones have a couple gags in them that make it worth while. Every film made me laugh at least once. I was expecting these films to be clunkers, but they're not. The Stooge co-stars that we know and love like Vernon Dent, Bud Jamison, Dorothy Appleby Eddie Laughton were excellent as always and bring a lot to these films. I was glad to see Dorothy Appleby play a major role in these. She adds a lot of spunk. I also liked Elsie Ames. I never saw her in anything before. I was impressed that she did a lot of her own falls and the physical stuff with Buster. I wonder why she never worked with the Stooges.

Buster's pratfalls are fantastic. No one can fall like him.

Did you notice, when Buster turns on the radio in SHE'S OIL MINE, that it's the same Rumba song from THREE SAPPY PEOPLE? I'm pretty sure it's the exact same recording.

Also, GENERAL NUISANCEIS is the BOOBS IN ARMS location.

In addition to being fun films, I also enjoyed watching them on a "Trivia" level...Looking to see if I recognize the sets, outside locations, the co-stars, background music from the Three Stooges shorts.

This set has definately got me wanting to see more of the Non-Stooge Columbia shorts!

Shemp had a solo series at Columbia. So did Joe Besser, Curly Joe Derita, Andy Clyde and other...

Keep'em coming Sony and I'll keep buying!
