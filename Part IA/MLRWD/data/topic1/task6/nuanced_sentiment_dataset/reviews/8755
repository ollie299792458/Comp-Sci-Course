A haunting movie in which everything is played for laughs.

There are no serious moments, deep introspections, revelations, life reviews, insights into life's purpose, etc. It is a non-stop gimmicks, special effects, sight gags, visual fluff suitable for the younger set.

The hero and heroine drown together in a car accident, discover they are dead and back in their dearly beloved house. They can't leave because there are monsters outside. Their peace in interrupted by the new owners who decide to redo the place in a ridiculous gaudy style. They notice an unexpected book "The Handbook for the recently deceased." on the nightstand which serves as their guide to their new situation. Through it they discover how to reach their "caseworker" and an obnoxious haunter named Beetlejuice

who might be able to help them remove the new occupants. Everything they try fails to work and in the end they accept the new owners. The owner's daughter becomes closer to them than her step-parents providing the child they always wanted and couldn't have. Other than the idea that they can not see themselves in a mirror and that the new owners cannot see them (except the daugthter), there is little we learn about the afterlife here. We see a couple brief scenes of the caseworker's office which can only be described as depressing. Worst movie I have seen in a long time.
