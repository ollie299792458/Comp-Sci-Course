I bought this as a Valentine's Day gift for my son and daughter-in-law and got the bonus of Amazon instant streaming video on my computer.  I don't know whether they've watched it yet, but I enjoyed it very much.  Like most romantic comedies, it doesn't presume to delve deeply into the human psyche or solve the world's problems.  It makes you smile and feel good and maybe think a little about the many natures of love.  And I'm not sure, when it comes right down to what matters, that this in itself doesn't solve some of the world's problems.  Anyway, I loved the many character portrayals and all their different stories.  The writers, director, and actors did a good job of making each character memorable and easily distinguished from all the others, not an easy feat in this kind of film, made up of quick snapshots of different, inter-connected lives.

One of my all-time favorites is "Love Actually," which of course this movie resembles in its telling of many inter-connected love stories.  This one isn't quite as good, which is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five.

My belief is that any film worth watching is worth watching twice, and this one is well worth a second viewing.  You'll catch all kinds of details you may have missed the first time.

I don't really have a lot to say that the Editorial Review and other customer reviews haven't covered well already.  I would only add that your soul is dead if you don't crack up (or if you're a woman, stand up and cheer) over Jennifer Garner's character dressing up as a waitress and describing the "special of the day" to the doctor she fell in love with when he is dining out with his wife (whom he had forgotten to mention to her).  And if, like me, you have watched "Pretty Woman" umpty-dozen times, BE SURE TO WATCH ALL OF THE CREDITS AT THE END OF THE FILM!
