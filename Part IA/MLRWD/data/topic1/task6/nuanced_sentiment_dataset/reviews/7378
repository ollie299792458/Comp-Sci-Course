The acting is good, sometimes excellent. Both Nicholas Cage and Jared Leto do a good job. Even Cage's dark witty cynicism is sometimes brilliant. The problem about this film is that it is obvioulsy one-sided or one-dimensional. The plot is poor, as it doesn't show reality from a wide perspective. There are some plain statements that one has to consider before making a film about war in general and about wars waged in the XX century in particular:
a) Arms are sold because someone buys them. Obvious but true. Therefore, those who buy weapons are as guilty as those who provide them. Just like drugs. And, like drugs or any other good, arms are ruled by the laws of market, a simple question of supply and demand.
b) The film centers on Western Africa conflicts, in particular Sierra Leona and Liberia (curious that the most brutal genocide in Africa, that of Rwanda, doesn't have a single scene), pretending to make us believe that the source of all evil is arm dealing. Well, let's point out again what is also obvious, that these African wars, like the Yugoslavian-Balkan wars, like the Osetia-Abjasia-Georgia war, like the Armenia-Azerbajan war, have an ETHNIC root, mainly caused by an ethnic (tribal in Africa) disruption that destroyed the territorial balance imposed by colonial powers or totalitarian regimes like the Soviet Union. Therefore, massive arm dealing is a symptom, not a cause, of the state of countries on the verge of war or already plunged into war or civil conflict. Thus, arms are always an element of wars, tactically essential indeed, but never the cause of them nor the reason for them.
Having said this, I don't think it's very honest to awaken consciences or be lectured on false premises.
