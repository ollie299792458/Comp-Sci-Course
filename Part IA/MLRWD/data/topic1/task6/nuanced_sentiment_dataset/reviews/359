Ok, truthfully, I was only about 8 or 9 when this series first aired in 1991. Even though I was young, I watched this show with my mom and sister. I get a strange feeling that I really enjoyed it, and my sister would write short stories re-telling the events in her own 11 yr old words. Thinking back, I think my sisters school girl stories were much better than the series itself.

 I remembered some things about this show recently before buying it, like Barnabas standing on his stairs in the day to prove to the cops he was not a vampire, and Victoria being sent back in the 1790s. WHen I found out about this DVD, I jumped at the chance to see it again. I would refresh my memory about the show and bring back feelings of how much I loved it. but now in my older mind, and having more experience with other horror related movies and shows, I have to say I was quite disappointed. Some of the actors are pretty lame and it sounds like they are just reading off of cue cards. The pilot episode was pretty ok, and then it just went downhill from there. I did anticipate the 1790s episodes, but it didn't have the same impact it did when I was young. I did give this DVD to my sister recently and she loved it! I guess all is not lost.
