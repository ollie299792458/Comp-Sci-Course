I'm sorry, but I don't get Jeff Dunham. The guy somehow gets away with ripping on every racial group and is never called out on it because he uses puppets I guess? I heard a lot about this guy and decided to watch this specific special on Comedy Central. It's effing horrible! None of the jokes or impersonations are that great or funny. I let out maybe one or two "ha!'s" during the whole thing. Not a laugh, just a "ha!", like "Wow, this guy is so bad!".

Everyone seems to love the "Dead Terrorist" character who just says "I kill you!" over and over. It's not funny. I wonder what the families of 9/11 and those overseas fighting for us in Afghanistan and Iraq think about that garbage. His redneck and grumpy white guy characters are also just as lame and unfunny. If I wanted to see rednecks, I'd just watch Larry the Cable Guy. Hell, I thought that the Blue Collar Guys weren't that funny, but compared to Jeff Dunham, they are great. If I wanted to see an old guy grumble and make lewd comments, I'd just go visit my own Grandpa. He's 100 times funnier than Jeff Dunham's puppet.

I heard a lot of hype about this guy, only to find out that he is a complete unfunny nerd. Maybe it's accepted widely as "Family Comedy" because there is not really much use of profanity, but I think that promoting every sort of racial stereotype out there with these puppets is far more offensive than the dirtiest joke, an hour of curse words and anything that Howard Stern has ever said on the radio that "Christians" and the FCC found so offensive.
