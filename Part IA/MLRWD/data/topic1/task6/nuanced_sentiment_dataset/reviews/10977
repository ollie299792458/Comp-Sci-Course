I remember reading Quentin Tarantino's great script for NATURAL BORN KILLERS before seeing the film. He wrote it in the late 80's and kept it until the early 90's when he sold it to director Oliver Stone (who wrote SCARFACE and directed PLATOON). At the time, Quentin Tarantino was not well-known, his only noticable work being a film that he wrote and directed in his debut, RESERVOIR DOGS in 1992. Therefore, Stone had his own vision for NATURAL BORN KILLERS, and practically re-wrote the script, only crediting Quentin Tarantino for the original story.
After reading the original script, it was disappointing to see how the movie steered so far from it. The film plays out a few different styles: it feels like a commercial, cartoon, video game, and music video all at the same time. The opening scene of the film plays well, it's definitely my favorite scene of the entire film, but the "creative" styles grow old fast. The techniques used put distance between the audience and the characters and make it hard for it to present that gripping quality Quentin Tarantino originally intended for.
Although, at times the colored flashing lights and black and white picture seem charming, they get in the way of the real film, preventing me from strongly reccomending this film. It's an unusual and interesting film, and made by a director who knows what he's doing, but it just doesn't hold up overall.
