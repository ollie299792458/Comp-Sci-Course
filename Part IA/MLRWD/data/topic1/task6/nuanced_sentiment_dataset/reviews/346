The storyline is good, but developing the characters of the "bad guys" was quite pathetic.  No depth, no brains, just blow up things at random and find things to bicker and whine about...  Especially trying to bring racism into the fray... lets blame the senseless violence on the "black guy".  The character happened to be a black guy and had a penchant for self-destruction... and blowing everything else up as well.  I personally found that little whining episode offensive no matter how you chose to interpret it.

The character development of John Triton was pretty good, but established him as more of a loose cannon rather than a highly skilled combat individual.  This is further reinforced when he gets into fights and essentially uses his face to block many of the punches.  That may work in the WWE, but does not establish a character who is supposed to be highly skilled in hand/hand combat.

Some of the scenes in the movie seemed to be filler to get minutes.  Especially his encounter with the two poachers while running through the swamp.

However, the movie still managed to be fun to watch, once I was able to adjust my expectations for the movie to be WWE entertainment, and not as a full action movie.

Overall, you can enjoy this movie if you choose to, it isn't a total loss, but neither is it a winner.
