After many years and after doing only supernatural movies (SUSPIRIA, INFERNO) Dario Argento returned to the genre that made him famous, the italian giallo genre. This was a well recieved film when it came out. And instead of using the dark cinematography he usually uses he decided to try making this film sunny and it does not lessen the impact of the film. It is about an american author named Peter Neal(Anthony Franciosa) who is promoting his new book TENEBRAE in Rome and while he's there a mysterious killer (using the black gloves that have become a recurring prop in Argento's giallo films) viciously murders "perverts" in the same way as in the book TENEBRAE. He murders a theif, lesbians, etc. He considers them perverts. The movie is relentlessly violent, especially towards the end and it has many plot twists. Argento relies more on narrative in this film than he usually does but it still has his same style. It again features a great score by Goblin and it also features the director's wife, Daria Nicolodi. For the recored she has been in many of his films(DEEP RED, INFERNO, TERROR AT THE OPERA a.k.a OPERA and PHENOMENA a.k.a CREEPERS). This is one of Argento's best films and it features many famous sequences, including a crane shot that was very difficult to pull off in those days.
