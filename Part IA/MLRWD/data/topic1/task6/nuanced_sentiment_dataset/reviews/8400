Ninja Scroll...Hmmm...It's hard to review this one.
First,let's deal with the violence and sex to get that outta the way.Yes.this is an incredibly violent movie,and lots of needless nudity/rape/sex.It's a shame,really,it almost ruined the movie for me,and left me with a baaaad taste in my mouth.Okay.Now I will speak as if you are aware of what I just said,which is a valid assumption.
Now.to get something else out of the way,everyone who badmouths this movie says it's stereotypical.Well,at this movie's age,maybe it's a sound assumption that this movie started some of those stereotypes?Therefore that statement has been proven INVALID.Wahaha.Perhaps a better argument is that the story is showing its age,which I can attest to.
The characters are very memorable,espeially Dakuan,the crazy old man with a lazy eye.He rocks.But,I'm afraid the story feels rushed at the end,with the main 'bad guys' dying left and right before they even really put up a fight.The Japanese voice acting is superb,and I think Wendy Lee does Kagero's dub voice.She isn't nearly as good ad the original,but she passes,unlike Jubei's cocky American voice.uggggghhhhhhhh...The animation is AWESOME.(for its time)But,this is a movie we're talking about.
Bleh..I gotta go,so I'll wrap it up.
it's pretty good.Buy it if you can stomach the senseless sexual content.By the way,if you're gonna bash it,PLEAAAASE stop calling it 'just another samurai anime'.There is a VAST difference between ninja and samurai.
