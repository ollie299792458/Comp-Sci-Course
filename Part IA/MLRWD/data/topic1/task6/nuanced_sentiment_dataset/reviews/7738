I am shocked by both the recognition and the positive reviews this movie has received.  In fairness, the plot summary should immediately warn the viewer that this film will be no picnic.  However, from the first dreary scene to the last, this movie is an expedition in human misery.

Bardem is a black marketeer diagnosed with terminal cancer.  As the movie progresses, we watch him die.  We see his love for his children and his desperation in wondering what will become of them.  We pity him as his bipolar wife reveals her unsuitability as a mother.

The movie covers the terrible conditions that Asian and African immigrants to Europe face.  This topic is under-covered in film, and it's the movie's one redeeming future.

However, otherwise, the movie is simply cringe-worthy - one depressing scene after another.  Bardem's character seems pitiable but mostly uninteresting.  His wife's behavior is all too predictable.  The movie's one interesting and heart-grabbing angle is the fate of his children, but that is too little, too late.
