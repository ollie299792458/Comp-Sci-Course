Three Stooges burglars add to implausibility
What started as an interesting premise and supplemented with a high-impact trailer that led you to believe that you would be experiencing a non-stop fear-induced adrenaline-high ended up being so bumbling and therefore implausible as to kill the adrenaline gland and make me wish had some chocolate from the snack bar to tide me over.
Illogical and irrational decisions, first by the burglars, as well as later by Jodi Foster's character and her `daughter' finally crumbled the reality the filmmaker was trying to portray.  Once I has seen enough really BAD decisions on both sides (bad guys and good guys), I could no longer in my mind put myself in their shoes and thereby feel their fear.  Instead I found myself saying (to myself), "That's a stupid thing to do, why aren't you doing the obvious?"  Jodi Foster's character switched back and forth from admirably logical to extremely illogical.  I suspect that anyone in a real-life situation like that would act somewhat the same.  However, in reality, I would expect illogicalness at the onset of the situation to be followed afterwards by increasing logical decisions as the situation was better understood.  This logical/illogical swing didn't seem to have any rhyme or reason.  But the burglars' ineptitude and truly stupid thought-processes and resulting decisions finally broke the camels back of reality, and for the rest of the movie, I had to console myself with wondering what silly or illogical thing the cast would do next.
I enjoy many of Jodi Foster's roles, but this was disappointing.
Maybe okay to rent, but don't expect to get scared enough to run out and build yourself a "panic room" when a "concern nook" will do just fine.
