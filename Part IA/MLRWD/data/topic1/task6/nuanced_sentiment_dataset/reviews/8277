Wings of Desire is often touted as one of the best films of the 80s. This is going to be hard to review because there isn't much of a plot, with the first hour and half of running time devoted to various internal monologues as two angels wander through the city of Berlin. Many existential questions are pondered until one angel meets and falls in love with an ethereal trapeze artist, and decides he will become one of the humans he observes to experience life. If that sounds a lot like City of Angels, you would be right as City was a very blunt remake of this film. Anyways, the angel's choice sets things in motion and we wonder if it will bring him fulfillment he so desires or a tremendous disappointment that is all too common a human experience. I liked the last half an hour or so of the film quite a bit, as it abandoned its languid pace of the first two thirds to arrive at its conclusion. But then you have to endure that first parts, which while a richly textured visual treat, is a test of patience to sit through.

The film's visual poetries are too remote for an uneducated guy like me to decipher, and while it never approaches the level of pretentiousness, a shallow person like me is unable to bring much to the film, and hence receives little in return. Am I a pretender for not loving it? Or will fondness grow with the passage of time? More likely, the memories will simply fade away like the last frames of any film. The End.
