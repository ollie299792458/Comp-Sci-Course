I've seen the movie twice as well as viewed related material about the movie presented by Robert Redford.  This movie is about healing...not only healing the horse, but healing individual lives and relationships.  It was  evident to me that Pilgrim and Grace suffered from post traumatic stress  symptoms.  Perhaps that's because I view it from the role of a mental  health counselor.  I commend Robert Redford for bringing to the film his  sensitivity in teaching us about healing.  I'm not sure who changed the  ending, but since Redford directed it, I assume he did.  Had the movie  ended as the book did, everyone would have been re-traumatized. Life brings  pain to all of us.  Life is a process, a journey.  We learn as we go.  If  we study The Horse Whisperer, we can learn that patience, persistence, and  a learned guide can help us heal.  In addition, the landscape scenes were  exceptional.  I liked the way we were given time to enjoy the beauty of  Montana.  It is a movie well worth seeing and pondering its meaning at a  deeper level!
