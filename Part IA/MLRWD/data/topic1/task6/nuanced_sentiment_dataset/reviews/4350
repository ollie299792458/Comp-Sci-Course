This movie clearly depicts the life of a Jewish individual trying to hide his identity to protect himself from the Nazi hysteria in Germany. Although the fact that the main character appears human and real throughout the movie makes the story appear as reality, as it is based on the fact that the movie is based on a true story, the main part that makes this movie excellent is its ability to give the viewer a sense of the struggle inside the Jewish boy's mind. However, the small details that come up excessively throughout the movie such as a scene where the two men are "letting out waste" towards the end add no meaning to the story and do not contribute to the plot. The movie also decides to "show" the audience various grotesque "things" when the description of the "things" could have sufficed. Overall, scenes throughout the movie correspond quite accurately to historical events such as the Night of Broken Glass. The movie's emotional scenes such as the point where the main character tries to stay with his brother show the brutality of Hitler's regime and make up for the horrible and excessive details the movie offers at various points. This movie deserves a 3 to a 4, actually.
