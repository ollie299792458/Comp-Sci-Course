Make no mistake, Stigmata will not challenge your gray matter on any level. Another in a long series of movies apparently put together by music-video directors, Stigmata attempts to cover up its hole-ridden plot with a lot of jump-cuts, cross-fades, and tiresome montages. There are a few interesting visual ideas, but you get the feeling that's the only thing the director brought to the movie, since the screenplay has no real meat. The characters are typically one-dimensional and live only to serve the plot. Many times during the movie, you can see them jump up and walk angrily out of the shot, or deliver a dramatic one-liner and exit (usually to another jump-cut), precisely when the dialogue would force them to say something substantive, or force the screenplay to tip its hand and reveal that there's no real meat to the story. The actors do fine with the roles they're given, but frankly, those roles don't amount to much. Every time this movie comes close to doing something genuine, it hides behind another blaring music-video montage, and ultimately, that's all it has going for it. It gets 2 stars for the mere virtue of being better than the utterly worthless End of Days.
