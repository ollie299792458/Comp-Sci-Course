The movie Head On takes a look at the trappings of a closeted gay son Ari (Alex Dimitriades) in a traditional Greek Orthodox upbringing. The director Ana Kokkinos tries to flush to the surface the isolation and alienation one man feels by his family and the alternate lifestyle they would never apporve of. Within this script, Ari enters into the realms of drugs and unprotected sex and then comes to the realization that this is how his life must end up.

Alex Dimitriades to his credit helps this movie tremendously, with his dark good looks, brooding nature, and a tortured portrayal of a man being torn by a secret life. However, this actor cannot carry the movie alone and the other characters in the movie do not come through as vividly.

The director wants to make the point about how various ethnic beliefs impacts the hardships of some who want to come out but are afriad too, yet by avoiding the confration that must take place between parent and offspring the viewer is done an injustice because the full message is not delievered. The director should have concentrate more on family life and interactions giving a greater sense of anguish, instead of the ridiculous clubs and parties. As the movie continues its downward spiral, it comes to an abrupt end and no real realistic resolution comes head on, thus the viewer is left seeing another gay movie where it is easier to let the audience draw the conclusions than the movie itself diving deeper than the surface of drugs, sex and denial.
