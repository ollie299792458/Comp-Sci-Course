The film The Graduate is a classic 1967 release that is directed by Mike Nichols and released by Embassy Pictures.  The film earned $50 million in 1968, which is number one money maker in that time.
  Director, Nichols, won the Academy Award for Best Director.  The film was also nominated for 6 other Awards, Best Picture, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Supporting Actress.  The soundtrack featuring songs by Simon and Garfunkel was gold in 1968 and "Mrs. Robinson" was number one on the charts for four weeks.
  College grad (Dustin Hoffman) does what his parents and other people tell him to do including family friend Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) who tells him to have an affair with her.  Then he falls in love with her daughter Eliane Robinson (Katherine Ross), and finally finds something he wants to do with his life.
  I give this film 4 stars because I thought Dustin Hoffman did a good job.  I thought that the music complimented the movie nicely as well.  It was a good film.
