o.k. i am a great fan of wide screen films - IF THEY WERE MADE THAT WAY!!!
the story itself is my all time favorite stephen king mini-series adaptation. (as usual the book is much better, but getting king from page to screen has always been a hard thing to do)

i have this thing about clowns-hate 'em. period. they freak me out, i don't know why...so, when the book came out i grabbed it up as did everyone else in the 80s and ingested it whole! when i heard about the mini-series, i was leary of it till i heard that tim curry would be IT. he is perfectly cast in this and is absolutly menacing!
i gave this dvd 4 stars cuz i had to take one away for pretending this was ever a wide screen film. the practice of pan-n-scan on wide screen films is bad enough (and we now usually get both options to choose from) but letterboxing a tv movie or the dasterdly work of letterboxing a theatrical movie (as they did with gone with the wind) is apauling! it DOES cut into the picture and only gives anti-wide screen people amunition for their propiganda pages.
