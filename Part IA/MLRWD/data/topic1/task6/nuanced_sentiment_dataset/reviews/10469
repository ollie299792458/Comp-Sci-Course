Hilarous indie about the pain of being a 20-something single. Three reasons to watch: star Jon Favreau's superb script, a great cast and Liman's top-notch direction. The witty screenplay delivers enough laughs and memorable lines to reward repeat viewings, from Trent's boast that he's going to "Find me two cocktail waitresses and pull me a Fredo" to a hilarious conversation between Mike, Trent and the rest of the crew about how long you should wait before calling a girl whose "digits" you got.

Liman, who also directed the excellent "Go," throws in a a number of deft touches that add to the script. And the ensemble cast (including Ron Livingston and Heather Graham) is terrific, especially leads Favreau and Vince Vaughn. Favreau is outstanding as the lovable nice-guy loser Mike, giving a deeply funny and even touching performance. As the womanizing Trent, Vaughn exudes the star charisma that he would later showcase in "Wedding Crashers."

One of the best comedies of the '90s.
