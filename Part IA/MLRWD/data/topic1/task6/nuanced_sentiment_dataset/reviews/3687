This is one of the all time great mysteries, perhaps the most superb of all the neo-noir films.  Personally, I have never liked the ending (where is Bogie when you need him?), but nevertheless, it is brilliantly written, brilliantly acted, and brilliantly directed.  The original is visually gorgeous - but you might as well buy the VHS version.  This DVD is really awful.  The focus is fuzzy.  It looks like someone took an aging, washed-out copy, upped the color saturation, and called it remastered.  The skin tones are almost too bright, but the colors while still faded, are too dark and murky.  I still remember the subtle use of color from when I first saw the film, the beautiful pinks and blues and yellows playing against the cool neutrals.  The rich darks giving gorgeous contrast.  And I remember the perfect LA light.  Only the brightest sunlit scenes come even close to the way it should look.  This is a Hollywood masterpiece, and deserved great love and care in its restoration.  It didn't get them.
