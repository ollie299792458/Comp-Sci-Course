After twenty-eight (28) years of waiting, we finally have this wonderfully nutty version of "Pirates" on DVD.
Most of the actors are from the Original New York Shakespeare Festival production, the exception being Angela Lansbury as Ruth.  Ruth is probably the most difficult (?!) role in the operetta, being that mezzo-old-lady role, but Lansbury does better than most.  I cannot say the same for George Rose (Major General Stanley)!!! His sputtering sounds nothing so must as, forgive me, verbal farts.  Most unattractive.  That cannot be said of Rex Smith, Kevin Kline and Linda Ronstadt.  All sing wonderfully, look beautiful and are more than carismatic.
Some musical numbers are cut in favor of the extended chase scene in which the cast interrupts a performance of HMS Pinafore.  But the added patter song from "Ruddigore" is welcome.
One can compare the original Central Park production <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RCMW">Gilbert & Sullivan - The Pirates of Penzance / Kline, Ronstadt, Smith, Routledge, Delacorte Theater (Broadway Theatre Archive)</a>to see the changes and modifications.
And it's in the original wide-screen format (2.35:1)
