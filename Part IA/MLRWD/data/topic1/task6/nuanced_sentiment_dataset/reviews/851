I almost like Shane Meadows films. With the exception of the dull, predictable "This is England". But "Dead Man's Shoes" is a Greek Tragedy of a story. It has madness, family, blood, protection , revenge, redemption and failure- and some moments of humour. Elements of Eastwoods "Unforgiven" the loner driven to wreak terrible revenge but as much out of guilt than pay-back. I liked that Shane Meadows did not turn the protagonist Richard into a vigilante hero, which the film as it unfolded threatended to do. But had him face his own demons, his life, his career choice and at the end there is some redemption-but no happy ending. There is a lot of the morality play in the story of this film, you have to work at it to get it, but getting it answers our own revenge fantasies. in the end is it worth it? Does it make us a better person? Boy, the lights went on and I sat like a stunned cod at the end of this one. The cinematography fits the story well. The soundtrack also adds as if tailored for the film. Nice one Mr Meadows.
