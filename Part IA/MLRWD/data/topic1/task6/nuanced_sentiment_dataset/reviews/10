Of the four stories, "Hoichi the Earless" is the most memorable. Not only is the famous composer Takemitsu Toru's music used most eeriely, the ghosts really have a reason to be grumpy (they all died  "heroic" deaths in a battle from ancient Japanese history.) This  third tale also features Takeshi Shimura, who reprises the role of a priest  from Seven Samurai - for real this time. His presence in reassuring, even  after he admits to the mistake that costs Hoichi his appendages.
The  uneveness mainly has to do with the first two tales, "Black Hair"  and "Woman of the Snow", both of which suffer from weak  editing/pacing of the narrative. "Black Hair" does live up to the  promise of a ghostly tale by the end --- a beautiful fusion of restrained  eerieness and horrifying effects of camera-induced disturbance. Famed actor  Tatsuya Nakadai remains his own profile in "Woman of the Snow",  however, making the most disappointing segment of the movie (even the eye  in the sky is more contrived than the corlorful battle-scenes of Hoichi!)  These first 2 stories are also typical of demonizing the female as  threatening supernaturals, but that's a construction the movie obeys rather  than creates.
All in all, Kwaidan's successfully rendered atmosphere of  horror and despair in the last two tales are well worth the time. Don't  skip the beginning though - for Takemitsu's masterful music and the  effective dye-in-motion that introduce the tales.
