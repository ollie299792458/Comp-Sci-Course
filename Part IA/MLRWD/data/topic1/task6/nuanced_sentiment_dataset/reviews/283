When I saw Ocean's Eleven, it stayed in my mind for a long period of time until I saw it 2 more times. I anxiously waited for Ocean's Twelve to come out but it was really a big disappointment compared to the first. Taking the example of other sequels, the whole action is moved to Europe, as if Europe is a distant and fantastically foreign land. This lead me to believe this movie is strictly made for Americans. Secondly, the plot is more complicated than in the first movie, but not necessarily in a good way. The heist is not shown in such full detail and the ending just doesn't have the same effect as seeing a remote controlled dummy driving a decoy van (the fact that LeMarc already had the egg and gave it to them didn't actually help the mood much). The music was nice and, despite other films' soundtracks, it's pretty underground. The laser dance song seems to have captured the attention of everybody here (check the soundtrack reviews). This film focuses more on Brad Pitt this time, surely contributing to his general image of a sex symbol, and also on Caterine Zeta-Jones (She's beautiful but I'm sick of seeing her, this is getting old... Get some new women actresses). There are some funny moments in this film, such as the whole Julia Roberts issue with Bruce Willis the playboy, and also some insignificant jokes scattered here and there. In conclusion I'd have to say this movie wasn't what I expected but it's worth seeing if you're a Brad Pitt fan or if you just have to stay true to the cult of seeing every sequel.
