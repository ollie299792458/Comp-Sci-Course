I rented this DVD based on the silly commercials I had seen about a guy who could fast-forward or mute through the parts of his life he didn't want to mess with. Looked like a fun family night movie. BOY, was I WRONG about the family part! We sat down with our 10-year-old and found ourselves watching a movie full of hilarious ADULT situations. From the busty nymphomaniac friend whose three divorces resulted from her cheating on her husbands with their brothers, to the series of family dogs shown "humping" a stuffed duck, to "fast-forwarded" sex scenes, a light-hearted romp through the main character's actual conception and birth and ensuing comments about the size of his male parts....LOTS of things I really didn't want to have to explain to my grade-schooler. Had it just been my husband and I, we would have watched it to the end. With our child in attendance, however, we turned it off at about the halfway point and popped in a Disney flick. The movie is rated PG-13, but I think should definitely have been rated R. It could have been done without all of the adult situations and been a great family movie about priorities and accountability. The producers, however, chose to make this a raunchy adult romp in line with Caddyshack or Animal House.
