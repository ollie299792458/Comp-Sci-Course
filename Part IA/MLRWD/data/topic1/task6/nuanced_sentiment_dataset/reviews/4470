Blue Crush (2002) Kate Boswell, Matthew Davis, Michelle Rodiguez, Sanoe Lake, Mika Boorem, Chris Taloa, Kala Alexander, Ruben Tejada, D: John Stockwell. Susan Orlean's magazine article, Surf Girls of Maui is stretched into a feature-length chick flick that does catch some credibility from the girls' blue-collar jobs as hotel maids and their bonding. Hard-hitting surfer Boswell bunks with her fourteen-year-old sister and childhood buddies (Rodriguez, Lake) in an island shack and being the best of the three, she takes a risk by entering a contest among the hotshots to surf the world's biggest wave, the Pike Master, with the danger of colliding against the reef; Davis plays her NFL-football crush whom she gives surfing lessons and could affect her chances to win. Remains conventional and equivalent to any teen movie with not enough substance to last longer than its article basis. Not a total wipeout from good wave footage filmed in Oahu, Hawaii. Running Time: 104 minutes and rated PG-13 for sexual content, teen partying, language, and a fight.
