I bought this movie on DVD this weekend and watched it.  I must say that it was a bit dissapointing.  Other than the first few scenes with them at boot camp the storyline and acting were not very good at all.

The best acting role in this movie was the drill sargeant.  The others seemed bland and stale.  Jamie Foxx did not play a very good staff sargeant and was no were close to the excellent job he did in Ray.

As you already know this movie centers around the first Iraqi war.  Operation Desert Shield/Storm.  The movie starts off with your basic storyline, marines getting grilled by the DI and going through various Basic training tasks.  After they get shipped to Iraq everything seems to go downhill as far as the movie goes.  To be honest, the movie seemed more like a documentary than an actual movie.  The story seemed to be building up to a climax, it never got there, instead it just hovered along without doing much of anything.

Don't expect a Full Metal Jacket type of movie, instead think of it as the Blair Witch Project of war movies; something always seems like its going to happen, but it never does.  Granted the Iraqi war was a different kind war than say the Vietnam war, I think the main thing that ruined this movie was the acting and storyline that never seemed to go anywhere.
