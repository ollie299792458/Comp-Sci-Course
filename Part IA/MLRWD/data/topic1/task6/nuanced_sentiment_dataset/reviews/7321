This was an amazing movie. But if you don't like movies that have heartbreaking sad parts that stick with you after you finish the movie don't buy this one. Otherwise you're in for a very well put together heart full, and touching movie. At times the plot line is hard to follow. But I think if you can tell what's going to happen and when, the movie maker hasn't done their job. In this case you are hooked on the story and the acting the entire time. The moments between Charlie and his brother Sam where very heart warming and also heart breaking. All these things are the mark of a wonderful movie. It has a very good message: you can love your family forever, even if they are no longer with you, but you must also live your life. Zac Efron has come a long way from High School Musical. I think he could go the distance as an actor. The same can be said for his young co-star, Charlie Tahan, who played Sam St. Cloud. He was very convincing every second he was on the screen. I cried every moment it was intended with him. I think he also has a bright future as an actor. I really latched onto them both. Which means they where good at their parts. I give this movie, which will stay with me for a long time, a 10/10.
