Jumanji starts with a sad lonely boy, a clueless father and a factory worker on the verge of greatness.  All confused, thwarted and aching for redemption.  The movie travels though time and adventure saving not only the initial characters but two orphaned kids from their orphaness.  Real excitement, real adventure, real tears.
This Zathura movie has no emotional connection, just overtly bratty kids, with cute kid shots disbursed ad nauseum throughout the movie.  This movie brings nothing but emptiness.  A frozen sister in hot pants underwear, a stupid young kid who supposedly is so smart but won't continue with a game that obviously will solve all the problems and then in the midst of all this banal nothingness a card is drawn that allows any wish to be granted; and the kid wishes for a football with Brett Favre autograph, are the writers of this screenplay medicated or just as stupid as the characters in this movie.  How could this kid not just wish to be home, it makes less then no sense.  Movies like this are not just bad but are symbolic of a culture that actually watches American Idol.

If as an adult you actually like this movie then to you I give the lyrics of Pink Floyd:

I cannot put my finger on it now.
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.
