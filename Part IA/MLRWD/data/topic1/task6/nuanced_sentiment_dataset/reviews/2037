I watched this film after reading a good review in the San Francisco Chronicle.  I'm glad I did.  It is a wonderful (and heartbreaking) story more about the mother in the film than her gay son. Being a gay man born in the '60's I've known a lot of people who want to shove scriptures down your throat as way of fulfilling their own mission to please God. This is what the movie really addresses.  The story is heartbreaking when the mother in the movie realizes she may have been the very cause of her son's suicide.  What is inspiring is how she lives her life after the fact and comes to terms with her own weakness' and failings... that ALL people are struggling. It's also inspirational to watch her struggle and overcome her own prejuduges only to become stronger and more sensitive to the world around her. (Many people stunt their own spiritual growth by refusing to question their  beliefs.) Ms. Weaver does an excellent job of portraying the many dimensions her character requires. The extras on the dvd are as interesting to watch as the movie itself.  All churches should have a copy of this film in their library.
