The sequals continue in this slasher. I must say it was exilerating for me to watch due to the fact that I'm a huge fan of the series.  The plot revolves around the fact that Michaels niece, Jamie, is being stalked by wicked psychopath Michael Myers.  Stemming from the 1978 hit, Halloween 4 in my opinion is an good sequale which I promise will scare you stiff.  Danielle Harris (Jamie) lights up the screen with her excellent acting along with Donald Pleasence (Sam Loomis)  The reason this didn't earn a 4 is because of the some what thin plot and mediocre acting by the supporting cast members.  Mostly hormone driven teens which you want to see die anyway.  The movie can be a bit slow at times also.  But that's kind of a contridiction due to the fact the original Halloween was slow and still was a great movie.  In conclusion, I recommend this to any hard core horror flick fans.  For others I think it will seem like any other "average" movie out there.  Got to say something about what I said? E-mail me at: omicron_30@yahoo.com.
