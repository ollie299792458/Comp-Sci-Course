Jonathan Safran Foer's book is a truly literary work and this movie is not a book. And, as many have already said in Amazon's ratings, this movie is not like Foer's book.  It is, unfailingly, cinema and with that in mind it should be judge upon cinematic criteria. Thus, although I will grant the impressive visual beauty of this movie (the cinematographer captures an oddity, serenity, and disturbance) I cannot agree with those who give it high marks.  The plot is sparse, as is much of the character development.  I am especially disappointed with the portrayal of Alex and his grandfather.  I found myself empathizing little with the grandfather or Alex in the movie's final dramatic scenes.  The grandfather's emotional turmoil seems underdeveloped as does Alex's reaction to his Grandfather's action.  Morevover, the parallels between the JSF character and the Ukranian characters seem forced.  The only things they share are contrived connections in the narrative's backstory.  Overall, I felt untouched by this movie.  And one last note, why is it even called "Everything is Illuminated?"  That title illuminates little within the movie.
