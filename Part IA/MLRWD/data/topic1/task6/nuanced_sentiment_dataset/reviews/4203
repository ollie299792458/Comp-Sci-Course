This is without a doubt my favorite film of this genre ever.  You got Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore.  Come on?  What are you going to expect?  This film is quite nearly perfect.  Michael Mann sets a perfect tone of Los Angeles with his gritty, yet Hollywood glam style.  My favorite thing about this film is the fact that there aren't really and concrete good guys or bad guys.  Al Pacino's cop and Robert DeNiro's robber seem like two guys who, if they weren't in their current line of work, would be sitting out back by the barbecue on a Sunday afternoon watching the big game while drinking a beer.  This is never better illustrated than the scene in which they are talking in a coffee shop.  The are enemies.  Bitter enemies.  They know just as we do that one of them will have to take the other one down.  At the same time there is this unsaid sense of respect for one another.  Brilliantly acted scene.
The bank robbery scene is also amazing.  Possible the best bank robbery scene of all time, it shows such a calm sense of urgency.  An element that most directors would screw up or over display, but not Michael Mann, he handled it brilliantly.  
This is one of those films where it just screams out for a special edition.  God knows I hope they release one.  I would repurchase this disc for a DTS soundtrack alone.  In the meantime however, the price of this disc is well worth it.  I have nearly 700 movies in my collection, and I still watch this 4 or 5 times a year.
