i love what anasma and future <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00095NX96">Wave Explosion - Bellydance Hip-Hop Liquid Fusion: Technique, Drills and Movement Flow with Anasma and Future</a> are doing with blending and teaching the art and philosophy of their dance. (future's on her other dvd and has his own amazing one on waving, also from world dance new york videos)

this is a keeper like rachel brice's work, too. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00095NX9G">Serpentine - Belly Dance with Rachel Brice :: Bellydance Technique & Yoga for Strong, Relaxed & Sinuous Movement</a>

(rachel brice's dvd is also advanced, but straight up more about the technical than the sexual creative life dance thing world dance new york seems to be about now. it's probably a cultural thing: dancing caucasians in general seem to be ecstatic just to finally feel free to MOVE and tell everyone else how like they just discovered america [yet again], while other cultures already know about how to move more freely--particularly in a lifetime of constricting situations--so they're often already well into the spiritual as well as the pragmatic realm in all the arts and plain life and philosophy--be it music, painting, dance, etc.)

keep an eye on world dance new york's output. they're onto something that's beyond dancing around in front of your tv on a suburban shag carpet.

there's something revolutionary and sexy and alive and many colors... i love all their uses of the word "fusion."
they live it. and to live it, you've gotta get along.

anyhow, good luck. grow into this even if you're still doing the box step.

everyone can dance.

in his own dvd, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000960OR4">Waves of the Future HipHop and House Dance with Future</a>, i love how future tells people how to feel and catch the rhythm FIRST. you see him click in. and then you're off...
