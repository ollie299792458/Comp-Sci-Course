I liked this movie until the last scene where they f*[ked up the time-line.  The following is the movie's chronology as explained by the disjointed scenes:

1) Beginning of story,

  Toshio's family dies.

2) Two weeks later,

  Mariko and Rika dies.

3) Five years later,

  Old lady's family dies, Rika found alive and in shock in

  house.

  ***MAJOR TIMELINE ISSUE #1***

4) Five years and a couple of days later,

  Death of policemen and Izumi's father.

5) Seven to ten years later,

  Izumi's hears Rika was found dead a week ago on the radio,

  ***MAJOR TIMELINE ISSUE #2***

  Izumi's dies.

This time line is impossible, and sadly ruins the movie for anyone who notices it.  By the end of the movie all I could think about was "when the heck did Rika die!!!???"  Which left me not thinking about how scary the movie was which is the reason you watch horror movies.  I had to re-watch this movie by skipping back scene for scene on the dvd just to figure out that it was a screenwriting error and not me missing something.

If you demand that your horror be plausible and conform to the standard "suspension of disbelief" necessary to make any fantasy interesting then this movie is going to sorely disappoint you.  If all you care about is the boo factor then this movie may work.  For me it doesn't and sadly it is ruined in the final moments of the film by having Mariko's student turn out to be Toshio and not some other boy, causing a ripple effect in the chronology of the film that cannot be resolved.

Sadly I cannot recommend this film.
