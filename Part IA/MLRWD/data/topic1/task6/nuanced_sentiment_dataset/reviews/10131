Silly question. Its because there is money to be made. I have never seen a movie that made me want to get off the couch and rip it out of my DVD player and break in half but this movie made me want to do that. First off, my perspective is as the mother of a 2 and 5 year old so I want to make sure that they aren't picking up bad words or attitudes which is what this movie is full of. The alpha's mother is the scariest pick of the lot which is strange because it seems as if her role is for comic relief. She switches between goofy ditzy 50's housewife with no clue to making scary faces and saying things such as telling her husband to rip someones tail off and stuffing it down their throat, threatening other wolves that she'd rip their eyes off and stuffing it down their throat, etc... I'm not a big Disney fan although I do allow my kids to watch it. I appreciate their adult tongue in cheek humor even as I roll my eyes at the product placement and stereotypes of the sexes and body perception. I don't believe that just because something is in cartoon format, then it must automatically be kid friendly. I never really realized how clean Disney humor can be without overly offending, frightening, or imparting violent attitudes until, well I saw it done by another cartoon. As far as animation goes, it's nothing like the CGI that comes from Pixar or Disny. Quality isn't there.
