The Game was directed by Fight Club director David Fincher and in many ways it prepares the viewer for the twists and turns of Fight Club.  Michael Douglas as control junky investment banker Nicholas Van Orton is  given an invitation to "the game" by his younger brother Conrad  (Sean Penn).  Before Van Orton knows it the game has started and it takes  him on journey where he is in the dark so to speak and he never really gets  out of it until it is over.  Other reviews have said that it has no sense  of humor, this movie doesn't need one.  it's mysterious and intellectual  strength is more than enough to keep most people fixed to it.  Others have  said that the ending is anticlimactic.  If one cannot appreciate the ending  of this movie, they haven't been paying attention.  If you want a movie  that makes you think, this movie is for you.  my friends and i started it  sometime after midnight a couple years ago and we didn't sleep for an hour  after it was done because it made us think that much.  the movie buff will  not be disappointed.
