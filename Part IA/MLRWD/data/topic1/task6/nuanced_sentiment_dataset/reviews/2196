The Gift is a story about a small town murder, a hated psychic and ghosts. Cate Blanchett puts in a good performance from start to finish and even Keanu Reeves seemed to transform himself into a half decent actor for this one.  The plot and story are interesting, not too great, but entertaining. At times it feels like you are watching every other movie about the south. Like The Client and the Apostle put together and molded into a murder mystery. But it is still thouroughly enjoyable. It is hard to see Katie Holmes, famous for playing a high school student on TV's Dawson's Creek, act as an older more mature women engaged to be married. It does not seem as though she fits in here. To me, she seems like she should still be in high school. However, the talented young actor Giovani Ribisi more then makes up for the poor casting of Katie Holmes. Ribisi plays a troubled client of Blanchett's in an outstanding performance.  Now for the reason why I only gave out 1 star; it had one of the most corny, uncreative endings I can remember seeing in a long time. Then, 5 minutes later, it tops itself by adding in something ten times more ridiculous and corny. You'll know it when you see it. The horrible ending ruined the otherwise above average movie for me. I guess we can chalk this up to the writing of Billy Bob Thornton.  I suggest seeing this movie, but I also suggest turning it off 10 minutes before it is over. Also, look for Mr. Lumberg from Office Space.
