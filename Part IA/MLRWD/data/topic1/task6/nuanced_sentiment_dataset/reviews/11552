As far as the story, suffice it to say this is one of my favorite short stories.  There are plenty of other reviews available concerning the content of the story, so I concern myself primarily with the presentation on the kindle.

Having first tried the other version available, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A14TAW">The Most Dangerous Game - New Century Edition with DirectLink Technology</a>, and finding that it had an unwelcome abundance of typos, I downloaded this version instead.  Unlike the other version, this version actually breaks the text into paragraphs, this very welcome and make the story much more pleasant to read.  There are two notes built in to the story as editorial comments on what certain words mean.  Although these comments are unnecessary to the understanding of the story, they are not unwelcome.  The biggest plus is that I haven't noticed typos in this version like I did in the other version.

Overall, I think formatting is well done and works perfectly for the kindle.  If you want to purchase this story for your kindle buy this version.

P.S. There is another reviewer of the kindle edition that mentions some of the text disappearing.  I have not experienced this problem.  It's possible this problem did exist and was fixed, but the problem isn't there anymore.
