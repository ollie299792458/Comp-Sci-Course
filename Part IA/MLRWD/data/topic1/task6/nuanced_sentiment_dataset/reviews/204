There are only a handful of movies that I find myself going back to time and again.  This is definately one of them.  Since it's release in 1999, I have probably watched LONE STAR at least a half dozen times.

This movie just has so much going for it. It is very well casted as the actors really are a great match with the characters they portray. The director has done a magnificent job of fading scenes from past to present and back again. But the storyline itself is what really captures the essence of the movie with its uniqueness. Living in south Texas, I was also most impressed with the accurate depiction of so many of the characters.

The movie contains several great subplots such as cultural interaction, family turmoil and small town politics, but the true focus is centered on renewed love with an incredable twist at the end. The only negative I can give this movie is that I wish Matthew McConaughey had played a larger roll. He is perfect in his characterization of an "I don't take crap off nobody" Texas lawman. This is a great movie which I throughly enjoyed and I think you will too.
