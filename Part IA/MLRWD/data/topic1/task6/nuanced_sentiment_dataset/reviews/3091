I give it one star for its special effects, another star for DVD's
commentary.
For those who doesn't know, Spawn is base on this premise-
Simmons is a government assassin.  Just before he dies,
he made a deal with the Devil for the love of his wife.
When he woke up again, he became a grotesque monster and
cannot go back to his life.  He was also obessessed with seeking
revenge on the person who kills him.  However, if he kills bad
guys then it'll make Hell's army stronger, if he recklessly kills
good guys then it would be evil and causes chaos, which is
good for the Devil too.  Worst of all, no matter what he does
he will waste his power (when he used up all powers he will die).
Doing nothing isn't an option either, since bad guys will go after
him and the people he loves.  Hence he has to struggle with his
own morality, the fact that he cannot be with his wife, and his
own existance.
Interesting concept, eh?  Unfortunately, the movie did not
capture the spirit of the original idea.  We never really get
involved with Spawn's internal struggle, hence we don't really
care about the main character at all.  The senses of irony associated
with "no matter what Spawn do it's bad" weren't created in the movie.
Nor did the movie really explain the hell/spawn relationship.
Only the action scences are somewhat worth praising.
Also, Cog in the movie is different from the original ideas.  This is
OK if it's done well, but Cog the mysterious Yoda-type was changed
into a not-so-old guy with blade-hand, likes to interfer but cannot
fight well.  It's just horrible.
