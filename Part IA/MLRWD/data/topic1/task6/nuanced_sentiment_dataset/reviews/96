Psycho the HITCHCOCK classic still stands as one of my FAVOIRT movies of all time. Anthony Perkins is also one of my favoirt actors!
I did in no way see a reason to remake this Classic.  and Miscasting glore.... with  that in mind.. is this a spoof? The shot by shot is only showing how  unorignal hollywood has become with so many titles.
now also what I mean  a little by Miscasting. Vince Vaughn in no way was trying to play Norman  Bates. He Was Trying to play Anthony Perkins. and in which case he should  have been trying to play his own norman bates and not trying to compair  himself to Anthony Perkins.
Now "PEOPLE" Want to say Color was  a good edition to this remake..  I think its sad to say that. Cause  Hitchcock (The MASTER of suspence!) ment to make Psycho in Black and white  and I think that was a good thing in this film.. Some films were better in  black and white, and surly Psycho was one of them.
so This film will  never even be close to that 2nd star..  If there was away. I'd give it a -  5 stars!
