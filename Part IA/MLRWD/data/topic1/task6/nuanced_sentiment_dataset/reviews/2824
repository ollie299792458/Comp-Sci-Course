I got this movie because I am a World History Teacher. Gunga Din was written during the time of the non-violent resistance led by Gandhi against the British Empire in India in the early to almost mid 1900s. The movie portrays the British soldiers as orderly, courageous, and civilized. On the other hand, the resistance movement Indians are portrayed as cult-like demon worshipers of the worse kind terrorizing India and the orderly British. The leader of the Indian resistance movement look strikingly like Gandhi himself! Clearly, Gunga Din became a propaganda movie to justify the British oppressive regime in India during the time when the Indian people are resisting British colonialism. I only show a portion of the movie to bring that point home to my students. I show the beginning of the movie to show the contrast between the British soldiers and the Indian resistance. Than I show my students when Gunga Din and a British soldier came upon a cult ceremony by the resistance. The movie is an entertaining action movie. However, I show the entire 1982 Gandhi movie, which is a much more appropriate movie to show my classes all the way through.
