I was not able to find this movie at any of the video rental stores so I was anxious to see how this subject would be presented. This subject was mentioned in a book by Cornelious Ryan called "The Last Battle" where Ryan mentioned that the Russians raped thousands of German women during the Battle for Berlin. The Russians felt this was revenge of all the terrible things the Nazis did in the Soviet Union. I noticed that a couple of people also were in another movie by the same producer called "Downfall" so you can tell the set and story line was done with the same amount of attention to detail. It starts out great with the German civilians hiding in the basements and cellars of the building hoping that they will not be harmed. But, in the end, the Russians storm the buildings and start picking out women who are raped (not too graphic scenes but you get the idea). I like the scene where the German commander is forced to talk on the loud speaker that Hitler is dead and for the German civilians or soldiers to cease fighting. The Russians break out with a large cheer and start sing the Russian national song. The noise can be heard inside the buildings where the Germans are hiding in shame for losing the war. In the second half of the movie, it starts to slow down after the German woman learns her Russian Major is being transferred and her husband returns to find out that she is now a collabrator with the Red Army. I totally suggest this movie as it is the only movie I have seen that addresses this topic. I give it a strong 4-star rating.
