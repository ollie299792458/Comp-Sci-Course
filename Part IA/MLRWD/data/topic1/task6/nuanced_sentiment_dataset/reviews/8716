I first saw "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" as an 8 year old kid at the Del City
theater, in Del City, Oklahoma, in 1958. It scared the hell out of me! Today,
I'm a 57 year old man who still loves this movie. This is cheesy, 50's sci-fi
at its finest! The paper mache hand, the semi-transparent 50 foot woman,
the ridiculous spacecraft (called a satellite in the movie), the horrible acting,
the corn-ball script, all come together to make this a movie "that is so bad
it's good." Now that's a term that's thrown around a lot these days, but it
applies to no other 50's sci-fi movie like it does this one, with the exception
of maybe "Plan 9 From Outer Space." The transfer to DVD is excellent,
considering the age and quality of the original film. There's an excellent
commentary by movie historian, Tom Weaver and Yvette Vickers (who plays
Honey Parker in the film), that comes with the DVD, but other than that there
are very few extras. This cult classic is a must-have for any 50's sci-fi movie
collector. Folks, it doesn't get any better than this. Highly recommended!
