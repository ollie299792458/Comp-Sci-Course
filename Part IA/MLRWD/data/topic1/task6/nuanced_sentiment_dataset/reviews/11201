Okay, I am a little shocked here. Those of you who read the book and then said the movie was better are missing something! I personally thought the producers of this movie completely butchered the story! I love Anne Hathaway but she was completely wrong for this role. Andy really needed to be someone much more smart and savvy and with a slight attitude, as opposed to confused, wide-eyed Anne. As a matter of fact, not one person in the entire cast (aside from Streep of course) was portrayed properly and in line with the book. What is the point of making a movie out of a book if you are going to completely change the story and fail to thoroughly develop any of the characters? I hated the adjustments made to the story and was decidedly angry that the writers chose to have Andy sleep with Christian (who, by the way, going back to the casting problem, should have been someone much younger, cuter and not a complete doofas). For what it was, a pretty good movie and entertaining to watch but speaking from the perspective of someone who read the book first (bad idea), this was a horrible rendition and a supreme disappointment.
