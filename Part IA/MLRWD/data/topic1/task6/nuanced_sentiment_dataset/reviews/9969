I realize the Hollywood literati will look down on this movie, for its over-reliance on special effects (Las Vegas strip falling into a massive earthquake crevasse?  cool!) and predictable dialog.  But I never really felt this movie was trying to be more than it is; namely, a tremendously entertaining end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it roller coaster ride.  Same with Steven King or John Grisham:  they'll never be Nobel Prize contenders . . . . but we like them, because they know, just as we do, that they're not the next Shakespeare, and they don't try to pretend otherwise.  Same with this movie.

What I liked:  Characters were an excellent cross-section of society: ex-spouses sharing custody, Russian mafia, self-serving politicians, and my personal favorite:  the off-the-grid survivalist radio host played by Woody Harrelson. I thought the last scene (no spoilers, but it involves some big structures inside a mountain) was really cool and interesting, made me wonder if we could really pull that off.  Some people are not fans of John Cusack, but I thought he was authentic and believable in this movie.  And special effects were off-the-hook, as many other reviews have noted.

What I didn't like:  Not much honestly. As I said, I did not expect Out of Africa or Citizen Kane, so I wasn't disappointed that it didn't change my life.  OK, some of the subplots were cliche (the Russian bimbo and her dog, the lone politician with a conscience), and some of the dialog was less-than-brilliant.

But the over-the-top CG, the quirky characters, and the what-if scenario of how the connected & powerful go about saving themselves as the world goes down the drain, all these were worth the price of admission.  I'm adding this one to my movie library.
