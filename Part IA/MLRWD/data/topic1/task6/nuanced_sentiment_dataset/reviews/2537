Technically, and acting-wise this is a great movie. The performances, especially by Gene Hackman, Richard Harris and Eastwood, are superlative. Hackman's "Little Bill" is easily his most memorable character since Popeye Doyle in "French Connection" (Too bad he had to do a caricature of it a couple years later in "The Quick and the Dead"). Cinematography, editing and most of the dialogue are also excellent.
My problem is with the plot. So Eastwood's Bill Munny, after arriving in Big Whiskey, has a dark epiphany of sorts in which he sees the harsh reality of death and the terrible consequnces of his murderous past. Yet he then almost casually goes through with the contract killings, even though he now knows that the account of the mutilation of the prostitute that he is supposedly exacting revenge for was exaggerated. To me, this makes all his dark visions and revelations meaningless; they had no effect. Despite all the pretensions of the script, in the end this becomes just another conventional western, with the "good guy" shooting all the bad guys. Despite all his character falws and all the nuances, in the end Eastwood is presented as just another avenging hero like his mid-seventies characters.
