Warning: I use IM and Text abbreviations in the following review. If this is a pet-peeve, please skip! :_D &lt;---it has begun!

Overall I found the film entertaining enough, but I wouldn't wanna watch it a second time.  I'll just list some of the pros/cons starting w/ the positive.

Pros
1) Taylor Lautner; yea sounds cheesy but did you really click on this film b/c you wanted to see the cinematography? No, you wanted to see Lautner w/out having him share air time w/ that vamp dude. Am I right or am I right?

2) Action scenes and choreography were good, I was actually impressed w/ Lautner's physicality. (that black belt's really paying off)

3) Great supporting actors, like S. Weaver and J. Issacs who give the film some much needed foundation and made the beginning of the film enjoyable.

Cons

1)The romantic sidekick- honestly, for me the lead female supporting role (not necessarily the actress) really slowed the film down. Is it an action flick or a romance. Choose one please b/c doing both isn't working. While the setup for this initially in the film worked, over the course of the film, it floundered. Echoing other reviews, the chemistry between the leads was lackluster.

2) Weak Plot- I think what's delivered in the trailers is a good plot however the film fails to deliver what was promised and leaves audience at a loss. After the initial setup the whole film seems superfluous. If you are not going to have a strong storyline then at least have the decency to distract me w/ senseless violence and mind-numbing action, instead of a kissing scene or an ALmost kissing scene (developing the romantic interest) every 20min.

TL;DR- Am I a team Jacob; yes so beware bias
Did Lautner sell the action bit- Yes! very well
Did Lautner sell the romantic doter? Um... rethinking my team allegiances atm, is there a team Alice???

PS-w00t my first review!
