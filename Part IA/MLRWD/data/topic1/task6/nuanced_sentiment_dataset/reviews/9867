As far as action movies go, "Gone In 60 Seconds" is a pretty good one for my tastes - a good butter-on-popcorn movie. What I'd like to alert others to is that, while this "Director's Cut" disc contains a number of good behind-the-scenes-type special features, the version of the actual movie that's on it is VERY different in feel from the theatrical release, which of course was the same version that was on the first release of the movie on VHS as well as on DVD. This new version uses more than a few different scene takes and different camera angles that did the theatrical release. In places, it also seems to be edited differently from the first-released version. A number of the cuts from scene to scene are different. And some scenes were cut and replaced by others. Obviously, any "director's cut" version of a movie, by definition, is going to be different from the original version. But if the version is THIS different, it's only fair to the customer that he/she be given viewing options. This was done in the latest release of "The Bourne Identity" on DVD, for example. Both the original and the new version of that movie were put on the disc, so the viewer could choose between the new version with the added or differently edited scenes, or the original version that he/she was familiar with and had enjoyed in theaters.
