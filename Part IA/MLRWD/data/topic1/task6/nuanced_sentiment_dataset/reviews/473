Well, i think some of my fellow reviewers have made the point but being English i'd just like to point out that in the 1980's this film (English title 'Beast in Heat') was placed alongside Evil Dead, last house on the left, Tenebrae and cannibal holocaust as a video nastie. Lets get this straight. It's a pile of doo doo that has no right to be placed aside genuine classic horror movies, even the nazi nasty genre should be ashamed of this drivel. It's basically an italian war movie spiced up with scenes of females being tortured in an ilsa type fashion except the director forgot to tell the maidens to act like there being tortured, i'm guessing having your finger nails pulled off with pliers would warrant a stronger response than 'ow'. Also we get a midget troll thing who's fed on ahprodisiacs who promptly tries to body slam chicks before munching on a wig placed over there special areas. It is Awful and has no redeeming features at all. In england because of our beloved (hopeless) media certain films got a reputation they didn't deserve and an audience that they shouldn't have had, this was one of them, luckily in terms of other films like Evil dead it worked in a positive light. SS Hell camp is for historians only and should be avoided if you want to be entertained, most approach this film in the hope that it will deliver what the cover promises, oh dear.
