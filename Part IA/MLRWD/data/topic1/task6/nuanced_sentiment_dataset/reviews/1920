I wonder if all the 5-star reviewers saw a different film than the one I watched.  This is easily Howard Hawks' weakest Western and probably one of his worst films overall.  The underlying problem is that it's hard to tell if it is supposed to be a serious film or a spoof; it tries to play on both sides of the fence, and that just doesn't work.

The Duke's performance is about average for him, but there seems to be a little spark missing from his acting; I wonder if he was a reluctant participant.  Dean Martin (and I am a big fan) gave an unconvincing performance as a drunkard who is trying to reform.  The problem with Martin is that a person never really knows when to take him seriously.

Walter Brennan was his usual irritating self.  Ricky Nelson was wooden and flat.  Angie Dickinson overacted, and I felt the film would have been better without her part.  Ward Bond's performance was probably the best of all the major players, but it was a minor role.

The "romance" between Wayne and Dickinson was very, very awkward and unenjoyable.  The caricature-like treatment of the Mexican roles was embarrassing.  And, at 2 hours and 21 minutes, the film was about 30 minutes too long; I found myself fast-forwarding a lot at the end.

Hawks' second attempt at this story, El Dorado, is a MUCH, much better film.  Even the much-maligned Rio Lobo is a lot more enjoyable.  Rio Bravo is a DVD that will not remain in my library.
