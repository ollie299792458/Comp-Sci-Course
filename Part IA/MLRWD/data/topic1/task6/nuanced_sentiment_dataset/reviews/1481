WOW! What an excellent film. From the beginning art deco intro to the violent climax, this film really worked well. I couldn't believe how well the making of Nosferatu was done in this film. Its amazing. Before going to see the film Shadow of the Vampire, I rented Nosferatu from 1922 for a second time to refresh myself on how the story went and the scenes. The scenes in the movie were almost identical and truely amazing to watch. Defoe mastered the role of Max Schreck who played Nosferatu. He surely should have won the Oscar for best Supporting actor. From his stiff dark pose to his huge evil gazing eyes, Willem Defoe surely steals the show. But let me not forget Malkovich who not only did an excellent job playing the role of F.W. Murnau, but also looked a lot like the original director. Lets just say producer Nicholas Cage was right on the money in producing this film. I give it five stars do to its realistic depiction of the F.W. Murnau classic Nosferatu and because of its witty comedic and spellbinding thriller story. See this movie...but first definitely rent the original F.W. Murnau classic. You will appreciate the film so much more.
