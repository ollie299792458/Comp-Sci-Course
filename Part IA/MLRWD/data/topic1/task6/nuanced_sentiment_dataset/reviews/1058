This movie is as wonderful as ever, but I'm dissapointed in the "special edition" DVD. The commentary consists mostly of PTA talking about wanting to talk about how to talk about movies, but somehow never really getting around to talking very much about ~this~ movie, in terms of theme or character. Granted, that is my own quirky interest in commentaries as I am not a film maker, so someone in the business might find what he has to say quite fascinating.
Even more annoying though is that Whalberg literally, and I mean literally, yawns and grunts his way through his literally phoned in commentary. He also constantly complains that he's got to leave for the airport or something, as if in such great demand that he can't be bothered to discuss his work with the likes of us.  Geez, you'd think that knowing this will be listened to for many years, by many many people, he could have contstrained himself and pulled it together for the short time it took to do the commentary, or made an appointment for a different day!
Juliann Moore is delightful (when she's allowed to choose what she wants to say),as is John C. Reilly, and so I will give three stars for that.
