I recently purchased this film for my library of westerns and finally had the opportunity to watch it today. I was struck by several things. First, this is not your archetypal shoot 'em up, though there still is plenty of suspence and action. You can tell from the beginning of the film, that the Director was trying to provide a more realistic view of what life was like back in the days of the old west, versus many westerns which depict a 'cleaner', less gritty or rustic reality. Watching this film, I could almost taste the dust rise up on the road, feel the heat on the long rides and could definitely get some sense of how most things -- everyday things we take for granted -- were challenging as the west was settled. Aside from beautiful filmography, I noticed the script wasn't typical either. I loved that what wasn't said had just as much impact as what was being said. No throw away lines. No chest-thumping bravado. Gregory Peck - God rest his talented soul - was excellent as a stong and silent man, who turned out to be more complex and sophisticated as the film went on. I thoroughly enjoyed the methodical build to the story, the mood both director and cast created, and the tension that grew as the film reached its crescendo.

I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't give away details. But I will recommend you buy and and absorb this film if you love westerns and great movies. You don't hear about this moody classic much, but it's worth your time. Peck is a master. And Eva Marie Saint and Robert Forster give smart performances, creating memorable characters that add depth and meaning to the film.

Enjoy!
