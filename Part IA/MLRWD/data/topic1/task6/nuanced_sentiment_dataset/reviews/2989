This was given to me as a birthday gift, and I was really excited at first--I love this movie and have wanted to own it since I was a child. But I was extremely disappointed when I actually sat down and watched this. Half of the dialogue is missing (mostly JiJi's), some of the music is missing and/or different, and the ending/beggining songs are the ones from the Japanese version, almost as if they couldn't be arsed to put in the ones for the English dub. Completely not worth it, as most of the movie was not there, and now this DVD will just sit on my shelf and rot because I won't watch it again. For newcomers to the movie, you might like it. But anyone who remembers watching this on TV or renting the VHS from the movie store will be vastly disappointed. :/

This isn't a fault of amazon, just simply the company that re-released it to get extra money out of people. So I don't fault amazon for this. There should still be a warning on here of some sort, because I never would've asked for it as a gift.
