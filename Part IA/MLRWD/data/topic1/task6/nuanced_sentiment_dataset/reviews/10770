The Accused is the powerful, heartbreaking story of a young woman, Sarah Tobias, brutally gang-raped on a pinball machine, by three boy-next-door rapists, while many other men watch and cheer it on.The movie itself is  powerful ,haunting, and the acting of the rapists, and the men who stand by  and watch the rape is frightening. However I just cannot see why Jodie  Foster won the Oscar. Her portrayal of a woman brutally raped by three guys  is extremely unbelieveable. I do not care how ''hardened'' she is by her  dangerous lifestyle it is extremely unrealistic to believe that a DAY after  she has been attacked she would go back to work and smile, and can act as  if nothing is wrong. She showed no distrust of men, no fear, no reaction at  all except anger. For a long, long time after rape, a woman is afraid to go  near any man- no matter who she is. Having seen other women protray rape  victims (notably Rebecca Herbst on TVs 'General Hospital')- I have to say I  am thoroughly dissapointed by the lack of vulnerability her charcter shows  as she is healing, especially after an able acting job WHILE being raped,  and immediately after when she flags down a car and goes to the hospital.  The scene where she crashes her car into the car of a man who cheered on  the rape after he was taunting her, is perhaps the only vulnerability she  shows. However the part of the boy who testifies for Sarah Tobias, a boy  who walked away from the rape scene is powerful, as is the man who cheered  on her rape.All in all, a haunting movie, with a powerful cast worth  seeing, but do not expect a realistic portrayl of a young woman gang-raped.
