I sat down with 3 other people and between the 4 of us I thought we could get a pretty good consensus on this movie. We were very excited to see this movie because: 1. We heard it was hilarious and 2. We love Forgetting Sarah Marshall. So we sit down and watch the movie and during the film every now and then I would stop and think, when is this going to get funny, and I just thought that the laughs were coming soon. When the movie finally did try to be funny it was in gross ways, and I do not consider myself an easily offended person. At one point when all of characters are in drug-induced mayhem the viewer has to ask themself, what is happening and how does it make it any sense?

I personally think Russell Brand is hilarious, but I feel that Get Him To The Greek did not allow him free-reign over improv or his lines. All in all we consented, all four of us, that Get Him To The Greek was approx. 90 minutes of complete wasted time. Usually during good movies a viewer sits and watches the credits for a few seconds or even minutes and revels in how good the movie they just saw was; tragically the second I saw the credits begin to roll on Get Him To The Greek I promptly turned the TV off and got on with my life.

Sad to say, but this movie disappointed on all levels.
