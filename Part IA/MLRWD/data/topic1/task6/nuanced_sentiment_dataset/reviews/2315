I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this movie is kind of like a stone skipping across the water; it covers some high spots but at the end of the film, you don't feel like you know the title characters better than you did when you started.  It was too short and like most papers in Britain, doesn't tell the inside story of the royals.  Certainly George VI and his wife were loved by the people largely because of their response to the events of World War II (Staying in London during the bombings and their visits to the neighborhoods and people that suffered through the bombings).  I don't think it gives enough credit to Elizabeth who seemed to be in touch with the "common" people as much as, or more than Diana at a later time.  It makes me curious about the depiction of her in "The Queen" where she seems uncaring or at times seriously opposed to Diana.
This movie covers an interesting period in Britain's history and deals with characters that have been rather reclusive as concerns their private lives.  I was disappointed when it failed to give us the insight I had hoped for from PBS.
