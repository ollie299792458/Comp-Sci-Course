A hip and wacky sex comedy featuring Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, Walter Matthau, Ringo Starr, John Huston and a thousand other people, and based on a book by Terry Southern--sounds pretty good, don't it? Guess what? It's not.
Candy is completely unfunny, if not depressing. Poor Richard Burton, licking whiskey off the floor! The various targets for its satire are the military (edgy!), surgeons (they asked for it!), mysticism (take that!), the police (burn!) and intellectual pop idols (huh?). The references to sex and drugs have lost whatever titillation/shock value they might have had thirty years ago, so don't expect to get much payoff out of John Astin with the joint behind his ear or the big transvestite scene. It's not particularly sexy, either. Who wants to see Walter Matthau, Ringo Starr or a hunchbacked Charles Aznavour manhandling a lobotomy patient? (I'm sure Ewa Ulin is/was a very nice person with lots of great qualities, but come on). 
Connoisseurs of the weird will prize this movie, but, to whatever degree one can be objective about these things, Candy is not a good film. There's nothing particularly fun, witty, or meaningful about it. It's just embarassing. And honestly, I've seen much weirder. Any ten minutes of Godard's Weekend is more bizarre, gutsy and anti-establishment than all of Candy. 
If you must watch sixties drug culture comedies, The Magic Christian is better.
