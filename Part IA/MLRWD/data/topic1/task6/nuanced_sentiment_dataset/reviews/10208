I like this movie, but I reserve 5 stars for things like "Citizen Kane", and I don't feel that this movie is quite of classic stature. I find it touching, but a little too earnest and simple-minded to be a real classic. 
The plot has been explained repeatedly in other reviews, so I won't bother with that. And I find no fault with the performances of any of the stars of the movie -- Kostner, et al, do excellent work. My complaint is that the movie doesn't convey the "magic of baseball" -- it rather assumes that you understand (and feel) that, and proceeds from there. (At least it doesn't just milk that magic the way "The Natural" did -- that was a beautiful movie, but a total mess otherwise.) Perhaps you had to play baseball as a kid to have this sort of nostalgic feel for the game (for me it's tied up with memories of magic hour at the end of long summer afternoons and trying to play one more inning before nightfall), and while I think that the movie uses those feelings honestly and fairly, it doesn't (to me) seem to be able to recreate (or even explain) them to someone that doesn't feel this way about baseball. 
It's a very pretty movie, and it does a great job of giving the authentic feel of an idealized midwestern summer. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could vote that here.
