The single most important criterion on which to judge this movie is its interest level.  For this, I give it three stars.  It is interesting enough to be entertaining.

Hero enters corrupt town.  Two warring factions vie for control of town.  Both warring factions are evil.  Hero plays them against each other in order to take them both down and restore the town to some degree of health, independent of the bad guys.

Throughout the movie, hero poses as a mercenary, just out for the money.  But hero gives away his money to help those in need.

We don't need a lesson in morality, so the only thing to base our review on is how interesting the story is, and it's pretty good.

It does not deserve to be called one of the greatest movies of all time.  It is not that.  The Godfather Part One, for example, is a far superior movie.

So for those of you who like the name Kurosawa and want to place everything he ever did above anything American, sorry, but this movie by Kurosawa can't be compared to Godfather 1.
