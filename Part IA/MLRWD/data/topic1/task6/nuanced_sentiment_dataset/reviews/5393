I barely knew who James Dean was until a friend of mine recommended "Rebel Without A Cause." Now, i believe that James Dean is not only an icon that people (esp. teens) should recognize for his outstanding role as a confused and volatile teen in Rebel, but quite simply a raw human being. He pretty much exemplified the outcry of most teenagers everywhere with this classic line from the film: "You are tearing me apart!" Who can't relate to that type of emotion that one feels for their  parents or friends, at times? I was surprised in how i could relate to the characters in the movie, even though they are nothing like me. That's why Rebel Without A Cause is timeless: it speaks for every young generation just as much as it did during Jame Dean's era. Also, everything else about this movie, the way it was made, the plot, the music, etc., just complements every aspect of the film. Of course, James Dean made this film what it is; it's amazing to see his character transform before our eyes, which is a very rare event to witness in a film.

Unfortunately, the three primary characters--- Natalie Wood, James Dean, and Sal Mineo--- all experienced tragic ends. Ironically, just like in the movie, Sal Mineo was murdered, Natalie Wood drowned, and James Dean died in a car crash. All of these people were truly talented actors that i hope will be recognized in this film as well as the others that they were in.
