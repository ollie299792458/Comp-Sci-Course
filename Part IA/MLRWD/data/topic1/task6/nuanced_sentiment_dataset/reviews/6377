I'm glad this movie is a parody. If it took itself seriously at all it would be absolutely horrible.

The plot is this--Stan Helsing, a flunky clerk at a video store, has to drop off some videos (yes videos) to the mother of the store owner. This gives Stan and his three companions a reason to being heading into neighborhoods they have never been in before. That's about all the plot there really is. There is a minor thread about Stan denying his bloodline (the Van Helsings) but that topic is rarely touched on and is really only there to give an excuse for him to be the monster target.

This is a very poorly made movie and I was sad to see the great Leslie Neilson make an appearance as a waitress. He must've had a contract obligation because there was no reason to have him in this movie other than to use his name.

This movie goes on my list of bad horror flicks. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is almost so bad, it's good. I did laugh and roll my eyes at some of the parodies presented in this movie but none of the cheesy concepts were given enough time to really develop any steam and so fell pretty flat.

I would put this movie on in the background at a Halloween party but that is about all.
