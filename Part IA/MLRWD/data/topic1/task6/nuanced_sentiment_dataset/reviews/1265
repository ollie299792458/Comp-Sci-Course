Remember, not so long ago, many of us had slowly collected the first few seasons of Mary Tyler Moore, waiting patiently for the remainder to come? Then, after years of nothing, the "box set" came out. Making the first discs we had bought obsolete, and they were seemingly forcing us to re-purchase what we had already bought. Fans howled in protest. Reviews were terrible UNTIL they took care of the loyal customers who had bought the individual seasons, and they released the final seasons individually in addition to the "box set".

Now, they are attempting to pull the same "bait and switch" with Barney Miller. I don't know how many years it's been since season 3 came out, but I know that I, and many others, have waited way too long for this great show to be available, with the OPTION of purchasing individual seasons.

This is highway robbery. Pure and simple. They do this with the best shows (many agree Barney Miller is one of the greatest cop shows, comedy or drama, in TV history), thinking we'll do anything to purchase it, even re-purchasing perfectly good discs.

They didn't get away with it for MTM, don't let them do it now!
