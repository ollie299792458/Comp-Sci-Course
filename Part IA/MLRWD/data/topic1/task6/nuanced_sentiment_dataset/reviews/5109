I dont watch regular TV, so i dont know nothing about Jennifer Aniston and the
others except Alan Alda (MASH). Twas great to see him again...got a little older as
time passes on.
So when i rented this movie, i already seen the preview, and there was something to
like...hippies...commune...drugs ...great mix for a movie.
  Usually when a movie has a RESTRICTED label, there is something worth restricting.. but in here we have a male walking around in the nude, and some not
very attractive females near the end......but open up your tv and people die with
bullets in their heads...and bodies get chopped up...but show a bit a flesh and
a few swear words....the whole world might come down....very sad state of society
indeed.
So back at this movie....fun movie....a few situations...a few wacko characters
different that others and filmed in the great outdoors gives it more quality.
Is is the best...no ...is it fun...yes....will i watch it again....yes.
