I really liked this movie when I first saw it, years ago. Watching it again now, I have to shake my head in rueful astonishment.

There's a shocking scene in the TV series "Mad Men" where a '60s family pack up after a picnic and simply dump all their trash out on a beautiful green lawn. Times change, huh?

I thought about that when our hero Frank Murphy, a police helicopter pilot played by Roy Scheider, saved himself by tricking the bad guys into firing missiles into a crowded barbecue joint and a high-rise office tower, and again when he shot up a civilian apartment building while trying to take aim on a bad guy in another chopper. This was particularly grating since Murphy had earlier spoken against the bad guys' low regard for civilian lives.

Forget the characters. Forget the plot. They will only annoy you. This movie is stunt porn, pure and simple, and given that it was made before the era of computerized special effects, we have to respect the ingenuity, skill and courage of Hollywood stunt people.

The movie is dumb, but entertaining. Lots of stuff gets blowed up real good, and helicopters are cooool. If you want more than that, you'll want to look elsewhere.
