I saw this in the theater because I love the choice of actors. I did not expect to see such a profoundly beautiful & disturbing film.  I do like movies that make you think, give you pause & spur you toward further research. I also like movies that treat the audience as though they have a brain. This film does all those things very well.  Add to that a beautiful setting & artistic cinematography, & this becomes one of my favorite movies of this year.  I actually love that it is so non-Hollywood (no car chases, no sex scenes, no CGI), something completely different for a change. It's all about the story. The acting is wonderful.  James McAvoy seemingly can do anything & do it well. His acting in this is worth the price of admission. Robin Wright brings such energy to silence & stillness, she is very moving as a mother first & then a prisoner. Their scenes together are the crux of the movie & are powerful to watch. Kevin Kline & Tom Wilkinson are perfectly cast. I highly recommend this for folks who like history & want a great, beautifully presented story.

Of note: There are hours of extras on this DVD. I was blown away by the historical information & the research that went into making this film. To address some charges leveled at the film's "agenda", the script was begun & nearly completed years ago (before Sept 11 2001), the courtroom speeches & closing arguments were placed in the script almost verbatim from the transcripts of the proceedings. And the movie makes no conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the main character....but it certainly does make you think.
