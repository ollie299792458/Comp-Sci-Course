I'm always amazed when I read reviews of films - ESPECIALLY COMEDY - how irrate and seemingly angry people are that don't like the film!!  Humor is so incredibly PERSONAL!!  How can one possibly PURCHASE a film based entirely on someone else's opinion?  It's beyond me!  We are all "critics" - merely giving our "opinions" - and 99% of us do not get paid for this act!!  Anyway, since very, very few comedies make me throw my head back and laugh from my "gut," I was so surprised and pleased when this little "feel-good" gem did just that!  Steve Zahn's performance is the "glue" that holds this film together!  He is zany, sweet, silly, and "eats up the scenery" in a somewhat understated way - if that's possible!!  I was surprised to see the accomplished actor Jeremy Northam ("Emma," "An Ideal Husband") in this small, underrated bit of confection!  But he is the perfect foil for Zahn's craziness!  As has been previously mentioned, Bill Macy is his usual excellent self!  And Illeana Douglas is marvelous (as always)as the frustrated kiddie beauty pageant director and the object of Zahn's  repressed affections!  The scene when these two FINALLY "connect" is a stitch, and bears comedic resemblence to the steamy love scene in "The Postmas Always Rings Twice" - but without the flour!!  So fellow movie lovers, don't BUY this because I loved it!!  Rent it or watch it on cable, and make up your own minds!!  But if the scene where Steve Zahn attempts to teach the tiny would-be beauty queens to dance doesn't at least bring a smile to your face, I suggest you hold a mirror under your nose to check if you're still breathing!!  (That's sarcasm, folks, and intended for humor purposes only!)  Enjoy!!
