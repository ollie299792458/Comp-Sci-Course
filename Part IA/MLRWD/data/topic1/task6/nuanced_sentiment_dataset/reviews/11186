I anticipated this movie being captivating, heartbreaking and sentimental especially since I am quite a fan of HK "real-life" dramas like Chungking Express (the movie that inspired Quentin Tarentino's Pulp Fiction).  Instead, watching this movie made me feel like I was perhaps missing something all the Cannes and Toronto film award critics saw.  The movie never really captured me nor did it make me sympathize with the characters.  It was one of those "artsy" movies that leave critics in awe but moviegoers in disbelief...disbelief that we actually spent $$ and time watching this film.  It sets out trying to lure you into it's "coolness": insinuating scenes of raindrops badgering broken down concrete buildings, softly vivid colors that defined the 60's, characters walking slowly in tune with slow romantic music, etc.  But that's just it, I felt the movie tried so hard to be "artistic" that it never gave us a chance to feel what the characters might be feeling.  The music was highly repetitive; trying to soak you in it's intended ambiance but I guarantee you would want to turn down the volume after you hear the movie's theme score for the pointless Xth time.  The story was convincing: two neighbors each find out that their corresponding spouses are having an affair with each other.  Imagine the feelings of guilt, denial, anger and curiousity you would have finding this out about your husband/wife.  Now picture those feelings trying to surface but unable to because of the fabulous clothes you're wearing or the melodramatic music that is controlling your slow, rehearsed movements.  That would be this movie.
