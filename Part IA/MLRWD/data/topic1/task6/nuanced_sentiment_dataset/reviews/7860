I just saw this wonderful documentary on OWN about an hour ago. It was so inspiring and uplifting to realize that there are films like this that can motivate others or at least have people look at themselves for once and question if they're doing what's right for one and for all. I went into this documentary knowing the basic story from all of the little clips they would show before it aired, but when I actually got into it, I was blow away. Utterly. It's everything I've ever wanted to express, and I thank Tom Shadyac from the bottom of my heart for making it.

I've read a few other reviews and it seems a lot of the people aren't seeing beyond "be more loving and compassionate". That's obvious. You don't need to make an entire documentary to say that. One example is Roger Ebert's review saying: "a film as watchable as a really good TV commercial, and just as deep." suggesting that he only saw the skin, so to speak, of this documentary. I suggest everyone to go back and re-watch it and really listen to him and all of his words. And if you haven't watched it yet, you should. I really don't have much more to say about it than that. It's a very enriching experience to say the least.
