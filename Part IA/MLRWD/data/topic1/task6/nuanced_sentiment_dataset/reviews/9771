I must admit halfway through watching this movie I thought it was OKAY. But then it turned just plain stupid. The acting was bad, and I never cared for any of the characters who had a major role in the film. The little kid just got annoying and same with his Mom. The movie tried to be funny sometimes, but it really wasn't. The dark humor did not have me laughing. For dark humor and action I'd suggest Payback. Not this ...Most of the interesting action scenes, in fact the best of the movie is the whole time they where in the casino. That suggests why the previews show mostly clips from the casino scenes. Okay, so this movie does have maybe 1 or 2 explosion scenes, but... By the time they showed any action at the end of the movie I didn't even care anymore and was ready to walk away. The DVD doesn't make up for anything in this movie. It's a weak DVD with it's only extra features being a theatrical trailer and a list of the cast. With the exception of the Filter song in the beginning, the music to this movie got on my nerves. For a superior Kurt Russell movie rent Breakdown. For an action movie with bad acting, just rent Eraser. Eraser was corny but at least it was enjoyable. Well... you've heard my warning... That's my 2 cents.
