Well, what can I say, I had my hopes up for this one.  Robert Kurtzman was involved and I have always liked his work with KNB.  This however was not what I would expect from a special effects guru.  The first 10 - 15 minutes were pretty darn bloody and really kept my attention but when the movie switched to some CGI vultures, that's when the movie became absolutely ridiculous.

SOME SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH!

This film is about a mad scientist that was creating a drug that would make people hate each other so that he could take over the world and at the beginning it had some Re-Animatoresque moments, but then it suddenly became an outdoor adventure.  The Rage spreads like a virus and if you are bitten you are infected.  The Rage gets outside, which is fine, except that some stupid CGI vultures spread the Rage.  Now if they had used 1 CGI vulture in 1 scene to make the Rage spread to the humans that would have been fine, but no, they had to be featured the rest of the movie!  BAD MOVE!  They are so poorly done that they are funny at first, but it just gets to be completely irritating.

This movie moved very quickly until the vultures appeared, then the film slowed to a crawl.  While I didn't fast forward I did check the running time on the box to see how much more of this dreck I would have to be subjected to.  Overall the effects are very extreme and look pretty cool but the damn birds!  UGH!  The pacing was good but what could have really been a good flick was quickly ruined.  Too bad, another wasted effort by Erin Brown (Misty Mundae), see her performance in Sick Girl if you want to see what she can really do.

A wasted cast and unfortunately some decent effects down the tubes by some really lame CGI.  Oh well, at least it was only $9.99.  I read the reviews and should have just taken it off of the pre-order list but I thought how bad could it be?  That BAD!
