We watched this in English class for one purpous- to mock it! This was so lame- in fact let's just countdown the lamest parts

1.The fact that they cut out the best part of the book- Simon's conversation with the beast! What were they thinking??!!!!!

2.The acting- it reminds me of some of my home movies, only worse. the whole thing is phony, cheesey, hokey and rushed. its as if a bunch of little boys had a day to film it with their mom's camera or something!

3.the novel was actually morbid and dark and thought provoking, this is just well... embarassing. how hard they're trying to be intiidating but are in reality just a bunch of squeky nine year old boys in their underware! how scary

4.The added stuff- like what's up with that pilot guy- he wasn't even in the book! and worse, they had to add so many other characters and stuff and it just dragged the movie even further down.

5.Piggy's death- LOL could they have made this any faker?

Well they achieved one thing- they ruined the lord of the flies' reputation as the most morbid and thought provoking novel and give it a cheesey and well frankly embarassing feel instead. well done whoever read the first chapter of the novel and then decided to make a movie about it!
