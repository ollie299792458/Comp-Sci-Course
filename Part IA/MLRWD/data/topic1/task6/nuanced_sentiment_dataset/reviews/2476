"Charlie Bartlett" can't seem to decide if it's a teen movie with some higher aspirations or a satire a la "Rushmore" or "Election" as set in a teen movie context. It certainly has many of the cliches of a teen movie - a high school populated exclusively by misfit ogres or beautiful party animals, a students vs. authority subplot and, in by far its worst scene, a god-awful dance montage - and these make for enjoyability as well as irritability.

There's certainly no problem with the acting. Anton Yelchin plays the naive but charismatic Charlie with pleasing gusto, and most of the other students fill in their roles nicely. Among the adults, Hope Davis does well as Charlie's easily-manipulated and (involuntarily) idle rich mother. And, as usual, Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene he's in as the sometimes funny, mostly very sad principal, driven to alcoholism by a job he needs but doesn't want and seeing his daughter become increasingly more distant.

The film's flaw, and it's a big one, is that it's too easy. In plot terms we can forgive the improbable rise of Charlie in his new public school. His common-sense advice as well as his provision of all varieties of over-the-counter drugs, while fancifully presented, is easy to imagine working on so unworldly a group as suburban high schoolers. The movie nearly veers in a direction to expose the ultimate shallowness of this approach, particularly in the encounters between Yelchin and Downey, but the movie ends on such a neat note that I can't help but suspect that the film's creators have fallen for it themselves.

It's still worth a look. High school movies will be with us forever, and you can do a lot worse than "Charlie Bartlett."
