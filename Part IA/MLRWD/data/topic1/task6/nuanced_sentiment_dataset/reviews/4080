In short, this movie was made solely by special effects and the plot. The only good actor, and many aren't even decent, was Kenneth Branagh, who played Gilderoy Lockhart in the Chamber of Secrets. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and his friends show little to no emotion during the movie, and even the more experienced actors portraying the teachers do little to show their talent.
  This movie, even though I thoroughly bash it above, was a huge improvement from the first, and I am anticipating the next installment. Once the main characters learn how to act, then these movies should have enourmous potential. The special effects are wonderful, I didn't think they would pull that off, and the plot provided by J.K. Rowling's books are superb. In particular, I am waiting for the announcement of the beginning of the production of Goblet of Fire, for I think that should be a very interesting movie to watch.
  In conclusion, all those who liked the first movie should go out and see Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. For those who would've liked Sorcerer's Stone had some aspects improved, they should go see Chamber of Secrets because those things have probably been improved. And finally, for all those who disliked or hated the first movie, do NOT go see the second in the ongoing series.
