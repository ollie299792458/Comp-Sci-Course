I think this story was interesting, new and keeps the viewer glued to the movie.  Unfortunately the viewer's not stop attention was caused by confusion and a constant search for answers that are never totally revealed.  The screenplay needs more development and editing. As a avid sci-fi fan, I was very disappointed with what could have been a great movie with newness in plot and very good actors.
The blame should be placed with the screen play writer who failed miserably in plot development, the editing, and the audio engineer.
The plot development could have been much enhanced with more information surrounding the character Sherman Reese. Why was he fired?  What did he know? How deep was the NASA coverup and why?The briefcase contents could have been much more effective with more revelation of the contents than only the VHS tape. Mr.Reese obviously made the tape in case of his death, so why did he want to share the contents with Jillian prior to his meeting Spenser at the subway exit? The dream sequences could also have been better developed to aid plot cohesion. While riding in the taxi, what did Jillian see coming down a building's stairs?  Even viewing in frame by frame mode, it was unclear to me.  These are just some examples of poor congruency and unclear development.  The ending left the viewer empty and unfullfilled in their quest for answers and with a feeling of being setup for a sequal.
Technically, especially with 5.1 surround systems, the sound levels were from extreme soft to very loud. This viewer got so tired of adjusting the volume level, he finally set volume control level much lower than usual and used closed captioning to aid comprehension of the soft conversations.
In conclusion, this sci-fi maven was very disappointed because TAW was fresh, full of possibilities, and could have been just plain excellent. But after watching the film twice, this viewer felt cheated.
