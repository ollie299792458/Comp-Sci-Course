I began watching Inuyasha on Adult Swim of Cartoon Network, and was instanly fascinated by it. The storyline is an interesting one...and it's filled with romance, adventure, humor, etc/ The basic storyline: A modern age teenage reincarnation of a very powerful spiritual priestess falls in a well and is transported to feudal Japan. She meets the half-demon Inuyasha, and together, with 4 others...a monk Miroku, a demon slayer Sango, her pet Kilala, and the young fox demon Shippo, they look for the shards of the Sacred Jewel of 4 Souls (the jewel was broken and scattered) and are looking to destory the very powerful demon(s) Naroku. As mentioned before, there are various storylines that encompass the basic story. Each character has an interesting history and help the series become as addictive as it is. Note: you can always check for the series on Ebay. There are about 9 seasons of this series...I have 7 of them. The last two are available, but are not dubbed in English as of yet. If you are a fan of any of Japanense anime...Sailor Moon, Full Metal Alchemist, HellSing, etc...then you will definately be a an of Inuyasha!
