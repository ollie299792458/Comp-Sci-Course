I have gave this film 3 stars not because i dont think it is good but because it simply isn't one to be remembered. It is a funny, well thought out plot and script and would make anybody with the slightest bit of humor in them laugh.
The film follows to very close conjoined twins as they set about achieving their own personal goals and supporting each other on the way. One half of the two decides to make a bid to become an actor but as the other is very shy finds it very hard to go on stage or on set and be with him but as nature intended he is forced to.
Then were off to hollywood as the two persue there dreams of making it big and the other gets a chance to meet his internet girlfriend, but he hasn't told her that he shares a kidney with his brother.
But you guessed it, it doesn't woork out as expected and they are forced into having a risky operation to split them up.
Will they survive, if so will they be better off than before.
Watch this film and i promise it will make you laugh but you wont be talking about it 2 weeks later.
