I've seen only two good video transfers of The Trial (1963) -- the laserdisc by Roan Group, and this DVD by the Milestone Collection/Image.  All the other tapes and discs are cheap, terrible-quality ripoffs.  Do yourself a favor and avoid them.

The Milestone DVD looks and sounds excellent -- I think they actually used the original negative discovered in a storage unit in Manhattan? -- you can really appreciate the eerie beauty of this film's high-contrast, black-and-white visuals, the weird sets and locations, and great performances (esp. by Anthony Perkins, Orson Welles, and Akim Tamiroff).

I also love Franz Kafka's novel and have always been a bit disappointed that Welles changed the ending (slightly) -- based on interviews with Peter Bogdanovich, Welles couldn't really come to grips with Kafka's totally despairing conclusion.  But don't worry, it's still a lot more satisfying than the completely tacked-on "happy ending" that was forced on Welles for his 1942 adaptation of The Magnificent Ambersons.  In a way, Welles's final scene for his version of The Trial is just as offbeat and ambiguous as anything in Kafka's stories.
