I feel that science fiction is very hard to write and you have to make it as simple as you can. And since Star Trek has become so elaborate by a construction made from a period of almost 40 years, it is still difficult to write a story that would match a trekkie's expectations.
To me Star Trek Generations is an awesome movie. It is a magnification of the TNG series just as I wanted to see it with great camera movements on the bridge, stunning visual effects in space and a theme that will make you wonder.
Generations catches the true spirit of to the whole cast as well as the Star trek tradition of seeking the nature of human existence.
The death of Kirk had to be in this film. We knew what Spock, Bones and Scotty were doing in the 24th century. And Picard's send off of the most legendary ship captain fo all time made a great closure the the original cast.
Star Trek Generations is the best Star Trek movie after the Motion Picture, it is a wonderful tribute to the whole Star Trek Universe.
