The best way to describe this film would be a mix of surreal/psychological/supernatural horror. And, sadly, part of the reason I went for this was that it's from the producers of The Lord of the Rings, yet it has none of the feel, not even epic terror. The cover of the case looks creepy, yet the imagery evoked doesn't make it in the film at all, which was dissappointing. The mysteries behind what's going on with Molly have very sparse explaining, and most of what is revealed is simply implied through enivornmental clues, so if you don't like to look at the world around the characters, this film won't make sense to you. Plus, I felt the graphic nudity in this film was uncalled for. If it were organically intertwined into the story, I could understand, but it isn't, nor does any of the nude scenes really make any sense. The language, for the most part, feel like college shout matches, trying to best each other on who could say the worst, which ruined the dialogue also for the most part. Most of the violent scenes, sadly, I was able to predict what would happen and what wouldn't at least a minute before it did/n't. The only part that really did give me chills (aside from the recording camera filming a neighbor family's young daughter and mother) dealt with the only time you do get to see what is afflicting Molly. The way the "thing" moved in an unnatural kind of way was the only real reason it did give me the creeps. Otherwise, they should've done better editing with the script, get better camera angles, not use so much extended camera shots (several seemed wasted), and learn from other movies how to make the scares more unpredictable and less bland. In the last shot is really the only other shining spot with a twist ending, but it was too late for me to completely enjoy.
Here's to hoping The Awakening, Sinister, and V/H/S will be much better.
