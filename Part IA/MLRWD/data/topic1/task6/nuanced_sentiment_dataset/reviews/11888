I bought the UP Blu-ray 4 disc version just so I could have the SD DVD with English subtitles.  I had the NetFlix version of UP and it had no subtitles or closed captioning.  Neither version plays on my computer and both versions are programmed to start with coming attractions.  The copy protection on these Disney DVDs is similar to the Sony DVD copy protection on many of its DVD releases at the start of 2007, movies like Casino Royale and The Pursuit of Happyness.  Then, Sony admitted that about 25 million of its movie DVDs used copy protection software that prevented many DVD players from playing the DVDs.  Disney will never admit it is selling DVDs crippled by defective copy protection software. Nor will Disney acknowledge that it is shortchanging customers by not putting Spanish or French language tracks or closed captioning on some of its new SD DVD releases.  The Mouse House seems now to be only good at firing longtime executives with one hour notice and selling shoddy DVDs of recent movie releases.  At least the Disney Treasures DVDs are still quality mastering jobs.
