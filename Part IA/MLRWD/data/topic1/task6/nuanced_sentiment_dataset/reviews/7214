I played the Max Payne game recently and I really love it. I had heard bad things about this film but decided to check it out anyway. The plot is a major issue here, the game has a pretty interesting and deep plot that is very character-centric, makes interesting references to Norse mythology, and has a good Noir feel to it. Granted, breaking the game's 8-10 hour long campaign into a 2 hour movie is a challenge, but the movie does it rather poorly. Wahlberg is fine but i feel like he portrayed Max Payne as being too angry and brooding, the game never really portrayed him as angry. Also, he never narrates to himself with dark, witty dialogue like he did in the game. The film places way too much emphasis on Valkyr itself (and the very unnecessary "supernatural" stuff). The characters have all been changed alot, the main villain is different and Mona Sax is given way too much importance (and Mila Kunis doesn't handle it too well).

Overall, I'd say the film could've benefited by being longer which would allow for a more cohesive plot (one more true to the source material) and more action. The "supernatural" stuff needs to go, and Max Payne's characterization and dialogue are quite off the mark.
