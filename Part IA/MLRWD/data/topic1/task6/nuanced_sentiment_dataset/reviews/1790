I was in the process of buying some Leapfrog videos (which are also very good) and came across this video set. I decided to go ahead and buy it because I wanted the sight words. I have only had the videos for a couple weeks and my three year old loves watching them. We are working on the sight words, but after every viewing, he wants to watch the colors. He already knew the colors by name in English, but he now knows them in Spanish also. These videos work even better when used with flash cards after the show (there is video flash cards on the DVDs, but I also use paper flash cards).

The animation for the videos looks like it's done in Flash and it looks like it was made for the internet. On my big screen, there is a lot of jaggies on the diagonal lines when they move, but it does not distract from the show.

There is not a lot of action in the videos. I have some videos that the story line of the show distracts from the lesson that is being taught and there is so much action that the child doesn't know where to look. These videos are meant to teach and any action is designed to enforce the lesson.

I think that these videos offer a great deal to children and I am very happy I bought them.
