I am a HUGE fan of this film, watching it every Christmas.  Over the years, I've just gotten used to the terrible quality.  Assuming that it was a result of the film being shot in the UK in 1951.  This Blu Ray transfer has changed that.  The black and white quality is excellent.  Yes, there is some grain, but that is expected when doing a transfer form the original 35mm negative.  Bottom line... short of a 4K transfer, this is as good as it gets.

The package itself comes with the DVD version as well, which... for me... is unnecessary.  I will always watch the much cleaner Blu-Ray version.  The DVD version has a 4x3 transfer which is OK, and a 16x9 transfer, which is terrible... cutting off important parts of the frame, and making the entire film more blurry.

Both the DVD and Blu Ray have the 2005 commentary for this film, which includes an expert discussing the production of this film, along with commentary from one of the original actors.

If you are a fan of this film, and classic films in general, this is THE version to buy...
