The answer is YES and Highlander: The Source proves it. In what can only be considered a need for money, Adrian Paul reprises the role of Duncan Macloud in what must have been written by people who never saw any of the tv series or movies...or maybe they did and they wanted to truly kill it.

To be blunt, this movie is so bad, it should only be viewed by anyone who is addicted to the Highlander series and wants to find a way to break that addiction. This movie is like a drug user having such a bad delusion, that he'll never touch the stuff again.

SPOILER:  In this movie, Duncan becomes the last immortal when he kills the worst bad guy in the history of movies and Methos (who up until this movie was the oldest immortal ever, until here where we find a bunch older than him) sacrifices his own life, a move that anyone who has ever seen him even in ONE episode of Highlander will realize that this is completely out of character for him.

But that's not the worst part of this movie.

Duncan becomes the final immortal and we find out what the prize is...it's not ultimate power to run the world as we all thought, oh no no no...Duncan can now have babies.

Keep that in mind and see if you can ever watch another Highlander video again. The Four Horsemen, Connor, Kurrigan, Xavier St Cloud, ALL of it, all of the battles, every episode...it was all about who can get fertile sperm. Go ahead and try to watch those classic episodes knowing that THIS was the goal all along.

So if you enjoy Highlander and want to keep enjoying it, then avoid this one like the plague. Adrian Paul sure should have.
