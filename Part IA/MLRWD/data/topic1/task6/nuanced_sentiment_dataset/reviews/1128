Most reviews already available describe the story and the viewer's feelings about the movie. Suffice to say that I agree with most of their assessments. It is a great story and very well-acted. Laurence Olivier tones down his acting prowess enough to make himself believable as the lost lover. Merle is at her best, as well, making the viewer feel her pain.

The film was nominated for eight Oscars in 1939, winning only for cinematography. However, the film did win for Best Picture by the New York Film Critics. It is also listed in the American Film Institute's 100 Best Movie Listing (never having been off the list).

I do not own this South Korean product because none of the other reviews specifically address its picture quality. Since there are so few left, I may have to chance a purchase. Until then, I will have to play my old VHS tape, which is showing sign of wear.

This is a movie that is well worth watching - more than once. It is a shame that is has been discontinued by the manufacturers, as so many others have (or even never been made available).
