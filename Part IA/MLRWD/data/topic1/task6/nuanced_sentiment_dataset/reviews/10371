I am a fan of unconventional movies such as this and any other film  dealing with real life issues and consequences that can happen to a person who puts their self out there  ....it shows what one professional independent woman likes to do in her free time with a strong attachment to casual sex, and drug use...yet  she is portrayed not as a "whore" in the typical sense, due to the fact of her characters role that comes with  the acceptance and respect as a teacher for deaf children...she detaches herself from her daily life as a sensitive, caring mentor and becomes a woman who in turn is drawn to the night life  emotionally numb to any lasting relationship... explaining why she had an affair with a married man in the first place ..

This movie explores the dark side of human nature and how evil can dwell within anyone regardless to race, religion, status, or looks of the stereo typical homicidal killer...

Richard Gere is excellent as the A-typical barfly playboy who is not grown up enough to hold a job or any other self sustaining adult responsibilities.. without using women as a way to support his partying lifestyle.

Diane Keatons role as the main character is a very diverse and complex lady with many sides to her nature...caring and patient ...competitive yet supportive of her sisters jet set life...a woman who is desperately seeking respect and approval from a father who openly resents her for having congenital scoliosis and liberal views.

What works so well for this film  is the truth within the  genuine psyche of the main character and holds strongly well in the sense that she can be any adult woman who is into the singles scene. The story line carries its weight in the stark reality of criminal horror that always plays out by having a trusting, innocent victim that seeks to send a very direct yet terrifying message in its shockingly, disturbing ending that puts  the viewer into the victims role...not your typical Happily Ever After ending..
