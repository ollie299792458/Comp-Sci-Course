This was originally a SCI FI movie with Steven Seagal et al battling the hidden alien menace. Said aliens revealed only by their occasionally sideways blinking eyes and odd bits of wushu style wire work. All really low budget and I suspect a bit of a pile of steaming stinky as our man Steve is so laid back he's practically comatose and his action hero skit isn't helped by the spare tyre he's acquired over recent years. He clearly isn't bothereing, looks like he can't wait to hit the doughnut shop with his police buddies.
Then to cap it all after completion the producers decide to rework it as a modern terrorist movie about a spectacular drug plot, only there are a few MAJOR problems :-
1) New plot doesn't make any sense at all.
2) Alien special effects including sideways eyeblink left in, one hell of a narcotic.
3) New plot dialogue dubbed in by somebody who sounds almost entirely unlike Seagal, presumably cheaper and it really sucks big time.
4) Stupid continuity errors with fight wounds flipping from right side of victims chest to left then back again. It's also glaringly obvious to the casual viewer, this is not nerd stuff. Failure to pick it up is symptomatic of this slipshod, bone idle, crappy production.

If you want an example of how not to make a movie fine buy it. If you're looking for a Steven Seagal Movie forget it.
