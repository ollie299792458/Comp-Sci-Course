Vanity Fair had too many things going on for Reese Witherspoon that I think she was overwhelmed, and couldn't deliver a smooth and confident performance like Legally Blonde or Sweet Home Alabama. I instantly compared her golddigger character to Gillian Anderson's  House Of Mirth(also a period piece). Here she desn't have to endure tragedy, and ultimately finds herself a wealthy husband from India. Well, it took her a great deal of effort to climb her way to high society. She had to lie to people about her past, and she dazzled some people with her talent and beauty. She gets to perform a few musical numbers as well. It's a great opportunity for her to display more of her range beyond her comedy roles in the past. Perhaps, it was too dramatic for her, that she didn't have enough intensity consistently. I also noticed that her accent was off when she has to play a heavy crying scene. I have to give her credit for trying very hard, and it is her most ambitious and difficult role to date.
The costumes ,makeup, and the lavish sets were beautiful. The supporting cast members overall delivered decent performances. Anyways, I fell the movie didn't work, because it wasn't a drama nor a comedy. It was kind of all over the place, and Becky is not a very likeable character. Oh well, I guess it's time for Witherspoon to return her more familiar horizon. So if you are a huge fan of Witherspoon, it's worth you while to see her carry a period piece for the first time.
