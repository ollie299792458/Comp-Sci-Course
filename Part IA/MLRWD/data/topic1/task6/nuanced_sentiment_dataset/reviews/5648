Not a particularly bad film, just not particularly good either.  It's a bit like watching The Sopranos.  You can start counting the bad decisions made by the criminals from the moment the first frame hits the screen, so the film has something of the appeal of a train wreck being screened in slow motion.  Unfortunately, this film lacks The Sopranos' gallows humor.  The criminal "mastermind" of the robbery states early on that he doesn't like working with people he doesn't know, and yet he includes McQueen's character in the job anyway, even though that character has apparently never been to prison, has apparently never even committed a crime previously, and has a fairly difficult time just trying to steal a license plate from a parked car.

Then it turns out that the McQueen character's former girlfriend lives right there in town.  I expected that she would be the seed leading to the ruination of the robbery and the destruction of everyone involved, and the main surprise of the film is that she is not.  She is the unwitting key to the fate of McQueen's character, but otherwise does not affect the overall outcome.

I'd have to say that this is a film for real die-hard fans of Steven McQueen, and black and white movies, and caper films.  Kansas City Confidential, from 1952, while only a caper film in part, is far more entertaining.  So is the original D.O.A. with Edmund O'Brien.
