Theatrical release of "The Long Goodbye" = 4.5 stars Video release of "The Long Goodbye" = 1 star
Robert Altman's noir pastiche, "The Long Goodbye," is one of his funniest, most  engaging, and aesthetically magical films (with gorgeous night photography  of Los Angeles). Unfortunately, it is unwatchable on VHS. I rented it a few  years back, found the film incomprehensible, and initially assumed that  Altman's directorial work was poor. Then, I caught it in a repertory  theatre and recognized the problem.
This is a masterpiece, but it's  impossible to make any sense of the pan-n-scan video; as in his other films  ("McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller," "The Player") Altman takes  full advantage of widescreen, a technique that is impossible to capture on  a small television set. So do yourself a favor: avoid this video entirely,  and either see the picture in a repertory house or wait until the  distributors have enough sense to release it in letterbox.
