Oh man,
I'd have to humbly say the only advantage to enjoying this movie is being a twelve year old seeing it for the first time.  But that would be a twelve year old of 1986 actually experiencing it in the movies.  Of which the twelve year olds today would probably need a lot more "eye-candy" to keep them amused.  But boy, is this movie rib-crushingly hilarious to the grown up of right now.
Catch me back in '86,'87 as a kid watching this movie with my jaws agape and you'd never believe I'd have grown up to laugh so hard at every TNT "Movies For Guys. . ." showing.  This is such a fun "Dude" movie.  It's so ridiculous and ubelievable - not to mention 80's cheese - you can't help but watch it every time it's on.  
But you have to give Sly just a wee bit of credit.  Pulling off that "Ode to Eastwood" thing was probably such a novel idea at the pitch meeting, it truly is a shame we never saw more of the omnipotent, invincible and insatiably charming Marion Cobretti again.
Yeah.
But anyway. . .so what it's dumb.  So what it lacks the believability of Rambo III.  And so what if you need plot, character development, consistency and story!  This is definitely the movie for you if you think wrestling is real.
And two stars?  Hey, man. . .I had to give it something.  One star just wouldn't be fair for the accountability of nostalgia.
Godfather?  Definitely not.  But hey, neither was The Toxic Avenger.  And I dare you to find a living soul that's actually seen The Toxic Avenger and not LOVED it!
So there it is.  Two stars for the timeless COBRA.  One 'cause it needed one for the review and the other 'cause I was twelve.
Take care.
