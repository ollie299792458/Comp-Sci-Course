My low rating is not for the movie. The movie is ok.

My one star rating is for the "ultraviolet" option that apparently comes with this particular combo pack version of the movie.  I usually purchase the blu-ray/digital copy combo pack versions of new movies so that I can have a digital version for my mobile content viewers (phones, laptops, tablets etc).  The digital copy in this movie is an "ultraviolet" version.  Ultraviolet is a "new" streaming option that is now being pushed and included by some of the studios in combo packs. The idea being that the ultraviolet digital version exists as part of "your" cloud account on the particular studio's server. This version can then supposedly be streamed or downloaded to any of your devices at any time (if you have the right hardware and software). Merits and practicalities of streaming video content aside, because the studios are so intent on trying to establish yet another new format you cannot download a digital copy without FIRST signing up for an ultraviolet account on the studio's website. Yes, yet another group wants to know your demographic, to know your email address and to subject you to their spam.  Why would we want this??

Regardless, I went to the web site, set up an account and tried to find a way to download my movie. after 10 minutes of circular references I have given up.  this is exactly what iTunes is not.  please bring back digital copies.

I don't need another format to deal with.  I will stop buying combo packs if this is the only option that we get.

if you wish to push back on format creep and costs then do not purchase combo packs that include an ultraviolet version
