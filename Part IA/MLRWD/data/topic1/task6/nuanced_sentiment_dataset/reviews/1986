Michael Apted's 2002 movie 'Enough', though being marketed as appealing to a 'feminist' audience through it's plot, rather shows and affirms prevailing stereotypes of woman- and motherhood as well as class and race.
Even though the 'operative' character is a woman, her motivations and actions are ultimately dependent on men.
The heroine, portrayed by J. Lopez has no upward mobility whatsoever and is 'rescued' into better circumstances by an, of course, far wealthier caucasian man.
When he turns out to be violent, she acts against him not on her own, but on her childs behalf. Furthermore, in order to achieve anything against him, she requires male council and financial support.
Thus the supposedly strong female character is the bearer of a naive morality, lacks economical aspirations and insight and is powerless in society in comparison to the male characters. J Lo's character far from being independent and empowered, re-confines 'woman' to Kinder/Kueche/Kirche.
On top of this, J Lo is framed throughout the movie in a commodifying manner that supports the unlike distribution of power between the sexes in this movie. Her body is rarely shown as a whole but always from compromising angles with focus on her bosom and behind.
Overall the film advertises desirable feminitiy through visual traits while omitting to comment on women's capabilities outside of traditional female space.
