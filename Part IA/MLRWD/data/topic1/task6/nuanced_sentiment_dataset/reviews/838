If you thought this movie was hilarous, you're almost as bad as the movie's villans. Marge would shake her head at you too. Don't people get that? I noticed this movie copy the same trick as Seinfeld say one thing or word often enough, some people find outrageously amusing for some reason. I just call it lazy but of course, my expectations for comedy may be higher than others. The movie becomes so wrapped up in creating needless scenes for the characters to say the same dialogue that it completely forgets it's own story, leaving the death of one of it's main characters(the very reason the story is supposed to begun- Jean) as footnote. Viewers who watch the film to see find out the fate of Jean will feel cheated especially after the chilling scene where Carl and Gaer break into her home. Sure, her fate is revealed but the viewers do not get to find out what happened or provoked it. It happens off screen and the time is filled instead with empty scenes like Carl talking to the escort or the scenes of people eating constantly. This movie is poorly put together and I was surprised that people could laugh at this. I guess people have become such snobs that if they hear a different accent other than their own, they find it amusing to look down on others. Also, the movie has quite a few plot holes. I thought this movie wasn't that great so I would recomend renting it and seeing it first before buying it
