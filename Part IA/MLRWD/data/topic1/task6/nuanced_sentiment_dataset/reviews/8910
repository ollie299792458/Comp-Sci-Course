For a fun, action flick with great visuals this film succeeds. As far as any salvageable message, it fails. Miserably. I found this film surprisingly pro-Church and almost anti-science at times!

SPOILER: The end scene sums up the message of the film: that men flaw religion, and that there is hope for the church. Well, what is religion (especially the Catholic Church) BESIDES men? Perfect example in the film: scores of men die, but because ONE cardinal (who they have not qualified with any extraordinary qualities) lives "God must have sent" the MAN who solves the riddles and the city from demise. So, did God brutally kill those people who died also? No... a person did. Just like PEOPLE worked their tails off to prevent the explosion. Tom Hank's character was WAY too "on the fence" about faith in God, with no payoff in the end.

In the film the previous Pope was opening his mind to science, the implication at the end of this movie is that will continue with the new Pope. Well, that is great, but the REALITY of the current Catholic Church could not be more different. Just because the church says they support science does not mean anything if they continue to oppress people and ideas that contradict their teachings without any grounding in reality. To use this film to try to say otherwise is just odd. I felt they were trying to appease the Catholic Church with this film.
