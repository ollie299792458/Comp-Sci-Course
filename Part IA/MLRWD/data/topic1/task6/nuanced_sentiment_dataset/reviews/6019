This film was very disappointing, coming from the Disney fold. Sure, my kids (aged 3 and 2) love it, but this movie is, at best, tedious, and downright nails-on-the-chalkboard grating when Annette Funnicello speaks her lines. Her opening dance number was halfway decent, but her bland, uninspired performance goes steeply downhill from there. And let's not get started on that nasal monotone she calls singing! She was such a bad actress in this film, the only other person who turns in a more dismal acting performance is Mother Goose herself. It is such a chore to watch the two women in the same scene, trying to outbore each other. I think Ed Wynn's turn as The Toymaker is the only part worth watching of the whole lot. By the time the last scene plods on, with the supposedly-demure Mary leading her groom Tom down the church steps after their wedding, you are just too sleepy it doesn't even occur to you to question if her wedding gown was inspired by the Michelin Man or if she had her hat specially sent in from Sherwood Forest. I would skip this one, unless you have very young kids.
