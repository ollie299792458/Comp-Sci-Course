1. World Heavyweight Championship
Dolph Ziggler vs Edge(c)
This match starts out pretty slow and is til about midway when the match starts to heat up and has a tremendous second half. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Edge can not use the spear here as it is banned which makes him think alot more creatively.

2. WWE Championship
Randy Orton vs The Miz(c)
This is probably their worst match together. I would even say that Miz's cash in was better than this. The match is way to long and drags. These to just did not have chemistry together. The last few minutes is fine but doesnt save the match.
(**1/4)

3. Divas Championship
Laycool vs Eve vs Natalya(c)
This match was like every divas match. Not Noteworthy
(*)

4. The Royal Rumble Match
This is probably a Top 5 Royal Rumble. It is action-packed with plenty of surprises. The ending is kind of lame but there is a shocker that i have never seen til this rumble.

Great Way to start off 2011.
