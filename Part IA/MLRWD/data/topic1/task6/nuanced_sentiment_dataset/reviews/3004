People rave about this movie -- and I had thought it would live to its reputation before I saw it -- but it just isn't convincing. Each of the four protagonists oscillates between being outrageous and borderline psychopatic, and being a normal person the next instant, then going back to crazy again. The older man, for instance, would insult his wife and bring her dirty laundry out in a particularly mean way, but when a minute later she does the same, he acts shocked that anyone could behave that way. Same goes for her, and in fact the other two as well, as the viewer is meant to be shocked by the outrageous person, then feeling emphatic for the normal person. And those reversals happen at the rate of one a minute.

Real people aren't that way, which makes this drama, while fairly interesting in itself, lose lots of its appeal -- it doesn't teach anything about the real world but about some imagined one where people's pshyches work in a different way.

And not to forget that each of those four drinks maybe 10+ glasses of hard liquor in a short time -- and they were drunk before their fateful encounter to begin with. That doesn't make the intellectual exchange among them any more believable.
