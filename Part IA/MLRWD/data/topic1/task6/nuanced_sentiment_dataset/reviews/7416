Martin Sheen. That's right Seagal fans. It's Martin Sheen doing the dub for the lost audio.

There is really nothing much to keep your interest unless you like mildly entertaining bad French accents and the Martin Sheen voiceover. Too bad we couldn't have had the real Martin Sheen in this film to lend some star power, but it's the best we'll get. I can't do a bullet list of things to look out for because there just isn't anything. Even Seagal's extensive wardrobe of black (which he recycled from Into The Sun it seems) couldn't keep me amused for long. You can still cut cheese with his widow's peak but we sadly don't get to see it happen. It might have added some value to the film.  There is nearly zero entertainment value here. None. I thought Today You Die was bad, but at least that had some witty stilted jive inspired dialogue and something in the way of an ending.

I tried my best at highlighting some interesting things, but I could only 'force' up with a short paragraph:

A nonsense opening scene concerning some black box that has nothing to do with even setting Seagal up as a master fighter or soldier, guys getting thrown through paper mache walls and styrofoam pillars (lax French building codes) and surviving, Seagal sitting around for literally half the movie in a bar and no explanation as to why he's even in France, Seagal's government trying to kill him to get him to work with them (at least that's what it seemed like), the knife wound on the girl at the end switching sides and being able to clearly see her lying on the ground while Seagal is supposed to be fighting her...just some of the flaws in this film. The parts where there was action felt like I was watching a bad round of Modern Warfare 2; a bunch of faceless military guys creeping around and getting shot.

Definately one of the worst, if not THE worst Seagal film ever made.
