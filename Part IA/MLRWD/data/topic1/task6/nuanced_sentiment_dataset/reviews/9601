I love World War II action films, but I can't tell you how much I hated this movie. There's absolutely nothing redeemable about it. From the bottom up, everything about this film is wrong.
To use an analogy, this film is like a $500,000.00 home in Malibu built from clapboard, thrown away furniture crates, and discarded soda bottles.
I'm not going to go into the specifics, all I'll say is that this film has nothing to do with an accurate portrayal of history, or any reality in this dimension!! 
The acting stinks, the actions sequences are laugable, and the main characters seem about as real as Bert and Ernie.  The pyrotechnics are so unreal, I half expected that guy from Second City to appear on screen and say, "It blowed up real good!"
If I were a Navajo code-talker, or even a relative of one, I would be totally insulted at some of the insinuations that this movie makes.  It's too bad that these brave men couldn't have been honored with a more accurate picture of their heroism.
