I bought this on a whim because I'm a gambling man.  Incase you couldn't guess by my rating I lost my gamble.

This movie consist of four storylines.  An over-all plot is given in between the other three stories.  The overall plot is something similar to a zombie movie, except the zombies seem pervesion-craving rather than brain-craving.  The other three plots consist of giant sperm, homosexual werewolf-like creatures, and a jewish frankenstien.  Well I watched the first short story (the giant sperm) and slowly my doubts grew.  As I watched half of the homo-werebear plot I gave up.  I like cheesy B-rate horror flicks; however, this was simply boring.  The humor was rarely entertaining to me and the plot lines were boring.

In conclusion I wasted $15.  I didn't even finish the movie.  It is rare that I find something I dislike this much. I realize there are many people who will still buy this even though there are bad reviews.  I was one of these people and now I've learned my lesson.  :(  Let my sacrifice not go in vain.
