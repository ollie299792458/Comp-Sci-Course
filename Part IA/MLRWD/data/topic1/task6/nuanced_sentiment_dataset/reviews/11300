When I was in high school back in 1969 I played on the freshman football team.
I scored a touchdown and the announcer said, "And The Touchdown Was Scored By 'Rooooster Cogburn' !!!!!
After the game I asked him why he said that and her told me that he had just seen a movie at Century 21 Theaters
and John Wayne Payed a one-eyed sheriff named 'Rooster Cogburn'.
Well I was amazed and thought where did they come up with my last name for a part in a movie.  I told my dad and he said, Yeah you didn't know that we had a great great third cousin named Reuben J Cogburn?  I said you never told me and he said you never asked.
So from then on I was nicknamed 'Rooster' by all my teammates.  For years and years I told everyone that asked that I had a great great fourth cousin named 'Rooster Cogburn' and everyone believed me. I was on a World Championship B League Softball Team with Steve Bartkowski (Quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons) and a few other ex pro baseball players back in 1980.
My dad told me one time he said, "Did you know the story behind the legend and I said no, tell me".  So he said
"'Cousin Rooster' was a sheriff back in Arkansas and he ran into a saloon after five horse thieves and one of them shot his eye out then he proceeded to kill all five of them with just six shots" !!!
I said "Wow" !!!  "What a tough S.O.B. he must have been" !!!
My dad never told me he was just 'B.S.ing' me and he passed away back in 1996 and I only found out that he 'WAS B.S.ing' me when I got my first computer in 2000 and 'Googled' 'Rooster Cogburn'.
I had a 'big belly-aching laugh' !!!
My dad was 'The Best Man I Ever Knew' and I will never forget that he certainly 'Pulled The Wool Over My Eyes' for all those years !!!
I LOVE YOU DAD AND I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU !!!
MY DAD, 'THE BEST B.S.er OF THEM ALL' !!!
