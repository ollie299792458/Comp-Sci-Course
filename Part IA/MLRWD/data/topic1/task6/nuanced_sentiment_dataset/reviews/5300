Liner notes on this DVD read "This is almost what it felt like being there." Having attended a Nine Inch Nails concert a few weeks ago, I can tell you the liner notes don't lie.

Concert footage was shot using handheld cameras from various vantage points throughout different concert halls during the Fragility 2.0 tour in 2000. This gives the viewer the feel of being in different places in the audience, whether it's crowd-surfing in the moshpit, standing in the balcony or pressing yourself up against the stage.

I only own the DTS version of the DVD, but the sound is spectacular. Be prepared for angry neighbors kicking your door and shouting for you to turn it down.

Perhaps the most striking feature of the DVD isn't the sound or the lighting, but the crowd shots. Check out some of the audience close-ups, especially during the songs "Piggy," "Starf***ers Inc." and "Hurt". If you're moved by Trent's music, you'll also be moved by some of the crowd shots.

It should be noted that this DVD comes in both Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1 formats. I'm not sure if most DVD players can do both now, but it would help if you checked your DVD player to make sure it can play the DVD in your preferred audio format.

If you ever have the chance to do so, go see Nine Inch Nails in concert. Trent always puts on a great show. If you want to see what it's like to be there, buy this DVD.
