Full Metal Jacket is one of the best, and most powerful war films of all time.

If you don't "get it", read the novel it was based on:
"The Short-Timers", by Gustav Hasford.

If you've read the book, you'll understand the way the movie seems to "jump" from one setting to the next, mentioned in other reviews here.

Short-Timers consists of three acts, "The Spirit of the Bayonet", "Body Count", and "Grunts." The first act is fairly accurately reproduced in the movie, but the second and third acts are combined, and the film loses some plot clarity as a result. In the book, you'll notice that the narative style begins in a simple, direct, and at times brutal manner, and becomes more introspective as the plot moves into the second and third parts ... while the main character, initially a passive observer, becomes increasingly involved. The movie reproduces this narative, enhanced by the imagery that is trademark Kubrick. You will be immersed in this film.

I'm by no means suggesting the ol' "the book was better" here ... this is a terrific film, and it stands on its own merits. However, for those who found the plot confusing ... read the book, you'll better understand the imagery of the film, the transformation of the central character, and why the film ends the way that it does. I can't help but wonder what this film might have looked like had Kubrick maintained the "three act" format of the book ...

Buy the film, you won't be disappointed. Buy Hasford's book as well, and you'll be back watching the film again several times over.
