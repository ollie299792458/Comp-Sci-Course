If key scenes from the only extant copy of "Citizen Kane" were destroyed, would the restorers have the presence of mind and the personal integrity to re-create the original without diluting it by adding their own personal "stamp" on the restored version?
This is basically the dilemma that presents itself to anyone who attempts to re-create METROPOLIS.
The "Restored Authorized Edition" is the umteenth release of a "version" of Thea von Harbou's and Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS. And, again it's a not the "original" release. It's someone else's idea (in this case Enno Patalas's) of what METROPOLIS was supposed to look and sound like in 1926/7. Still, the Patalas' version-- in stark contrast to other famous re-releases such as the Giorgio Moroder version released in the 1980's-- actually shows a more faithful adherence to the von Harbou/Lang vision and offers the viewer a closer approximation to what they intended. In comparison to the Patalas release, Moroder's version is nothing more than historically anecdotal. The color tinting and the grotesque, "modern" soundtrack Moroder added were totally inappropriate. Thankfully, the Patalas release avoids such self-aggrandizing vanities. On the very big plus side, the Patalas version uses the original Huppertz soundtrack.
Did these restorers have the presence of mind and the personal integrity to re-create METROPOLIS without diluting it, adding their own personal "stamp" on the restored version? Sadly no. Perhaps, someday someone will. Until then this is an enjoyable alternative. The process of "restoration" and transfer to DVD are not without their flaws, but given the fact that the orginial is nearly 80 years old, the copy is clean, crisp, and worthy of kudos.
