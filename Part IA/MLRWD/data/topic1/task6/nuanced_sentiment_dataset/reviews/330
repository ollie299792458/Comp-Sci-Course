That's right.  Anyone who liked this movie is stupid.  This is just another slasher movie where the main characters are complete morons, and are required to do the dumbest things conceivable in order for the plot to progress.  "Oh yeah, we just picked up a sketchy guy who says everyone on his boat is dead - how about I leave him alone with my wife on this boat while I go check it out."  -- Or "Oh yeah, I've got a shotgun, but I think I'll have sex with the bad guy instead of shooting him." Or "Now that I've drugged him and he's knocked out, I'll tie him and leave him below by himself so he can wake up and easily escape."  Guys - THIS IS STUPID CRAP - IT IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE.  Oh yeah, how about the gratuitous dead baby scene in the beginning?  I just can't believe 25 Amazon reviewers gave this movie 4 or 5 stars.

Really - I mean, are you other reviewers serious?  Do you own shares in the movie?  Do you just think Kidman was hot or something?  Seriously - check out the New York Times review of this - it's pretty accurate.
