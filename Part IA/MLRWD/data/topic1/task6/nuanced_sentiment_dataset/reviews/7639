Well, this is one of those movies that sounds like it will be fun, but it's slapstick comedy at its worst.  Sure there are a few truly funny scenes, (don't blink or you will miss them!) but I think this movie's "target audience" was aiming for low IQ or adolescent boys or both.

There is lots of nudity, tasteless gags, and an attempt to give the film legitimacy by throwing in a cameo appearance by Hugh Hefner and capitalizing on the Playboy name. Lots of people will probably watch it due to the Playboy angle, then wonder why they wasted their time. Maybe if you watch this while seriously drunk, you won't care.

It's totally absurd and if you feel like wasting your time foolishly, this fits the bill.

If a bunch of school drop outs managed to make a better film with pocket change,  in their spare time, I wouldn't be surprised.

This film obviously had a lavish budget and it's a clear example of money over taste.  I've seen some low budget films that were just downright hilarious and entertaining. Throwing a ton of money on a movie, doesn't guarantee it's good.

If you bought this movie for a $1, you might feel cheated. I think it's worth 25 cents though.
