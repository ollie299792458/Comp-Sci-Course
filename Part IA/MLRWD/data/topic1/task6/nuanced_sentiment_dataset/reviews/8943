Fantasia 1940 isn't simply the greatest piece of animation anyone ever made, it is one of world's greatest works of art. It's illustration of various pieces of classical music was as daring and innovative a move as any artist in any medium has ever made. It's animation was awe-inspiring and it even had a kind of coherence. Fantasia 1940 was almost the world's first animated opera. Fantasia 2000 merely follows in 1940's footsteps, with the aid of computers. It's a sequel and it looks it.
That said, I had a wonderful time watching this. As in the original, some of the segments don't work as well as others. The Beethoven's Fifth segment is a bit of a bore, I thought the Respighi whales piece was excessive, and, given the choice, I wouldn't have included the Sorceror's Apprentice again. But some segments work extremely well. I've never cared much for Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, but its segment here gave me a whole new appreciation of that work. The Carnival of the Animals is hysterically funny, with almost a Chuck Jones feel to it. And Donald Duck is both very funny and very touching in the Pomp and Circumstance. 
Following a legend is an impossible task. But Fantasia 2000 is a worthy sequel to its illustrious predecessor.
