This is a very atypical production of an old Verdi vintage.
It is a figurative version, and if you do not already familiarise yourself with the script, can lead to serious misunderstanding of this work.
As far as modern entertainment goes, this production deserves 5 full stars.
As an operatic production, a mere three.
The reasons are obvious. The direction took the story out of context. The production is minimalist, and if there is no soprano as attractive as Anna Netrebko, this production would have been a big flop for sure.
Musically, the voice of Anna Netrebko is ecstatically beautiful and full. Whether one would prefer a Cortrubas or Freni in the title role's singing is very much a matter of taste, at least as far as the First Act goes. Netrebko negotiates the wild coloraturas with bravura and her young and vibrant soprano is a plus. Her acrobatic ability adds much to her acting prowess. Not so much in the later Act, where she is only partially able to convey the conflict and pathos in the long confrontation with Thomas Hampson. Hampson is similarly vocally bland in this Act, and offered no assistance.
In the final Act, the duets between Alfredo and Violetta were done a trifle too robustly then is otherwise warranted dramatically.
Rolando Villazon, at the onset of his stardom, demonstrated a passionate way of interpreting the role that carries dramatic conviction, if not totally suave vocally.
