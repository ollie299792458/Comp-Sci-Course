Let me start this off by saying, I dont feel the need to post reviews normally but had to in this case.  While I love the classics like "Frosty the Snowman","Rudolph the Red nosed Reindeer" and "Santa Claus is Coming to Town", the movie "Elf" is no classic.  This is perhaps the biggest waste of time one could have.  I can honestly say I have lost all respect for Will Ferrell after seeing this movie and one must question James Caan's ability to judge a good script.  The lone bright spot in the whole movie was the acting and actual singing by Zooey Deschanel who has a great voice. I expect her to have a good film career in spite of making this bomb of a movie.  To be sure, I love Christmas movies as much as anyone and picked this up thinking it would be a good start to the holiday season. I WAS WRONG. This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen.  I am shocked that a studio actually spent good money to make this film.  If you thought Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez' movie "Gigli" was a bomb this movie may actually be worse. In fact if you said for 1 million dollars name 5 movies I have seen in my life that are worse, I am not sure I could.  In short, dont waste your money.  If you are a sadist and want to punish yourself, your spouse and your family, rent it.  At least you can bring it back to Blockbuster if you decide to shut it off. It was so bad that I started to think I should have addressed that 95 minute root canal visit to the dentist that is overdue.  Yes friends it was that bad.
