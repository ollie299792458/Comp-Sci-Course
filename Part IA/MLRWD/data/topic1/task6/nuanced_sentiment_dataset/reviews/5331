I was really intrigued by the story line and for the idea that Jenny gets killed off. She was a girl from the mid west, come out to the west to venture a new life with her boyfriend, fiancee, ex husband then to have realized her sexuality isn't what she had thought because of her misconstrued nature of life.  she was an excellent character, and she acted very well, she was the one character that i just wanted to pull her hair off, not just chop it off.
I loved the story line with Bette and Tina, and i'm glad to see them back together again.
Shane wished she had Carmen come back into her life, but instead went crazy for Jenny.
Alice should not have shared her idea with Jenny, already knowing how caniving and devious Jenny is.  But there is, and always will be a character you will have to base who is the good guy, and who is the bad guy in order to know the difference between the two. Tasha is excellent.
I don't know what's running through Max's head.
Helena, i despise that she wanted to return to Danny's girlfriend. Boo on that part.
Overall story line, honestly with the time that was permitted, the budget they were limited, was very excellent, only because they had intended to have a spin-off. Which i do hope the spinoff makes it to television, and not just online.
The L word was and is, always going to be a monumental historical epic for lesbians and bisexuals and transexuals in televison entertainment. I heart the L word!!!
