New Moon was the one book in the series that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I read it. Not to say I didn't love the other novels, New Moon just kept my emotions on edge and actually pushed me to tears. In my opinion, it was the most emotional book in the series.

This movie did a terrible injustice to the book, and after walking out of the theater, I thought to myself, "I've just seen the worst movie of the year." Many around me voiced the same sentiment verbally. It didn't translate the utter hopelessness of the story and never left me with that "that just happened!" feeling. I felt detached and skeptical throughout the entire film.

Kristen Stewart's terrible acting actually took me out of the movie and all I could concentrate on was her voice that lacked the emotional inflection necessary, and her incessant lip biting and blinking. Ashley Greene did considerably better in Twilight, I was very disappointed by her terrible acting.

Rob Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, and supporting actors and actresses such as Michael Welch and Anna Kendrick did their jobs with their roles which ranged from the dramatic side of Jacob, to the humorous, sarcastic side of Jessica. The scenes involving the Volturi were stunning, I must say. Michael Sheen did a wonderful job as Aro and I was pleasantly surprised by Dakota Fanning who's Jane was dead on, without speaking she was able to translate the ruthlessness of the character. I will not complain AT ALL about the two gorgeous main actors showing off their assets, but there are movie posters out there that will suffice. But seriously, the only reason I would buy this movie is to watch R.Patz and T.Lay over and over again, but even I'm not that desperate.
