I was disappointed with the movie. I foremost ordered it because I wanted a movie in German, not because of the actors in it. It was German alright, but that was about all I liked. So this schoolteacher goes to Turkey to follow the girl of his dreams and all sorts of bizare things happen to him on the way. This spontaneous girl Juli accompanies him on the way and wants him to fall in love with her instead, which of course, he eventually does. Storyline is okay, but the whole movie is just a mess. The director tried too hard to make it hip, modern and fun, that somehow it simply is not. Christine Paul just doesn't fit the part she's playing, maybe it's her age, maybe because she never seems to get comfortable with her part, and Moritz Bleibtreu really isn't that cute and one never gets the chance to really like any of the characters. It ends up being a mess one watches from the distance. I was glad when the movie was over an I am not planning on watching it again, so if anyone wants my copy, let me know.
