After many many years sitting on the Weinstien brothers shelf...the return of Micky Rourke to the spotlight has given fans of John Madden, Elmore Leneord, and gritty crime drama a chance to see this near masterpiece.  The orignal film, slated to come out in 2005 was a more robust film, with scenes with Johnny Knoxxville of Jackass fame that had the internet buzzing.  Unfortunately none of those scenes are in this version of the movie.  This movie is of a hitman who takes an apprentice and attempts to keep his life from falling apart..like his brothers.  Rourke is great ( and in my opinion always delivers) Gordon Levitt ( Cobra Commander in this years G.I. JOE film) is simply brilliant as a non thinking ner' do well, and with Diane Lane, Rosario Dawson, Thomas Jane adding to major support...this movie would have to completely miss the mark to suck.  Fortunately for us, it hits the mark...even if the target was slightly altered befor it's release...if it ever comes out as a directors cut...it is a must buy.
