I'm pretty out of shape after years of graduate school and no exercise. My wife bought this video recently, so I thought I'd try out our inexpensive investment before forking over big $$$ to a gym. It's great!!! I get a fantastic full-body workout with this DVD... The instructor gives you variations on the exercises in case you need to increase the level of difficulty (the exercises are hard enough for me without the variations). Verbal prompts about using correct posture and body positioning are also helpful. The power stretch segment is excellent--I've been involved in competitive sports/track & field for years but I still learned some new flexibility techniques here! This DVD is budget friendly... all you need to get going are hand weights (I picked up a 40 lb. adjustable dumbbell set). After starting with a single workout per day, to get my body used to exercising again, I now do all 5 workouts in a single session, 3 days per week. On my off days I take an exercise walk/hike on the treadmill. Getting stronger, more coordinated, and more flexible each time (and losing extra body fat)...very satisfied!!!
