I watched this DVD today, with some trepidation since I found the movie almost unbearable at the theater. I am a huge fan of the book and the deviation from the book by the screenplay was inexplicable, kind of like the butchery done in "The Firm". Hint to Hollywood: If you make a movie from a best-selling book, don't let a screenwriter hack it to bits; maybe the author knew what he was doing when he wrote it. 
Most of the plotholes and logical inconsistencies pointed out here in other reviews were dealt with in the book. Many of them are still present in the movie, but this is not the version shown in theaters. The DVD cover states that it has been edited, and it has, to good effect. 
I'm still trying to pin down exactly what was cut/re-edited/added, but overall I enjoyed the movie twice as much on DVD. Maybe because I have lower expectations now or because it's on a smaller screen, but if you hated it in the theaters you may want to try it again.
And please don't compare this with Lynch's "Dune". No amount of re-editing will ever put BE on my top 10 list.
