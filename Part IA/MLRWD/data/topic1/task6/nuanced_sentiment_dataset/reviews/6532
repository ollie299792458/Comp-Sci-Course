You can either watch this movie while flipping through your manual of authentic WWII gear and tactics to find the flaws -

Or you can imagine yourself as a very young man with 6 weeks of basic training shipped to Europe to face a still very deadly Nazi army.

This movie will get under your skin.  And yes, give me three days of front line experience, hand me a flame thrower of any kind (fire hose or not) and tell me to destroy an artillery position and it is entirely realistic to assume that I will scream like an idiot and possibly wet myself in the process.

The first person point of view delivered by the script and cameras went way beyond most big screen war epics to bring me into the cold, damp fear of comabt.

If you're a WWII film buff - you know you're going to watch it.  Just try to park the "wheel chair general" mentalilty and you'll come out alright.

Then tell me that the veteran German NCO leading the patrol in your front doesn't make you want to run home to mamma.

If you want the typical GI Joe genre - watch the old 40's and 50's war films. This picture has some good points to make.  The bloody dog tags smeared on a Major's breast by a shocked American Lieutenant is worth the price of admission.
