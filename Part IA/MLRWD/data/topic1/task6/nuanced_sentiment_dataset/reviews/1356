I have not gotten far enough to actually watch this movie...  but I wanted to let everyone know that there are 3 discs in this set - not 4 as stated.  And when I went to add this movie to my ultraviolet digital collection I got an error page at flixster.  I already have both accounts up and working and managed to add a family member for my collection (many headaches involved in dealing with these sites) so I know how to do this.  They just don't have the page up and working on the day that the movie released.  And since I'm taking the time to write this I will also say that the streaming of ultraviolet digital copies on an I-pad stutters and the video quality isn't as good as I-tunes digital copies that I have.  Hopefully they will put better copies in the cloud and I have not yet downloaded the film to a device and tried watching it that way.  Also, the flixster app in the roku box will not allow you to access your collection yet, hopefully that's in the works as well.  This whole experience feels very beta to me.  And they could get some customer service phone numbers for people who are having problems.

Edited to add:  I found an alternative link that worked for adding this movie to your collection: flixster.com/ultraviolet/771205892/
