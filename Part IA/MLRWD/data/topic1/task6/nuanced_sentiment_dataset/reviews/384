Jarmusch does some interesting things with Ghost Dog, a solidly artistic film, but a similar film, Le Samourai by Jean-Pierre Melville is an incredible film and a masterpiece in cinema.  Jarmusch uses some of the same themes that Melville used; a romantic and unrealistic look at a professional killer; an old-fashioned protagonist who cannot survive in the modern world; existentialist thought.  However, Melville managed to create a more subtle approach to his film, creating a different (and in my opinion, superior) approach to all of his themes.  Jarmusch has Ghost Dog (the title character) explain to an Italian Gangster what Bushido is, and has Whittaker continuously quote from Hagakure.  Jarmusch feels that he has to explain all of the underlying themes, that his audience needs to have everything clarified; this stands in contrast with the Eastern philosophy of restraint and minimalism. Melville however, presents the samurai aspect of Jef Costello (the protagonist) through subtle character development, and the Hare-Kiri at the end of the film.  Melville captures the contrasting elements of Jef--a lone schizophrenic--with much more restraint and subtlety than Jarmusch; Jef's dialog is minimal, his face a mask that betrays no emotion (which is very appropriate to the etiquette of a samurai and the tradition of saving face.)  Of course these two films are different, both directors do great things; but if you liked Ghost Dog (which I did) or even if you didn't, definitely check out Le Samourai.
