I am so agitated after renting this movie last night, I had to google the reviews and see what other people were saying about it. I am not only frustrated because it left a lot of unanswered questions, but because the story has you believing that David Callaway (played by Robert De Niro) is doing one thing (i.e., when Elizabeth (played by Elisabeth Shue) arrives with daisies for Emily, he is listening to music with headphones and doesn't hear her come into their house), when in actuality, he is acting as his alter ego.  You've gotta wonder, so did he imagine that he was listening to music as Elizabeth headed up the stairs for Emily's room, or was he in Emily's room when Elizabeth entered the room, hiding in Emily's closet, playing Charlie, David's alter ego. This stupid movie just pulls the rug from under your feet, and they purposely try to direct you to thinking that the so-called imaginary friend is something supernatural (i.e., from a take when Emily enters the room behind the hall closet and finds an old empty rusty bed and personal belongings of the previous occupant of the house).

I feel like I was cheated. And, I have one question for actor Robert De Niro:  What were you thinking when you accepted this script?  I am sometimes so astonished when high level actors accept an acting position with a lame storyline!

My advice to others:  Don't waste another buck on the decade's worst movie.
