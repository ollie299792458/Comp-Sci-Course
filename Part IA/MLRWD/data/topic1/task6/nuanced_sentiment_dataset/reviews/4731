Gohatto is the law, or the code. In this magnificent piece from the master of cinema Oshima Nagisa, Gohatto means something like a marshal law. With or without knowledge of the Shinsengumi, the movie offers plenty to viewers who like plots based upon samurai stories. However, instead of the fighting scenes on the battle fields like most of the stereotypical samurai movies, this one is ever so contriving about the human within the samurai with their physical and spiritual projections towards life, death and sex. Kano was portrayed as an utterly handsome youth recruited as a new member of the militia, who was inevitably attracted by a number of other militia members. Whirled within all these conflicting feelings among the wooers, Kano appeared to be composed and cold, with a sole goal towards the "right to kill". Tashiro, the rumored only lover of Kano, was suspected of killing another samurai, Yuzawa, who courted Kano as well and assaulted sergeant Yamazaki. Commando Kondo ordered him to be executed by the hands of Kano with captain Hijikata and lieutenant Soji watching afar. The movie ends with a surreal setting of the wilderness, with drizzling rains and smoky air where Soji and Hijikata exchanged their premise about love among men. Kano was finally able to execute Tashiro and retreated, likely with Soji. With his narration, Hijikata objected the evil behind Kano's beauty which was not only to woo the men in the militia, but also to lead the wish to violate the samurai codes. Stymied a beautifully blossomed cheery tree in one swift swing of his sword, Hijikata's mind was made to crush the beauty so as to preserve the sacred code of samurai.
