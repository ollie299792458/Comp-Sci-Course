The first thing anyone will notice about this film is Christian Bale's emaciated frame. He lost over 60 pounds to perform this role and the scenes of him shirtless are rather grotesque, yet effective to his character. His acting I must say is superb, he truly delivers a wide range of emotions - fury, bewilderment, passive satisfaction, the whole nine yards.

The directing is also excellent, the entire movie is shot in soft colors and lighting, which gives it a mellow, yet ominous feel. The symbolism is heavy, featuring repeated symbols in different forms. The movie has an atmosphere of urgent tranquility which drags the viewer into the paranoid state of Trevor Reznik, the main character.

My only qualm about this flick, is that it reminds me of much of the last decade's hip indie thriller plotlines. I don't want to give too much away, but you kind of have to push movies like Fight Club, American Psycho, Memento, Pi, Following, etc, out of your mind in order to truly enjoy it without an annoying sense of de ja vu. Certain points of the movie become like a mishmash of these aforementioned films... It also maintains a Hitchcockian vibe throughout with its desperate, schizoid portrayal of the protagonist.

Sparing this it is a stylish, engrossing film which hits the mark. I recommend before watching this film to pretend you had never seen the films I previously mentioned, and it will be much more enjoyable. Otherwise the movie could become like a cycling of cliche questions concerning a disturbed mind...
