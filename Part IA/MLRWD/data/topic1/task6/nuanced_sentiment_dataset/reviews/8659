We loved "Old School" Volume One, other than the amusing assertion they are always making that this material is "unfit for today's preschooler." Volume 2 contains a similar message, though I honestly can't see why. I presume it may have something to do with "political correctness." If, however, the producers are concerned about being PC, I would like to know why they choose the opening episode of this series to be Episode "666"? I'm not a numerologist, but it certainly freaked me out as the show opens with the words, "Sesame Street" and then "666" appears under it with no explanation. At first I wondered if this had always been a part of the title and I hadn't noticed it as a child. Then, I searched the inserts and found that this was merely the Episode # they had chosen from Season 6. Considering that in the broader American culture, this number along with Friday the 13th is held as tabu and generally avoided, I see no reason why they couldn't have selected another episode or edited the opening scene or added some introductory words on what exactly we were seeing on the screen. If we have really progressed so much that this material is "old school" for "nostalgic purposes", then I would have thought the editors would have a bit more taste, sensitivity, and care for others. I give it three stars for that reason. I was not warned about that little suprise or I would not have purchased it on principle. I'm not about making fun of someone else's concern or weakness. To me, that's the real "old school." Buyers be forewarned.
