I'm currently reading this graphic novel from which this movie was based upon so this review is strictly from my impression of the movie alone. Again as I mentioned in my review of "XMen 2" this is a movie to be seen on the big screen.
I saw this movie the same day I saw "Terminator 3" which I was disappointed in so I guess it all depends on where your mind is when you see movies. 
The individual introduction of each of the characters was "fun" I absolutely thought they selected the appropriate cast for each of these roles. From Alan Q. to the Invisible Man each of these actors were very convincing as their own UNUSUAL brand of Heroes and their many talents are only really shown I believe a total of 2 times in this movie. In this it reminds me of "X Men 2" each character only had a few instances to show their gifts/talents. The story is probably plausible for that era {Victorian Age} but maybe hard for the youngins of today to grasp. Captain Nemo's ship was Magnificent although I did wonder how was a ship so large able to get into the canals of Venice???? 
I gave it 3 1/2 Stars for the cinematography, the special effects and the casting. It is worth the price of a matinee, will I add this to my at home collection..... probably not this is one best seen on the big screen so if you are not viewing it in that content then you don't get the full effect. Not for young viewers there are some blood scenes with the Mina Harker that are pretty graphic and this guy takes all of Hydes potion and is pretty scary so if you have kids who suffer from nightmares over stuff like this I would steer clear of it.
