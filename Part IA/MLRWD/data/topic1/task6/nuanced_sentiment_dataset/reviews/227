This film adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel Emma is, in my opinion, the worst of the four. The filmmakers used a very exaggerated, hyperactive Hollywood style which really undermines Austen storytelling. It leaves the viewer every moment expecting something more 'exciting' to happen but of course because it's an Austen story, the excitement is not in large or epic events but in the small every day interactions between characters and in the things that happen that really can only affect themselves and not society at large. The result of this dichotomy was that it moved at a snail's pace when it tried to 'act' as if it were a racehorse, and I and my four friends who watched it, none of whom were familiar with Austen like I am, were all bored to the point of starting to FALL ASLEEP! We couldn't even finish it but turned it off a little over halfway through.

My personal favorite adaptation is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767020308">Emma (A&E, 1997)</a>, although the brand new one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XTBE6K">Emma (2009)</a> is excellent as well. The old BBC version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244F64">Emma (BBC, 1972)</a> is forgettable and not worth watching since we have these other two excellent versions to pick from.
