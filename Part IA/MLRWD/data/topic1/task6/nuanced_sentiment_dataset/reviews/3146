I can't quite recall from where i heard this, but legend has it that Quentin Tarantino decided on John Travolta for Pulp Fiction based on this role. If it's true or not, i like to believe it. This film is one of those rare moments of brilliance in cinema. Forgive the somewhat pretentious nature of my review , but i love this film. I agree that it is similar to a Hitchcock film, as De Palma is often known for, but without some of the same examples like the the annoying cameo. This film is a great thriller. Even though Nancy Allen does sort of do the ditsy blonde role that we've all seen before, there's more of an approachable and welcome innocence about her. You're truly heartbroken when Lithgow's character attacks her.
Technically, this film is beautifully shot and who cares if you're overtly aware of it. It's a visual medium and camera movement is a very large aspect of it. Obviously, this film is about sound and even though i'm quite surprised and maybe even a little disappointed that there is no 5.1 mix, it sounds amazing. I bought this years ago on laserdisc and that transfer was atrocious. I rented the dvd and it was just as dismal, so this Criterion Collection version is what I unknowingly have wanted for years. More "lost classics" like this should get the treatment they deserve.
For all of who have not seen this and might be a fan of Travolta, see this and add this to the short list of his great perfomances like Pulp Fiction.
