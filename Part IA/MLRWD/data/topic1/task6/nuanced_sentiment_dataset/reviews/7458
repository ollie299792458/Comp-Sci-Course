Giving yet more fodder to the belief that women only want to be barefoot and pregnant, 'Lindsey' throws away a, long-sought and fought for, promotion in order to be with a man.  A man who could have found any number of women who are as fanatical about the Red Sox as he is.  But no.  It's not enough for 'Ben' to utterly ignore 'Lindsey' except for sex, (even when she is knocked unconscious by a foul ball, he ignores her until the caught ball is celebrated).  Oh ha ha ha she has to have a CT scan of her head.  Big deal.

Even though 'Ben' could have hooked up with any of the women who knew him well because he held lifetime seats at Fenway, they weren't good enough for him.  My take on this is that he didn't like women at all, and that it was only by seeking women who would reject him, until, that is, he found the "right" one whose life he could destroy, so that he could find balance.  I don't see this as much different from psychotic behavior -- (someone who knows films well, and writes about them, could give many examples).

That this kind of movie would be made in the 21st century is nauseating.  That Drew Barrymore agreed to be in it - - even moreso. That so many people claim to have enjoyed this movie is very, very disturbing.  Good thing 'Ben' was able to make a 'whole' woman out of 'Lindsey'.  I hope that lots of employers watch this movie because that will give them added incentive to only promote men, and to pay men more than women for the same job -- why not?  The women just want to get knocked up.

We would all have been happier if this was solely a movie about the Red Sox and the love of baseball.
