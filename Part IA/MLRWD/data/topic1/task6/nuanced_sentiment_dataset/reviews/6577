This movie is not for everyone. The jokes are base, there is a good bit of slapstick, and if these folks really were cops, then we'd all be in a whole lot of trouble. But through it all, the characters really are charming, except for Trudy who is always disturbing.

The Reno sheriff's department is invited to a police convention in Miami. By a twist of fate, they become the only police available to cover the city. This is their story. It is a story fraught with Jell-o wrestling, mystery tattoos, exploding whales, topless beaches, and an Al Pacino wannabe. Cameos include Danny DeVito, The Rock, and Paul "Pee Wee" Herman.

I am familiar with the TV series but I watched the movie in the company of those who were not. We all laughed and often at the same time. But I also know people who have watched the TV series and are "not amused." The movie is everything the series is plus sex and explicit language. But as I said, it is able to maintain its charm and humanity.

Oh, and it made me laugh way harder than did No Country for Old Men and that counts for a lot in my book.
