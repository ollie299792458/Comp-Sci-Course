Ok so this is another underlooked item in the Best Buy $5 bin. And as far as action movies go this may not be my #1, but this is insanely awesome! I think that if they ended the movie after the first hour, it would have been better though. And, here is why ( i will try not to spoil the movie) basically, the movie starts and is non-stop action until it climax's (with a knife against a man's throath and rambo saying I could easilly kill all of you) and then after that it becomes less awesome. Personnaly though I don't care because it is so intense, and so .... I meen rambo has a knife ( a big knife) and can easilly live in the woods like hes in Vietnam. And he has about 6 men chasing him in the woods, and only one of them thinks its a bad idea, (Haratio Kane from CSI). That being said, they know who he is and still want to kill him.  So, the vengeance is there and I feel like rambo should peel there flesh off bit-by-bit when he gets the chance, and when he doesn't it doesn't make him less of a man. I don't understand his choices though, and maybe I am just too far gone and want to see some heads roll. But, not very many heads roll. And that is what I will say, watch this and be amazaed at Sylvester Stallone in all his bad-ass glory, just don't be too upset when the ending is kind of a let down. A lot of action, and a lot of blood, and even some scenes where rambo is sewing up open wounds, and splinting broken bones. No detail is left out in these scenes, so maybe the faint at heart stay away from this flick? all you go-hards grab this, and I would check out best buy first (especially if you have best buy gift cards)
