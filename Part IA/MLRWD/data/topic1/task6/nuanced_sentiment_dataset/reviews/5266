I have owned this movie for several years and never could talk myself into watching it until recently.  When I finally watched it I understood why it never made it big at the box office.

Several people gave this movie five stars and to that I have to say, "To each his own."  I was slightly less thrilled.  Yeah, it was okay.  I got a few chuckles out of it but I have to say that if you are looking for some good belly laughs this movie is not for you.  The idea of using old movie clips was cute at first but got tiring towards the end.  The plot had to go through so many complications and twists and turns in order to use all of the old clips that it became almost impossible to follow.  This is a detective movie but when the end came I really didn't care who dunit. I really don't think that this is one of Steve Martin's best.  I found it mediocre.  If you want some good laughs try "Blue Heaven" or "The Jerk".  Now that's comedy!

Would I recommend it to someone?  I really don't know.  Every body is different and has different tastes.  For instance: I can't understand the popularity of Dane Cook.  I can't stand him!

To those people who liked this movie - good for you.  I'm seriously glad you did.  I'm glad I finally watched it but I won't watch it again.
