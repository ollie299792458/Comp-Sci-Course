I have watched the movie and i must say that i was not overly excited about it.

The punch of the movie is spoiled from the get go because you already know what is going to happen to some of the characters in the film.

The author(s) and director were trying to redeem Admiral cain the movie by revealing what had happened to her since the initial cylon attack and why she did most of the things she did as explained when she first appeared in the season.To me the main idea was to use a Cain wanna be scapegoat (Shaw) to redeem Cain but she ends up being really unlikeable like Cain or even worse because of the storyline.

The movie has it's good moments nonetheless but it falls flat and has no real tension to it. The pegasus characters still stay unmemorable and you really do not feel any pity for them at all even though the intent was to shed some light on their clouded past.

A lot of the shows from the series are way better than this movie.
We will have to wait for season 4 to get he real deal on the next adventures of the people we came to adore in the TV series.
