I believe this is a film that everyone should see because it demonstrates two things: 1) The ability of film as an artform to invoke strong emotional reactions in its audience; 2) The American ideal that the truth can be heard and not overcome by rampant corruption and powerful interests.  While this may not always happen in America, deep down, no matter how cynical we may feel, we HOPE that it can happen...

While you may be tempted to decry Jimmy Stewart's character's idealism and naivity in this movie, this movie powerfully demonstrates that our unwillingness to expose political wrongs and stand up for what we believe may be a "safe" bet, but it also ensures that the corruption machine never stops. With half of eligible voters staying away from the polls on election days, this movie couldn't be more important, 60 years after it was released.

Outside the political aspect of this movie...it couldn't be better acted. The romantic aspects of this film are a welcome respite from the political realities. This film is a great example of how a powerful script and suburb acting & directing can come together into a masterpiece. If you aren't already a fan of Jimmy Stewart, you also discover masterful acting by Claude Rains and Jean Arthur. For a movie with similar undertones to " Mr. Smith..." see George Steven's "Talk of the Town" with Cary Grant and Jean Arthur.
