If you like white punks using tons of profanity, this is your Citizen Kane. Of course, you might need to steep your ears in Holy Water for few days. My only wonder was why they didn't hire Cheech Marin to bark in front of a Vegas whorehouse like he did at the T.T. Biker Bar in From Dusk Till Dawn. Too bad gents... I guess what happens at the T.T. stays at the T.T.. That posh coating of circa "the tweens" on the original classic aside, this version is rather fun, full of great special effects and even has some reasonably good acting for a few frames, minus Toni. "Oh Muriel, you're horrible". Kudos to David Tennant that makes an excellent Peter Vincent. Also surprising is young Anton Yelchin pulling off a decent, but not great, Chuck Brewster. But comparing any performance in this to those by William Ragsdale, Stephen Geoffreys, and Roddy McDowall in the original is like comparing fine wine to Thunderbird. However once in a while that's not so bad. Do I sound like a purist? Well... not really. Just don't "call me Evil". I love vampire movies and this is going to be a proud addition to my collection.
