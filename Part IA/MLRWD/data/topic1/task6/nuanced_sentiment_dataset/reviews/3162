Just a quick note to the people that are still doubting whether or not they should purchase the Taiwanese DVD: I can assure you all it is of excellent quality. The image quality is great and every bit as good as any of the (remastered) classics released in the US and Europe (like Spartacus, for example). The image is full-screen, but like many said before, this movie is from before the Rotoscope era. The box mentions the movie is B&W as well, but this is not the case. The DVD is in full glorious color.

The (Chinese) subtitles will only pop in when you select them in the menu, otherwise the image is subtitle-free. The sound is good as well, albeit 2.0 stereo only.

One catch though: apparently there are multiple versions of this DVD. The DVD I received looks nothing like the one pictured by Amazon; it has a MUCH more beautiful cover with Taylor and Kerr in a romantic pose... as a matter of fact, it's one of the prettiest DVD covers I've ever seen. Thus, I can only tell you that this version (purchased from a Taiwanese seller through Amazon) is the top quality version I received, I don't know about the version pictured on this site.

The text on the box is in English as well: there are no Korean characters on it whatsoever. The only thing that gives away it's Asian origins is the fact that the DVD packaging is slightly larger (I have more Chinese and Korean DVD's that have the same format). But that is no biggie: it only gives the gorgeous cover more chance to shine.
