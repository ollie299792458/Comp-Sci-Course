As a long time reader of the Destroyer series I find it difficult to seperate the books from the movie. It's obvious the the producers wanted to make a good "Destroyer" movie but unfortunatly their efforts fell a little short. The choice of the villain is particularly questionable. A crooked defence contractor, no matter how devious, just seems to be contrary to the kind of villain that Remo should have to contend with. By comparison the books always had great villains, both human and non-human, who were more than capable of giving both Remo and Chiun a run for their money. On the positive side I liked the training sequences and the way that the "mechanics" of Sinanju worked. I imagine if this movie was done today the action and fight sequences would probably be similiar to what's in the Matrix movies. Fred Ward does an admirable job of playing Remo but in the end it is Joel Grey's portrayal of Chiun that steals the show. The Remo/Chiun relationship is pretty much on target. The books had the luxury of letting Remo and Chiun's father/son dynamic develope over time but the movie had to do it in a much shorter timespan. Wlford Brimley's take on Harold W. Smith doesn't match what I imagined the character to be like but that shouldn't matter to anyone who hasn't read any of the books. All in all it's an enjoyable movie but I recommend the books to anyone who wants more of Remo and Chiun.
