At first sight, this may look like a movie about reincarnation, far from our bed. No! It is an excellent explanation of how Buddhism can be "the answer", also to people in the West. We see a Tibetan monk looking for the reincarnation of his master who died 8 years ago. He seems to find the reincarnated old monk in the form of 8-year old Jesse, a typical American kid. Now,  Jesse's typical American family thinks that Buddhism is weird, "what have we got to do with that?", and they kind of want to ignore the Tibetan monk. The Americans have their own life, no place for Buddhism there. Then all kinds of things start happening in the Americans' lives: the man's partner goes bankrupt, he later kills himself, etc. That is when, suddenly, the American man sees that in his way of life, he has no way of dealing with these things, and that Buddhism on the other hand is exactly talking about these things that happen in everybody's lives: loss, change, suffering, death and how to deal with them. That is where the 2 story lines beautifully merge into one story: the Westerners see that Buddhism talks about their life in Seattle as much as about life in the Himalayas. The old monk can now safely die, his mission accomplished. In fact at that point in the movie the 2 stories also merge with the third story line, the re-telling of the life of the historical Buddha. Thus, the life of Buddha, the crisis in the life of the Western people, and the story of the Tibetan monks and their search for meaning, all become one. One. The last scene of the movie says it all: the American child (wise like a little Buddha), floats the Tibetan monk's ashes on the river in Seattle, WA. His mother is looking on, smiling, pregnant with a new baby. Another little buddha on the way. Hmmm, didn't the old monk just die? ...
