best horror movies ever. Start with the worst. 1) acting. Never have I ever seen acting as bad as this. One scene where the police detectives are talking at the police station one of the actors is reading off the script off his desk. One character named Tony couldn't cry if someone else cried for him. Mrs. Freemont acts like she is trying out for a high school play every time she opens her mouth. 2) very bad screen play. The story line was written for creatures with very low I.Q's If anyone can't follow this one. Something is very wrong here. 3) bad directing for the actors. One woman at the first comes in her apartment, turns on her radio, hear about a bunch of women getting murdered then instead of leaving the radio on so she can hear music she turns it off and goes and gets in her bubble bath so the killer however he gets in her apartment can go to her and chop her up while she is bathing.  The radio was ONLY turned on for us the people watching the movie so we would know what the plot is )s Now for the best. Blood, Gore, Blood, Gore and more Blood, Gore. That is where 95% of the movies budget went. For its time a classic. I love the film for that. H.G. Lewis was master of gore. five stars for blood and gore only
