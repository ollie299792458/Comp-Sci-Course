I'm a big fan of historical romances and dramas, but normally I'll watch them once and be done with it. "The Young Victoria", on the other hand, has a certain unique quality that makes me want to watch it over and over. Though it deals with the usual complex political intrigue one would expect in a film about Queen Victoria, the story moves along quickly and the scenes are compact and well edited. So you won't find any long-winded dialogue scenes or slow spots. Besides that, the film is a joy to look at - the costumes are like eye candy and the cinematography is delightful (notice the close-ups of the glasses and people at the King's birthday banquet).

Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention what is probably one of the best on-screen romances ever. The relationship and marriage of Victoria and Albert is portrayed so tenderly you can't help but root for them both. You'd be hard pressed to find better chemistry between two actors on screen.

You won't find a heavy Best Picture Oscar-caliber film here, but you will find a pleasant film you will want to watch over and over.
