From the start you can tell this movie is based on a book. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but you can tell by how the exposition is delivered and the characters' introduction. The whole movie feels like boring exposition until the climax. The rising action is so boring it doesn't count as a rising action. The climax is where the main character is captured and dies. That is the last scene of the movie and the only worthwhile part. If you watch the alternate ending you'll find a better ending that won't make you scream at the TV, "That's it!" There was never proper advertising for this movie that actually advertised the movie; the advertising only advertised that Nicolas Cage was in the movie. People often pick movies based on who stars in it, which is what a friend of mine did when she picked out this movie to watch, but this movie absolutely proves you can't do that. You assume that a star like Nicolas Cage would pick a movie that has a good story and a good movie overall since he would be the star of it, but that is wrong. This movie is not worth watching at all. I only wonder what Nicolas Cage saw in this movie that made him star in it because I honestly can't see what it could possibly be
