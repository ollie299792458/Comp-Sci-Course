Quite simply the best Disney film ever made! Yes I've read many reviews by the so called experts telling us about how weak it is compared to Mary Poppins, well 'rubbish' is what I say. This film is a league above Poppins. Its so much more enjoyable to see the brilliant (now late) David Tomlinson play a good guy as opposed to the villain in Poppins and especially The Love Bug. Its one of those films that seems to be over before its started, even though its almost 2 hours long, the time just flows away when watching it. And as they say, time flys when you're enjoying yourself. The children are suberb, the animation is excellent, the special effects are extremely convincing and the spells are addictive. Come on now kids.. you can't tell me you werent shouting "..traguna mercoides tracorem satus dee.." at the top of your voice in the vein hope that it might work?.. LOL! My final appraisal has to go to the marvellous Angela Lansbury who's suberb performance in this film is whole key to its success. She's prim, she's proper, she's English, but most of all she's a true gem of actress! Her talent is wasted on too many highly predictable Murder She Wrotes!
