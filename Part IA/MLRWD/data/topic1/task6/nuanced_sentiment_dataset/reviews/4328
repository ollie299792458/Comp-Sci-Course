My father married my mum when he was 24 and she was 15 in 1941.  Today this would be considered molestation.  What Roman Polanski did with this girl was totally orchestrated by her mother and possibly her.  This girl could have sucked the chicken off of a bone.  Like Monica Lewinsky, she knew what she was doing in order to get her career jump started.  If I had been that girl, I would have been so privileged to have been "sodomised" by Polanski that I would have thanked my lucky stars.  Those who are calling him rubbish are simply prudish or envious.  With all this man had been through in his life, what could one expect that he would try to escape his pain.  He is brilliant and truly an artist.  France is lucky to have him and I would have done the same as he with that fraud Rittenband for a "Judge."

This film is so wonderful that I immediately ordered a copy after watching it someplace else.  There are many great nostalgic photos of him and Sharon in their beginning, of the others surrounding them, and of the time that was.  This film is insightful as to the truth behind the case I had always heard about and never really examined.  One can see the pain on his face and know that his life has been as extraordinary as his art.  God bless Roman Polanski.
