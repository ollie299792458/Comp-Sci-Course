The Shield is one of the most gripping shows on television and Season 4 is no exception!  It was so tempting just to watch all the episodes in one sitting - I don't know how I manage when I have to wait for the new episodes to air on TV!  There are plenty of other cop shows on TV but the thing that stands out to me about this show is the character development; shows like Law & Order are so episodic and really neglect to delve into the main characters, but in The Shield the characters seem more real (instead of archetypes) and the longer plot line is way more compelling than an episodic format.  Furthermore, the writers challenge social norms and might even make you question our own opinions regarding law enforcement.  This show has everyting - action, depth, and a killer plot!

The best part about Season 4 was without a doubt the introduction of Glenn Close as Captain Monica Rawlings.  Who would've known she could succesfully take on this kind of role?  A pleasant surprise!  Having Monica and Vic work together was an unexpected but really interesting story arc, and definitely my favorite part of Season 4.  Shane's misadventures in the vice unit will also keep viewers riveted.  This may be the fourth season but the show is still going strong and doesn't feel old or stale at all.
