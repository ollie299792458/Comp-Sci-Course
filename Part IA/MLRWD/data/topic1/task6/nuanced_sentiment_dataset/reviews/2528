Let me tell you what you already know: James Marsden and Rod Lurie are not Dustin Hoffman and Sam Peckinpah.  But if there wasn't an original "Straw Dogs" to compare this to, this new film would be a serviceable, multi-layered thriller with some interesting performances that never decides if it was a drama or a psychological thriller or a blood-soaked home invasion film reminiscent of the "Last House on the Left" remake.

Unfortunately, the original does exist and its capturing of the zeitgeist and culture clash between classes was much more pronounced.  Yes, Lurie provides a suitable stand-in with these small town proto-white trash caricatures, but Marsden never feels like "the other."  In the original, his accent will always betray him.  He'll be American forever.  In the new one, he's just the geeky kid from school getting picked on by the bullies.  What separates them isn't the same kind of impossible gulf.

What also hurts the new one is a surprise.  Kate Bosworth gives a much stronger performance than the original's Susan George.  What worked in the original was that Susan George wasn't that strong, a delicate flower that Hoffman's character felt he was protecting.  You could understand why her personality type found something in Hoffman's intellectual.  In the remake, Bosworth is very much her own woman and her attraction to Marsden is somewhat amorphous.  I don't know what she saw in him, really, which weakens what should be the character that the entire story turns on.

One last thing.  The entire plotline of the mentally handicapped man, David Warner in the original, Dominic Purcell here, feels tacked on as if it had to be there because it was in the original and Lurie was afraid of catching heat for excising it.  It serves no real purpose here.
