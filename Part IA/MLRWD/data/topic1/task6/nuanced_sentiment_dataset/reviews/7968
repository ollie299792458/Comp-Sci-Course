"We Were Soldiers" is better than "Black Hawk Down" mainly because the characters were more fully developed and we actually care about what happened to them.  The combat scenes were as intense but I felt more engaged by the unfolding tragedy.  BHD is also a great war movie, but it seemed to rely on more special effects to create it's impact.  There is a review here that picks the movie apart, but I don't believe anyone will care about the small points the author is trying to make.  Who really cares if Col. Moore invented the tactics?  And it's always easy to criticize, after the fact, the tactics that were used in the battle.  It was a new type of warfare, and it was the first time those tactics were used to that extent.  What also made this an enjoyable movie is that it wasn't made from an ugly American type viewpoint.  The film makers actually believe there is something good and decent about America, and that shined through in the movie.  After what happened to this country on Sept. 11, we certainly needed it.
