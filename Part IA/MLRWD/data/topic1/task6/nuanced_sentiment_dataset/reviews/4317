When I first saw this movie back in 72/73 it was the next big western to the wild bunch but now I must admit it was quite boring in parts and the violent scenes well were a bit kitsch, I mean the Indians looked like the Hollywood stereotypes all clean and the outfit of Ms Bergen's looked tailor made. The film centered around two shootouts the Indian attack then at the end the white mans massacre a little like the the wild bunch this was centered around two shootouts.I also noticed in the whole time nobody really got that dirty  Candice with her hippy attitude very prominent for that time, their teeth capped and very white and shiny so I personally found that the film lost quite a bit over the years. This is not to say that the film hasn't made its mark in movie history it was a turning point  when it came to show that the Americans weren't nice guys. As always reviews are a personal thing had you asked me the same question 30 odd years ago the answer would be completely different. So I hope I haven't offended anyone but I have seen better westerns.
