to tell the truth the perview for the movie did look stupid but i thought well it might have potental. and it delivered for sure

the movie is about a teenager played by aaron johnson(can not remember his name in the film) who decides to become a real life superhero. even though his first attempt almost killed him. his second try at do gooding got him some natioal prasie and made kick ass the name he gave his persona famous without anyone knowing he is really is of course.it also attacts the attation of hit girl(chloe grace moretz) and big daddy(NICOLAS CAGE)vigilaties who actally know what they are doing Unfortanly also the attation of the local crime boss than he finds himself way over his head.

the movie has great performaces all a round espically moretz who i will give props foe being a cute little killing machine.also johnson and cage( as always) also do a good job. and the action is relentleess and unforgiving which is rare in a major release. desevers its r rating(in fact mathew vaughn who dircted the movie had to fund it with help from indepent investors cause the major studios would take it if he removed hit girl and softed the movie to a pg-13 rating).

so all in all it is kinda like superbad metts the punsiher. it is worth the money
