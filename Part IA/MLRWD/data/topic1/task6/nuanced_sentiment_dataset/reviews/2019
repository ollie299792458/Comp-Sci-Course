The Ladykillers (Alexander Mackendrick, 1955, 97')

Five diverse oddball criminal types planning a bank robbery rent rooms on a cul-de-sac from an octogenarian widow under the pretext that they are classical musicians. The Ladykillers mocks both the criminals and the authorities with its unlikely octogenarian heroine Mrs "lop-sided" Wilberforce.

Ealing's great comedies captured the essence of post-war Britain, both in their evocation of a land once blighted by war, now doggedly and optimistically rising again from the ashes, and in their mordant yet graceful humour. They portray a country with an antiquated class system whose crumbling conventions are being undermined by a new spirit of individual opportunism. Arguably their greatest asset is Alec Guinness, whose multifaceted performances are the keystone upon which Ealing built its biting, often macabre, yet always elegant comedies.

Main titles were: Hue and Cry (1947), Another Shore (1948), Passport to Pimlico (1949), Whisky Galore! (1949), Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), A Run for Your Money (1949), The Magnet (1950), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), The Man in the White Suit (1951), The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953), Meet Mr Lucifer (1953), The Love Lottery (1954), The Maggie (1954), The Ladykillers (1955), Who Done It? (1956), Barnacle Bill (1957), Davy (1957).

In fact, many of the films were built around a repertory group of actors, screenwriters ("All the exuberance of Chaucer without, happily, any of the concomitant crudities of his period"), directors and technicians. Directors were Alexander Mackendrick, Charles Crichton, Robert Hamer, Charles Frend, Anthony Pelissier and Henry Cornelius. Notable actors who became prolific in these films included Stanley Holloway, Alec Guinness, Raymond Huntley and Alastair Sim. A number of actors, such as Philip Stainton and Edie Martin. also appeared recurringly in smaller roles.

Many factors contribute to the success of these films - including fine music scores, uniquely evocative locations (the environs of King's Cross in Ladykillers, for example), and writing that always displays Ealing's unique perspective on British social mores.
