This movie was a rotten piece of vomiteria!  YES....I made up a new word just to describe this sh*&ty film!  It is not worth renting...not worth even 5 minutes of watching!!!  I was so excited about a sequel to the Lost Boys...one of my fave horror movies of all time....I was greatly dissapointed!!!

If the movie was called "Bloodthirsty Surfer Extreme Sports Dudes Gone Wild"....that would sum up this 2 hour lesson in self-torture.

In a nutshell, there are no salvageable aspects of the movie.  Acting was flat, plot...oh wait...there wasn't one...and even the makeup was not engaging or believable.  The actors just feel like fillers...nothing special
about them...their backstories are pointless and do nothing to move the story along.

This movie could have been soo much better!  I mean..they got Tom Welling for the friggin Fog remake...they could have spruced it up for a theatrical release...but instead, Warner Brothers threw it together without any real entertainment value other than the fact that this film shares the same name as the first movie.

Not entertaining even if intoxicated....the only entertainment value that I could see resulting from this film is
heckling with friends....and even then...I would advise finding a 3 dollar bargain bin copy.
