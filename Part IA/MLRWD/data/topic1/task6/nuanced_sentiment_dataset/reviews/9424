Boy, do I agree with the other review: this movie is sooo good, so underrated that it's odd that it wasn't a bigger hit. The known story is: a group of mean, hard criminals go to Las Vegas to rob one of the casinos, the robbery goes fairly well, but they didn't know that the meanest, most badass of them doesn't believe in splitting the money. I have to say that I was surprised by the role of Kevin costner, psychotic characters are very common, violent ones too, but very few of them can come even close to the way Costner looks and acts in this film (there's a scene when he intimidates the guy who was going to clean the money, where you can really feel how threatening he is, how violent and psychotic he could get). Kudos for Kevin, even if he wasn't one of my favorite actors, he is one now. Forget the negative reviews, forget the pseudo-connoisseurs who want to show how clever and witty they are and how ignorant and fool we (audiences) are: this is a great way to spend two hours of thrills and fun, not everything has to be existencial or meaningful, this film is fun, entertainment, and Costner is greater than life here, cooler that any character you can remember. Watch this movie, buy the DVD, you'll be thanking you did. Really.
