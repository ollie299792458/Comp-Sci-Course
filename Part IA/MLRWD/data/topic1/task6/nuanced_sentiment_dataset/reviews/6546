Wow!  Watching this movie was like riding a roller coaster!  There were more ups and downs in this movie than the Loch Nest Monster at Busch Gardens!  This movie starred Ben Affleck and Samuel Jackson.  Ben is the Wall Street lawyer and Samuel is the average guy trying to keep his life and marriage together.  They are both heading for court and get into an accident.  Ben leaves Samuel as he is late for court.  So is Samuel.  Unfortunately, Ben leaves his court papers with Samuel by mistake.  The rest of the movie is the bad things they do to each other to retaliate.  The tension is thick throughout the whole movie as you watch them destroy each others lives.  Watching it unfold you realize how mean people can be to each other and how we can mistreat our fellow man.  Fourtunately in the end each man realizes the harm they are doing and rectify the situation.  Without the positive ending this movie would have fallen short.  But the ending brought it all together!  It's quite a thriller with a great ending!  Give it a try....
