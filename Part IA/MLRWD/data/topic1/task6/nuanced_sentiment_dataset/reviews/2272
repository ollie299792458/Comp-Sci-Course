Hunter Thompson practiced total immersion journalism.  He called this form reporting gonzo journalism.

Hunter Thompson drove to Las Vegas to report on a motorcycle race and ended up writing a story about himself writing a story about a motorcycle race.  If he would have written a conventional report on motorcycle racing it would have been interesting to motorcycle enthusiasts for a few days.  Since he wrote a gonzo story he had a very wide canvas and he used it well to create a classic.

Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro do justice to the outrageous characters created by Hunter S Thompson.  The reader might be turned off by the obstreperous behavior, extreme self indulgence and offensive inconsiderate language.  If you can look past this offensive conduct and you will see that Hunter S Thompson gave us an insight into the American character of the 1970's.
