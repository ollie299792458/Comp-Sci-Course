Granted there are many quacks out there with cures for everything, but this movie stands out in that it clearly demonstrates the test results (cancer) diagnosed by western medicine and doctors and then offers the test results (and patients) after the treatments.  Yes, statistics can lie, and it would be great to see some scientific stats on the cure rates but as the movie points out, pharmaceutical companies would lose out if the diseases they say they try to cure were actually cured.  Do you think Exxon wants to promote solar energy?  Do you think Chrysler wanted to promote mass transit?  Do you think Winston-Salem tobacco wanted it known that their cigarettes were not cool and killed people?  Corporations will not fund studies that question their own products.  Wake up to the profit motive people.  People (and corporations) will threaten and kill to keep their wealth.

I found this movie to be inspiring, especially shot from the viewpoint of a teenager.  While the production itself wasn't a huge budget, the logic, thoughts, and exploration made this an interesting adventure.  If you already have your mind made up that there are no alternative therapies than our traditional medicines I feel sorry for you not having and open mind and for not being able to consider something that might prolong the life of your loved ones.
