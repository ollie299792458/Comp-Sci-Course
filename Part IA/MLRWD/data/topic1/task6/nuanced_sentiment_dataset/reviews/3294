This was actually a very good movie, but it could have been better. The problem is that the adult parts were played by extremely talented and experienced actors and so the course of least resistance was taken: Feature the adults and leave the kids in the background. While I'm sure that it is difficult working with child actors, this movie seemed a little unbalanced in that the adults completely over-whelmed the story. For instance, while the relationship between Ferrell's character and Duvall's character got plenty of attention, the relationship between their sons was all but ignored. This was a rather unique situation. Although Ferrel's and Duvall's sons were the same age, one was the brother of Ferrell's character and the uncle of Ferrell's character's son! Again, it's understandable that the easy way out was taken given the immense talent of the adult actors, but it would have been nice if more attention had been paid to the child characters given this unique situation.

Ditka was a lot of fun in this movie, although he basically just played himself. The bonus features that come with the movie are also worth viewing. All in all, I'd give the movie three stars and a wink and I think most people will find it to be an amusing and easy to enjoy comedy, BUT I still feel that it fell short of what it could have been!
