FIRST OF ALL JAMIE LEE CURTIS RULES....ROCK ON GIRLFRIEND...
 As for Prom Night I have to say it was one heck of a slasher film. Although I like the Halloween movies better, this one did have it's high lights,and it was real simular to that of Halloween in several ways...As for one of the first ways you'll have to see the movie yourself...And in a second way I found my self seeing a little of Laurie Strode in Kim Hammond, hence in the opening scene of Prom Night where  young Kim forgot her Cemestry book, just like the straight  A student of the year Laurie Strode forgot one of her school books in Halloween. Even her personality was almost the same..I kept wanting to see Donald Pleseance as Sam Loomis pop up somewhere...But I have to give Leslie Neslson as the principal of the high school and loving father of Kim Hammond some credit,as for some of the other characters the acting wasn't at it's best although they did a pretty good job of dying I'll give them that..But enough about the simularities..This movie was one that kept me guessing of who the killer was, and it was a shock when revealed...The slashing scenes were sometimes dull in some places since they didn't show you  much of it but you got the point across,as for others they were quite the gastly gut wrenching scream....But it all starts out when a group of young friends are innocently playing a very disturbing game by the name of "KILLERS" when a some what shy and some what unpopular girl wonders on in, and is savagely killed (accidently of course) by this group of taunting pre-teens...But as most horror movies go "they don't want to go to jail" so they all bail and never speak of what really happened..So six years pass and the pre-teens are now pre- adults as they prepare for  one of the high lights of high school their senior prom...But as little do they know...SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED ( gee why does that sound so familar, could it be I Know What You Did Last Summer)...And is now getting their kicks by taking them out Myers style one by one...So if your a fan of Halloween or just a fan of great slasher films this one is a must..It's worth buying but I always recommend renting them first....
