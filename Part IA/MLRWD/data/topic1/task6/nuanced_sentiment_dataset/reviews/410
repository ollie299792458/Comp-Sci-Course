When I saw this movie out on DVD, I grabbed it right away- especially with all the hoopla surrounding the opening of Pearl Harbor.  Although I've seen this movie several times on television, it's been quite awhile since my last viewing.  What has always amazed me with this movie, is the fairness and historical accuracy used in its creation.  The movie's beginning says it has attempted to be historically accurate- which I agree with.  I realize there's a great many people out there who believe FDR "knew" the attack was coming, but I for one, agree with the movie in showing that he did not.  The movie is very good at showing the chaos going on in military Japan, and without going into excruciating detail, depicts the upheavel and in-house fighting going on within the country.  Besides the accuracy, I really like the action scences- the flights of planes, and the ships in the harbor do not look like little toy models or anything along those lines.  Very well done, put together movie, and I recommend it for anyone who has an increased awareness about the battle.
