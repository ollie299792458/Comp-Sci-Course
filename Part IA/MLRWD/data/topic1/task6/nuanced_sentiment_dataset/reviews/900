So, I wasn't expecting much, given how many reviews I read in which this movie was completely panned. But I like Katherine Heigl and had nothing better to do on a lazy Sunday, so I rented it and settled in.
What a total waste of time and money. There are bad romantic comedies, but this one exists in a class of its own.
Gerald Butler, who was sexy as hell in 'Phantom of The Opera,' is supposedly likable as he swaggers around the Sacramento news station with his bloated, drunkard boxer face spouting the most vile crap that would get anyone fired without a second thought. But, we're supposed to believe that because of a primarily male upper management team and the controlling nature of Heigl's character, Butler's disgusting rants are considered funny and cute?
Side note: I love Katherine Heigl to death, but why does she bitch about being typecast as a humorless shrew in romantic comedies? She has the ability to say no to these terrible scripts and one dimensional characters. At the risk of sounding like Butler's character, Katherine, I like you a whole like better if you'd shut up and look pretty.

All in all, this movie is painfully predictable, totally unbelievable and utterly devoid of any laughs.
