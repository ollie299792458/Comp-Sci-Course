When I first saw Superman II as a kid back in the summer of '81, I thought it was great. Superman vs the three villains from Krypton. But as a young 10 year old, I was too young to understand what made a great movie so great or what was 'good acting'. I thought this sequel was better than the original. 
Fast forward to 2001 and I'm all grown up now and how I realize I was so wrong. I still get a kick out of the comic book style fighting scenes and story, but compared to the original Superman II is not as good. Now that I found out about the whole Richard Donner/Salkinds controversey, I'm even more incensed over this film. Having said that, I know that Donner's II would have been a much better movie since it would be without director Richard Lester's emphasis on campy and cheesey stuff. (By Superman III, COMPLETELY directed by Lester, we can see that the bad scenes in 'II' were all Lesters and the good stuff was Donners).
Even after all that, the DVD version just lacks in comparsion to the SE of Superman the Movie. Maybe Warners never cared for the sequels or maybe because they just didn't want to re-open a can of worms.
