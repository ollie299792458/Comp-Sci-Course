more. it's fun to spot the murals and obvious lots that serve as artificial backdrops in this very entertaining 1942 picture . oh sure , it's preposterous , but it's got a lot going for it . Mr. Kruger is deceptively silky smooth and seemingly very kind in a villianous role . likewise Priscilla Lane is many things at once making her conflicted character interesting (and quite lovely) . it's an odd little picture peopled with folks like a very talkative , almost manic , truck driver . an immposibly knowing blind gentleman , not too far removed from the one in Frankenstien over a decade earlier . all quite well acted . those are just a couple of examples of the unusual yet ordinary people you'll find in a pleasing and involving throwback to a different time . accurate and divergent synoptic reviews can be found in Leonard Maltin's yearly reference quide as well as Mick Martin and Marsha porter's DVD and VIDEO quide . very talky (in a good way) . lots of interesting and cool characters . pretty good film . smart and funny . i've seen season one of Hitchcock's television series and now own several of his films . if you're a nostalgist and/or a fan of Mr. Hitchcock , you'll be entertained . Bob Cummings is very good in the lead .
