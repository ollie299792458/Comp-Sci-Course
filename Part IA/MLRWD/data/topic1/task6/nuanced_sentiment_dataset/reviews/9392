I am a fan of Benjamin Bratt, having admired his work in "Law and Order" as well as in his other movies, particularly the tv movie, "After the Storm."  Even when the movies in which he appears are not the greatest, his performance is usually solid and entertaining.  Having said this, I rented this movie based largely on earlier reviews of Pinero, most of which touted his performance as a great departure from his clean cut good guy image, and for showing his wide range of acting skills.  I was disappointed in the movie itself, finding it disjointed, and finding the title character's life to be less than savory or sympathetic.  I wasn't expecting to identify with the title character, but would have liked to have either admired him, his talent, or to have understood him better.  None of these options was possible via this movie.  I also felt that Mr. Bratt's attempt to show his range, tended toward over acting.  Sometimes, less really is more.  I had to laugh as the always sensational, and understated, Rita Moreno steals every scene of the movie in which she appeared.  Unfortunately, stealing this movie doesn't seem to be much of a prize.  Unless you're a true fan of Miguel Pinero (I'm not), I would not recommend this movie.
