At long last the epic FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is becoming available in the aftermath of the release of EL CID.  This was the movie that destroyed Samuel Bronston's studio.  Much of the story would later be the basis of GLADIATOR.  A terrific cast: Stephen Boyd as Livius, Sophia Loren (was there ever a more beautiful star?) as Lucilla, Christopher Plummer (in a wonderful over the top performance) as Comodus and Sir Alec Guinness as Marcus Arilias. To this add John Ireland, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quayle, James Mason and Mel Ferrer. Colossal sets and set piece battles with thousands of extras that today could only be done by CGI, this is an epic in every sense.  A failure at the box office in it's time.  The author, John Logan, of the GLADITOR screenplay says he was unaware of this movie when he was hired by Ridley Scott. Perhaps, the stories both use the same chapter in history and real persons.  Both have Comodus die in hand to hand combat with the protagonist.  Neither is true but never let a little thing like the truth ruin an entertaining film. This appears to be the old roadshow edition with intro and exit music.  Films like this, so prevalent in the 1950's until the early 1960's are now a thing of the past. A pity, in their day they really were spectacles in the best sense.  Highly enjoyable fare!
