When the original Sci-Fi series for Earthsea came out, I was more than ecstatic! I had never heard of Ursula K. Le Guin before, and was coming into liking fantasy and sci-fi, so this was the perfect series for me. I watched the movie/series and left wanting more. It was the next year that I took Fantasy Literature at University, where we read the first three books in the Earthsea Cycle: A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan, and The Farthest Shore. I had just seen the movie, and now was going to read the books... I was pretty excited. But as I read the books, everything seemed so much more realistic and exciting and intense. The movie twisted around almost everything the author so eloquently put across in her writing. Yet in the end, I was still fascinated by the movie.

I know a lot of people here have given the movie a bad review, and rightly so. But I do think it worth watching. Personally, it made the books come to life even more, having something visual put right in front of you. Even without the movie, the descriptions in her books are stunning and more than enough; but there's just something about having the picture in hand, that you can actually see it with your own two eyes.

I would certainly recommend the movie to anyone who has interest; but do yourself a favor... read the books. There is so much more to be read than watched. It's the classic epic, the bildungsroman, the story of good and evil, right and wrong, equilibrium, and is indeed one of the greatest fantasy stories ever told.

Oh yeah... keep an eye out for certain details... it's interesting to see how much of Le Guin's writing and ideas ends up in Harry Potter.
