During the production of this film, there were many protest groups, mainly Gay Right Activists, who made attempts to halt production and influence their opinions as to the tired stereo-typing of films that depicted gay characters as psychotic serial killers.  Which, believe it or not, had actually become quite common in a long list of films.  God bless the activists.  Therefore, during the filming of this movie, the director William Friedkin, felt pressured to alter the story at different points, and so what we have here as an ending I don't believe was supposed to be the actual ending.  That explains why the storyline leaps into the Outer Limits at times and loses it's way back.  Wouldn't it be nice....  if this ever shows up on DVD with perhaps a long lost director's cut... with maybe the original storyline/ending... no matter how bizarre or gory it may well be.  As long as we are given an ending that makes sense, I'd be content.  Al Pacino has always picked roles other actors may not have touched: the bi-sexual bank robber in Dog Day Afternoon, and this kinda-sorta-maybe gay character in Cruising, and with these roles he brings a warmth and understanding that allows one to connect with his character.  Kudos to Al for doing this movie.
