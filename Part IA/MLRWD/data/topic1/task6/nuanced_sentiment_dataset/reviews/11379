[brief plot synopsis]

A new student suddenly finds out that a group of privelaged rich students run the school by bullying. When he, himself, gets his leg severely injured by an accident caused by the bullies he decides to retaliate with murdering them one-by-one in very unique ways. When that is all said and done, the once bullied becomes the new breed of bullies. Once again he has to start his murdering rampage to rid the school of bullies.

[good things]

This movie has a great story, one that I enjoyed alot. Kimberly Beck's full nudity scenes almost makes this movie a must watch.

(A young) Robert Carradine also does a phenominal job in this movie.

[the bad]

The movie is very out-dated. It's from 1976, and it shows. The fashion, acting, and the filming.

The movie severely lacks blood and gore.

[final thoughts]

I personally think this is a movie that should be remade. The story is very "generation Y" friendly. A nice cast, with some nice blood and gore would be a great asset to this movie.

This is one of the only movies to see Kimberly Beck naked. Friday The 13th fans all know she was Trish Jarvis on Friday The 13th: Part IV. Like I said, any fans of Kimberly Beck really should check this out based soley on that.

The movie ultimatley gets a 1.5 score, but don't let that determine whether or not you want to watch this, the movie isn't that bad.
