I wouldn't have picked this movie until my uncle (this macho guy of all people!) told me that I had to rent this movie and see it for myself. He promised me that I would laugh from the beginning to the end. And he was right.
Mel Gibson has always been one of my favorite actors ~~ he can play serious roles and comic roles better than most men can ~~ and in this movie, he starts off as a "male pig" and ends up being ... well, you will just have to watch it. 
He is comic ~~ and I swear that I have never laughed so hard when he takes his advertising copywriter role so seriously. And the chemistry between him and Helen Hunt is just delightful! And Helen Hunt plays his boss wonderfully ~~ so insecure but trying to come across as a hard-driven advertising executive ~~ but Mel Gibson plays his charms well. 
I would love to sit here and expound all the scenes in the movie but I don't want to ruin it for you. I suggest that both men and women check this movie out ~~ it is hilarious and sexy as well. You won't regret it.
