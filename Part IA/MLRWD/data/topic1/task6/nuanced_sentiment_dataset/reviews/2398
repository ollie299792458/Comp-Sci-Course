I watched this because I thought it might be funny, I mean a tire alive killing people had to be funny, right? Well kinda, some parts were funny, but most were just silly and some even stupid! But hey I didn't pay a thing to watch it so not a big problem, but why is this movie over $16 for, its was almost not worth taking the time to watch it free, why would I pay $16 for it?To me this is the type I would imagine finding in a dollar store for $1, or at Walmart for $5, though I wouldn't pay more then $1 for it myself!I find it funny what people like to call artsy when it comes to films these day, are people so desperate for something new and different they will take anything and say its great its art, the film makers are thinking outside the Hollywood box?

Though I do agree with some people on here and else where who have talked about Hollywood's closed box, thats what I call whats happening now a days with all the re-makes, most of which are not even close to as good as the original! Hollywood it seems has closed the box everybody like to bring up here, and instead of make new movies they just keep re-hashing the old ones, or they re-make a movie from another country instead!

But please even with that all said, this is NO artsy film, its just an odd long drawn out Saturday Night Live skit.Don't pay no $16 for this thing, heck don't even bother watching it, its not time well spent trust me!

PS: I know I am not as good at writing these things as most on here, but at least you know I am a real person, not a friend of the movie maker,book writer,TV show creator, or singer!
