Rating: 3.5

This was the first movie I had seen based on a graphic novel. The film is very different; a cross between the old Batman TV series and an adult rated Anime Cartoon (Jessica Alba in tight clothing is thrown in for an added bonus!).

I know someone who reads graphic novels and he loved this film. My stand point is from that of someone unfamiliar with the genre. It seemed that the unique visual aspect of the movie overpowered the plot/storyline. The story line(s) can get a bit blurry at times and you are then flashed with a grand visual display. It was made to truly be a "graphic" novel for the big screen. I saw them movie twice and now still have a hard time remembering all the storylines. What stands out in my mind is how visually powerful the film was.

If you're looking for a movie that is fast-paced, fun and at times racy (my husband truly enjoyed Jessica Alba's "acting"), this film is for you. I did see V for Vendetta last week (this film was also based on a graphic novel) which visually could not compare to Sin City, but had a more of a true story line, was suspenseful, bold and even somewhat political and moral. Of the 2 movies I can say I enjoyed V more overall, but was glad I saw Sin City for its visual appeal.
