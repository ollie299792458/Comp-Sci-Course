Two high school teenagers decide to kill someone to free themselves from the constraints of society.  They appear to be at first very borderline and intriguing.  But the producer's put so little development into their characters we don't see very much of that internal motication.  We are presented with this codependant relationship that the killers have yet we are never told why they need each other or why this dependancy exists.  The police officer Sandra Bullock has many demons of her own and what made her go into police work.  I think the movie may have tried to take on too many plots and it ended up not developing either one of them very well.  The acting is good but the storyline falls behind.  I think the movie should have concentrated more on the killers and backed off the cop character.  I think this is a case where the movie casted too big an actor(Bullock) for a part that shouldn't have played as big a part in the movie.  I recommend renting it, but it probably isn't a very good addition to a DVD collection unless you are a huge Bullock fan.
