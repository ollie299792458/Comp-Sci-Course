After reading some of the reviews on amazon.com, I was taken by surprise by the dissapointment expressed by some. This movie is one of my personal ALL TIME favorites. I purchased Mary Shelley's Frankenstein after it was newly released. I have watched this movie several times, and always find myself astounded by the tremendous effort that went into its production, including the landscape, architecture and even the soundtrack, needless to mention the talented cast of characters. Robert DeNiro pulled off a powerfully convincing  portrayal of "the creature". Perhaps I am misunderstanding something, but one reviewer said this would be a good rental for Halloween? It's my understanding this movie has nothing to do with the Horror genre, *not really* because it is more appropriately classed among those rare classic tales which have a_moral_to_teach, it is a powerful story about humanity, and in this case, this story would border on the argument about Science and God: Where does man draw the line? It is a compelling story, the best version that Hollywood has released to date of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. I must give this movie five stars. I'd rate it six stars, if Amazon allowed for "extra-ordinarily superb!"
