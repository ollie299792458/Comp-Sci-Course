This gift package is a deception. "The Hobbit" movie and "The Return of the King" movie are made by the same people, but the middle movie, "The Lord of the Rings" is made by a differnet team of people. Not only are the styles and approached completely different, but the story line gets all screwed up. "The Lord of the Rings" movie covers the first book and a half of the the trilogy, and appearantley the sequel that would have covered the second half of book two and all of book three was never made. The Return of the King movie jarringly jumps back to the hoakey style of "The Hobbit" and tries to explain the third book of the trilogy without the first two books. The result is the that a large chunk of the trilogy is missing. These three movies do not actually go together as a set, they are just the only available Tolkien videos. The publishers are trying to capitalize on the Tolkien ban-wagon, even if it mean decieving the purchaser. I think they are hoping no one has actually read the books and will realize what they did.
