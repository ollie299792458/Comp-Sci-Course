The first 50 minutes of this film is some of the best work De Palma has done. It is Kurasawa's RASHAMON meets Hitchcock. The different points-of-view are put together with hypnotic precision that I was glued to the screen. The last 30 minutes were an absolute rip-off. The ending is extremely anti-climatic and unbelievable. Cage on the boardwalk referred to how he got out of that tunnel filled with water. There was no such ending. Apparently there was a huge CGI set-piece to finish the film that the studio forced De Palma to remove it to that lame ending. Anything would have been better then the ending we got. Also De Palma's original cut had a higher sex and violence quotient that the studio forced him to delete a lot of scenes. One goes to a De Palma film for organic violence. Hopefully a director's cut might be released with the missing CGI climax and all the sex and violence put back in the film. I will be the first customer to buy the original censored version by De Palma's original cut. Studios don't tell Scorsese or Spielberg to delete the violence in films like THE DEPARTED or MUNICH. Tarantino gets to make his operatic violent movies, why not De Palma? HARRY GEORGATOS
