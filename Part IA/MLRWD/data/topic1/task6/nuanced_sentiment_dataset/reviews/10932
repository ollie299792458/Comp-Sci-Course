PLEASE, ORCA IS A BRILLIANT FILM ADN IT ISN'T A JAWS OR MOBY (...) RIPOFF.  SOME HAVE COMPARED IT TO DEATHWISH, BUT  THAT AIN'T RIGHT EITHER.  THIS IS MUCH OLDER AND DEEPER, A CLASSICAL, OR PERHAPS SHAKESPEAREAN TRAGEDY.  THE ORCA IS OUR TRAGIC HERO, OBVIOUSLY, AND HIS TRAGIC FLAW IS THAT HIS WIFE IS A STUPID DILLHOLE WHO KILLS HERSELF BY RAMMING HER HEAD INTO A PROPERLLER FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  IN THIS WAY HE'S LIKE MACBETH. I URGE YOU TO THINK OF THE ORCA AS MACBETH.  THAT MAKES MS.ORCA LADY MACBETH, OBVOIUSLY, AND THE RICHARD HARRIS CHARACTER INTO MACDUFF. OR PERHAPS ANTIGONE.  I THINK I'VE GOT IT, THIS MOVIE IS A JOINT ADAPTATION OF MACBETH AND ANTIGONE.  AS SUCH IT HAS A DEPTH AND POINGNANCY UNHEARD OF IN MOST MODERN FILM.  AND THE CHARLOTTE RAMPLING CHARACTER IS A MIXTURE OF REGAN AND JULIET, SO NOW I THINK THERE'S EVEN MORE TO THIS THAN THOSE FIRST TWO PLAYS. I'VE ONLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE.  ALSO, I THINK THE ORCA MAY BE A SLAM AGAINST MOBY (...), AS THEY HAVE A VENGEFUL WHALE RATHER THAN A VENGEFUL MAN.  IT REALLY MAKES YOU THINK. ALSO, I THINK MS.ORCA IS ALSO PARTIALLY INSPIRED BY THAT ONE METAMORPHOSIS OF OVID WHERE THE WIFE GETS KILLED WHEN SHE'S PREGNANT AND THE CANTERBUY TALE INSPIRED BY THAT STORY AS WELL.  I COULD GGO ON AND ON.  ANYWAY, NO MATTER THE GENEAOLOGY, THE ORCA IS BY FAR THE BEST PROTAGONIST IN ALL FILM. IT'S ESPECIALLY SAD CAUSE HE BLAMES HIMSELF FOR HIS WIVES DEATH, EVEN THOUGH IT ISN'T REALLY HIS FAULT.  AND HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY DIALOGUE, YET HE CONVEYS  THIS FACT.  SOME OF YOU MAY NOT HAVE SEEN THIS ASPECT OF IT, BUT IT'S THERE.  YOU JUST WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION.  ALSO, THE FACT THAT THE WHALE WASN'T EVEN NOMINATED FOR BEST ACTOR IS A COMPLETE TRAVESTY. PERHAPS THEY SPLIT THE VOTES BETWEEEN HIM AND HARRISE, BUT EVEN DOING THAT THEY BOTH JUST SHOULDA BEEN NOMINATED. ALSO,  IF YOU  DIDN'T CRY AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE, YOU JUST TOTALLY FAKED IT AND WOULDN'T LET YOUR EMOTIONS GET INVOLVED.  YOU TOTALLY WANTED TO CRY.  YOU CAN'T DENY THE SHEER POWER OF THE WHALE.  ALSO, THE SCENE WHERE THE IKCY BABY ORCA GETS SPONTANEOUSLY ABORTED IS THE MOST SADDEST, TRAGIC SCENE EVER IN ANYTHING.  I DIDN'T LAUGH AT ALL DURING THAT SCENE. NOT ONCE. AND NEITHER DID YOU.
