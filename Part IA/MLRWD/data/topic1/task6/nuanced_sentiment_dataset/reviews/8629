I looked at the cover and was not so impressed,  but hey, it was Will Smith, so it would be worth a few laughs.  It has been a hard week and my wife and I needed something light.

Wow!  We just got done watching this movie and I laughed more than I have laughed at a movie in a while!  It was funny.  It was romantic!

Does it get predictable at parts?  Yes.  Does it cross into the "cute" realm a couple of times?  Yes.  It is not perfect, but it is a very good movie.

Will Smith does an awesome job in the character.  Not many people can play the nerd-gone-player, but he pulls it off perfectly.  Eva Mendes does an awesome job as the love interest playing a character with just enough complication to make you buy in.  Kevin James is priceless and almost steals the show from Will Smith!  He is the ultimate underdog that you can't help but to cheer for!  Amber Valleta did a good job but she looks just enough like Cameron Diaz that you almost have Something About Mary flashbacks at some of the funny parts, but I mean that as a compliment.  Julie Ann Emery played the female underdog that reminded me of "that single friend" that most young wives seem to have when they get married.  We all knew someone like her character who just needed a chance with that one someone who was out there somewhere.

All in all, this movie is not meant to be anything other than a good laugh with just enough romantic twist to make you want to snuggle a little tighter between the laughs.  If you are looking for that cute date movie, be it your third date or a date night at home while the kids are staying over with the grandparents, this is a perfect movie.  You walk away holding hands with smiles on your faces.

Oh, and you guys on the third date ... rent this movie, sit close, play it cool, and only lean 90% when the movie is over.  Don't know what I mean?  Watch the movie ... you'll see!
