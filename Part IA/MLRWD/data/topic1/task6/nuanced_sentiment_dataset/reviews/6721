Have you noticed that at the time of this writing it's 35% off? There's a reason...

I salivated when I learned this set would be available, but for some reason put off preordering/buying it. I recently read a review that points out that Warner screwed up the Technicolor settings on this release of The Searchers (weird, considering they're the ones who with AOL developed the Ultra-Resolution "edge-enhancement" technology that constitutes the current state of the art in Technicolor restoration--at least for those shot using the three-strip process). It seems that they're aware of the problem and are planning to correct it by timing it to an IB print such as that used for the laser disk release, but until such time, fans might want to think twice before opening their wallets. I, for one, want to view Technicolor films the way their directors/cameramen intended them to be seen, with the original color calibration intact.

Six stars for the films themselves, BTW. I only wish the non-Warner titles could have been included, but I'm thrilled that the entire Cavalry Trilogy is finally on disk. And to see Three Godfathers make it to DVD is the frosting on the cake.
