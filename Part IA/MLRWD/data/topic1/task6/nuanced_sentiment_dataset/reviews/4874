I watched the film on Tv 5 years ago and it was such an incredible night! After watching the film, as a Turk, I was there facing one of the most notorious films and i was just smiling, because it was just a film and nothing else. It is true..Turkey is not that democratic a country and we stil have problems. It is not easy to progress.There are lots of obstacles to get over. But it is also true that films just deviate from the truth..so the film is just an adaptation of the truth. And at that time, it was Oliver Stone's and Alan Parker's adaptation and comment. I don't think they have never cared about Turkey and its democracy. I don't even think they know where Turkey is. That's why it is very understandable. I don't really see the point what's so wonderful about the film. Prisons are bad places and nobody can claim the reverse. Turkish prisons are bad places just like american, greek, armenian, russian prisons. You turn the tv on and watch israelis kill palestinians, watch the cops beat black men in South africa, watch the racist people in america. It is not fiction. It is real. So if anyone claims this film represents the truth, I recommend them watch tv and see the real Midnight express. Better than Alan Parker's adaptation!
