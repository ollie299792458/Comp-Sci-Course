First off Lucas loves DVD. They are working on the DVD version of the Indy films, and may be done soon.
These are the greatest action films ever  made. Many tried to copy this film (almost as much as Die Hard has been),  but none have succeeded. Ford was great as Indiana Jones, and can hardly  wait for a new film. I finally get to see these films the way they were  meant to be seen...WIDESCREEN!
Raiders: The original is still the best.  One of the classic films of the 80's and one of the greatest all time  films. It is reminiscent of classic serials in the old days. This is the  best action/adventure film ever created. Ford gave a great performance as  Indy, and John Williams's classic score shall never be forgotten (who can  forget the Raiders March). Spielberg made a great film.
Temple of Doom:  The worst of the series, but compared to two great films, this is still a  good film. It was more violent than the original (move that inspired the  PG-13 rating). A great film but had a somewhat weak supporting cast.
Last  Crusade: Great film. Sean Connery and Ford made magic together on the  screen as father and son.  Brody and Salah finally get into the action in  this film. William's does a great job with the score again, and it is nice  to see how Indy got the famous hat and his scar.
