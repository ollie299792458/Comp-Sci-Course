I watched the first Saw film and found it disgusting and total trash. I didn't bother with the second but for some reason hoped the third would hold some promise. WRONG!! This new trend of horror/gore-porn is an insult to the horror/thriller genre. This movie was just one disgusting, blood soaked scene after another with no characters worth giving a damn about. It wasn't scary, there wasn't even any real tension. It was just blood and guts for the sake of blood and guts, just like the previous entries in the series. The only reason this franchise continues is because simple minded gore freaks insist on indulging in this kind of schlock cinema. The guys who created the first Saw film might be considered smart as they made a cheap movie and made a ton of money, and I guess that's where we are now. These movies aren't movies. They are products to be trotted out to the waiting public so they can plunk down their money just so the studio can make another and repeat the cycle. Lionsgate must be pretty happy knowing they can release the same movie over and over, year after year and they will always make money because of the simple minded followers they have brain washed. Now they even release special edition, multi-disc DVDs to cash in even more. That fake blood must be expensive, especially when you use it up by the tanker-full. The new breed of 'horror' movie makers, such as Eli Roth and the guys responsible for 'Saw' are not masters of horror, as some would have you think. They are silly children who think blood=fear. I don't expect a lot from a horror movie, but I expected more than this.
