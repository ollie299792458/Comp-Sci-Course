Since there are plenty of reviews, I will keep this short.  There is a cavalcade of stars in this picture, all providing exceptional performances.  John Wayne plays the lead and does not let us down.  This is more than a war story for the alpha male.  The story portrays the friendships, bonds, and romances of the characters.  The story is woven very well and ties together the characters and sub-plots.  The nearly 3 hours flies by.

The special effects for the day are very good.  No CGI in the day, but the battle scenes do not need it.  I only detected minor use of stock footage - enemy planes flying overhead, but they made up for that with the 5.1 re-mix, so the planes sounded like they were in your media room.  Apparently, there was some usage of model ships, but I did not find that bothersome.

The transfer to DVD is very good.  The widescreen picture is in black and white, but that is soon forgotten.  The blips on the screen from age are negligible (I think I counted 2).  There is a 5.1 re-mix sound track that is very good.  The surround speakers are utilized as is the .1 low bass, but it is not exceptional.  There is great surround sound within the first 15 minutes, when the viewer feels the presence of enemy planes in all corners of the room flying overhead.  The bass is utilized throughout the picture, but the most resounding bass sound is near the end when the guns are in full force.  Perhaps I am spoiled by the house shaking rumble of today standards, to call it exceptional.

Overall, this is a definite purchase and stands next to Patton.  This picture warrants another viewing.
