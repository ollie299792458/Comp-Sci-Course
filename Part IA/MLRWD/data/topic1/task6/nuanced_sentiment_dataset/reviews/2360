"Ratatouille" is a delicious musical treat for the whole family to enjoy. From Disney, the company famous for its mouse,comes a loveable rat Remy who wants to cook up a feast. It's an inspiring fairy tale about family, love, and the power of faith. From Michael Giacchino's bistro-worthy soundtrack to the tasty intrigues of the story, "Ratatouille" is a cinematic meal.

In "Ratatouille",Remy the rat (expertly voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt) befriends the garbage boy Linguini. As in Cyrano de Bergerac, Linguini gets the credit for Remy's amazing meals. Linguini might also be the love child of Gousteau,the chef who inspires Remy in visions. Linguini himself is smitten with the no-nonsense chef Colette (a bittersweet Jeanne Garofalo) The devious Skinner (former Bilbo Ian Holm) plans to turn Gousteau's magical recipes into instant frozen meals (like "Tooth Pickin' Chicken" and "Haggis Wraps") There's also a health inspector who bears an uncanny resemblance to Walt Disney himself. Finally,the evil cadaverous critic Anton Ego (voiced by the equally cadaverous Peter O'Toole) comes to Gousteau's with a bone to pick.

"Ratatouille" is a delicious mix of comedy,in-jokes,and visual wonders. It's an ode to the joys of cooking and the beauty of Paris,the City of Light. It has a moral without being ponderously moralistic. As Anton Ego learns his lesson from a delicious plate of ratatouille,so does this movie please the palate. Bon appetit!
