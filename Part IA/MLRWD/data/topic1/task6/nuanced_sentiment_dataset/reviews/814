Seven college bound friends return from a weekend camping trip to discover that a foreign army invaded their Australian homeland. With their friends and families taken prisoner, they must band together and find a way to fight for their freedom and survival.

Tomorrow When The War Began is a low budget Australian movie recently released in the U.S. that follows seven students on what they think is their last hurrah camping trip before the school year begins in the fall. Upon returning home, they discover their family and friends have all vanished and begin searching for answers.

There isn't a lot to say about this movie. The beginning is slow as they develop the characters which isn't surprising because the movie is based of a ten book series written by John Marsden. Once the characters are developed, the story movies along fairly quick and the action picks up dramatically.

Due to the slow development and large amount of books in the series, this would probably do better as a television series. I also wonder if U.S. audiences will connect with the movie since it's not based in the U.S. Tomorrow When The War Began is required reading for Australian middle school children which means most viewers are familiar with the story before they walked into theaters.
