This movie is basically eXistenZ without the slime and with more violence and blood.

Uninspired plot. Mediocre writing. Good acting. Love the cinematography. Love the soundtrack (R&oacute;is&iacute;n Murphy FTW!). There's a "sex" scene at the end that brings whole new meaning to the term "gore porn."  It's intense. When I saw that scene in the theater I actually had a moment where I thought to myself, "I'm not sure I'm old enough to be watching this." And I'm 24. In fact, that scene is pretty much the only reason I bought this DVD.

Aside from that, the movie's got some racefail, but it's not much worse than James Cameron's Avatar in that regard. Let's just say this is not Whitaker's proudest moment as an African American actor. It also fails the Bechdel test, not that anybody in the target demographic would really care. I just figured I'd put that out there on the off chance I'm not the only woman of color interested in this movie.
