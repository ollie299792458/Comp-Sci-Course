Being unfamiliar with the criterion laserdisc print of this film, I can't really comment on the quality of this FOX LORBER edition. I can imagine that the colors could be a little more vibrant, as this edition did seem a little "washed out".  But since its the only print available right now on DVD (region 1 anyways), I find it satisfactory (otherwise I would give this film a rating of 5 stars).
For those nitwits that don't find the character played by the exquisite Martine Carol fleshed out enough...Pay closer attention.. if youre looking for history rather than fiction..ummm, go die.  This truly is one of the most remarkable films of all time. The subject matter, while set in the 19th century, is handled as (post?)modern as anything out right now. This is a story of a figure whose (vulgar?) exploits and scandals could only be tamed (at the hands of men and the status quo) by being reduced to a SPECTACLE (how true of ANY revolution!!!!!! ).
Buy the fox lorber print ...its cheap enough. theres so much to be gained by this film.
theres a haphazard review. hope it was helpful.

p.s. Martine Carol is gorgeous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
