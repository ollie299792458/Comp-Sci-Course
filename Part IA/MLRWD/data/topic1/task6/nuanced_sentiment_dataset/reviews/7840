Saboteur was released in 1942, while World War II was dividing the world and this film's budget was obviously effected in part by the days events.

The basic plot involves a war plant machinist Barry Kane(Robert Cummings) who is [...] for an act of sabotage at his plant by a man named Frank Fry(Norman Lloyd) who in a small role is quite effective as a cold blooded villain.

Because of this event, he is forced into fleeing cross country as authorities suspect Barry Kane and want him behind bars and the real villains wish him very much dead.

I won't give away all the details but the suspense grows as Barry Kane tries to uncover who set him up and why.

The final climatic scene atop the Statue Of Liberty is what most people will have indelibly burned into their minds and it is one of Hitchock's most memorable scenes, right up there with North By Northwest, Mt Rushmore sequence, as well as Vertigo's opening sequence with Jimmy Stewart, to name a few.

The DVD release of Saboteur is quite excellent which offers storyboards and Hitchcock sketches and poster art and the obligatory still gallery.

The documentary that's included is not as good as some of the more mainstream Hitchcock releases, but has its moments, including comments by Art Director Robert Boyle, who  worked on The Wolf Man prior to Saboteur .

Overall this movie is uneven, in spots some of the acting is a bit wooden, the effects are a bit weak at times given budget constraints, but very enjoyable at the core.

This dvd presentation includes French and Spanish language tracks and subtitles, in addition the English sub titles.

On a rating of Bronze to Platinum......I give this film a SILVER...rating!!! Enjoy!!!
