When The original "The Grudge" Came out. It was a shocking very scary experience at the theater. I was jumping in my seat. I saw the original when I was 16, up to that point it was one of the scariest movies I'd ever seen, and I've loved Horror/Scary movies since I was four years old.

I really like Sarah Michelle Gellar. I think she's a great actress and I always like her movies. I was a fan on "Buffy" So, I was excited that she would be in the sequel.

To my disappointment she had about 5 minutes of screen time in "The Grudge 2." I was really looking forward to the sequel. But, I was actually shocked at how bad it turned out to be. I really couldn't believe how terrible it was. It was NOTHING like the original "The Grudge" It lost all of it's spark. Not one part of the whole movie was even remotely frightening. NOT ONE PART.

"The Grudge 2" was the only movie in my entire life where I actually fell asleep in the theater. I never thought the day would come where I would fall asleep in the theater. It was that boring and uninteresting. Unfortunately, I didn't fall asleep for very long. I really tried to like this movie. I wanted to like this movie. But, I just couldn't. There were so many different ways they could have taken the sequel. But, they turned into something that could have gone straight to video.

The Japanese Version of the sequel was much better than this. If you must see it, rent it.
