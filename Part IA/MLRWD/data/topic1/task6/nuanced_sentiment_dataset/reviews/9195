"The Terminator" blends science fiction and horror into a non-stop classic film.  James Cameron's budget was beyond low but he succeeded in bringing the scares with brutal violence and breathless action.  The time travel storyline is simple here and it actually makes sense.  The characters act and react in what would probably be logical ways, given that they have a nearly indestructible killer cyborg stalking them.  And speaking of the cyborg, Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfect for this role.  He's a huge, hulking mass and is intimidating to say the least.

The special effects are dated by today's standards, but if you're a fan of stop-action animation, there's some very cool scenes to drool over.  There is also some great model and old school puppet work, highlighted by the Terminator cutting into his arm and eyeball to do a few repairs.  Speaking of that, even though this film is very violent, the blood, gore and language is milder than you'd expect.  "The Terminator" is one of the greats of sci-fi cinema.  It always entertains and is endlessly re-watchable.
