As other reviewers here have pointed out, Frantic plays like Polanski's homage to Hitchcock. An American doctor's wife is kidnapped in Paris in a case of mistaken identity. The doctor, Richard Walker, is in Paris for a medical convention. He's disengaged from the city--Paris is just a backdrop for a lecture he'll be giving. His wife's disappearance forces him into the city's underworld. Polanski presciently makes the villains from the Middle East (at a time when everyone was still so hung up on the Cold War). The film's plot has holes in it, but Frantic is really about Walker's shock, cultural isolation and loneliness (even though he has a beautiful female sidekick) as he searches for his wife. Harrison Ford is excellent as Walker, the American forced to loose his innocence in order to get his wife back. His acting here has a vulnerability that I've never seen in his other films. Frantic's cinematography is reminiscent of American film noir, We see Walker's nondescript hotel room, garbage trucks, empty highways and underpasses and sleazy eurotrash nightclubs. The drabness mirrors the emptiness of Walker's unexamined inner life; he's so fixated on his work and family life that he's tuned the richness and complexity that Paris represents. And his provincialism has made him oblivious to the ominous emergence of global terrorism. A cheap souvenir of the Statue of Liberty holds the clue to the film's mystery and the statue's tawdriness makes a statement about the superficiality of American values. Ennio Morricone's terrific soundtrack reinforces the film's emotional depth. The Paris we see in Frantic is an eighties' Paris that is gone forever, which gives it a great nostalgic value today. But is Dr. Walker really going to be happy with is prim wife after running around Paris with the beautiful Michelle and her druggy bohemian friends? This film could also be a commentary on his marriage.
