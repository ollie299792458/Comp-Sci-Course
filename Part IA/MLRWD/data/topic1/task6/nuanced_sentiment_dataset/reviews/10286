Enough people have commented on this that if you are reading my comment you're a very difficult person to convince!

Trust me, this series is probably one of the best ever put together on this topic. It's compelling, informative and the production quality is simply amazing. There's a nice mix of actual images and rather impressive CG that, when woven together, really bring The Universe to life. And I really enjoyed the various interviews with some of the leading researchers in the field that were blended quite nicely into the narrative. This really helped add a more personal and human quality to the series that can be lost with only images and CG animation running over an invisible narrator. I've watched this series so many times already that I've lost count. And now I'm forced to wait until the summer for Season Two! That's definitely not fair.

The one complaint I've seen was posted here already regarding the formatting of this DVD. And I have to be honest with you - while that might normally bother me it did not in this case. Perhaps it's my love of this topic. Perhaps it's the stunning job the History Channel did putting this series together. But I can tell you that I'd watched the series through almost it's entirety before I even realized the black bars I was that absorbed by it.
