"To the Manor Born" is one of my favorite BBC comedies.  I first viewed this series on PBS in the early 1980s, shortly after it was filmed (1979-81) and recognized Penelope Keith, Lady Audrey Fforbes-Hamilton, as the same actress who played Margo Ledbetter in "Good Neighbors."  This show was well cast, with supporting actress Angela Thorne (Marjorie Frobisher), and Audrey's protagonist (played by Peter Bowles), Richard DeVere.

I enjoy the witty dialogue and repartee between actors.  There is humor, but it is never overstated, never tacky, never vulgar.

The chaste language should appeal to anyone, no matter how conservative.  Yet, the class distinctions, snobbishness (Audrey's reference to Richard, a native born Slovak turned British citizen as "not one of us") tells volumes about class struggles, jealousy, bitterness over changing circumstances which can apply to anyone, not only Britain in the 1980s with changing economic status, class system, etc.  Richard, a self made millionaire and owner of a grocery store chain, buys Audrey's home and grounds (The Manor) in Episode 1, and Audrey, forced to sell on her late husband's death, is broke and forced to endure someone of a lesser social class (but much greater wealth) living in her former home.

The scenery is beautiful, the plots more believable than many TV shows, and overall quality very high.  I have owned this series for the past 7 years (VHS), enjoying it very much, and expect to re-watch these for more enjoyment in the future.  This is so superior to many American TV shows, and to much of what I've seen from the BBC and other British productions over the past ten years.
