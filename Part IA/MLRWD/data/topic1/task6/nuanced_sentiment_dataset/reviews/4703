As a big Twilight Zone Series fan, a movie including remakes of the original episodes should be a must-have. Unfortunately, out of over 150 episodes, some of the weakest episodes were picked to be remade in this movie. The only "classic" episode is "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet", which originally starred William Shatner. The remake is well done, but the monster was actually MUCH creepier in the original episode.

The funny thing is that Albert Brooks mentions, probably the most popular, and definitely one of the best episodes ("Time Enough at Last" starring Burgess Meredith) in the introduction scene of the movie. Why not remake this episode instead of just mentioning it? It was clearly classic enough to be acknowledged in the movie, so why remake mediocre episodes instead?

I'll never understand the planning of this movie, and I can never really enjoy watching it. If you're unfamiliar with the series, and need a gateway to see what it was all about, this is a terrible representation of what to expect. Don't waste your money here, buy the Twilight Zone Complete Season DVDs instead. There's plenty of bang for your buck there.
