I would have given the movie more stars had it been closer to the game, but when has hollywood ever made a realy good movie based on a game, book, comic, etc.  there are always changes.  Lord of the rings was a great film, but too much was changed and left out.  This is what hollywood does.  Now with Doom.  I liked it as a stand alown film.  Meaning not based on anything.  They will always screw up scientific data, alter plots, even change the whole concept.  This film does get the concept right. Kill, Kill, Kill.  I do beleive it would have been a better film had they based it on hell and demons instead of a genetic experiment, but again that is hollywood.  Many people who wrote reviews in here obviously don't get it.  They shread the film apart and cry because they changed things.  Here is some advice.  If you loved Doom, and will be upset if they changed the concept of the film then don't see it.  If you feel you might be wasting 20 bucks at the theaters, but would still like to see a decent action film that realy was no slower to start then the first Predator film. Then wait and rent it and watch it with some friends for 5 dollars.(make them bring the refreshments)  If you are a fan of the Rock, want to see some violent action, then this film is for you.

Hope this helps
