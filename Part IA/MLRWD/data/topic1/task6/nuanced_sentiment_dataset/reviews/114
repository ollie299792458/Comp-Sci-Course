Celtic Thunder is the best thing to come along in years! - make that decades!  These 5 guys are incredibly talented.  Each one is a solo performer in his own right, and as an ensemble they blend together with incredible panache.

The performance is an eclectic mix - Celtic music, old and new, and some mainstream "standards", all performed with a presence that you can't ignore.  They're not going through the motions, there's somebody home here doing songs they believe in and are involved in.  While it's almost tempting to say that the Celtic music is what they really excel in, it wouldn't be fair to discount the standards.  You may recognize the words, but I swear it's like you've never heard the song before.  Warning: they'll probably spoil you for any other version.

There is truly something here for everyone.  The variety just serves to make you appreciate their talents and versatility even more.  They'll make you laugh and smile as they do some very joyful and inspiring tunes; then they'll turn around and tear your heart out and hand it to you.

This is no spoiled boy band clone.  What may strike you most is that they're genuine and authentic men and not afraid to let that show through.

While I love and admire every darned one of them, Keith Harkin is a gift, he's just exquisite.
