Now, when I first heard that Adam Sandler was going to be making a movie with Seth Rogan, I thought, "Of course I have to go see this!"  Two really funny comedians in one movie together?  What would be better?

I'll tell you.

ANYTHING.

Sandler plays a big-shot famous comedian who just finds out that he's dying.  Through a strange set of coincidences, Rogan becomes very close to Sandler's character and...well, I don't want to give too much away.  But, throughout the movie, there are multiple scenes that actually take place in comedy clubs, where these people who are supposedly great stand up comedians are doing there stuff.  In the movie, the audience watching them is crying as they laugh.  In my theater?  Everyone had the same confused-dead-pan-what-the-heck-is-supposed-to-be-funny-about-this look on their faces.  Were those supposed to be jokes that they were telling?

Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting any "why did the chicken cross the road jokes", and I knew that because the movie was rated R, there would be plenty of crude body jokes, but come on!  Rogan's character's jokes revolved only around his "manliness" and farts.  Even Sandler's character pointed out that Rogan would never get a girl if he kept talking about things like that.  I personally got so tired of the repetitiveness of Rogan's jokes that whenever he got up to perform, I would zone out and start paying attention to the people sitting around me because, honestly, they were more entertaining than what I had paid nine dollars to go and see.

When it got to the second half of the over 2 hour long movie, the "funny parts" disappeared completely.  It wasn't even pathetically funny.  No, in the end I would've called this movie People, because the said People were definitely not Funny.
