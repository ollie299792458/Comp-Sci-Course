Never before has a movie delivered such a truthful portrait of Hitler and his sycophantic minions. The effect is chilling. We would all like to believe that Hitler was an out-of-control psychopath, cruel and hateful to everyone. But in reality, he could be very kind, affable, and affectionate, just as long as you could prove Aryan, non-Jewish origins. A cruel lunatic would have had few followers, and Hitler knew it. He was careful not to play his hand very often, and it worked well for him. Most people didn't even know the full extent of his crimes until the war was over.

Much of the controversy surrounding this film centers around Bruno Ganz' amazing portrayal. This Hitler is by counts kind and charming, sad and broken. In other words, human. And yet he speaks with pride of his decimation of the Jewish population, refers to the youth of Germany as expendable casualties, and refuses to help the starving, terrified citizens of Berlin, punishing them for losing his war. He is delusional, bitter, and increasingly dangerous. It is impossible to feel sympathy for a man so bent on his own destruction. His final act of suicide (touted by Neo-Nazi's as an act of bravery) is nothing more than cowardice, an easy way to escape responsibility for the horror he unleashed. The truth is never a pretty picture, especially in this film, and an honest look at Hitler could never flatter him. A sympathetic film? Not even close.
