Billy Elliot is a wonderfully written movie.  The acting is above average, although not spectacular.  I was most pleased with the way the movie would have subplots that seemed not to fit with the movie (such as the miner's strike), but they would be wonderfully interwoven into the movie in a way that was thought provoking.
However, I was somewhat dissapointed with the movie's handling of the homosexual issue.  While the point of the movie was that not all boys that are interested in dance, etc. are homosexuals, the movie gives the impression that all male homosexuals are interested in dance, etc.-- which I don't think to be true.  However, that aside, the movie deals with the issue of young boys and their emotions very well.  It shows that there is nothing wrong with emotionally expressive boys.  I was also impressed with the way the writer handled the family situation- the interactions between Billy, his father, his brother, and his grandmother were intense and meaningful.
Overall, a movie worth seeing for anybody interested in child psychology.  Also a good discussion starter for families... teenage and above.
As a note, since this is a British film, the accents may take awhile to get used to (for Americans), but it is not very difficult to keep up.
