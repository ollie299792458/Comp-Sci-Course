This will be short:  This film is only one micro-millimeter away from being just as good as the original "Rocky".  It is poignant, well-written, very well acted, and, if you'll forgive the boxing terminology, it packs quite a punch.

Folks, when I first heard that Stallone was doing yet another "Rocky" sequel, my first response was, "He's GOT to be kidding, right???"  I just couldn't believe it, and I thought that it was a sure sign that Stallone's career really was over.  I was certainly sad to think that, because I've always been a big fan.

This is one of those very rare occasions that I was well and truly wrong about something.  This is a very good film, and deserves to be given credit as being what it is:  The best of the "Rocky" sequels.  Stallone's writing and acting, as well as his direction of this film, haven't been this good in some time.

If you loved the original "Rocky", and you haven't already done so, SEE THIS FILM!

You'll thank me later.
