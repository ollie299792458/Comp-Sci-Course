Watched this movie this weekend......I love movies with a collection 800+ films strong.  I cannot see what people see and rave about in this film.

It is like the worse Grindhouse martial arts film I have ever seen.....the dubbing is sometime extremely cliched and out of sync (reminds me of the American Pie scene after the first party "Their tiger style kung foo is strong, but our dragon style will defeat them, the shaolin masters from east and west must unite... fight... and find out who is number one".... with worse then Saturday B film dialogue.

The action yes is non stop but over and over and over with no real storyline or plot.

And be aware Ultraviolent and bloody here....which I can take (see Hellraiser and Kill Bill series)...but the violence didn't really fit except to string on scene to another to another to another and was there most times to make the movie be sensationalist and bloodier.

C'mon this, as some have said, is the best action film ever made?  The best martial arts film.....wow these people must have a very very limited collection!

Save your money folks!  I wasted $25 of mine...well at least I can get $5 back from a Best Buy trade in.
