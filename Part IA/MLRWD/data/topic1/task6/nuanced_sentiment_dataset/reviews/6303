THE PACKAGING FOR THIS SET DESTROYS THE DISCS AS YOU REMOVE THEM.

The packaging for the new Kubrick box set has slots for each disc with a point too narrow to remove the disc.  If you cut open any of the sleeves, you'll find that the cardboard on the top and bottom has a sort of nub on each side, making the pathway by which the disc would be removed slightly smaller than the disc itself.  In order to remove the disc, you have to grab a hold of it with your thumb on the info surface and yank very hard.  The close tight space the disc is in is just cardboard, some of the slots had debris which put gashes in the each disc removed.  The packaging literally destroys every disc removed from it as intended.  I managed to save a few of my own discs by cutting open the packaging (Hence how I saw the nub cuplrits) but this has rendered the set unreturnable, so I'm out a hundred bucks with the prospect of buying up separate discs.
