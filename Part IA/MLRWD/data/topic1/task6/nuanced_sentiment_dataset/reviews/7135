I have to say I have a bit of mixed feelings about the movie. I did enjoy the movie BUT, there were some details that I didn't like. For example: I thought the movie was to be a bit more balanced on the lives of Peter and Paul. IMHO the movie concentrates more (way more) on Paul, than on Peter. Peter is almost reduced to cameo appearances throught the movie. Maybe it was just bad editing. I read another review that said that the series was a lot longer. Maybe most of the Peter scenes were cut off. 
Another detail was that Peter looked weak from time to time when it came down on making some important decisions. I compared Antony Hopkins portrayal of Paul with Philip Sayer's on A.D. The Mini Series(1985)(I stronly recommend A.D.) and I would've liked to see that same contrast of Paul's attitude before his conversion and after his conversion on Peter and Paul. I take nothing away from Mr. Hopkins he did a wonderful job. His passion to spread the teachings of Jesus and his preaching on the most difficult places was very inspiring and admirable.
Besides these details, I enjoyed the film very much. It was very inspiring. I could define it more as a biopic of Paul than Peter. 
If you are interested on the history of Paul and the Early Church, this film is for you.
