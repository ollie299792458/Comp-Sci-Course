I rented this movie for $1, assuming it was going to be crap-tastic... and was actually pleasantly surprised!  Within the first few minutes they made it perfectly clear how the tone and style for DBE was going to go.  At first you think it's going to be a serious movie about Goku training and becoming a man etc., then the wirefighting and ridiculousness break out and you can tell immediately that it's going to be a silly, fun adventure movie.  Not a straight-up comedy by any stretch... think about the same level/tone as Sky High meets Mortal Kombat and you'll be pretty close.  Props to Chow Yun Fat as the dirty, old Master Roshi!  I loved it so much I'm probably going to go out and buy it later :)

As for all those die-hard DB fans out there that are griping about the movie being different from the series... I actually considered this movie to be a fairly good 90-min representation of DB/early DBZ.  There were some plot holes/explanations-left-unanswered/etc., but it was certainly a fun movie that kept true to the basics.  Just don't expect that you're buying a super-serious, $100million remake of the DB series.
