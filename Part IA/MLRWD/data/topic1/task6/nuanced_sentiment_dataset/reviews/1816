As one reviewer has noted, this movie did not age well. It is essentially an exploitation flick made to sucker in every old geezer's favorite sex fantasy ("sugar daddy") during an era when free love was supposedly being handed out left and right to a generation (1970's) that the old geezers despised and were jealous of. Having said that, it isn't as bad as some reviewers say, nor as good as others have said. The direction by Clint Eastwood was quite decent and I think Bill Holden's performance was outstanding (demonstrating that a really good actor can go a long ways to salvage an otherwise creepy movie...reminds me of some of John Malkovich's roles).

The really terrible part is a) the plot in the first place, and b)most of the dialogue. Only Holden captivates. Kay Lenz is a very attractive young actress who was, at the time, trying to be the next Kim Novak or similar "sexpot". She never made it and eventually faded from the scene. "White Line Fever" is probably her biggest role and that doesn't say much.
