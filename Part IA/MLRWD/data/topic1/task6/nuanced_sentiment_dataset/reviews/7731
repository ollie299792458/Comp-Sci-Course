When I saw the trailers I figured there would be some elements of found
 footage films. Well, it kind of is. The Devil inside was clearly influenced by
 paranormal activity to some degree just in the way the camera work is done. The
 entire movie is presented as if it were a documentary. Personally I feel a real
 documentary about exorcism would be much cooler to watch and I'm now making a
 note that I should do such.

The movie opens with a message I personally found so hilarious I have to
 share it with all of you. It states the movie is not endorsed by the Vatican.
 Has there ever been a movie about demonic possession that was endorsed by the
 Vatican? Has the pope ever seriously said "in the name of all that is holy
 I command you to go see (insert movie title here)"? I don't think so, but
 it does conjure some fairly amusing imagery.

My final thoughts are this movie is bad, not bad as in pisses you off, but still bad.
This movie much like its predecessors will become
 a cult classic over time. The exorcism scenes are fun if you aren't looking for
 anything new. The Entities have dialogue that is clever at times. It is an okay
 party movie and something that would be enjoyable to watch with friends
