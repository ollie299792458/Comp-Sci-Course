In viewing the film, I happened to miss the opening titles, but in  sumbmitting this review, I was shocked to find that John Schlesinger, one  of my all time favorite directors, had something to do with this nonsense.  Plus it hardly has a happy ending.  Gay man and straight woman try to  raise young son... all is not well on the homefront!
Madonna, first off  looks horrid. Despite a well toned body, she has become frightening for me  to look at.  Though her acting is always slightly above average, the trite  dialogue is not pulled off by either her or the always fine performances of  Rupert Everett.  
On another note, I'm actually beginning to believe that  Neil Patrick Harris is gay.  (Didn't he turn up on Will &amp; Grace last  season?) This actor is so talented!  After all, we all believed that Doogie  Howser really WAS a doctor!  His emotional performance of a man that looses  his lover to AIDS should not go unnoticed.
A few years back, there was a  film that was similar in subject matter called The Object Of My Affection,  with Jennifer Aniston, which ran circles around this movie. Mainly because  it included something known as "a good script".  Something this  film clearly doesn't have.
On the plus side, you have to give Schlesinger  credit though for bringing to the screen what other directors would never  in a million years.  Next time John, read the script first.
