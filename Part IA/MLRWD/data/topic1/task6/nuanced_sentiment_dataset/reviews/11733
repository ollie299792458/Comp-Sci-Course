I'm sorry, I haven't seen the DVD of this movie.
I just remember seeing two movies, back to back, back in the late '70s in a Drive-In: "The Hills Have Eyes" and "Don't Go Into The Woods".
This became an Indie-joke between my friends and myself to refer to movies that were supposed to be cheap and scary.  I seem to remember a subliminal flash of a skull a few times during the "Don't..." movie also.  Some of us found the movies scary, some of us were dying to leave.  We who were dying to leave suddenly perked up and tried to spot more of the subliminal frames.  The other guys never saw them.  They weren't subtle either: In the middle of a very dark woods scene suddenly is one frame of full white with just a black skull in the middle, enough to blind you in a dark parking lot.  Even more puzzling that only two of us saw it.
Anyway, maybe "The Hills..." has some subliminals in it also so if you buy this movie try to keep your eyes peeled open watching for them.  There were only three or so in the other movie.
It would be a chuckle if they made it into this.
