I love Michael Mann's films.  Both Heat and Collateral provided stellar performances, proper gun handling and technique and decent screenplays.

Miami Vice the movie was a complete disaster.  The acting was stiff, almost like cartoon characters.  Granted, the movie didn't have masters like De Niro or Pacino, but I expected a lot more from Foxx and Farrell.  The supporting cast was even worse.  And what's up with the screenplay?  There's this scene where one of the female cops threatens an informant with throwing him out a window.  Talk about idiotic empty threats.  In Heat, while interrogating Ashley Judd's boyfriend, the cops intelligently interrogates the subject by leveraging him with the threat of extradition to another state where he would be automatically sent back to prison on a parole violation if he didn't cooperate.  Now that's a threat with a brain behind it.  And then you have the .50 cal sniper rifles.  My impression that it was gross over kill and sensationalist like the typical Hollywood use of Desert Eagle hanguns.  M14s would have made more sense given the possibility of having to be utilized for both sniper and up close work.  And I'm sorry, but Gong Li looked terrible.  I really like Asian women, but she looked like she got up without putting on any makeup and didn't get enough sleep.

When I watch a Michael Mann film, I expect to see a modern day classic.  I expect realism intended for a thinking audience.  If I want to watch the typical Hollywood tripe, then I can just go to the theater and watch whatever is playing at the multiplex.

The old Miami Vice series had better acting, better gun handling (Don Johnson's Weaver stance), better story lines and much better character development.
