The long awaited Dogma - first promised on the end titles of Clerks - takes Silent Bob &amp; Jay to their next target. Having approached sex,  drugs, romance &amp; shopping (and achieved an incredibly gratifying  nothing) organised religion pops up next. With the entirity of existence  (begrudgingly) requiring their assitance the world is in trouble.
This  film came in for a lot of stick for its discussion of organised religion  and faith. Denounced as blasphemous by many it raises many common  criticisms of religion and Catholism - but does it do it well? Yes and No.  The script is at times excellent and usually good however there is  sometimes a feeling that Smith just doesnt quite know what he is doing or  saying with his direction and the set pieces seem to lack a spark that  would have made the film far more rounded. The performances from the cast  are good especially Lee who puts in a great turn as Azrial.
On the whole  - good but not great. Better off watching Chasing Amy or Clerks but if your  in the mood...
