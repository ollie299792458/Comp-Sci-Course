I liked Austin Powers I and II but this third one is a total bummer. This movie was made simply to put Hollywood's big shot celebrities and MTV pop culture up on a pedestal. Many of the big shot names made brief and absolutely pointless appearances. Second of all, it doesn't continue off as a sequel to the last movie the way Austin Powers II did. Whatever became of his girlfriend/sidekick (played by Heather Graham) from the last Austin Powers movie? That's a total mystery.
Perhaps a couple of scenes (not too many at all) are funny, but the story line just has no point to it. It becomes very difficult to keep up with because they keep taking time out to throw in these unnecessary scenes featuring famous celebrities, which becomes just plain annoying after a while.
Last, but not least, not only is Beyonce Knowles a bad actress, but she also makes for a poor sidekick for Austin. Her good-girl professional image is not Austin Powers material. What were they thinking??? C'mon folks, Austin Powers is supposed to be the man! He always gets the girl in the end. What happened here??? He had a sexy, attractive woman like Beyonce Knowles next to him and he was scared to even try anything! Did Austin lose his mojo or what? WHATEVER???
If you wan't real hilarious, tongue in cheek Austin Powers, I recommend getting the first and second of the series. This one, you can skip.
