I really like this movie. It's still shocking even today. I have to say though that the directors commentary that Billy Friedkin made for the DVD is by far the absolute worst I have ever listened to. The whole point of the commentary is to tell the viewer what went on behind the scenes, what the actors thought. I want to know what Linda Blair thought about the climax of the film. Talk about all the people that walked out of the theaters. No. Billy Friedkin just narrates what is happening as it happens. It was like listening to a book on tape as I watched the movie. Example: The scene when Max Von Sydow is walking through the woods and gets the telegram that tells him he's needed in DC. Friedkin literally says "We now see the old priest walking through the woods and then a younger priest run's up and hands him a letter. We don't see the letter but we know what it says. The old priest once again has to face his old nemesis in a battle of good versus evil." What kind of commentary is that? Lame! Boring! One reason why I buy DVD's is because of the extras and especially the commentary. If you want a good commentary check Milla Jovovich in Resident Evil and Polanski's Ninth Gate. Very insightful and entertaining.
