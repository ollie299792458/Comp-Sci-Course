Stevens the Butler (Anthony Hopkins)is master of Darlington Hall in Oxfordshire and of his own emotions ... until Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson) arrives to be the housekeeper. Although there is no overt sexual tension, they grow to love one another. In best British style, the emotions are suppressed for decades.
Kazuo Ishiguro, a Brit with Japanese ancestory, acutely observed the British psyche in the novel. But Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's script for Merchant-Ivory is a rare case where the movie is better than the underlying book. She uses the technique of the epistolary novel (telling a story by letters between two people) and the carefully nuanced voice-overs by Hopkins and Thompson move the complex plot right along.
If you can only picture "Sir Tony" as Hannibal Lecter, you'll be convinced that he is a great actor by this performance in which he ages several decades. Emma Thompson responds with heavily banked fires.
When Hopkins begins a speech, "I must say this, because we may never meet again," you'll feel the tears running down your cheeks. This is a movie to watch time and again.
