Miramax's DVD cover does not mention the film's real subject matter, making it appear to be a romantic comedy when it actually depicts a man dying before his time of cancer. However grim that is in real life, Arcand doesn't succeed in portraying it with any real depth or emotional resonance. On one hand, this film is the usual middle-brow arthouse weepie about parents and children reconciling and celebrating life blah blah blah. On the other hand, it's the work of a bitter, somewhat reactionary old man who, like his characters, feels superannuated by a younger generation (the barbarians of the title?) who don't share his generation's values. This aspect of the film is much more interesting and enjoyable, especially the swipes at Canada's health care system, which all good liberal Americans are expected to envy. It is depicted as corrupt and falling apart, forcing the dying man and his son to drive to Vermont for a PET scan. The ending is undeniably emotionally moving, but any movie about terminal illness and death can't help but be. On the whole, this is a shallow but very watchable movie.
