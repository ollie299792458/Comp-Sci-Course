Oooh no no no! These guys can't be serious. Holmes in "modern" suites and riding cars -- in a world war II setting! I'm well aware of the fact, that Basil Rathbones character by many is regarded as the "classic" Sherlock Holmes, but I just think these 40s interpretations of Conan Doyles stories are a total insult to the author's work. 
OK, there may be a certain "film noire" feeling about the atmosphere, that could come close to aestethics, and Basil Rathbone is probably the one who most accurately LOOKS like the detective in Sidney Pagets drawings. But overall it's just embarrasing watching Holmes talk rapidly in American Bogart style, transported to an environment and time frame that has nothing to do with the original stories or with Victorian England at all. However, these 40s version are splendic examples of the "classic" Hollywood's total lack of respect and self-distance and shows that the Sherlock Holmes stories only can be filmed by English companies and directors to garantee a justifying result; "authentic" and "historical accuracy" must have been totally unknown concepts in America during these years. It's just [sad]!And even though I'm a true fan of early film-making, the acting here is a joke and totally overrated by all too many "experts". 
If you want real authentic film renderings of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, I instead recommend Granadas excellent versions with the genius Jeremy Brett in the title role. Once you've seen these, they'll be the only ones you need.
