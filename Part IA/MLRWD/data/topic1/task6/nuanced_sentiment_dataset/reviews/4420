McCartney attempted to make a movie that combined the immediacy of Let It Be, the day in the life theme of A Hard Days' Night, the adventure of Help!, and the whimsy of Magical Mystery Tour, with mixed results. As movie producer, screen-writer, starring actor, music producer/arranger, music writer/composer, singer/musician, and whatever else, McCartney seems to have taken on too much, which is initially obvious in his deadpan (but not awful) acting. The movie actually has a nice plot, with several subplots, and an uplifting theme, with several nice sub-themes. But McCartney should have thought up a better scenario than Harry getting accidently locked in the rest room with McCartney's valuable master tapes. Maybe he should have had Mr. Bean get on the wrong train and wind up in Moscow with the tapes, or something. But there are some great actors, and musicians, making appearances in the movie. And the music videos, which constitute about 80% of the movie anyway, are terrific. This is a great long-form music video, even if only a fair feature film.
