The Night Stalker introduces to us  has been investigative reporter Carl Kolchak(Darren McGavin).  In this outing his beat is Las Vegas, Nevada, where he find a modern day Count Dracula like serial killer stalking the world famous Las Vegas strip.  The victims had lost all there blood and Kolchak finds out much to the chagrin of his cantankerous boss Anthony Vincenzo(Simon Oakland).
A great supporting cast includes Larry Linville(Major Burns of M.A.S.H), Ralph Meeker, Claude Akins, Charles McGraw and Carol Lynley.

Our second feature "The Night Strangler" has our hero Carl Kolchak, move from Las Vegas Nevada to The Pacific Northwest city of Seattle Washington. This time Kolchak stumbles on a serial killer who hides in the catacombs of the old Seattle Underground which burned down in 1889.  The year the first wave of Killings began and then occur every twenty-one years. The killer is a Civil War doctor who served in the Union Army(shades of "Dorian Grey" in the second feature) who keeps himself young and alive by a secret elixer he produces.  All to the chagrin of his cantankerous boss Tony Vincenzo. Another great TV film with a wonderful cast Margeret Hamilton(Wizard of OZ) Wally Cox(voice of Underdog, and his last appearance), JoAnne Pflug, Al Lewis(Grandpa Munster), and Richard Anderson(Oscar Goldman of "The Six Million Dollar Man and "The Bionic Woman).

In both films he wears a straw hat, bowling shoes and a seer sucker suit.
