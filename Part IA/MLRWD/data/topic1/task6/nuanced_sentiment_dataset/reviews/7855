Okay, first off, I love Bogey, He is one of my favorite actors. And I wasn't born until 1987 so yeah I have awesome taste in film. I even watch ones with subtitles. In fact I don't bother watching movies unless they are in Black and White or have subtitles.

So my reason for giving it two stars? Obviously there is nothing wrong with the actual movie. But this says it is a two disc Special edition. If it is so special, then why didn't mine come with a cool gray fedora or a flask of bourbon? How am I suppose to watch this wonderful "Special" edition without bourbon? It's typical hollywood fat cats creating all kinds of "special" "alternative" "directors'" "extended" editions just so they can sell more copies of the movie. I mean seriously what the heck is wrong with them? Do they not realize that many people rebel against that by downloading through bit-torrents? Next time a production company tries and makes a "Special" edition of a movie with bogey and they don't include a flask or colt revolver, they are simply wasting their and especially the fans' time.
