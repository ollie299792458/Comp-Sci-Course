Shallow Hal was really fantastic. Seriously, I thought it would be another dumb-movie-that-everyone-says-is-funny-but-really-isnt, and it was another great-movie-that-everyone-says-is-funny-and-actually-is. It is a movie about a guy named Hal, who is as shallow as you can go. A guy that only goes for looks, and if there is one flaw, he dumps them...or actually...he gets dumped, but anyway, just when his life is starting to go downhill, he is able to see the beauty inside people, not the beauty on the outside. Then, Hal falls in love with someone who is a wonderful caring person, someone who happens to be one of those people if he really saw the outside, he wouldnt even think of dating. Then everything gets mixed around because of his friend, and he has to get her back. He becomes as deep as can be. Shallow Hal was an awesome movie, and it shows that it is not what is on the outside, but on the inside that counts. No matter how much make-up a girl is wearing, how good a person she is matters more. A great romantic comedy, hilarious and heartwarming...something I never thought I would see under the title of Shallow Hal.
