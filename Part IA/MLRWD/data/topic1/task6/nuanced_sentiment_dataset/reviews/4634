cntn. of the Ong Bak series - This movie picks up where #2 left off. The 3rd installment just failed overall. *spoiler* After a brief 5min. recap of #2 the fighting starts. The first sequence is so far over the top and unrealistic I wanted to drop a hatchet elbow through my tv. I've been a martial arts enthusiast for as long as I can remember an appreciate just about anything they can bring to the screen but, this did it in for me. So after he's beaten to a literal pulp after 15min. or so (we're talking a full swinging battering ram repeatedly striking his skull) the movie deviates on some over dramatic flashback tangent of love, weird camera angles, odd dialogue, and facial expressions. This goes on for 1hr. 15min. By this point you're hoping by some director's epiphany that a jaw dropping fight scene breaks out. Which it does. Unfortunately, it's during the last 8min. of the movie and then the credits roll. It was like the original movie made so much money and was completely awesome that they tried and made a decent 2nd, which has no relation to the 1st, then tried to finish with a crescendo of a 3rd movie and ended up with a mildly-retar*ded little kid playing a kazzoo instead. Bought it to finsh the collection, painfully watched it once, and it will continue to collect dust where it has been laid.
