When I first saw the previews to this I didn't think much of it. I wasn't in a rush to see it. Then some guys at work told me it was hilarious, and my sister incidently rented it one night so I decided to give it a try.

Before I give my review I do want to say that I am an AVID fan of Dane Cook, I remember seeing him on Comedy Central WAY back before he was famous and even THEN his humor was kinda gross and out there... so I was expecting it. But I love his humor nonetheless....

I'm not going to give a synopsis since so many people have but let me tell you, me and my sister were laughing so HARD at some scenes I couldn't breathe and my stomach was hurting!

When they're in his car after Cam locks her keys in her car, she shows him her REALLY bent thumb and he responds with "Holy crap, what'd you get pissed at a stamp???"..... WOOOO....... SO funny!

It is mostly CRUDE gross humor, so you have to LIKE that kind of humor to like this movie...... Yes the plotline could be a little smoother, but who really cares, this is suppose to be a funny movie!
