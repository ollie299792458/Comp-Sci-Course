This review is based on when I saw it in a theater in 1983.  It was better than expected, and not too bloody and gross, but what I remember most is audience laughter in inappropriate places, and a stupid tacked on ending that pretty much ruined all that came before it.  So why did I buy it?  Inexpensive; Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles are fine, and I just wanted to see it again for the good parts.  And without laughter in the wrong places.  For the most part it makes a good companion piece to the original if you own that one.  I don't know if John Gavin was offered a part in this or not. His participation might have made it more interesting.

Since writing this review, I've watched the movie (on Halloween). My star rating remains the same, and I've softened my harsh critique of the ending; it does explain a lot of what happens beforehand.  It's really the last 30 or so seconds that bugged me.  And though the film takes place over several days (if not a couple of weeks), Vera Miles wears the same outfit throughout the movie!  Why did no one notice this?
