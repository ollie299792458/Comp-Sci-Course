When I talk to my friends about the "Batman" movies, and if they like "Batman Forever" or not, it comes out as either they like it or they don't. This is not my favorite "Batman" movie. Mine is  probably the first one, this one comes off as some sort of Jim Carrey wanna  be movie in the realm of "Ace Ventura". Why? Well, casting is  okay, Tommy Lee Jones and Nichole Kidman portray their characters well. Val  Kilmer looks too much the playboy to be a good Batman. A lot of the  "Dark" in "Dark Knight" was lost in this movie. I'm a  Batman fan, but I wasn't suffering because we had gone 2 movies and hadn't  seen Robin. Not that Chris O'Donnell was bad, but Batman had Robin as a  sidekick, not a partner because Batman is a very seperated and dark  character, even from his butler Alfred (Also, I love Alfred in all of the  movies, he's kinda like the Q in the James Bond movies). Maybe that is why  he can't hold down a relationship. The parts where we try to get into  Batman's problems comes off as corney because Batman doesn't seem to be  strugeling with anything in himself, he's just trying to tell Nichole  Kidman that he's Batman.
Above all else, Jim Carrey stole the show and  that is why a majority of people went to see the movie. Plus everything is  just too flashy and neon colored to give the sense of darkness that Tim  Burton's Gotham gave off and is in the comic books. 
After this movie, I  need a shower to clean off the dirty sticky feeling that it gives. I hoped  that the movie following this would be better... but that was the hope  beyond hope.
