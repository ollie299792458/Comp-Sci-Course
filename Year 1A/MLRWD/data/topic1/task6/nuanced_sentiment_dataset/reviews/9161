I enjoy horror films, and have seen a lot of bad ones. Dead End isn't 'bad', it just isn't all that good. The acting wasn't bad, it was a bit above average. On the plus side the main characters seemed to be all what you would find in a slightly dysfunctional family, no one is overly bad or overly good, which served to make all of them just a little more believable. What hurt the film more than anything was missing so many opportunities to create a real sense of suspense or terror or even moments of surprise. The story also lacks a creative sense of ambiguity, a sense of what's really happening? You do get some sense of necessary confusion, a sense of hopelessness that anyone can get out of this alive, and a bit of wonder at what has happened that the family seems to travel endlessly down the same track as they are struck down. But there is not enough of a question of where everything is going, more a bit of magicians misdirection. So, if you just need an hour and twenty minutes of misdirection Dead End may be a good choice, just, don't buy it, it's a watch once and move on kinda film.
