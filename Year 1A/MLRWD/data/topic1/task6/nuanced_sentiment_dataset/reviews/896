My family are HUGE Disney fans and thus we were very excited to have this new Diamond Edition release as we are always looking to keep up on the times and have great movies to boot in our collection. In watching this, I have to say that they have come so far since the VHS tape version of this movie that we still have. The digital quality on this Diamond edition was amazing, and the movie itself just explodes from the screen (let alone the sound that you get as well).

On top of this, you also get an amazing array of bonus features on this that allow you to go behind the scenes to see some things that have not been released in the past and some that have, but that were still great to view again. I loved the Tangled short that was included on this as it was definitely one that was worth watching over and over again.

All-in-all this was a definite upgrade for my family in regards to quality and my girls simply adored watching the movie again and even they reacted (at least my oldest did) about how great it sounded.

If you are looking to add a great Disney movie to your collection, this is definitely one to bring home today!
