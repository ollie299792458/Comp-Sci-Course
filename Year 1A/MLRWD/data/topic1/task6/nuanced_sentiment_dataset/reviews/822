The first "Halloween" is a seminal event in horror films.  It started the slasher genre.  While "Halloween 4" does not measure up to the original, or to the high production values of "Halloween  H20", it is the best of the "second series", the three films  of lesser quality produced between 1988 and 1995.  Halloween 4 is  entertaining and returns Michael Myers to his post as the king of the movie  slashers: a superhuman engine of destruction nearly unstoppable by his  all-too-human opponents.  What few realize is there there is a story to the  Halloween films, as the viewer tries to figure out Michael and why he does  what he does.  Unlike a lot of slasher films (Friday the 13th, etc), the  Halloween films are just as much mystery or suspense as horror.  Halloween  4 is not the film to jump into the series with, but for fans of Michael  Myers, who want to see him at his best with a minium of backstory,  Halloween 4 is hard to beat.  It is a key brick in Michael Myers' legend,  even though the film makes little sense and has little appeal out of the  context of the ongoing series.
