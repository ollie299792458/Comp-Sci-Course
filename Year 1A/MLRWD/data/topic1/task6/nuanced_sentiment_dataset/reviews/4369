I rented this movie mainly because of the talented cast, including Winona Ryer, Paul Rudd, Liev Schriber, Janeane Garofalo, Ron Silver, Famke Jansen, Gretchen Mol, Jessica Alba, and Oliver Platt. What were these actors thinking being in this mediocre "comedy"? They deserve a better movie.

The film seems to be impressed with how "wacky" it is. Ha, ha. Instead, it's just silly and stupid. We have two black 20 year olds born to a white couple who wonder about their paternity. The mother thinks it's Arnold Schwarzenegger and hires an actor (Oliver Platt) to pretend to be him. Then the mother realizes the boys' father is really Arsenio Hall. So the actor, who can't do an Arsenio impression, does Eddie Murphy. A woman (Winona Ryder) gets married after her other fiance falls out of a plane and get surgically stuck in the ground. Then she falls for a ventriloquist's dummie and has sex with it and leaves her husband for it. Another sketch is about a woman (Gretchen Mol) whose husband likes to hang out around the house with his other male friends naked rather than go to church. Another tale is a raunchy, offensive cartoon about a rhino who likes to gossip and whose lies lead to grisly deaths by sex.

Doesn't really make any sense, does it? What does any of this have to do with the Ten Commandments? Nothing, really. It's just unfunny nonsense instead of sharp, humorous satire. If you want to see a funny, controversial film that deals with the Bible, check out Kevin Smith's Dogma instead.
