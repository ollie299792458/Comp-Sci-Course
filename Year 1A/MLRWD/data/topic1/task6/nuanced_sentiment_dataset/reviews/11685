But try and see this too if you can. I gave this three stars to cut the difference. There times where its a five star experience -- when the little girl sings "The Times They Are A Changin'" in a pure, clear voice. I suppose it was a one star experience when I just could not stand one more moment of the poetico profundo hipster scat dialogue pouring out of the characters' mouths. And it would slide back and forth -- 1 to 5 to 1 . . . -- while a mad prophet played by Val Kilmer spouted forth insane profundities.

I think this whole movie is more about experience than story. It is profane and divine, clear eyed and full of poo, full of wrath and compassion, funny and tragic, artful and artless, a confusing mess -- sorta like life. It reminded me of a plotless Flannery O'Connor story. A lovely film to look at, the music is of course awesome.

I only wish the DVD had the lil concert Bob and his band performed for the crew as a special feature. I suppose in a few years it will be released.
