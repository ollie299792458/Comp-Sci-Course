In "An Evening with Kevin Smith," the writer and director of "Clerks," "Mallrats," "Chasing Amy," "Dogma," and "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" gives an interesting behind-the-scenes insight into movie making, as well as his outrageous views on pop culture.
The film is comprised of clips from seminars at universities across the country. In addition to a surprise appearance by his on-screen "hetero life-mate" Jason Mewes, Smith takes questions from the audience consisting of not only university students, but also fans of his movies. The huge size of the audience (some are in the thousands) is a testament to how large the cult following of Kevin Smith actually is.
Throughout "Evening" Smith gives the audience a laugh a minute, displaying his natural sense of humor that can be seen in all of his movies. Among the subjects covered are: how he chose Mewes for the part of Jay, and why  Smith's character "Silent Bob" is  silent? He also discusses how "hurtful" it was when he met his wife, and his appearance on the cover of the pot-legalization magazine "High Times."
On a more serious note, Smith talks about his controversial religious film "Dogma", and reveals, among other things, how many death threats he received because of it.
Probably the most fascinating parts of "Evening" are when Smith talks about some of the unusual movie projects he has been asked to contribute to. He reveals at great lengths the inside stories on: writing the script for a new "Superman" movie; and the documentary he filmed on pop star Prince that will probably never be seen. He says he did them because he is, in his own words, a "press whore."
Finally, he answers the question he gets from his fans probably more than any other: will there be another "Jay and Silent Bob" movie?
In conclusion, if you're like me and you are a fan of Kevin Smith's five films, this video is well worth the price. Smith is just as entertaining answering questions as he is in his movies.
