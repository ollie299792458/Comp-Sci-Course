You know I have been a fan of the Simpsons since the first episode.  NEVER did see it on the Tracy Oldman show.

Now, I understood when they started releasing the seasons on DVD about putting supporting characters on the packaging.  But since they started that the last few seasons have NOT been if this makes sense major minor supporting characters.  Kang or Kodos?  How about Barney, Moe, Mr. Burns or Flanders?

Then making this themed after Kang & Kodos THEN releasing it December 2011?  Sure, you need that to promote Christmas.  And, why December 2011 & season 13 released August 2010?  What was with the delay?  At least they did NOT do what they did for several years-release it Christmas week.

Aren't we glad they stopped the starting each season AFTER Halloween making Treehouse of Terror the 1st episode of the season?  This was 1st season they did this.  Stupid idea, post season baseball but why miss September?

This season was also the down fall I noticed of how funny the shows were.  My favorite episode on disc 1 "How I Spent My Strummer Vacation" with Mick and Keith.  Disc 3 "Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington" featuring Krusty is good as well.

Now, the DVD packaging  is TERRIBLE.  Hard to get the discs out in this horrible design.
