Eric Thal is truly the greatest American thespian ever to grace the silver screen.  Did anybody else notice that he mostly acts with his mouth?  Like, when he was taken over by the alien, he opened his mouth real wide cause now he's EVIL Eric Thal.  And then when Julie Warner has that happen to her, and at the end (which I won't give away, even though it's like a Mack Truck rumbling down a residential street, pretty hard not to see it coming), Thal's got his mouth open real wide again.  That's the DISTRESSED Eric Thal, I suppose.
Rest of the cast is a B-movie lovers gallery.  Marshall Bell, Yaphet Kotto, the guy who played the President, and the guy who played the President's head of security (I've seen both of them elsewhere), oh, and who could forget the guy who plays Thal's partner whose name I just can't place right now.  He's awesome, too.
The movie itself?  Well, aside from Eric Thal's BIG FAT MOUTH OF EVIL DISTRESS, it's a guilty pleasure movie at best, laughable joke at worst.  Worth renting so you too can feel the power of THE MOUTH OF THAL.
