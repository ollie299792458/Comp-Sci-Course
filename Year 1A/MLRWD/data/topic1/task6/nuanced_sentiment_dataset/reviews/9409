I don't remember seeing the Johnny Cash show when it first aired,(I was too young)and I don't think my parents do too. They always liked country music and had Hee-Haw, The Tommy Hunter show, Dolly, Barbera Mandrell, etc. on the T.V.(that much I do remember)so, they probably did watch this show. I never cared much for country music when I was young but when Johnny came on T.V. well, that was different.I always found him different from the other country hick singers of the time, he seemed more of a rebel, dangerous, you'd almost say with his deep voice, black clothes and dark music.
  Fast-forward to today. As I've grown older I've gained an appreciation for those corny hick country stars of yesteryear I used to scoff at. When I viewed part of this DVD compilation on PBS, I was intrigued and very thankful that somebody had the forsight to create this time capsule ,of sorts, for future fans to see. I bought this for my parents for chistmas and have heard nothing but good reviews from them (hopefully they'll let me watch it one of these days).So buy it!!!
