The main problem with this film was that if you read the 6 story comic book that this movie was to take after you would have been pissed to find out that they completely changed the story line of this film.  There was no league of assasins, no cloth making materials, no freakin killing for the purpose of others.  The real story was that Wesly's father was part of a group who were villians all the villians got together killed all the super heros of the world and divided the world amongst themselves.  One of the supervillians wanted to come out of hidding instead of ruling behind the scenes because the portion of the world he received wasnt that profitable.  Wesley's father was actually in the book started out in a 3-some with two other guys while video taping it.  So how in the world did this come out I will never know.  The character in the comic book were not hero's and raped, murdered, and killed for fun.  How do you change that by making a movie.  The problem with movie companies is that they are afraid to go towards the actual transistions of the film because it might not be profitable or because its a little to raunchy for the thearter.  You knew what the story was about but you chopped it up and made it about bullet bending when in the comic book only a few characters knew how to do it.

But I guess if you only saw the movie it wasnt that bad but you really need to read the comic book because I myself am not a comic book reader a friend of mine put me on and when I read the first book I couldnt wait for the next and since it only came out with 6 books was like what in the world I had to buy my own greater story in the comic book with real a**holes and Wesley wasnt all that nice either.
