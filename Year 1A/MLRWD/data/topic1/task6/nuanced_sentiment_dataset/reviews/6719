So said the tv spots for this Mel Gibson crime/caper flick.  And make no doubt about it; Mel's a thieving, conniving, murderous thug, but what makes you root for him is his dogged determination to get what is rightfully his.  This film is a throwback to the old gangster dramas, along the  lines of old Cagney films, but it's much more brutal and vicious.  It's  full of great moments, and Mel never once steps out of character making his  performance that much more believable.  Even Kris Kristofferson's good in  it, and that's sayin' somethin'!  Throw in the luscious Lucy Liu and you've  got a good flick.  Still don't think Mel can pull off playing a scumbag?  See this one and be proved wrong.  As James Coburn states in the film,  "Man, you're just mean!"  My favorite part of the movie is the  first ten minutes, as Mel goes from being bleeding and busted to having a  good suit, a pocket full of money and a credit card, and it's all 'cause  he's a slick S.O.B.  Based on the book "The Hunter," by Richard  Stark and directed by L.A. Confidential's Brian Helgeland.
