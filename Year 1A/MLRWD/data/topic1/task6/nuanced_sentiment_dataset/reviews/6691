Read the book in back in the 1980's...just so there's no confusion.

Okay, now to the movie. First of all, at 98 minutes, this movie was
just WAY too short! I'd really love to know what ended up on the
cutting room floor, and whether any of that footage could have helped
flesh out what's otherwise a pretty decent movie anyways.

Remember that this movie came out just a few years after the release
of The Quest for Fire. Before that, there was what...One Million BC
staring Raquel Welch, The Flintstones, It's About Time...any wonder
those cave guys in those GEICO commercials get so upset?

Hey, given the time-frame this movie had to work with, I believe it
turned out pretty darned good! Locations and sets worked well, the
acting was believable, and the story line kept the feel of the book.
And let's be real...Daryl Hannah simply looked GOOD running around in
that pre-historic bathrobe! My only compliant is the length of the
movie...and that a sequel was never made!
