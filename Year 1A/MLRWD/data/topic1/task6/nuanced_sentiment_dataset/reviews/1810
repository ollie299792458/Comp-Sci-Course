One wonders exactly what the amazon.com reviewer was expecting when he looked at this film.  There are some movies that win by style and spirit alone, and Rock & Rule is definitely one of those.

It is a memorable animated feature if for no other reason than by virtue of Mok, who I think is one of the best animated screen villains of ALL time...a devilish cross between Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed (with songs by two of those actual artists!).

The story and characters may be on the preposterous side, but if you're looking for "anime-style" hardcore sci-fi geekouts you have come to the wrong piece of entertainment, my friends.  This movie is about the power of ROCK MUSIC, both the camraderie and force of good spirits it can give and the evil mass-control it can harness.  And the early use of computer graphics is not only historically interesting but well incorporated into the piece--the animation quality is excellent, as are all the voice performances.

The soundtrack is too good to be true and ties everything together in great form, becoming a part of the narrative and not simply promotional 'decoration.'

This is one of the most eagerly awaited 'lost' animated films for good reason.  I don't think it's a film for everyone.  But for those who can enjoy Rock & Rule it will be like "sugar on the tongue"--something that for me at least, I come back to repeatedly over the years or even decades to feel good while watching and be thoroughly entertained.
