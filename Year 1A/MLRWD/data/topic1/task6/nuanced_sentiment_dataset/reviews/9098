This movie is rather typical of its genre, college age kids go to an exotic locale with the intent of drinking and debauchery, but then find themselves in a struggle for survival.  In this instance a group is lured to a secret hideaway of a mad doctor who is in the black market organ donation business.  He bills himself as a patriotic sort who wishes to make available to locals the organs that otherwise would go to big city American hospitals for wealthy clients.

So the scenes unfold in the Amazonian jungles.  There is suspense and the usual cast of attractive yet stupid characters.  As you watch this there is the dual question of which girl will undress and which of the group will be killed next.  But there is a fair amount of suspense as the chase moves through the jungle and into a river with underwater caves.  The problem here is these kids seem to know which direction to swim even though they have never been here before.  But it does have its entertainment value as the scenes are well acted and well filmed.

In the end there is really nothing remarkable about this film.  There are some survivors of the group, and it can pretty well be predicted which individuals do survive, but the film has somewhat of a pleasant ending.  However, we really don't know how they were able to fly without their passports and money, which had been stolen earlier.  I guess dad found a way to bail them out.
