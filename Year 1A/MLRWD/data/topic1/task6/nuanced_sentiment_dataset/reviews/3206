The DVD set "M*A*S*H:  The Martinis and Medicine Collection" has effectively brought together all the hilarity and hijinks of the doctors and nurses of the 4077th, over 11 seasons, in one place.  It has given me hours of enjoyment, even late into the night when I am on my laptop.

Unlike other reviewers who claim that the sleeves in which the discs are packaged damage the DVDs, I have had no such trouble.  I have kept the discs in the original packaging and they play perfectly.  The retrospective booklet has the episodes listed in broadcast order, which discs they are on, and gives a very brief synopsis of each; the pictures contained in it have brought back memories of this popular series, which I had begun watching in my younger years.

The bonus material is excellent, with interviews from cast and crew members, and gives the viewer behind-the-scenes looks at the series and insights from those who worked on the project.  My favorite "extra" is the quiz game, although you really need to know your M*A*S*H trivia to get to the highest rank (Lieutenant Colonel).

The package itself, which is made to look like a large hardcover book, with sleeves that fold out and a "clipboard" on the inside front cover, was a stroke of genius.  The "book" approach to creating the packaging is original and makes for a great collector's item.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the series or who is looking for the perfect gift for a M*A*S*H lover.
