I guess the people that review this film are mainly the ones that like this type of genre and hence will bias more toward favorable reviews (this is true of most non mainstream stuff I think).  Bias aside, the movie is revolutionary in its technique of artisticially portrayal of reality.  I guess if you were a smart enough, you would pick up on the ironies and subtleness of the film - whether this is intentional or not I do not know.  The film suffers from a bit of overacting on certain members (I won't name them, but it is obvious) of the cast, and the film simply does not exploit the medium of the drawing over the film enough to justify it in the first place.  I would have enjoyed this film, just as much for example.. if it had not been painted over.  If they paint it over, they might as well exploit it more - like putting in more hallucinegetic visuals, or whatever.  Reasons for owning this is that is is unique, some of the dialogue is good, and of course it has Winona Ryder in it (if you are a Winona fan).
