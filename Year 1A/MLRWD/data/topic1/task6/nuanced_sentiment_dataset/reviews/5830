There's a bit where our protaganist is trying to get buzzed into his dealer's apt. bdlg. and the dealer keeps buzzing too soon for him to open the door, so it goes on...back and forth. This is supposed to be funny. There  is another bit where, when they are on the run, they figure out they've been set up so one of them smashes a bong over the guys head then apologizes for breaking his bong....or when the antaganist finally gets his comeuppance by having his charred body  supeonaed...I gues that's the uh..climax? This is an offensive movie. Offensive on many levels, seeing young kids smoke pot is not funny on any level, and putting young actors in that position...I guess this is mild in today's new cynicism but I was taken aback at the demeanor and content of that scene. The protaganist is such an unpleasant guy to be around, 'an obnoxious fat turd,' as he calls himself, or something to that effect; his voice grating like sandpaper on a flesh wound, his dishelved body odor practically creeping out of my screen. But then he surruounds himself with even lower life forms, as he himself says, 'why would you ever hang out with your drug dealer?' yes and why spend over 2 friggin hours with them?? Just scene after excruciating scene of dialouge snd scene construction about being stoned, and oh let the hi-jinx begin! I couldn't even watch this stoned, it would make me cry at the time I was wasting. I mildly chuckled with the driving with the foot out of the windshield, but man..nothing, not even the plot twist where the bad guys assume our hero is some kind of spy, made me laugh.
