HOODWINKED is proof that a cartoon does not have to have the best animation or even the best artwork to be truly excellent. Made by a pair of brothers no one has even heard of, Tom and Cory Edwards, and distributed by the Weinstein brothers of Miramax fame, HOODWINKED provides a new and very twisted take on the Little Red Riding Hood fable. The plot as such involves someone stealing pastry recipes and plays out like RASHOMON, in that it ends up being told from various participants' perspectives. While the execution of the cartoon leaves something to be desired -- this is no SHREK or ICE AGE or MONSTERS INC. or even ROBOTS -- the story is absolutely hilarious and the characters (voiced by Andy Dick, Puddy, Glenn Close and Anne Hathaway) are wonderfully fleshed out. Some of the dialog is to die for, and plays equally well to adults and children. Just as importantly, HOODWINKED is a full-blown musical, and the music is as every bit as good as the dialog. The highlight is a number sung by a cursed billy goat (don't ask) as he explains his curse to Red and then takes her on the ride of her life. Many movies are referenced in HOODWINKED, including XXX, THE MATRIX and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, and there is a bizarre extreme sports sequence involving Red's surprisingly athletic grandmother. Oh, and the Three Little Pigs make a guest appearance as three klutzy cops. Enjoy. I know I and my family sure did.
