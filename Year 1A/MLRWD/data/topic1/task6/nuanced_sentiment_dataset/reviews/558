I watched this movie with my 4 year old daughter just tonight. It is supposed to be the story of Aladdin from the "Thousand and one nights" also known as "Arabian nights". The problem is that it deviates from the true story in many ways. For example there is no "ring" or its Genie in the movie at all. There are additions such as the monkey turned elephant as well. In fact there are so many other deviations that it would take me a whole day to mention. However to be fair, this is not unique to this movie. Most movies, Disney in particular tend to rewrite master pieces resulting in vastly modified stories.

Now this modified story, is perfectly OK by itself and my daughter loved it. There are some clear attempts to make the story appealing to adults. But then it helps to have parents interested! The songs are good and kids love them.

As for the politically correct change from the first Disney release i.e. replacing the  arab stereotyping, it is not unique. Disney also replaced a particularly offensive (stereotyping of africans) part of Fantasia in their DVD offer. My feeling is that we could all do with less racism and if it means  removing offensive scenes and language we should do so. Besides this movie was never the real story anyway and the "non-PC" part hardly contributed anything. After all the value of the movie is not in how many people it hurts. My advise is: If you want the real story, please read the book.

On the whole, this is a great movie, just not the real story!
