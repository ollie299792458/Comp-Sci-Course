I'll keep it short and sweet. The movie was adorable. Of course the returning cast completely set the mark of the movie. So much of each character has come into their own. I'll agree that Wade is more comfortable in his own skin as an "out" gay man and Noah has completely grown into a very inspirational/encourging young man as well, seeing as though throughout seasons 1 and 2 he was seeking the advice of his friends, now his calming advice seems to help reconcile the others "troubled" relationships (both)as previously mentioned in the JTB photo shoot interview) I believe Noah and Wade (maybe unintentionally) switched roles in this movie. I can't really explain my reasonings for this but Noah has seemingly become the "steady ground" in Wade's life, of course Wade still continues to "carry Noah"... but then again that'd only seem right... seeing as though Noah's quest to "win Wade back" in Season 2 appeared impossible considering Wade's (somewhat) loyalty to Dre' minus the two times they cheated w/ each other, but in their defense, both times (after Noah bailed Wade out of jail and the beach) with such passion between two ppl, it'd sure to lead to sex. In JTB, Noah and Wade's relationship has definitely evolved from both seasons and their chemistry stronger.

**SPOLIER ALERT** Noah brought out alittle of "Alex" in himself in the movie, which was cute, especially in the hot tub when assumingly they were all playing drunk drinking "blue gatarade" I mean, Hypnotic...lol... One (I have many) of my favorite scene is in the house during Noah's accidental phone call to Wade's mother, and the ARC, all drunk, sat there laughing at Noah's drunken attempt to get her to the wedding, Ricky especially. I admit I was laughting too when Wade's mother asks "Wade's getting Married?" "And who are you the pastor?" LMBO. And toward the end during the conversation with Noah and his mom. Mother: "Your father really wanted to be here but he had to go stay with his mother" Noah: "Grandma, she ok?" Mom: "Yeah, she fell". "Bruised her hip" "Drunk ole battle axe" Noah: "Mom" Mom: "Oh, she's fine"...lol. (sounds like my mom in refernce to my dad's mom)

Ok, back to the movie... I wish Trey would've appeared in the movie. His and Alex relationship has grown on me, after watching both seasons. However with watching the movie twice, I still can't really place where Brandy and Baby Gat fits into the movie... **SPOILER ALERT** Although Baby Gat falling into the water and then stripping bare naked and running to the hot tub was hilarious and Brandy's kitchen conversation w/ Alex was cute- her and Beyonce' twins...lol... their characters seem unrealistic... BUT on another note since they did return to the movie, I'm glad the orginal actors were not replaced. The only part I'm in the dark about is the webcam conversation between Alex and Trey (toward the beginning of the movie) and whateva it was Trey asked if Alex would tell Noah... that was never clarified, unless I missed something or he was talking about their martial problems (which I doubt) Anyway, I said I would keep it short, so all in all, I enjoyed the movie and has watched it repeatedly. I became a fan alittle late in the game, but hey I'm here now... Well... enough for now... (in the voice of Brandy) *Toodles*
