With no prompting or knowledge of this movie, I took the plunge since I'm a fan of late 60s - 70s shows.

Given the vintage, this watch follows many of the devices of modern movies.  Thus, I wasn't quite as entertained as I usually am with these types of shows.  Although not a fan of too much dialogue, this film lacked the lines where they would have been useful.

The style and scenes of the era are always nice.  There wasn't much wasted time on development of character, which is a plus, too.

Those of you who prefer characters with simple motives, Walker will join your list of favorites.  All demand can be reduced to a basic element and Walker's is retrieving stolen cash.  And I particularly admired his resistance to distraction from shapely dames and conversations therewith.  Surely, you will find his focus on task refreshing given most characters seem to have the attention span of a gnat.

And, Angie Dickinson is an even trad-off for the hip stuff.
