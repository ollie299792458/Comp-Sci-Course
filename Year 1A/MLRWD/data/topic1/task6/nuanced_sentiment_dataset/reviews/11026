Some people say that you shouldn't compare books to movies, generally the people who haven't read the books, but when a movie is based off of a book of course you should compare it and judge it on whether it kept the integrity of the author's story, and this movie did not. The book was all about growing up as an american teenage girl and having this whole secret life of being a werewolf, of wanting to fit in, and be understood, but always being set apart. When making the movie they increased her age moved the movie across to a whole different continent, and basically turneed it upside down. All they really kept the same from the book to the movie was the names. Our main character doesn't even end up with the man she's supposed to. Not to mention they turned the good guys into bad guys and the villains into good guys. Even when not compared to the books, the effects were awful and the plot or point of the story was almost non-existent. This movie was awful and was not worth the money I spent to buy my ticket.
