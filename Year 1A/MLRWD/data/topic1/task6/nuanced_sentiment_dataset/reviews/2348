I cant even give this a NO rating ! This movie if you want to call it that was just awful I mean awful ! And stupid ! Silly ! Bad acting !

What were these people thinking ?

The original was so MUCH better ! There was mystery ! Whos calling the girls ?  Where is he ? Who is he ? Did they get him at the end ?

I am so disgusted with this remake !

If youre smart you'll rent this at the Redbox for a buck and its not even worth that much , DO NOT buy this if you saw the original as a kid and were scared out of your mind !

This cheap remake is NOTHING like the original and what the hell was the hospital scene about ?

Where were the police telling the girls or girl " the caller is coming from inside the house " ?

This is trash ! And poor Andrea Martin she was in the original as the student in this shes the house mother and it doesnt go over very well , but I still love her !

These other so called actors , um why dont they go to commercials like um Lee nail press ons !
