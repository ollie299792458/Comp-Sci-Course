This movie is the worst and I mean the WORST movie I have ever seen! I don't know what Hackman was thinking but I gotta tell you he wasn't when he agreed to make this flop. Here's a clue for you, if a movie comes out on DVD a month after it was in the theaters it's a BAD movie. I can't find 1 good thing about this movie, not the actors (By the way the lead Owen Wilson  will not get many scrips after this movie, I hope). Not the director (John Moore), After a successful career in TV commercials, were he should have stayed. This is his movie debut by the way and I hope it's his last. I just can't say enough bad things about this movie. If you waste the [item price] on this you will be saying the same things. This movie is so dumb it's laughable. My best laugh came when he (Wilson) has to use a satellite radio but has to climb on top of a mountain to get better reception. LOL and all these 50 or more guys chasing him that were 100 yards behind him are nowhere in sight after he gets up there. LOL. this is just plan bad. DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY. And just because I make really good movies dosen't mean I won't say when one is good that I didn't make.
