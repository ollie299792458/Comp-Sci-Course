This adaptation is faithful to story line and accents, etc.  My problem is with the story itself.  I think its time has passed.  This story portrays a time when upper class children forced servants to their knees to shine shoes, threatened servants with punishment, and made 70 year olds stand at attention.  It is also rooted in a time when it was acceptable for parents to care nothing for their children's upbringing and to leave it all to servants--thus the mother and father who didn't love the girl Mary and left her in a cholera epidemic, and the father who neglected Colin to the point that the boy became psychosomatically disabled and left him to the care of a doctor who wanted the boy dead.  Unlike Dickens or Austen whose writings overtly criticize such societal evils, this story takes a neutral (or even positive) stance.  I wouldn't want my kids to watch this.  I would have to explain to them the thoughtless, cruel, savagely proud demeanor of the children in the story.

If you are watching this for engaging entertainment, I can only say I found it slow paced in the extreme.  The Yorkshire accents (not at all helped by poor sound quality) will leave many Americans (especially children) unable to follow the dialogue. Cinematography was also less than the usual BBC quality.
