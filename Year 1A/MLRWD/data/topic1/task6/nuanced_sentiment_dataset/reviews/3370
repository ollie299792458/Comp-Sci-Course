I saw it in theaters and liked it, but not too much.  It was funny, but something irked me about it.  After watching it a second time, I think I figured out what it was.  The hangover was fantastical.  It never asked you to believe the events in the movie.  I thought it was funny, but yearned for a more realistic comedy, which is what Tucker's movie should have been.  Three friends at law school could have actually done everything in this movie.  However, this movie seems to be at odds with the role it should have played.  From the first mention of the midget in the beginning of the movie, I knew exactly how it would end.  When Tucker revealed his affair with the midget, was it really a surprise to anyone?  That story line fell flat.  Maybe it would have been different if I had not been familiar with Tucker's oeuvre.  I think that Tucker had an excellent opportunity to make a realistic version of the hangover that could have rung very true to its viewers. Unfortunately, he created an ambitious movie, which tries to do too much.  The best comedic timing in the movie I think was when Tucker himself gives the terrible best man speech in the wedding scene.  A lot of the actors could have benefited well from more takes; the dialogue in a lot of the movie seems a bit forced.
