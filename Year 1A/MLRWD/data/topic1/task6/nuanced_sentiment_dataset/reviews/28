This original video "Anne of Green Gables" and its sequel,  "Anne of Avonlea" faithfully capture the delightful and inspiring  stories of the series of "Anne of Green Gables" books.  The  videos are favorites of me and my daughters -- perfect for rainy weekends  or days they stay home from school due to illness.  I am saddened to see  that the original is out-of-print and encourage the studio to re-release  it.  (Perhaps if demand is high enough, they will!)  
Unfortunately, we  recently tuned into the new PBS production of "Anne:  The Continuing  Tales."  This was a monumental disappointment that I can only liken to  "The Godfather Part III."  Although the Anne stories written by  Lucy Maud Montgomery continue through her marriage, career and children,  the producers of this movie discarded any relationship to the charming  original stories or the memorable original characters.  They merely  borrowed the names of the characters and then created a highly unbelievable  scenario that bore no hint of continuity between the fiercely independent,  fiery, patriotic, and highly moral Anne, her bosom buddy Diana, or her  sweetheart Gilbert.  Throw in a baby who cries throughout the entire video,  some unbelievable WWI scenarios and politically correct but anachronistic  "anti-war" sentiments, and you end up with a despicable mess.  
If you loved the original books or videos, STAY FAR AWAY from "The  Continuing Story" so that you don't taint your fond memories.  And if  you haven't already seen the videos of "Anne of Green Gables" or  "Anne of Avonlea," then do whatever it takes to see them as soon  as possible.  (Don't wait for a rainy weekend!)
