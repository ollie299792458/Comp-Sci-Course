Cary Grant & Rosalind Russell star in a classic that began on the stage. Because of those theatrical roots, there is an atmosphere here at work that is seldom seen in movies today. You will never see more characters on screen at the same time trying to talk over each other. You have to see the movie numerous times to catch all the witicisms, so imagine how the play must have been. Cary Grant is perfect in this role, and really gets to play the center of the universe of this film. Rosalind Russell plays a great star reporter/ex-wife to Grant, the editor of a newspaper. The swarm of other characters that revolve around these two are perfect, fiancees, future mother-in-laws, reporters, civil servants. Years Later, in the fifties, Jack Lemmon and the late great Walter Mathau tried to remake this film, obviously without the romantic undertones. They may have been the only two with enough screen chemistry to even attempt this recreation. Unfortunately it just never worked, some masterpieces just can't be redone.
