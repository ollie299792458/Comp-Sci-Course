The Extras on this DVD make it worth a look, but honestly you could skip the movie and get more enjoyment out of the disc.  I Can not believe this movie got released as is.  The story IS remenicent of the first MIB but I don't fault that; I mean how many sequels have there been that simply rehash original material.  The big problem I had with this film was that it only gives a cursory glimps of the plot line, the movie feels so rushed I thought I was being brushed off by someone who had something better to do.  If the film had been given the time to develop all its ellements I think there would have been a good movie in it, but as it is the runing time is just around 1hr 20min and in the day and age of 3hr versions of LOTR and 2hr 45min of Harry Potter I think a great injustice was done to this production by not fleshing it out fully.  There were some good points in the performances... but without the time to really develope the characters even these great actors have a tendency to appear wooden and in some cases bored.  The aliens were of course a high point but without a good story to present them it seemed more like a pagent for animatronics and CGI; "here is alien pupet #1"  "here is alien computer grafic #5" "aren't they beautiful" this gets tedious after a while no matter how beautiful Rick Bakers work is.
The Extras have some real pluses though, and I found them all very worth while, the Blooper real is side spliting.  The Special efects docu shorts aren't as good as the ones included on the Episode I disc but are still very interesting.  And far and above everything else is the animated short film called "Attack of the Chub Chubs" this is totally hilarious, one of the best short subjects you will ever see... I rank it right up there with "For the Birds" which is included on the Monsters Inc DVD.
BOTTOM LINE: If you don't expect much from this DVD you will be satisfied by it, but if you expect the magic of MIB I you will probably be angery and sad.
