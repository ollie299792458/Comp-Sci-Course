I heard great things about this movie, so perhaps my expectations were unfairly high when I finally got around to watching it.

The acting was really excellent - I've always been a Keri Russel fan, and she really shines in this movie. I was expecting her to reprise her Felecity character, but as Jenna in this film she was entirely different than I've ever seen her - she really proved her acting skills here.

The other actors were excellent as well, which automatically put this movie a step above the average film.

So why the 3 star rating? Frankly, it was just a bit too slow. I've always been a fan of the more subtle Indie films over big blockbusters, but this one just didn't have quite enough going on to keep my interest. As I said, the acting was good, but that can only carry so far when the characters have nowhere to go and nothing to do. Although perhaps the entire point of the movie was to show a slice of "real life," in which case it perhaps wasn't my type of film.

The other minor criticism I have is the ending - I won't go into detail because I don't want to ruin it, but I did feel that Jenna acted a bit out of character. I didn't quite buy the quick turn around in attitude.
