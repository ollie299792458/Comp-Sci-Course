The typical teen movie has a lot of gross jokes and an air of comedy in it. So does a mickeytake movie like Scary Movie.
Scary Movie worked cause the films it parodies are serious, and so you can make a funny version and it's cool. 
With the teen comedies parodied in this movie there was already humour and gross jokes, so the crew made the mistake of having more extreme jokes than the films they parody, which ends up rather OTT and too forced to be funny.
Take the scene where the horny school guys are in a ventilation pipe above the girls' toilet watching a student take a dump. This could have been funny handled well, but the pipe collapses and so does the floor of the toilet when the guys land in it, resulting in the toilet and the students crashing into the classroom below, and tons of fake turd going everywhere and covering everyone. Little kids might laugh at the presence of fake turd, but most people who watch this genre of movie (mid to late teens) will think this is really lame. Sadly a lot of the jokes in the movie are the same.
There are some good parts to this movie, but they are generally short, spread out and they don't do enough to make the movie good. See this at the cinema if nothing else is on, and don't buy it.
