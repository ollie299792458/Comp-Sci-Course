This film I thought was alright. I did get to see Zangief fight some little kid which was hilarious and the animation is fairly good in my opinion. But other then that this film dissapointed me a little for these reasons: The lack of characters and the characters that did show up had very short scenes other then Ryu, Ken, and Chun Li which I guess why there were not much cameos they concentrated on the most popular characters in the whole Street Fighter series, I never heard of the main villain, confusing story that never showed up in the Alpha games, sentimental story line, and most importantly of all not enough fighting and the fight scenes that did show up were really short. Oh yeah another reason is Akuma's crappy cameo and how can they kill off one of the characters in the game even if he is not that popular unless that was apart of his orginal story line in the first Street Fighter game and thats why he did not show up in any of the other sequels of Street Fighter. But at least I got to see Zangief beat up a little kid. Stick to the games any other media of Street Fighter dissapoints if your a big fan of the games. Nothing I hate more then changing the orginal storys of characters.
