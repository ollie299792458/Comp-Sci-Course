Based on the novel of the same name by world famous Texas author Larry McMurtry, the movie "The Last Picture Show" takes its name from an all-too-common event in the slow decline of small towns on the High Plains--the closing of a vital business or key institution. The last meal served in a restaurant, the last gallon of gas sold by a service station, the last class meeting before the school closed, the last car sold by a dealership, the last sale at a grocery store, the last withdrawal at a bank as well as the last movie shown at the theater--all these closings become memorable, if sad, events in the gradual decline of community life. Without groundbreakings, grand openings or other usual markers of growth and progress to celebrate, what else is there to remember? Though the movie was made a third of a century ago and set two decades before that, the depopulation and decline it depicted have continued into the 21st century. However, the abandonment of the High Plains remains an invisible chapter of American history. Most Americans take it for granted that they live in a country of growing populations, ever-sprawling cities and new buildings & malls that appear seemingly overnight. Yet, for those few still living on the High Plains, the vast landscape stretching from west Texas northward into Canada, the conspicuous, everyday reality is that of the last picture show.
