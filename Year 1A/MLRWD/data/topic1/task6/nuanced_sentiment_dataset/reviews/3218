To see this film for the first time is a magical experience.

DO NOT READ ANY PLOT SYNOPSIS (SYNOPSISi?) Be open to a new experience...yes, from 1945!

This is an intelligent, witty and clever film written back in the days when screenwriters were artists. All of the characters have distinctive roles that keep them anchored into this whirlwind of a plot. Frankly, the film shouldn't work. The idea is bizarre and unlikely. There are many twists and turns but it's more than a screwball comedy, more than a christmas movie, more than a love story...it is an adventure. An adventure at christmastime during World War II.

It's an adventure that you don't tire of. There is surprising depth in this film: but you won't realize it until you've seen it 3 or 4 times. The first few times you are just hanging on, even shaking your head, laughing too hard and smiling too much. And then you think about it and it occurs to you that the plot works. It shouldn't work. No one could actually do this, could they? Yes, it's just a movie, but it has to be plausible to hook you in. And because of the writing, the acting and the direction, this film does more than just pull it off: it reaches out and pulls you in.

The genius of this film is that it accomplishes all this while in the guise of a simple, light-hearted christmas flick.
