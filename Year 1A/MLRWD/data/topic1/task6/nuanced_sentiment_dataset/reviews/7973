Look, I love Scrubs more than anyone. I think I have watched every episode from Season 1-Season 6 about three or four times each. With that said. the show finally became unwatchable to me in Season 8. The new cast of interns was just not interesting to me at all. The jokes were poorly done and all the original characters lost their edge. I think they should have wrapped up the show after Season 6. Instead of fabricating some drawn-out, aukward ending, the uncertainty with what happened next with JD and Elliott and their life-changing decisions would have been an in intriguing way to end the show. But as with most popular shows, they milked two more seasons (7 and 8) and possibly another one(9)! If you are thinking about buying season 8, my recommendation would be to instead buy the early seasons (if god forbid you haven't yet!) and stick with those. Season 8 is just too aukward and forced, and really isn't funny at all like the show was in its first 6 seasons. Some of the scenes with Elliott and J.D. in season 8 pondering their relationship are just painful to sit through. OK, I have rambled enough. Now the decision is on you. Choose carefully.
