This is such a fine film, both quiet and unassuming. Perhaps these qualities are what set it up as an easy target for the professional reviewers when it was first released. It was released by a small studio and fresh director, which also made it easy fodder. A film like this tends to show the soft under-belly of worthless reviewers, most of whom are nothing more than cattle following perceived tastes of their readership. I hope Tab Murphy directs again, although petty reviewers seemed intent on preventing this possibility. Squashing one of the finest films? Reviewers are often the lowest of the low, incapable of independent thought, and certainly incapable in the creative process. How many of them could make a film? (Sorry for the rant.)

A film like this appeals to the better side of our nature, and offers rare rewards. The viewer would have to be capable of enjoying a fantasy, and falling in synch with the director's intention. I've seen reviews by prickly and vaguely prejudiced people, reacting to the alleged revisionist message that white man - bad and Indian - good. No, this movie is a fantasy, supposing the existence of a survived Cheyenne tribe and held in great value by the two white people making the discovery. Naturally, their goal becomes to preserve and protect something of rare and incalculable value from our exploitive world.

This film is very moving, and stands up to repeated viewings. It should have been wildly popular, but was stopped by the same people who promoted Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. Fortunately, when purchasing DVDs, we have a forum like this. My recommendation is to buy one for yourself and another for someone you love.
