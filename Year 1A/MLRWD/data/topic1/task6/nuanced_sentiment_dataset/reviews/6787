When you see the names "Eric Roberts" and "Roger Corman" on the same box, you already know what you're in for. When that same box has "SHARKTOPUS" slapped on it, this became an instant love it or hate it kind of experience, and the movie stays true to form.

Sharktopus is a weird hybrid movie, much like its protagonist. The movie is horribly directed, horribly acted, and the special effects aren't going to win any awards outside of the Razzies. All of this is done intentionally, trying to create a bad movie on purpose and rack in DVD sales due to the underground popularity of "so-bad-it's-good" movies.

Personally, I'm not a big fan of these movies. I have the same problem with the Troma line- the best "bad" movies happen when everyone involved really thought they were making a good movie. It's for this reason that I really love Jean-Claude Van Damme's work. He really believes in most of his projects and tries his all in each of them. By contrast, Sharktopus' Eric Roberts has been eating up a lot of these easy paychecks lately, and it doesn't seem like he's putting the same level of care into it.

So yes, Sharktopus is a hilariously bad movie to enjoy on popcorn nights with friends. I just worry that you'll wind up with the same sneaking suspicion that I do, that this whole piece is the overcommercialization of a niche market. You can only go to this well so many times before it runs dry, and my cup's already coming up half empty.
