I bought this movie expecting to see a much overlooked masterpiece, considering all the good reviews and the 4 1/2 star rating at the time.  I don't know what these other reviewers were watching, but it couldn't have been this movie.

First of all, this was the most depressing, downhearted, pessimistic, piece of trash I'd ever set eyes on, I don't believe there was a genuinely "good" smile in the entire flick.

Lisa Blount played an absolute ditz, and Billy Bob was nonchalant in his role, almost as if he didn't care about any more than the paycheck he got each week during filming.

There were quite a few holes in the plot, also.  The only one I care to mention without spoiling the movie is this:  During the fight between Billy's character and Snake, it was clear Billy had the upperhand, but somewhere in the middle of the fight he decided to just give up.  What was that all about?  My wife and I looked at each other and said, almost simultaneously, "Why isn't he fighting back?"  There was absolutely NO reason for him to wimp out at the moment he did.  It didn't tie into the story at all.  Basically, he started the fight by calling Snake out, and then just let Snake whip his rear, nonsensical idiocy.

The whole movie was like that, two hours of questionable stupidity, and then fizzling out at the end, with nothing more than a whimper.  I didn't care for any of the characters after the fight, and I was hoping they'd all die off before the credits ran.

BIG PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!!
