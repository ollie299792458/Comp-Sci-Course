Hyped over the previews I saw, I went and saw this movie on opening night. Initially I thought it was a 4 star movie. The special effects are amazing, and the storyline was pretty good although it dragged at times in my opinion. I saw it again a weekend later for free, and it was even less interesting that time. The issue of global warming is a real issue and the concept is an interesting one to think about, but the idea could have been further explored and explained. To me it felt like a love story and a movie designed to say take care of your Earth or this will happen. I was bored the second time around and I will probably not buy this dvd. That is just me though. The movie had great effects, nice acting and was wonderfully directed. I just think they could have taken this one further. Do I recommend seeing this movie? Yes. I have friends that love it but I happen not to. A lot of people will like this one but it is one you have to make your own mind up about. Maybe you will enjoy it more than I did and then again maybe you won't.
