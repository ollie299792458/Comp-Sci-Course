Note to filmmakers: You can't manufacture controversy.

CHAOS is a movie made with all hyperbole and no talent. If you want proof, look no further than the cover art: Even when you take the graphic violence into account, it's far from the "most brutal movie ever made". In fact, it's nothing more than a rip-off of Wes Craven's grindhouse classic, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. That film may have been a spin on Ingmar Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING, but CHAOS actually steals from its source scene-for-scene. In the end, it's the equivilant of the PSYCHO remake (minus that film's skill). It's a miracle these amateurish filmmakers weren't sued.

If you want a lesson on how NOT to make a movie, then watch this. If you want a good unintentional laugh (the DVD extras show the director in a morgue, wearing a wrestler's outfit and flexing his muscles), then watch this. But don't watch this in hopes of seeing a genuinely effective shocker. You'll only wind up feeling insulted by this hackneyed attempt at peddling to horror fans.
