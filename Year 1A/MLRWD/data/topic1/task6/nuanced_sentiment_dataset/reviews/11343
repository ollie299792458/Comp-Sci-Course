We bought the 3D version because we were enticed by the prospect of watching this in 3D at home.  We thought it would be a great movie night with friends (it comes with 4 pairs of 3D glasses).

The glasses are the red/blue kind.  They are not like the glases you find in theatres and amusement parks today.  The problem with this is that the colors are washed away in 3D and you are left with a strange orange and purple mix.  For example, skintones become orange.  Everything else is purple or grey.

Its a good thing that the 2D version is included on the same disc as a menu selection.  After five minutes of watching it in 3D, we chose to restart the movie in 2D.  The few scenes that take advantage of 3D are clearly recognizable during thr 2D version and after you are done the movie, you realize that you really aren't missing 3D anyway.

Jensen Ackles does a great job.  This movie felt like a two hour WB/CW show, which was fine.  The movie is good and kept us guessing who the murderer was until it was finally revealed.
