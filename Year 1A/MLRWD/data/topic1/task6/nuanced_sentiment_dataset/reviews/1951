The first ST in almost 20 years, fans had high hopes for this series, which were later realized but definitely not in this season.

Stardate 41153.7 "Encounter at Farpoint, Parts I and II" The worst pilot ever made in ST history.  I could barely sit through it...what was with all the guys wearing skirts? It does introduce TNG fans to Q, who would become Capt. Picard's later nemesis and the most popular recurring character of the show. 1 star

Stardate 41209.2 "The Naked Now" Copied from TOS episode "The Naked Time", TNG's was considerably worse than TOS's.  Seemed to concentrat mostly on sex. 2 stars

Stardate 41235.25 "Code of Honor" Lt. Cmdr Tahs Yar is kidnapped and must fight to go back to the Enterprise.  3 stars

Stardate 41386.4 "The Last Outpost" Enterprise meets the Ferengi for the first time, which is enough to make this episode bad.  In the early days of TNG, the Ferengi were more like monkeys, not the smooth businessmen that we came to know in DS9.  So seeing the Ferengi jump around like barbarians isn't a pleasant evening.  On the plus side, Enterprise runs into its first of several extinct species. 2 stars

Stardate 41263.1 "Where No One Has Gone Before" The Enterprise is sent a billion light-years into space to meet another exploratory race. 3 stars

Stardate 41249.3 "Lonely Among Us" Aliens take over Worf, Dr. Crusher and Capt. Picard.  Must not have been a great episode, because I barely remember it. 1 star

Stardate 41255.6 "Justice" Wesley is sentenced to death because of a planet's overly strict laws.  Wesley was the worst charcter ever created and should have been killed in this episode just so we could be rid of him.  1 star

Stardate 41723.9 'The Battle" Capt. Picard encouters his old command, the Stargazer, and becomes caught up in his old memories thanks to a Ferengi mind device.  The first episode that deal with characterization. 3 stars

Stardate 41590.5 "Hide and Q" The worst Q episode made.  Riker is invited to join the Q Continuum.  2 stars, just because it's Q.

Stardate 41294.5 "Haven" Lwaxana Troi (Counselor Troi's mother) comes onboard for the first time.  She is the most annoying recurring character, but what would we do without her? That bell did get annoying though... 3 stars

Stardate 41997.7 "The Big Goodbye" Introduces Capt. Picard's favorite holoprogram of L.A. detective Dix HIlls.  Crew becomes trapped in holodeck (it breaks almost as oftern as the transporter does). 3 stars

Stardate 41242.4 "Datalore" Introduces Data's evil "brother andrioid" Lore, who impersonates Data and tries to destroy the ship. 3 stars

Stardate 41636.9 "Angel One" Crew boes to matriarchal society and becomes stranded there. 2 stars

Stardate 41365.9 "11001001" Repair crew made up of aliens called "Binars" take over the Enterprise. 3 stars

Stardate 41309.5 "Too Short a Season" Famous diplomat comes aboard the Enterprise and de-ages rapidly. 2 stars

Stardate 41509.1 "When the Bough Breaks" Wesley and other Enterprise children are kidnapped by dying race.  For Wesley. 2 stars.

Stardate 41463.9 "Home Soil" Enterprise crew finds a bizarre life form that lives in the soil of a planet that is being used for terraforming. 3 stars

Stardate 41461.2 "Coming of Age" Wesley takes the Starfleet Academy Entrance Exam and Capt. Picard comes under scrutiny by Starfleet Command, which was rather interesing. 2 stars

Stardate 41503.7 "Heart of Glory" A group of fugitive Klingons takes over the Enterprise.  Explores Worf's loyalty issues and the rich Klingon culture.  First time the Klingon roar is heard for when a warrior dies...always a favorite. 3 stars

Stardate 41798.2 "The Arsenal of Freedom" While exploring the disappearance of the USS Drake, the Enterprise disovers a planet where weapons have taken over.  First time Capt. Picard comes on an away mission. 2 stars

Stardate Unknown "Symbiosis" Two neighboring planets, one with a drug monopoly over the other.  OK. 2 stars

Stardate 41601.3 "Skin of Evil" Evil mud being refuses to allow Enterprise crew to rescue the stranded Counselor Troi.  REsults in the rather pointless death of Tasha Yar, which will lead to some excellent episodes later on. 3 stars

Stardate 41697.9 "We'll Always Have Paris" Capt. Picard is reunited with one his former love interests. 2 stars

Stardate 41775.5 "Conspiracy" PIcard begins to suspect that there is a conspiracy in Starfleet Command, which is soon revealed to have been caused by alien parasites. 2 stars

Stardate 41986.0 "The Neutral Zone" The first TNG episode featuring Romulans. War is imminent and the crew also has to deal with revived 20th century humans, which leads to interesting questions about cyrogenic freezing. 3 stars

A pretty shaky start, but it will get better.
