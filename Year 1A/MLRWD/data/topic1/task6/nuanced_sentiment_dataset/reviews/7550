Two hours ago, I was not a Pink Floyd fan.
Since before I was born over 24 years ago, my parents had a deep affinity for Floyd, and I don't remember them ever playing any records as often as DSOTM, The Wall, and Animals.  By the time I was four, The Wall was my favorite album, although the artwork on the inside of the sleeve provided me many a nightmare at the time.  So I've loved PF pretty much all my life.
But two hours ago, I was not a Pink Floyd fan. Sure, I thought their concerts were great, their music, everything, was fantastic.  But I never thought of them as people, and that's what this DVD showed me.
All the personality injected into this album, all the ideas, backstories, bells and whistles have never been more clear after watching this DVD.  I must have listened to DSOTM literally hundreds of times in my lifetime, in open spaces, with good noise canceling headphones, you name it, and every so often I still hear new things.  Well, this DVD kind of spoiled everything, because now there's nothing more to discover.  Every minor detail is covered, sonically and lyrically, and after watching the DVD, the album is fresh once again, imagine that.  I have a new respect for the album and the band as a whole.  Well made documentary, some clips of their videos thrown in here and there, some old footage, but mostly more recent footage of interviews and such.
This is so worth it, especially to watch Gilmour play, it's amazing to see that in over 30 years, he still has it. Beautiful.
