The cover OF THE DVD CASE had some reviewer quoted say
A ROCK'EM SOCK'EM ACTION FLICK ! Story was really slow to start out with almost no fighting or karate style fighting . Bored for a good 45 minutes . It does pick up a bit but its not anything AMAZING . Basically only ONE main character in the ENTIRE cast has Marshall arts skills. The rest looked corny to me at times. It just wasnt overly convincing to me that any of the leading cast could even kick my ass much less save the world. It wasnt awful, but I was expecting more than it delivered. Christerpher Lambert of Highlander movie fame was misused as his character was really pretty boring. Overall , Ill be genereous and give it 3 stars out of 5 . The techno beat some complained about in reviews is involved in some of the more dramatic fight scenes and might of actually help make it more exciting than it was . So I wont bash that element of the movie .In the end....I wasnt totally disappointed but I did expect a better pace to the story and more convincing marshall arts in many of the battles. The cast did have likeable characters, they just fall flat on delivering the fight scenes.  Take that for what its worth as I am writing this right after I watched it.
