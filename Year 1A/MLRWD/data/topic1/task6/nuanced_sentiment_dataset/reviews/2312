The movie is ok and certainly worth the price.  However you will need to get from someone besides this seller.

I thought I ordered the new, wide-screen version of Ripley's Game but the narrow-screen version arrived.  I checked this order and it was not for the wide-screen version.  Oops--I thought.

It was not expensive so I ordered the new, wide-screen version to correct what I thought was my error.  Easier than returning.  When the second order arrived it was the the narrow version, again!

I had judged the version by the description on the box. While I was on the phone with Amazon customer service I noticed that the shrink rap on the second order (not the first) had Widescreen written on it.

Turns out they were both the same:  They were both the widescreen version in the standard screen box.  When I checked the barcode (using Delicious Library 2), they were both the same and for the standard version.  Also the first barcode had been scratched so it could not be read, damaging the box.

It is also obvious that they both were not new movies.

Avoid this seller.
