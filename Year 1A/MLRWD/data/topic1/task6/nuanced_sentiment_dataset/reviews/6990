Matthew Maconaughanahanahay is a womanizing self-absorbed jerk with a bad tan going "awww raaaaht!"  (Actually, that could be any one of a dozen movies.)

He shows up at his brother engagement dinner in order to deliberately wreck it.  He offers to help his bro leave his bride at the altar, ruins the cake, and during the dinner toast, launches into a rant about marriage is a tyrannical institution and is as childish as the "eeester bunneh".

The ghosts don't even show up until the 30 min mark, and the title is a misnomer:  actually, only the first ghost is an ex-girlfriend.  The Jacob Marley of the movie is "Uncle Wayne" (Michael Douglas) a boozy ladies' man ghost who chastises Matt for being a bum.  This despite overlong flashbacks showing Wayne molding Matt into the bum he is today.  Uncle Wayne invented the term "MILF", or so the movie says. American Pie was not that long ago, morons.

Robert Forrester is in here, for some reason. Is he physically incapable of cracking a smile?

"Every night I sleep in a lake of sex".  WHO TALKS LIKE THAT.

I like Hitch a lot more than this cheap ripoff.  It's the same backstory, basically.  Matt isn't responsible for his behavior, he just was heartbroken and deceived as a kid.  Also, the protagonist is a caricature, obviously meant to be hated from the outset by every women watching.
