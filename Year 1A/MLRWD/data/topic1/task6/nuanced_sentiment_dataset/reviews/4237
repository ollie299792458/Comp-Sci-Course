I ordered this DVD set because of the glowing reviews but I am so sorry I did.  My 3 year granddaughter loves being read fairy tales now so I wanted to get her the visual version of all of these great stories.  But when we sat down to watch these DVD's, she was bored after a few minutes and I was appalled by the sexual inuendos and adult dialog.  Thank goodness I was viewing along with my granddaughter and thank goodness she does not yet understand these adult "jokes" etc.

  These stories may be acted by some of hollywood's great "stars" but dont be fooled by that fact like I was.

 These DVD's should NOT be viewed by children under the age of 13--as certain movies are rated PG-13.  The producers/directors of these DVD's should be ashamed of what they have made.  What could and should have been a wonderful experience for little ones by watching these stories come to life and being able to find the magic of so many classic fairytales, are NOT found in these terribly scripted tales.  My advice to anyone who is buying DVD's for children--DO NOT ORDER THESE!
