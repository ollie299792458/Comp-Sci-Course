This was an interesting depiction of that tragic meeting - BUT - what ruined it for me was the casting of Branagh as Heydrich. Completely unbelievable. And also the casting of Stanley Tucci as Eichman. Horrible.
 First of all - Branagh is just not tall enough to be a believable Heydrich. Secondly, he was completely incapable of conveying the psychopathic air that Heydrich exuded. Branagh had a little twinkle in his eye throughout - and a somewhat smug and bemused comportment. Anyone who has ever seen film footage of Heydrich knows there was no "twinkle" in his Killer's eyes - and "bemusement" was a character trait utterly foreign to him.  Branagh never seemed, in any way, scary. Heydrich never seemed anything but. Anthony Hopkins was able to get "the look" with his Lecter role. Branagh never even comes close.
 As for Tucci - a totally unbelievable depiction of Adolf Eichmann. And if you've seen Thamas Kreschmann's absolutely brilliant and riveting performance in the 2007 film "Eichmann" - then Tucci becomes unwatchable in this role.
These two men are both excellent actors. And maybe they should be glad they are incapable of pulling these two monsters from somewhere inside themselves. But for us - the audience - the failure to do so is painful to watch.
I'd pass on it.
