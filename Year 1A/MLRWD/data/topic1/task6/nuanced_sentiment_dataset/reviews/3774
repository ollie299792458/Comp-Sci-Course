I am an old school X-phile. I liked the alien story-arc (even if it was played out repeatedly, like Scully always arriving seconds later after something cool happened to Mulder), but what really drew me to the series was the "freak of the week" (FOTW) episodes like "Darkness Falls" and "Humbug". Each one was different and exciting.

This movie is a pretty decent attempt at recapturing this concept. I'm not sure if they wanted to do a FOTW to gauge public response to a series of X-Files movies or they just wanted to dig up the series and see if it still had any life in it for a future television project. It did a great job of dragging out that old Mulder-Scully chemistry, that intellectual reparte that we all had known and loved about the original series.

While this movie DOES close some story-lines (the whereabouts of their son, what they were up to after the series ended, etc.), it opens new questions, and most certainly to X File fans: Will they finish the Alien-insurrection Story?

Main drawback: I didn't care for either Xibit or Amanda Peet's characters. It's not a shot against either as an actor, but the character writing was extremely contrived and telegraphed: you could see that they were trying to fit into the X Files story instead of just being FBI agents on an investigation. This could have been solved by one character, not two, filling in the gaps. This would have been a great place to plug in Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and make him a central character (this would have been hugely satisfying).
