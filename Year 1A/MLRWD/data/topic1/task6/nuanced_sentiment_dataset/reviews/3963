When I saw this DVD I thought, due to packaging similiarities, it was the "End Of The Century" movie that was being released to theatres at the same time. That was a good movie.

"Raw" is mostly dull home video (actually, road video) footage. I had a hard time watching that all the way through -- how many shots of Ramones on the toilet, looking into the camera do you need? The concert in Italy is worth seeing. The rest of the live footage documents the extent of their decline as a live band -- even at ever-increasing beats per minute, it's no fun to watch them go thru the motions. There's also some almost dada Uncle Floyd, and starved-for-rock Brazilian rioters. All in all, maybe 30 minutes of good stuff; the rest is sad, numbing tedium you'll wanna skip over.

Soundcheck for the Italian show is in the main program -- a half dozen Italians not dressed as punks lounge in the sunny audience area while the Ramones rock the rock. That was kinda cool. The actual concert is in the bonus features. The band, while no longer in their brilliant early period, are still young & healthy. The show occurs on a green in front of what looks like a castle, sweet place for a medium sized outdoor concert. A great day to be a Ramone.

Fans should rent "Raw" for the concert. Non-fans should still see "End Of The Century", a swell documentary that should please anyone with even a tolerance for rock'n'roll.
