The subject is an interesting one, but this documentary is sorely deficient.

The biggest problem is that the film-makers never address the central issue of whether IBM actually cheated or not.  The film is full of accusations and innuendos, but there is essentially no analysis.  I was left confused and frustrated at the end.

The sound quality is terrible.  I kept having to adjust the volume up and down, up and down.  The music is often much too loud and drowns-out the speech.  In general, the background music is too melodramatic and intrusive.

The director used too many "artsy" flourishes, like repeatedly -- repeatedly! -- cutting to clips of an old movie about a chess-playing automaton.

There is almost no useful information in the movie about chess or computers.  It's like the film-makers were aiming the movie at the least common denominator.

The movie starts with a story about a "mechanical Turk" that defeated Napoleon in chess, but the film-makers never explicitly state that the Turk was a big hoax -- a human was hidden inside the contraption.  Sure, they hint at it, but a resolution to the story would have been a nice way to end the movie.

The film-makers had the opportunity to ask really interesting, probing questions of both Kasparov and the IBM team -- but they dropped the ball.  The interviews are shallow and uninteresting.

Skip this documentary.  There are books written on this subject, and although I haven't read them, I imagine that they're much better than this movie.
