I'll be brief and try not to repeat points that others have made. As far as I can see, "right wingers", are not good at promoting conspiracy theories - I say that he must be a Republican because he holds those conservative sacred principles: protectionism: we white Europeans conquered the United States a few hundred years ago, therefore we own it: the need to keep foreigners out: the Bilderbergers want to take our guns away: God is on our side: we should be able to do what ever we want: we shouldn't have to pay taxes: among others. These to me are not admirable principles.

 Alex Jones, doesn't seem able to separate the "wheat from the chaff". He mixes truth with with fiction, takes many things out of context less skillfully than Michael Moore and often "throws the baby out with the bathwater", like when he lumps together those that have committed holocausts and eugenics experiments with those that promote responsible birth control such as "Planed Parenthood", branding them all evil.

 His theories lack any evidence and he posses no alternatives. I suppose he is a textbook anarchist with a heightened sense of self-importance.

 I give it an extra star for the interesting archival footage. The film was fairly entertaining, but the lack of a consistent message resulted in me not being able to take it seriously. I am baffled at so many five star ratings. So many people seem to mix up emotions with reason. America is filled with much pain. I am glad I am not a citizen that country.
