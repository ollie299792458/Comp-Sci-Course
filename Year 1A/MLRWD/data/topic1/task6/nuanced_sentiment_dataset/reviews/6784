I did the 40 minute routine for the 1st time yesterday. I am only 8 weeks pregnant and found this DVD to be somewhat challenging.  I can't imagine what it would be like for someone who is further along.  I would recommend this workout for someone that is already a seasoned exerciser. It's fast paced, so I would not recommend this DVD for a beginner.  I am an avid runner (average 8-15 miles/week) and regular gym visitor (4 days/week using an elliptical and bike), a yoga student (1-2 days/week) and a former step aerobic student.  What I didn't like about this routine was that I had to re-arrange my furniture in order to do some of the exercises in Segment 1 (the 40 minutes is divided into 4 segments.)  I wished the DVD had prepared me for what was needed as far as "equipment." I had to keep running around the living room/dining room to "find" and "arrange" the needed equipment. So those of you that wish to purchase this DVD, you will need a sturdy coffee table, the edge of your couch, a flat wall, a dining room chair, a living room cushioned chair (I don't have one of these and used the loveseat) and an exercise mat. The other thing I didn't like about the DVD were some of the crazy camera angles and the fact that Erin doesn't always countdown the number of reps.  For some of the floor exercises, you are supposed to keep a long neck (looking down while on all fours), however Erin wasn't giving instructions and I had to keep looking up at the TV to figure out what I supposed to be doing.  Overall, I did have a pretty good workout. It got my heart rate up and I did sweat a little.  I'm sure I will get better at keeping up with the routine.
