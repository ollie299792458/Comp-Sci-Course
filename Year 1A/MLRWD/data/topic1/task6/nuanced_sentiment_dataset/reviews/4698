Prior to watching Bobby, I knew that the movie was about a group of people that were present when Robert (Bobby) Kennedy was assassinated.  Thus, I thought the movie would be a portrayal of how Kennedy's death affected their lives.  Instead, the movie was a (somewhat) fictionalized depiction of how these people spent the day of Kennedy's assassination, ending with the assassination itself.  Consequently, my reaction to the movie was one of confusion and disappointment.

I wouldn't have had the reaction that I did had two elements in the movie been different.  First, Emilio Estevez inserted actual newsreel footage and recordings of Kennedy's speeches throughout the movie.  These insertions leave the viewer with the thought that Kennedy's words made an impression on people.  Thus, it is confusing why Estevez would take the time to include these words when he doesn't show the impact of them.  This flaw directly influences the other item of weakness in the movie:  the characters themselves.  By presenting such a large group of characters (both campaign staff and those not associated with the campaign), Estevez seems to imply that Kennedy was affecting a broad spectrum of society.  However, by implying and not completing that connection, the viewer is left wondering why these people's stories are important to follow.  The fact that the movie ends without continuing the cast's stories just heightens that puzzlement.

Kennedy's campaign to bring more dignity and economic parity to the poorest members of our society earned him admiration.  It's clear that Estevez shared that admiration and wanted to depict it through the movie's characters.  However, by not showing how Kennedy's campaign, words, and especially his death inspired people to change, the viewer is left wondering what all the fuss is about.  As a result, Bobby has to be seen as a disappointing attempt to portray the influence that one person and his death had on American society.
