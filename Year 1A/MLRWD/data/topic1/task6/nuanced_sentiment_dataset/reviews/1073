sherrybaby is from the start until the end a great movie.. it's unfortunate that the ending destroys everything the movie worked so hard to attain.

it's about a woman (maggie gyllenhaal) who gets out of rehab and tries to get her life back on track, easier said than done because she lets her little girl stay with her brother and his wife, and they emotionally kidnap her and treat maggie gyllenhaal like far less than human because she used to use drugs.  this is masterfully portrayed by the actors, particularly gyllenhaal.  throughout the movie, something is accomplished which i've never seen in a movie - total cynicism about society.  the srangers gyllenhaal meets are mean to her, but the meanest of all are the ones she considers her friends.  one scene even shows that her own father used to molest her.  this is great, dark subject matter that makes for a wonderful movie.

but then in the end... well i won't say exactly what happens but basically all the darkness is erased and you're supposed to believe gyllenhaal's character is going to be A-OK just because she has a positive attitude - the exact opposite of the rest of the movie!!!!!  ridiculous and terrible.
