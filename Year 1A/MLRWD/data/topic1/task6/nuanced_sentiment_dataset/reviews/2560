I liked this movie a lot.  Of course it's no masterpiece so I can't rightfully give 5 stars, but 4's good enough for what the movie is.  Long ago I didn't like Sandler because I didn't find his humor too cool, it was kind of crass I thought.  Well it still is to some extent, but I've found a lot of his work touching, with this being no exception.

The first half of the movie deals with comedy and setting up the premise of the remote, characters, career and all.  Second half takes a dramatic turn and will probably bring tears to your eyes if you allow it to--and more than once, imagine that!  It's been a while since I've been to a flick that has managed to do that, even once in fact since most films are so unmoving.  The plot is about a guy who works too much, neglects family a bit, and yada yada...things come full circle but it's done nicely.  Beckinsale's a beauty, of course that's an added bonus.  A real looker, she is.

If, like me, you have enjoyed some of Sandler's other romantic comedy work (Wedding Singer, 50 1st Dates, Mr Deeds), do check out Click.  Many say it is similar to It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol but with its own version.  I would say his movies are sweet, at the risk of sounding feminine.  But hey, they are.  Watch with chicks even, they should dig it too unless they're callous or anti Sandler.

Some trivia: cameo from Rob Schneider as usual, albeit incognito.  Happy Days' Fonzi as Sandler's dad.  Marge Simpson (voice...) as his mom.  Cranberries' singer performing Linger--great song.

As a closing note I'll add that I found this more worthwhile than a number of recent summer flicks I've seen: Pirates 2, Superman, XMen, MI3, DaVinci, Fast Furious 3, heck even Cars now that I think about it.
