First, a number of Woody Allen's films are among my very favorites, and I've enjoyed some of his most recent work.

But I have to be honest. Imagine Larry David pretending to be Woody Allen, interacting with a cast of characters from The Beverly Hillbillies. That's exactly what this film is. I'm completely serious.

Allen should be ashamed of this travesty, for many reasons. The dialogue was almost uniformly horrendous, with characters implausibly speaking things that should have been shown, like a Three's Company episode. Even Larry David's trademark crankiness, when infused with Allen's bleak, pseudo-intellectual perspective, grows old very quickly because it is presented repetitively, without wit or subtlety. Almost every single scene was a predictable string of clich&eacute;s that we've seen far too many times already. Several times I knew exactly what was going to happen as soon as the set up was revealed.

Beyond that, the film is simply ignorant and mean. Staggeringly so. I get what Allen was going for, and he flatly failed. It was not funny. It was not engaging. It was not even challenging. Instead, his utter contempt for people outside of his own Manhattan sphere, and his complete and total misunderstanding of them, is an embarrassment. If you appreciate artless 90 minute lectures about how stupid, racist, immoral and gullible everyone in the world is, this is your film.
