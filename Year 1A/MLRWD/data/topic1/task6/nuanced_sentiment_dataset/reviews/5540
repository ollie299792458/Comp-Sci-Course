The movie My Fair Lady was based on the book by G.B. Shaw, Pygmalion. It tries to show the feelings and the personality of the characters in the book but I don't think this is done too well. The book and movie vary in certain aspects, like the fact that the movie is a musical and also some of the words are changed, added, and sometimes even left out. I think that many of Shaw's satirical ideas and messages are misinterpreted in the movie or not shown well enough.

Some of the characters do not have the same personality as the book. For example, Higgins, in the book, has a very strong and controlling personality, as well as Eliza. In the movie, though, Eliza's part of this personality was not portrayed as well. It seemed as though she was more of a gentle women just trying to survive. Some of these things were changed to make it a more interesting movie and to capture its audience, but I think Shaw would have been disappointed by it. In the movie they exaggerate the upper class and its elegance, like in the party where everyone is dressed in black and white and everything was done with extreme care and elegance. Also, the part where Higgins puts the teacup on his head was funny but not what Shaw would have done.

I think that although the movie was good and entertaining, it cannot really compete with the book since it does not express Shaw's original ideas. The movie changed some ideas around and added new things to the setting and characters to make it a more interesting movie but I think that Shaw would have definitely made the move differently.
