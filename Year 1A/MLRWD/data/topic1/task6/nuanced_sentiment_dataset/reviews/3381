After a decade on her own in the big city, Mae Doyle (Barbara Stanwyck) returns to her hometown which is a sleepy fishing village in Coastal California. Listless, bored, and broke, she eventually drifts into a marriage to Jerry D'Amato (Paul Douglas), hoping he will provide her with some security and safety. But Mae soon realizes she wants more excitement and passion, which her fisherman husband is oblivious to.

Before long sparks fly between Mae and Jerry's ne'er-do-well friend Earl (Robert Ryan) Now torn between a ''bad boy'' lover and a boring husband and infant at home, Mae's life careens out of control. She finds that her exciting new lover not only does not offer her much satisfaction either, but leaving a loving husband and infant daughter arouses some long-buried emotions.

''Clash by Night'' is classified as a Film Noir but to me it seemed more like a drama. The plot is pretty straight forward and somewhat predictable. Director Fritz Lange adds in some Film Noir-like elements such as scenes at night, smoky bars, and men fighting over a blonde, but there is not much element of danger.

The acting is good but nothing extraordinary, including Paul Douglas' performance as Stanwyck's dull-but kind husband. Stanwyck herself is good in the film, but not as smoldering as in ''Double Indemnity'' There is a small part in the film by Marilyn Monroe as a naive but fun-loving gal who marries Mae's brother.

Overall I thought ''Clash By Night'' was a solid 3-star film but not much more. The plot is somewhat interesting but similar to so many other films I have seen. And the passion between the characters did not always ring true. Also, some of the actors just didn't look the part of rough-edged fishermen. If you are a big fan of any of the actors in the film you may enjoy it, but I've seen much better films in this genre.
