Though it could have been argued that a 6-part serial novel could not be made effectively into a movie, it can also be seen that it happened.
Frank Darabont (known for King's adaptation of the Shawshank  Redemption) wonderfully sculpted and told Stephen King's tale of a death  row during the Depression.  Though he jumped a few years and changed the  state, the basic elements of the novel are intact.  Furthermore, Michael  Duncan and Tom Hanks stepped flawlessly into the roles of John Coffey and  Paul Edgecombe, respectively.  
Only one gripe:  Darabont's film wrapped  things up too nicely; he answered too many questions.  The end turns out  much too nice.  The one drawback to cinema anymore is that audiences need a  happy ending, so this slight oversight is easily forgiven.  
Though over  3 hours long, The Green Mile successfully sets the tone and images.  It  makes the viewer feel sorry for not only John but also for Paul.  It is a  tragic yet uplifting story, that will leave the viewer pondering over it  for many hours.  It leaves a feeling of loss, and it inspires the search  for justice.
A great movie for King fans, and even better for movie fans.
