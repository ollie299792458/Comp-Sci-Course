In this B-grade Sci-fi flick, the government combines alien DNA with human eggs resulting in a female alien/human hybrid dubbed Sil.  The alien, played by Natashia Henstridge, has an insatiable urge to procreate.  It's basically a big master plan by the aliens who sent the DNA to colonize earth.  Sil escapes her captivity and goes on the prowl for unsuspecting men to impregnate her.  Meanwhile the government dispatches a handpicked team to find Sil.  Led by the sarcastic Michael Masden and the compassionate Marg Hellenberger, the team tracks Sil to Los Angeles.  Here the body count rises as the team races to find Sil before she can mate.
The concept is a good one and the acting/dialog is on par with what you would expect from B-grade Sci-fi.  Sil's alien persona is based on creatures created by artist H.R. Giger (Giger also created the designs for the creatures in the Aliens movies).  Giger's biomechanical aliens often take on sexual overtones, a concept that is carried through in this movie.  The movie plays like a X-Files episode at times as Masden and Helenberger take center stage in the hunt for Sil.  The computer generated FX in the closing scenes are dated, but effective.  The DVD is a budget version from MGM offering very little in the way of extras.  The movie is presented in both widescreen and full screen formats.  The picture is crisp a clear with excellent detail.  Sound is good and presented in Dolby 5.1.  Species is a definite asset to the sci-fi buffs DVD library and a must for "creature feature" fans.  Helenberger, Masden, and Henstridge returned a couple of years later for the inferior but entertaining sequel Species II.
