Really really stupid as most of Adam Sandler's movies.  Not funny at all.  I watched this because of curiosity to see Al Pacino's role, and I was horribly surprised to see an actor of such a great caliber to go so low and take part in this awful project.  I guess Pacino owed Sandler some kind of favor in order to accept and participate in such a piece of trash movie.  Bad bad bad.  The part that hurts the most is seeing Mexican great Eugenio Derbez negatively represent his own people here.  Derbez is one of the top rated comedy geniuses in Mexico; he does both acting and producing his own shows and successfully produces other high quality comedy shows as well.  Derbez has an endless portfolio of high quality TV shows, and movies under his belt.  But well, his star didn't shine this time.  Is hard to believe how being so big and suceessful he went even lower than Pacino and chose this project as a crossover for the English speaking audiences.  He not only made a fool of himself in playing such a low third-rate role, but he added fuel to the fire as well by representing his own people in such a negative and unreal way.  Derbez probably doesn't know that George Lopez' already beat the horse to death by using the embarrasing task of discriminating against your own race.  Derbez will probably regret being part of this project for the rest of his life becuase as the saying goes, it's better to be a Mouse's Head (in your own turf), than a Lion's Tail.
