This has been a LONG time coming officially to home video, never even released on VHS.  Castle fans are still awaiting official releases of (among others) his classics MACABRE, and his remake of James Whale's OLD DARK HOUSE (HINT!).  Anyway, HOMICIDAL is a great deal of fun, and "Jean Arless" gives a terrific performance as...well, you'll have to see.  These days you'd have to be blind not to anticipate the classic twist ending, revealing that...well, you'll have to see. I will say there are a few great shocks, and delicious dialogue from Castle's best writing collaborator, Robb White.  
As for the DVD - the "Psychette" (as in 'a less-grand version of PSYCHO') is OK but too darn short (under 7 minutes), like Columbia's other recent Castle releases (13 GHOSTS, MR. SARDONICUS). It would also be nice if they could track down some original cast or crew rather than interviewing contemporary film critics and horror buffs.  They seem not to have good source materials as the DVD is full-frame, and there is no trailer for Homicidal on the disk.  The clips from the original trailer used in the featurette seem to come from a shaky VHS. Similarly the "trailer" for STRAIT-JACKET is only a 30 second TV spot.  The movie's image quality is very decent but nothing special. 
Absolutely worth taking a "Fright Break" to see.
