Adam Sandler and Kevin James (THE KING OF QUEENS) provide big laughs in I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK AND LARRY, an uproariously funny comedy that, though not terribly concerned with being politically correct, will make you laugh in spite of yourself. Sandler is Chuck and James play Larry, best friends and firemen who have seen each other through everything, including the death of Larry's wife. After a recent brush with death in a bad fire, Larry becomes concerned that his current insurance benefits will not properly provide for his children in the event of his death and learns that the only way he can properly provide for his children is to enter into a domestic partnership with Chuck, where they would pretend to be gay lovers and actually marry. Laying aside the fact that I can't imagine two heterosexual men ever doing this in real life, it does lay the groundwork for one of the funniest comedies I have seen in years. Gay stereotypes are perpetuated at every turn but there is nothing mean-spirited about it making the incredible premise plausible. Also thrown into the mix are Larry's son, whose interests seem to be limited to tap dancing, baking, and auditioning for the school musical, and a pretty attorney (Jessica Biel) who catches Chuck's eye but unfortunately he has to conceal his feelings about her. Mention should also be made of a hilarious supporting turn from Ving Rhames as a fellow firefighter who is inspired to come out of the closet, after being inspired by Chuck and Larry's relationship. Primarily, it is the inspired comic teaming of Adam Sandler and Kevin James that makes this one work.
