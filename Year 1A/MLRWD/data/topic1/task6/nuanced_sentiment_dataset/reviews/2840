I really wanted to like this movie. I like Steve Carell and Kiera Knightley and I thought it was going to be a romantic comedy.

Dodge (Steve Carell) has been living a mundane life until an asteroid is predicted to destroy the earth in two weeks. In the first scene, his wife leaves him because their marriage wasn't working anyway. He goes to work because he doesn't know what else to do.

Some people are trying to get in everything they ever wanted to do during their lifetime while others are committing suicide. His friends are having End-of-the-World parties and want to hook him up with someone to spend his last days with.

When rioting begins, Dodge and a neighbor he's just met leave the city and begin a road trip. He wants to find his high school love. Penny's (Kiera Knightley)family is in England so she goes along since she has no one else.

Over all there wasn't much humor, but there was romance which was nice. Still the movie can only be described as a downer.
