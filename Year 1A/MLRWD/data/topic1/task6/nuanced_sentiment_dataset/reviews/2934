"The Shining" is one of my all time favorite movies, saw as a little kid and it scared me to death. Years later I watched it again and loved the movie. Many people either love or hate the movie based on the fact that it strays pretty far from the Stephen King novel. The way I see it is like this, the book was incredible, the movie is incredible, they are two seperate things and should be viewed as such. The only problem with the movie is the casting. Nicholson and Duval were both perfect and horrible casting at the same time. Nicholson plays the madman to perfection, but you never see him as a loving father and husband. Duval plays the terrified wife perfectly as well, but you get the feeling she's lived her whole marriage in fear. You don't believe these two would have ever gotten together. Because of this, the first half of the movie is a bit hard to swallow, once she reads what Jack's been writing however, the casting is perfect.
 As for this new edition included are two new documentaries about the movie with interviews with crew from the film as well as Jack Nicholson and others who are fans of the film (Steven Spielberg for instance). The docs are interesting to watch and learn about some of the behind the scenes stuff. There is also a piece with Wendy Carlos who did the music for the film. Too bad the soundtrack is not in print, it is by far THE scariest music from a film ever. If you can find a copy somewhere, give it a spin sitting alone in your house at night! Creepy stuff.
 A nice upgrade from previous editions of the film.
