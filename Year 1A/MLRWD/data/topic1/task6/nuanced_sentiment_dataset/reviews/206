The Time Traveler's Wife, adapted from Audrey Niffenegger's enchanting second novel of the same title, is the story of Henry DeTamble (the Time Traveler) and Clare Abshire (the Time Traveler's Wife). Clare first meets Henry when she is six years old and he suddenly appears, naked, in the Meadow near her home: he's thirty-six at the time. On the other hand, Henry first meets Clare in the library where he works, when he's twenty-eight and she's twenty. Henry has a condition called Chrono-Displacement Disorder, which has him disappearing and reappearing into various times in the past and future. This is ultimately a beautiful love story with a time-travel twist, which adds a different dimension to the story: humour in some parts, horror or heartache in others. Whilst no movie can encompass all of a book, this one is none-the-less fairly faithful to the book. While I might not have picked Eric Bana for this role, he portrays Henry very well, and Rachel McAdams brings Clare to life beautifully. I loved Tatum and Hailey McCann as Alba and Brooklynn Proulx as the young Clare. I enjoyed this movie enough at the theatre to buy the DVD.
