There certainly is a political bias in the film.  Yes, the film does appear to actively celebrate pornography within our society by honoring Larry Flyntt as a "hero" of the First Amendment.  However, the film is actually done in a fairly entertaining way, showcasing who Larry Flyntt is -- without any attempt to cover up his most well-known distusting publications, including the woman being pushed into the meat grinder.  The story focuses on Larry Flyntt's case before the U.S. Supreme Court, Hustler v. Falwell, which dealt with the First Amendment case related to whether Larry Flyntt had the right to publish a pictorial representation of religious icon Jerry Falwell having sexual relations with his mother, in an outhouse (of all places!) with the description, "Falwell's first time."  The issue in the case is whether one is able to defame Falwell, a public figure, if people clearly would understand that the ad is false.  
Clearly, Falwell would never have enganged in such behavior.  The U.S. Supreme Court said that Flyntt could publish such material because no one would believe that Falwell would do that, and thus, he received no harm.  
The irony is that the movie, while called The People v. Larry Flyntt, is simply not true, because the dispute between Falwell and Flyntt was a civil, not criminal, issue.  Now Flyntt has been subject to obscenity prosecutions, too, but that is not the subject of this movie.  Overall, the movie is well done and and quite entertaining, too.
