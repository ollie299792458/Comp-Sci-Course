This movie was so bad, it was painful to watch. The acting was terrible; the plot utterly predictable; and the script horrendous with such gems as: "I'm your dad, and my relationship with your mother has nothing to do with you". The first time our Romeo (John Corbett) stands close to Juliet, (Nia Vardalos) he loudly sniffs her hair like a St. Bernard. She appears oblivious to his probing proboscis though, vacantly staring ahead with a forced smile, as if bravely weathering another bout of PTSD. And there are lots of stupid, slightly mean-spirited gags like our heroine unknowingly standing on a homeless man.  Only in a culture with contempt for the poor would that be funny. And when Corbett discovers his former flight attendant girl friend cheating, it reinforces that nasty, obsolete stereotype of all flight attendants being 'easy'.  In fact, FAs have unwittingly become the new "Nurse Ratcheds" (`One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest') of the 21st century--But I digress. Nia was excellent in 'My Big, Fat Greek Wedding'. Why couldn't she have left well enough alone?
