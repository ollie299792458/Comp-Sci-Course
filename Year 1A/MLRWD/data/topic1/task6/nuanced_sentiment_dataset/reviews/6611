This anime has some very nice backgrounds and such - the water training scene in particular has a zen peacefullness to it.  The animation during the fight sequences is generally done very well and there are a few moments that are awesome.  The drawing style is unique and I really liked it.  The story is pretty weak - typical street fighter "with great power comes great responsibility" I guess.  Some of the fight scenes are really spectacular - though I found myself waiting a bit too long for them sometimes.  I understand that the whole movie cant be fighting, but when you name a movie Street Fighter I just wanted a little more.  All in all I would say this is easily as good as every other street fighter movie made and I appreciate the inclusion of Akuma, though it would be nice to see Guile and Dhalsim play larger roles. Down, Down-Forward, Forward+Punch.
As far as the extra features go, I dont know, I never watch that crap.  If you are really looking for an awesome anime, this is definately one of them, but if you havent seen Ninja Scroll or Vampire Hunter Bloodlust then I would say get those first.
