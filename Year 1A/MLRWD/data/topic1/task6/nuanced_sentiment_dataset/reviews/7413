I review this DVD from a personal perspective of having been a great fan on GP motorcycle racing since the late 1970s. In my considered opinion, Valentino Rossi, one of the principal subjects of this "documentary", is one of the greatest racing talents to ever come along. I only wish such skill was also present in the director of this video production. Frankly, this DVD is almost unwatchable for one steeped in motorcycle racing. It is as if the director decided to make a film that someone not at all interested in motorcycle racing could tolerate watching in between aftershave and pizza TV commercials.

Such an execrable production as this would not have been possible without the mediocre influence of MTV. Every segment of track action, which is what real racing is all about, is aborted before one has any sense of continuity, with quick cuts to interviews, pit activity, and other off-track activity. Back and forth... back and forth... It is as if the intended audience for this video had no interest whatsoever in motorcycle racing and the artificial editing contrivances of the "director" were needed to alleviate the obvious boredom of track competition.

This video is made for people who have no knowledge or interest in motorcycle racing. Anyone with such interest or knowledge should look elsewhere. The only reason I give this dreck a second star is that there are a couple of personal interviews which do provide some insight into the riders. Otherwise this is a total pass. I hope they never let this "director" near a motorcycle racing production again.
