Due Date was... well... horrible. If you ever saw Planes, Trains & Automobiles than you saw the superior version of this quick cash grab send off. I'm sorry but I didn't laugh once (ONCE I TELL YOU) during the entire run time. It just didn't make any sense even in the most stoner, moronic or desperate of ways. There are several times in this film where you say "I would have parted ways with this guy." but for some unexplained reason they keep staying together. The whole "I have to get home one way or another before the my wife's due date" just didn't gel with me as a sufficient reason to risk life or limb. It's an important event but is it worth all the crap RDJ went through in this film? I understand desperation but the scenarios were unfunny and idiotic. Anytime somebody nearly kills you or seriously maims you is a surefire reason to part ways with them. I know they want Zach Galifianakis to be the lovable, clueless moron but he never seemed like a nuisance you didn't mind having. Zach was the same exact guy you saw in that "other" film and I mean the exact same character. Robert Downey Jr usually kills with his charm but in this he was equally at fault as Galifianakis as to why this wasn't funny. Neither was relatable or you cared about and neither were Jamie Foxx  or Michelle Monaghan who equally gave some wooden performances. Planes, Trains & Automobiles had heart and plenty of laughs but this was the 1st time in a while I didn't like any character in this film. It was forgettable or maybe more so unforgivable depending on your expectations. Potential diverted.
