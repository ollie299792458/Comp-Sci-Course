Watching this movie for the first time, I was expecting it to be one of the biggest action flicks of all time, but was seriously dissapointed when there was nothing new or original in this film. All of the action sequences had been done before, or done better recently: a perfect example of this is the freeway car chase. It would have been amazing if it had come out five years ago, but it gets absolutely blown out of the water by the car chase in "Matrix Reloaded". 
Aside from the lacluster action, the writing in this is horrible. Not that I was expecting an Oscar-worthy script, but at least a little effort would be appreciated. Every character is very clicheed, and the acting is more annoying than tolerable, especially Martin Lawrence, who is unbelievably annoying in this film. 
Seeing a movie like this, one has to suspend their disbelief quite a bit, but it is still way over the top how a couple of Miami cops can basically raise an army and invade Cuba. Also, I'm not sure the actual running time of this movie, but it felt way too long for an action film, the plot becoming more and more boring as the movie progressed, leaving the viewer only wanting to skip through the garbage and get to more so-so action scenes.
