Wayne and Ford, what can you say? This film is a good as they come a classic film about one of the darkest days in American History. We'd been attacked without warning and/or provocation, a great portion of our Pacific Fleet lay in ruins and the enemy was advancing on all fronts. Into this desperate tableau throw in a group of young officers trained on a new type of weapon which must quickly find its place in a new type of naval war, carrier based war. While Wayne and Reed might have provided the names and the romantic sizzle in this film it was Robert Montgomery's subtle and nuanced performance that all but steals the show in this one.

The Scene where Montgomery has to leave men behind to get "key Army and Navy Personnel" out, is one of these most heart rending in movie history, perhaps only matched by Noel Coward at the end of "In Which We Serve", when overcome with emotion he turns and walks away from his Officers knowing they'll never serve together again. These subtle touches are what make Ford perhaps the greatest film director of all time. This is a must watch for me. I watch it everytime it's on and once or twice a year I dig out this DVD.  It's quite simply, great film and pretty good history.
