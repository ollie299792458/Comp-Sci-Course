Like many of the golden age "classics," this movie simply does not hold up over time and betrays all the moral and societal restrictions of the time in which it was made. Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine might as well be Rob and Laura Petrie in their separate beds -- tiptoeing around attraction and physical desires to the point of absurdity.

Other actors in the film give performances that are so stereotypical and "clever" that they belong more in a sitcom than a motion picture. True, Jack Lemmon is a great actor, but even he can't save this extremely dialog-heavy and ultimately boring movie.

The famous last scene where Jack and Shirley end up playing cards -- GIVE ME A BREAK! That's not what two people in love who ultimately find each other would end up doing. But of course, in a 1960 movie, that's what they had to settle for.

The movie works as an interesting period piece, but is hopelessly dated and an example of when movies were limited by moral and societal shackles that make them look -- today -- ridiculous.
