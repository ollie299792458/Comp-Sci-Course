The Tillman Story is a very important revelation about how the Military Industrial Complex treats humanity. Pat Tillman gave up a multimillion dollar contract in the NFL to give some payback to the villains of 9/11. He didn't do it for the glory, he constantly rejected the utilization of his service for propaganda purposes, He certainly wasn't motivated by money. He did it because he believed it was the right thing to do.
The last day of his life, the military unit he was assigned to made a number of unwise, precarious moves that led to his own (split) unit firing at itself in the shadows of twilight in a steep Afghan valley setting. This was a horrendous situation, but then the military made up a story that was more advantageous to their purposes. Their story was heroic, romantic, but blatently false, and self-serving. As is usually the case, it was the Tillman family that suffered, while the military used the story for propaganda, to boost their sagging reputation after Abu Grieb, and other fiascos.
The Tillman family ends up the heroes in this story, fighting, and fighting to get the truth out. Their son, husband, and brother, was chewed up by the political machinery: as their dad put it, "They blew up their Poster Boy". Bless the Tillmans and damn the military, this is a story that needs to be shouted from the mountaintop.
