Here's a premise, startlingly akin to Orson Scott Card's EMPIRE novel, rich with dramatic and suspenseful possibility: take a professional sniper (the best ever, of course), make him disillusioned with a government he can't trust (they killed his best friend--naturally), then rehire him and betray him all over again. Mark Wahlberg, of Marky Mark infamy, is just such a sniper, and he's hired to help prevent a presidential assasination. How's he going to do this? By anticipating the assasination strategy in advance so that the plan may be thwarted. Problem: the people hiring him really just want a good plan to assasinate the president themselves.

And the best American assasin in the world can't see this? I ask you.

Anyway, if you can get past the improbability of this plot, there's a passable action flick here. My only real regret, expectations being what they are, is all of the slow-motion photography, which I suppose is made to make Wahlberg look exceptionally cool, when all it really does is, well, slow him down.

Good, not great. Goes for most of this kind of thing.
