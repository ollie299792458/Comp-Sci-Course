I was channel surfing one night and happened to come across The Last King on A&E and have been obsessed with it ever since.  This is truly a masterpiece!!
The casting is wonderful.  The acting is brilliant. The costumes are gorgeous. The writing is captivating.  Every time I watched it, it was just as wonderful as the time before.  I opted to buy the DVD because I felt cheated when I heard it was a 4 hour drama.  A&E only had it as a 3 hour.  What wonders did I mess out on?!
There is nothing about this series that I didn't like.  It had the right balance of politics to help understand what a King's duties are-without making it dry and boring.  There's enough tasteful romance in it to keep it racy without being obscene.  I was impressed with the historical accuracy.  You CAN make a period drama interesting without compromising it's integrity.
I cannot say enough about this drama.  It is perhaps the best movie I have ever watched!!
My only question:  Did the king love the queeen?  Is that the reason he stayed married to her?
I can't wait until I get my copy so I can watch it again!!
