Even if you aren't able to watch the DVD edition of Monsters, Inc, the VHS version is still laced with a few extras to enjoy at the beginning and the end of the film.
"For The Birds", the Academy Award Pixar short winner plays first, a wonderfully modest computer animation of little birds getting their just deserts when crossing power with a bigger bird while perched on a telephone wire. It is continuously the most hilarious 5-minute story you'll ever watch. We are also indulged to a small clip of Pixar's new movie "Finding Nemo" (coming to theaters in 2003), detailing the life of a young fish stolen from his coral reef home and the search his timid father must undergo to find him.
Next is the movie Monsters, Inc. the magnificent comedy that can be enjoyed by ANY age group. I am endlessly amazed just how clever the people at Pixar are, no detail is overlooked and the film flows with such energy and intellect the story is essentially believable.  
While the credits roll, we are treated to the bloopers that were later added to the theatrical release. A few include James stumbling up while entering the scare floor, Roz popping up in random places and your average character accidents like messing up lines. After the outtakes, Pixar ingeniously created the cast to perform, "Put That Thing Back Where It Came From Or So Help Me!" the play Mike and Sulley claimed they were rehearsing during the movie to cover up an argument (returning Boo to the human world), which duplicates the entire film's plotline into a musical rendition.
After the film, the animated short "Mike's New Car" is included, which has Mike showing Sulley his new 6-wheel drive vehicle that completely explodes with various mechanical problems. Not as funny as the movie itself or "For the Birds" in my opinion, yet still a delight.
Overall, everything about the tape is just superb, I highly recommend adding it to your Disney/Pixar collection.
