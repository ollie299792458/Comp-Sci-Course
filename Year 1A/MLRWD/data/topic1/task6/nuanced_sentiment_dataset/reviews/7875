I love St. Joan of Arc, but this movie doesn't accurately depict her or her life's story with accuracy! I'd give any St. Joan movie 5/5 stars anytime, but this one portrayed St. Joan as somewhat "mad". St. Joan wasn't always an angry, raving girl with looking to pick a fight with everyone around her! Wrong depiction of a historical figure from director Luc Beeson!

If you like sensational Hollywoood movie war scenes and computer graphics,
watch this movie.

OK, look, it has a good opening start! Modern people want to see ancient maps and history. It's awesome to see how movie showed audiences what happened, when and where at the very graphical opening start of the movie, and how St. Joan begin her life's story at the time of war. I'd give 5/5 stars on how this movie was told at the start, but everything else seems to go downhill from the second half.

Don't be lazy, go read decent historical books about St. Joan instead if you want to study her.

If you need to watch a modern movie about St. Joan, I'd recommend watching "Joan of Arc" (DVD) starring actress Leelee Sobieski (she looks like actress Helen Hunt). Her saintly aura shines out more in Leelee Sobieski. Her body type also more or less accurately depicts how the historical St. Joan may have looked like.

Milla Jovovich, my Lady, continue on with your "Resident Evil" series and sexy "Ultraviolet" movie roles! You fare much better in sci-fi action movies. You disappointed me, your fan, in this role as a saint! Throw the director's silly script aside, read the books on St. Joan, get inside her head while transporting yourself back to her world, then start acting as St. Joan in the 21st century.

Too bad the French have forgotten one of their famous saints these days!

Can someone competent make an epic Hollywood blockbuster of St. Joan?
