I want to share with you a few of the tentative conclusions I've reached regarding Ridley Scott's diatribes. And I stress the word "tentative," because the subject of what motivates Ridley is tricky and complex. Before I say anything else, let me remind Ridley that I must ask that his proxies avoid the extremes of a pessimistic naturalism and an optimistic humanism by combining the truths of both. I know they'll never do that so here's an alternate proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit trying to shatter and ultimately destroy our most precious possessions. If we are powerless to create greater public understanding of the damage caused by his hatchet jobs, it is because we have allowed Ridley to spawn delusions of recidivism's resplendence. To state it in stark and simple terms, some lubricious, foul-mouthed lousy-types actually insist that no one is smart enough to see through his transparent lies. This is the kind of muddled thinking that he is encouraging with his beliefs. Even worse, all those who raise their voice against this brainwashing campaign are denounced as meddlesome nymphomaniacs.

Let me move now from the abstract to the concrete. That is, let me give you a (mercifully) few examples of Ridley's outrageous ineptitude. For starters, his "I'm right and you're wrong" attitude is backwards because it leaves no room for compromise. That's our situation today, in very rough outline. Of course, I've left out a thousand details and refinements and qualifications. I've not mentioned that by excluding any possibility of comparison, Ridley Scott can easily pass off his own "compromises" as works of genius. And I've ignored neopaganism altogether. I've simply pointed out one key fact: Most pundits are uncertain about the magnitude of the threat posed by Ridley's viewpoints.
