When I sat down to watch Meet the Parents, I figured I was in for a good time.  Some of my friends had seen it and told me it was hilariously funny.  However, it didn't live up to my expectations.
Greg Focker (Ben Stiller), an interestingly named male nurse, wants to ask his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) to marry him.  But first, he must get the consent of her father, Jack (Robert De Niro).  From the moment they meet, Jack does everything in his power to find fault in Greg, who, as the opening song says, is a nice guy and therefore a loser.  Throughout the entire movie, Focker (a word which is never spoken without director Jay Roach attempting to make you laugh through repetitive and childish mishearing of the name) is the target of sarcasm and criticism whenever anyone talks to him.  When Greg goes to do something, all he manages to do is abuse himself or destroy things through tedious, overdone sight gags which are never more than a string of unfortunate coincidences.  This results either in more scolding and caustic remarks or an uncomfortable silence followed, of course, by more humiliation for Focker.
When all is said and done, Meet the Parents utterly fails at making a good, entertaining movie.  The complete dehumanization and humiliation of Greg Focker, aimed at making the audience like him through sympathy for his situation, only serves to disappoint rather than entertain.  We all have bad days, but suspending disbelief for the entire one hundred eight minutes of movie is harder than making it through the longest bad day.
