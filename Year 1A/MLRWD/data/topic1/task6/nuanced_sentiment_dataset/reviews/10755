Khartoum is both an African city and the name for some colorful 1884 North African history: the rise of a Messiah-like figure named "Mahdi" among the Muslims of present-day Sudan, the return of a noble general, Charles "Chinese" Gordon, who vanquished slavery in the area, and a tragic fight between the Mahdi and the noble general. 
That being said, the film works somewhat well as an action vehicle, but most of the more colorful events from the actual history are glossed over or not well portrayed. I found Laurence Olivier's portrayal of the Mahdi to be very weak with every kind of Muslim stereotype presented as well as some real kitschy overacting. Laurence Olivier simply doesn't pass as a radical Muslim leader. Charlton Heston should never EVER try to do accents again! His British accent more than flopped; it plummeted. The majority of the film suffers from overacting or just plain poor acting. What may have been billed as an Oscar-nominated screenplay in 1966 wouldn't fly today in 2003. 
The film's 134 minutes are not well arranged. The film suffers from numerous slow moments and the musical accompaniment is sleep inducing. Both my roommate and I snoozed while trying to watch this film. Some of the cinematography is breathtaking, but nowhere near the level of "Lawrence of Arabia." At any rate, even a little bit of good cinematography can't save this weak film. 
I'm giving this film three stars because it does a mediocre but passable job of being an action film. "Zulu" would be a much better film if you would like to watch British soldiers face off against native hordes. Then again, Charlton Heston's wooden acting might make this a camp film classic such as Heston being struck by a spear and slowly falling off a wall was pure cheese. Who knows?  
I don't recommend this film.
