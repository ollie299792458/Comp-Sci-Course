Anyone who loves the tv show The Dukes of Hazzard really should steer clear of this AWEFUL AWEFUL movie. I've noticed that the movies they made recently are a STAIN on the Dukes good family value name. Even Ben Jones who played Cooter in the tv series posted a blog about how disappointed he was in the movie. My friend and I tried to be open minded and rented it, but we noticed right from the start all the things that didn't work with what the tv show portrayed. We noticed within the first 10 to 15 minutes like 20 or so things that didn't work for us. Things that we loved about the tv show weren't there in the movie. We couldn't watch more than that we were so disgusted with the movie. My sister watched the whole thing and some of the things she told me from the rest of the movie didn't add up from the show either. Bo was not shy; Boss was not tall or an a**, he may have wanted the boys out of the way, but he didn't want them to get hurt; Rosco was not mean; they purposely welded the doors shut, not after an accident; Luke would NEVER fool around with a girl while Bo played look-out; in the tv show they were done with moonshine; and no offense to Jessica Simpson, but Catherine as Daisy had more class than Jessica and don't get me started on the 2 posers who tried to play Bo and Luke. The 2 guys from season 5 of the tv series did a better job than Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott. They may be good actors, but I feel sorry for everyone who was involved in this calamity. Really next time they want to try something like this remember "if it ain't broke... DON'T fix it!!!!" PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T mess with the Dukes anymore!!!
