For a movie that "moves" so much, there isn't much action here.  There's a lot of loud music, rapid fire editing, maps and time markers popping up on screen every six minutes, but that's about it.  Take away these attempts by director Scott to make it APPEAR as though a lot of action is taking place, and you're really left with a movie about some guys sitting in a subway.

The main one of those guys is John Travolta, in another performance so bad that I'm actually starting to think he's taken an oath to suck.  Never has a movie "villian" been so poorly written and acted as Travolta's "Ryder" in this film.  The dialogue he has to deliver is awful to begin with, but Travolta seemed determined to hammer this point home.  I've never heard someone scream "mother***ker" with such a lack of conviction.

As for the other actors, they seem to accept their roles as plot devices, and decide to phone in their performances.

The only other problems I couldn't get past were how people had Internet service in the subway tunnel. Or why the MTA dispatch center was so grandiose it would be the envy of NASA.  Or why the police were such bad drivers. Or why they didn't use the helicopter to deliver the ransom money.  Or why Travolta's character and his crew didn't just "stage" a terrorist attack instead, which would've still gotten them hundreds of millions of dollars, with the added bonus of not putting their lives in any danger.
