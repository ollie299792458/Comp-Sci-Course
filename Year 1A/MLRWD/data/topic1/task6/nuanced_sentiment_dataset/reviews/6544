The first two episodes of this season really almost did me in as a fan. It was so obvious that the show didn't know where to go. This is something that has cropped up here and there , in all of the earlier seasons , except perhaps the first. A good example would be the sudden, unlikely death of U-Turn. In fact, in my opinion, the writing on this show has ALWAYS been a little on the uneven side. The most popular three solutions to problems as they come bearing down on Nancy....the DEA, Nancy f's someone or someone dies...or sometimes all three, as in the case of Peter.

I stuck with it this particular season and at times I thought " cool , they're back, this is going to be great".  Unfortuneatly, it never really delivered anything solid or even very memorable other than maybe the conclusion.

I thought the show was very stale towards the end of the 5th season , again , other than the finale. Going on the run gave the show a real chance to settle, well , anywhere , really. My imagination soared at the concept of the clan somewhere a little different, such as Canada or Seattle. A chance to recapture some of that magic of the first two seasons without the repetitive, overbearing seriousness of her ascent through the higher ranks. Face it, Nancy was at her best when she was still a small fish.

I couldn't help but feel that the writers did not have an end game for the 6th season and didn't really expect a 7th season. It seemed everytime they ran out of quick laugh type scenarios...they moved them down the road. Finally, another option other than death, the DEA and/or sex...just move on. I really wonder if this is an option we may need to consider as fans, in order to preserve the memory of a once overwhelmingly fantastic, unique and innovative show.

I am starting to look at this show as Weeds : season 1-3, and Weeds Lite: Season 4&5 and now Sorta-Like-Weeds: now with less of a plot and fewer laughs BUT at least the scenary changes
