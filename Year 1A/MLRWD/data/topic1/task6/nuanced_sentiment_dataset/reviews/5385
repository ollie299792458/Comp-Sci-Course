I LOVED this movie in the theater- I'm a big Will Ferrell fan, and a closet NASCAR fan, and I believe this movie highlights everything that is hilarious about the sport and its enthusiasts.  However, my major beef with the unrated version is that some of my most favorite lines are missing and certain scenes are deleted- there isn't the option on this DVD of watching the "Rated" vs. "Unrated" version, which really disappointed me.  One of my most favorite scenes is the one early in the movie when little Ricky Bobby is in his momma's car and all he says is "I wanna go fast"...  I checked my DVD a hundred times, but that scene is totally gone!  If you saw the movie in the theaters and enjoyed that cut, I would highly recommend NOT buying this version because I feel as though this cut lost some of the flavor of the original movie cut.  Very disappointed.  I fortunately was able to exchange my DVD for the "rated" version, which still has all of the hilarious gag reels and deleted scenes available if you want to watch them.
