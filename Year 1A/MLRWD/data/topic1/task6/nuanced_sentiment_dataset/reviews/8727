I remember watching this movie in the mid 80s, having rented it at the local EROL's in excitement after reading the FANTASTIC & ScArY novel B4hand (countless times in fact). I occasionally watched it years afterward when it plays on looping cable. Let's just say this is NOT one of Carpenter's best!!!

Don't MISinterpret me as a Carpenter-"basher"! He used real creativity in directing two of mi favorite horror/suspense classics, HALLOWEEN & THE FOG. But those were vehicles (pardon the pun) of his own creation, along wi Debra Hill. In the case of CHRISTINE, it looks like someone just gave him a script, said "here U go, direct this!!!" & he did so withOUT reading the book or its elements!

Thus the movie is a letDOWN compared 2 the book as it CLEARLY WAS MADE 2 appeal to fans of Stephen King! It seems almost lazily cheap to imply that Christine is an "animal-force" with a life all her own when in fact (the book) she was nothing more than a conduit for the REAL EVIL villain- her prior-sole hateful & sinister owner: Roland Lebay who projected his rage, fury & menace onto & into the car like a storage battery over his lifetime thus her rampage was really a reflection of HIS rage. But Carpenter transposes those two elements (BIG mistake) 2 make it seem Lebay was just another victim of Christine's.

Other weaknesses R the acting which is FLAT & with no real emotion, the actors woodenly reading lines rite out of the book. The attacks R dull & lack the horrific violence that demonstrated the car's power in the novel which was told in a suspensful drawn-out type of story-telling that the film neglects. That radio playing is a lame gag & that final scene ("U two R heroes, U kno...") is a joke. Junkins was killed off in the story, BTW- a "post"reporting by the narrator that is left 2 the reader's imagination!

Nice try bi Carpenter.....but this is a story that NEEDS 2 B remade, definetly!!!
