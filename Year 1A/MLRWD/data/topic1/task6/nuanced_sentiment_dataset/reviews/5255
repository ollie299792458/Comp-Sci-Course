One of the greatest WWII films of all time, The Guns of Navarone has witstood the test of time, keeping the viewer in constant suspense.  Beyond the thrilling film itself, the DVD is a must-own because filled with  fascinating extra features.  
It is particularly engrossing to see the  numerous interviews and featurettes with the cast that were produced both  in 1960/61 and today.  I found it fascinating to hear the perspectives of  actors while they were working on the film contrasted with a forty-year  retrospective.  What I actually found more interesting was probably not  even intended by the producers of the DVD.  By watching  interviews/newsreels then and now with the fabulously talented cast  (Gregory Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn, etc.), one can not only learn  more about the conditions under which the film was produced, but also  witness to some extent the evolution of hollywood culture.  For lovers of  behind-the-scenes special features, this DVD is a must-own.
However, I do  agree with some of the other reveiwers complaints about the mediocre  transfer to DVD.  I did not think it was THAT big of an issue to hamper my  enjoyment of the film, however--only enough for me to amend my review from  5 stars to four.
