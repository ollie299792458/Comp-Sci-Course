I have been looking for years to buy the series.  I've had the companion book since the series first came out but was excited to watch the series again.  The first and last episode are very thought provoking about what would you do if these events/inventions hadn't happened.  If you don't watch episodes 2-9 (you are missing a lot) - please watch watch episodes 1 and 10.

The computer revolution episode may seem a little dated (although I'm a little dated because I worked with those technologies) but think what it would be like if we were still using those storage technologies and what may happen with our current storage technologies 10 years from now (will we be able to even read a DVD data disk?)  What is the next "connection" that may happen?

For those who missed the series in the late sixties, Connections is primarily about the history of technology and the places technology would appear - such as time measurement arising from monks wanting to pray at the same hour in the night.  Now you know who gave the world the idea for an alarum clock.

James Burke looks like he had genuine fun demonstrating inventions or watching historical recreations.  Burke keeps the program moving, so there are usually about 1 to 2 minute explanations while there is action taking place - no long boring lectures.
