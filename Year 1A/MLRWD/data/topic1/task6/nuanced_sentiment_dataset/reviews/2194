This is the most Life-Changing video I have ever watched. My number one favourite, it follows a mentally challenged man from Alabama in the most crucial decades of the century. What will leave you watching this is Forrest's good heart. He hasn't a clue of the evil in the real world, and lives his life on a gentle breeze. The ending is remarkable! When he is talking at the end under "He and Jenny's tree", I can't help but cry. What is also entertaining is how he tells the people he sits with on the bus-stop's bench his life story. A line my mom and I laugh over is when he almost sounds annoyed as he says," And I met the President of the United States, again" and he rolls his eyes. All in all, Forrest Gump is a must see for *almost* all ages-I don't know, I saw it for the first time when I was seven! If after you see this movie you don't feel an appreciation for life knowing that their are people as gentle, and kind as Forrest Gump, and don't wish to move to a town as charming and rural as 'Greenbo', then, well...Go watch Glitter or Crossroads!
