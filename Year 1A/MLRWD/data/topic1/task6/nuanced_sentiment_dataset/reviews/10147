Once you achieve catharsis, you can never go back.

I wanted to like this new movie, but it failed to deliver anything new or revelatory. I got closure after Battlestar ended, and watching this cylon perspective movie made with old footage mixed with new didn't re-create any kind of emotional impact for me. It was like watching a rerun with cutting-room floor scenes.

I'm not saying this movie is bad. It could have been so much better if the writer had just stuck to all-new material instead of interweaving old footage with new. Maybe the budget was lacking? And honestly, Cavil just isn't all that interesting when it comes down to his character. He's portrayed as this one-dimensional madman, but his demons are not completely exposed. There's no satisfaction in watching his character arc (it's not even an arc). He's a prick from beginning to end, and then you have the scene where he stabs the kid, which just completely felt gratuitous. You get more emotion and interest from watching Nixon in the Frost/Nixon interviews. Many other parts of the portrayals didn't quite work for me either, and overall, I felt this new movie didn't improve on how the series ended with various threads resolving character arcs.
