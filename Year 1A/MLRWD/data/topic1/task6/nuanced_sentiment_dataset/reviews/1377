This little gem comes to us from South Korea, which has been putting out a lot of great genre titles lately.  It is a monster movie that mixes horror, drama, and comedy.  The film begins with a reckless American scientist ordering some chemicals dumped down the drain.  We then cut ahead to meet the family at the center of the film, the Parks.

The family fits the definition of dysfunctional, with Gang-du, a dead beat son working in his father's food stand, his alcoholic brother that cannot get a job, in spite of being college educated, the sister with Olympic-level skill in archery, but is always to slow to win, and the Hyun-seo, the daughter of Gang-du.

It doesn't take long for the real star of the film to show up, however.  The monster appears underneath a bridge on the Han River and soon swims over to the populated beach, causing panic as it runs through the crowd, randomly crushing and eating people.

Hyun-seo gets grabbed by the monster and then it dives back into the river.  Everyone at the beach is quarantined to check for a virus, but the Parks soon receive a phone call from Hyun-seo, whom they thought was dead.  They decide to break out of quarantine and find her.

The promotional material for the film regarded it as "The greatest monster movie ever!" and "On par with Jaws!"  I would hesitate to put those kinds of accolades on the film, but I thought it was a really good movie.  There is a bit of anti-American sentiment in the movie, as the only Americans that are in the movie are bad guys, but it is my understanding that that is quite common in Korean cinema right now.

The special effects in this film where really great.  While the monster was really cool, I felt that the tight storytelling and the realism of the family was what set this movie apart.  Pretty much everyone has at least a somewhat dysfunctional family, so the Parks were easy to relate to.
