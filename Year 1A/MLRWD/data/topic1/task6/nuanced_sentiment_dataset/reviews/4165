This is a great movie....but if you want more of a story, go buy Basilisk instead. The movie is supposed to revolve around the battle between the Iga and the Kouga, but it's also supposed to be mainly around the two lovers Oboro and Gennosuke. You barely see them together, and more time is spent on  very brief but visually stunning battle sequences between the Iga and Kouga Ninjas. Isn't the point of a tragic romance to actually SHOW the romance a bit more? There's also lack of character development too, but considering how long you see some of them on the screen, it probably wasn't worth the director's time anyway. It's almost like the director chose the characters he wanted to showcase and threw the rest under a rug. Visually, this movie is stunning! The locations for Manjidani and Tsubagakure are completely different but very beautiful and show how much both ninja villages vary. Manjidani is a mountainous area that is more arid, whilst Tsubagakure is near a river and is surrounded by greenery. The special effects are AMAZING and you can tell that a majority of the director's budget was spent here instead of making more of a story. Overall, it's worth it to see this movie at least once. But make sure you watch Basilisk first.
