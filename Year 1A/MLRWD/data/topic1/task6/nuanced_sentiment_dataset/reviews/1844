I was going to write my own review of this but I don't think I can improve on what's already here. The movie simply isn't funny. The Axel Foley character is turned from a clever street wise cop always ahead of everyone into this clutz who can't seem to do anything right.
The story is about a couterfiet ring operating out of an amusement park. Somehow one of the bad guys shot Inspector Todd (a waste) back in Detroit and Axel is sent again to Beverly Hills.
This is one of those movies where the audience can see who the bad guys are from the beginning so there is no suspense here. We are supposed to wait for Foley to unmask the villains and expose the plot. Instead Foley fumbles through scene after scene of ridiculous situations in which he barely escapes except for plain dumb luck. Herein, Axel foley is a clutz who can't get the upper hand here no matter what and is not funny and in no way compares to the first 2 movies in this series.
The whole thing feels clumsy and awkward. Reccommend BHC 1 & 2.
