This movie has made Billions of $ Dollars for the pool and billiards industry. There would probably only be pinball, dart boards, and poker machine in bars, if it weren't for "The Hustler" & "The Color of Money". There would be no bar boxes, no pool balls, no Art. Pool is the only thing Artistic that happens in a bar. There is absolutely no reason to walk into a bar, unless you want to drink, lose money or play pool. These are your three options. Pool, by far, is your best choice. Even on a bar box, which is a six foot pool table(they started out being ten feet long and have shrunk since the 1950's), someone who can play with any ability is mesmerizing to watch. Pool is now global. It is  played by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, every day. The man who is partly responsible for that has just died, Paul Newman.  Fast Eddie lives no more, on earth. He has become one of the pool gods, actually the only real one that exists, and an archetype for pool lovers world wide. Plus this is one of the TOP TEN MOVIES OF ALL TIME, PERIOD. "And man you sure play a great game of pool."
