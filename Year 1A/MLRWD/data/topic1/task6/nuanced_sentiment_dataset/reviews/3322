It's much more and oddly moving which leads to violence and gore because sometimes you just cant have a happy ending. This is not only the Years Best Films buts one of the best horror films of the year along with "28 Days Later" of 2003. If you can't have a freind make one, May (Merle Kennedy) is a young girl who grew up wearing a pirate patch covering her lazy eye,she never really had freinds and was always considered weird. Her only freind was a doll that her mom gave her and was the only freind all her life, she said that "If you can't have a freind make one". Until she sees Adam (Jeremy Sisto), crazy for him especially his hands she has a relationship for the first time in her life. But when things go wrong Adam dumps her. Now she knows that people aren't always 100% perfect only some parts are! This is a great weird film also apearing in this film is Angela Bettis(Scary Movie,1,2,3,). If you like weiredness, drama and comedy with a bit of horror this is your kind of movie, it's definetly a rare must-see!
