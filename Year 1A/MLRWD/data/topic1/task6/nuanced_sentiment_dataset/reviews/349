This film was a truly remarkable adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel, Little Women.  The cast is near perfect, although I couldn't picture Claire Danes as "Beth", she was wonderful emotionally mind you but she wasn't physically "Beth".  Winona Ryder puts on a stunning performance as "Jo", I could go to sleep to the sound of her voice.  And Kirsten Dunst is the unforgettable "Amy", she's so cute.  Later in the film Samantha Mathis plays grown up "Amy" and though not as cute as Kirsten Dunst she's very pretty and portrays the grown "Amy" very well.  Trinni Alvarodo is the mortherly "Meg" and is exactly how I picture Meg to be.  Susan Saradan is loveable "Marmee" and is so moving in that role that you almost wish she was your own mother.  The movie followed the novel very nicely and though a few scenes from the book were not included in the movie(those missing scenes aren't an any versions of Little Women), it was still a heart-warming film and one that I love watching again and again.
