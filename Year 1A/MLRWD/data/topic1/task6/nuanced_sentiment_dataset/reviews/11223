The coincidences in this film piled up a mile high.And what is it with this so called great director's attitude toward men,he has outright contempt for them.The men in the film or the ones that are referred to are  either ineffectual,sex-crazed,invisible,burdensome,transexual(which,in the  context of this film makes you an authority on men and women)or just  downright evil.There is such a dearth of quality American cinema that a  contrived,pretentious,female chauvinistic film such as this can win an  academy award.Just imagine if the roles were reversed and women were the  objects of hatred in this film.N.O.W. would picket the movie every night it  showed.Boogie Nights was lambasted for it's frank depiction of the porno  industry and it's frequent use of "colorful metaphors",but this  film is praised and it's just as dirty or even worse when it comes to  dialogue.I guess if you say it in another language it's considered art,but  if you say it in english it's considered dirty or controversial.That's one  of the double standards when it comes to foreign films.Don't be fooled by  the high production values or the sympathetic characters in this film,it's  all an assault on men that Patricia Ireland would be proud of.I recommend  you see this film if only to see if you agree.
