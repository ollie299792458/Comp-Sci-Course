I doubt one documentary could ever present the whole truth and nothing but the truth (as R-Truth might say). This latest version is just that--simply, the most updated.

If a fan wants a more complete look at what it took to bring each event to the WWE Universe, as well as some real interesting trivia and insight into the match booking, I would first direct that person to finding a copy of the 5-star, coffee table sized book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060393874">WrestleMania: The Official Insider's Story</a>. Next, try and locate a used copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305994781">WWE WrestleMania 2000</a>. The second disc of the 2-disc DVD set contained a real nice look at some of each 'Mania's key match(es) through 'Mania XV--complete with various commentary by superstars and other personalities. In fact a few of the commentaries on the blu-ray are directly from that WrestleMania overview.

Finally, highly acclaimed books by various WWE superstars like Mick Foley, Bret Hart, Chris Jericho, Shawn Michaels, Edge, Steve Austin, et al. provide loads of details about backstage happenings and context for matches they were in (and others' as well). Of course, it is from their point of view and some superstars will always carry legit grudges against some guys for one reason or another. But most of them are pretty on the level.

The other reason I bought this documentary--specifically the blu-ray version--is to get some of the older matches in the blu-ray format. (I won't get into the match listing since other reviewers will do that, or comment on the matches themselves since all of them deserve to be on these discs.) I didn't expect anything before WrestleMania XXIV to be truly HD; the matches from older WrestleManias included on the disc definitely look lots better than any DVD version out there, but don't expect eye-popping detail. Most of the time the matches, especially from the 80s and 90s, simply appear less pixelated; the images are still quite soft and look their age.. just cleaner. The match selection is good enough that, when combined with specific superstar or themed match collections, should allow the fan to avoid buying any of the pricey WrestleMania (or other PPV) anthology sets.

If the WWE wants to do older WrestleManias right, they would release more editions like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MLWQ7W">Wrestlemania III (Championship Edition)</a>, complete with commentary from the wrestlers who headlined the 'Mania or provided the most memorable moments, and background material/video packages so the context of the otherwise obscure matches (to most fans) can be understood.

There are some nice elements, such as the behind-the-scenes look at WrestleMania IX, and I did enjoy hearing from the various superstars and crew members. But these moments are mostly scattered and brief. How this documentary can not have *any* comments/thoughts from four of WrestleMania's greatest superstars--The Undertaker, Bret Hart, Randy Savage, Roddy Piper--is egregious for a story wanting to create any form of value. In short, by itself, this is WrestleMania History 101 (or a supplemental set to the WM2000 documentary at best). Die-hard fans will need to seek out more sources for a truly in-depth experience.
