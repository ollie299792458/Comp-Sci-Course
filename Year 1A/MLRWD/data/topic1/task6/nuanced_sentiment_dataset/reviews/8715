Bottom line up front:  I would not pay $25 to watch this movie again, but I probably will buy it to see the bonus footage.  Everything I had read pointed to this being really great, but it was a little disappointing.  Barry Pepper did a good job and the actress playing Theresa was good as well.  The actor playing Junior did not have a clue.  They left a major character out until the end, which was the Daytona International Speedway.  The track killed his best friend, which is given about 30 seconds of play.  He had numerous near misses there, and more wins at Daytona than any other driver but he could not win the 500.  The movie gives you no sense of why it was such a big deal for him to win the Daytona 500.  You are also left to figure out for yourself why Dale and Darrell Waltrip are mortal enemies, but at the end of the film Waltrip's brother drives a car owned by Dale.  Too much had to be left out because of time wasted in the beginning, I guess.  Earnhardt is a legend because he drove his way, was the best, and made everyone love him without changing who he was.  I didn't really get that from this movie.  I do have to say that the end was a great bit of filmmaking.  Very haunting without being horrific.  Fading to a white screen and hearing DW ask "What about Dale, he all right?" I'm getting chills typing this.  After the broadcast, ESPN hyped the DVD as containing 5.5 hours of footage inculding interviews and race footage.  Depending on the races they use, that alone could be worth buying.
