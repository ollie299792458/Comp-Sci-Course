The comparisons have been made before, but I'lll go ahead and make them again: this film is a lot like Armageddon, only the characters have to go into the Earth to rescue humanity, rather than into space.  Earth faces a number of catastrophic disasters (destruction of Rome & San Francisco),and humanity gathers a group of select people to save it.  They face perils on the way to, and at their destination, not the least of which is the people in mission control, who might end up hurting their mission.

With that being said, this is a pretty entertaining popcorn flick.  Although scientifically inaccurate, it is a pretty decent waste of time.  The characters are fairly stereotypical, but engaging on the surface level.  The special effects for the disaster scenes are pretty fun, and the plot was at least moderately entertaining.  I actually enjoyed this film more than Armageddon, or the Day After Tomorrow (which I borderline loathed outside of the special effects).  As long as you don't expect a classic, you'll probably be entertained for about two hours.
