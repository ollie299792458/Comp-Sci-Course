I gave this DVD a three-star rating because as of this writing, I am one episode away from the final episode of season two and I think season two was much better than season one. The final episode of season two is sitting on my DVR, and I am just waiting until I can sit back and totally enjoy it.

I have enjoyed Eastbound and Down, though like Tony Soprano, Kenny Powers needed to grow on me. I am female, and as unattractive and kind of gross as I thought Tony Soprano was when I first started watching the Sopranos, I felt Kenny Powers was just as unattractive and kind of gross. I ended up really liking them both!

I can understand reviewers who said, "Who would hang around with this guy?" because Kenny Powers really is not your average guy and he is quite crass most of the time. But first of all, it's TV and there is all kinds of personalities on TV and second of all, I don't think it would be unrealistic to think a real-life guy like Kenny Powers would have lots of friends. He's actually pretty funny and he is way more vulnerable than he wants to let on.

Anyway, I won't write any spoilers about season two ... all I will say is that season two is very good. However, the only thing that bugs the heck out of me is that there were six episodes in season one and only seven in season two. I am sorry, but six or seven episodes does not make a season.

I give season two four stars. I might have given it five stars had it lasted longer.
