I loved loved adored adore the film. From the opening atmospheric ominous scenes, to the majestic musical score, to the stark gloomy yet realistic flashback scenes. I will deFINitely buy the DVD when it comes out (hopefully with subtitles as a some of the speech was incomprehensible). Also I plan to buy all Dan Brown novels. This form of mass media entertainment (video games, CD, DVD, books) CAN ONLY encourage & inspire people to study history with renowned zest, curiosity & wonder. I love the way the film parallels the advantages/disadvantages of belief & non belief in a Jesus Christ, God & religion. Why do closed minded religious extremists consider this to be blasphemous? It's as objective, middle grounded as you can get, with a conclusion that will leave believers & skeptics all equally satisifed, amazed & riveted. If there is one, God bless Hollywood for once I think perhaps those rich actors deserve all their money. Tom Hanks was amazing, so underrated, go Forest Gump! The scene in Teabing's mansion where they unravlled the mystery of a human civilization was profound: a LITERAL Book Of Revelation on film. Would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for Audrey Tautou's unclear French accent. Screw Harry Potter, [...] Lord Of The Rings. This book could be the Holy Grail, the secular saint, the answer to end all answers. GOD'S A WOMAN BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO THE FATHER IS? [...]
