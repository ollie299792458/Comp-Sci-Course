Gave a Four-Star because husband gifted me with the Set and though was a New/sealed set, Disc 1 was CRACKED! (Amazon, you've disappointed me! WAS a first out of hundreds of purchases, but as can't return once opened, I must buy a second copy of the set now to replace that one disc!) I DO LOVE the Forsyte Saga (I also own the 3 novels); this Granada Television production is beautifully and lovingly handled by all involved, IMHO. What a great cast! (the one exception being Gina McKee, a miscast I'm afraid, tho I think I'm not alone in that assessment); hats off to Galsworthy for such a variety of well-developed, memorable characters and a masterpiece of a narrative/examination of social developments/psychological insight (despite his critics' undervaluation of him and the overshadowing by some other authors, his readers have enduringly appreciated him). Episode Four is my favorite!  I located the beautiful, elegaic poem Young Jolyon reads at Old Jolyon's funeral - it's (not surprisingly) by Shakespeare!  This is a rich, winning production I will watch again and again and never grow tired of.
