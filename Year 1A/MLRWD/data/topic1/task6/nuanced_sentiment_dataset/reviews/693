Wow!  If you don't know what Pokemon is, you've probably been stuck in a cave for the past year or so with your fingers in your ears.  Just kidding.  Well, we all have grown to love (or hate) Pokemon for our own reasons.  Anyway, down to the movie.
The movie itself was done pretty well.  It is  just like the cartoon you can watch on your television set, but with a  clearer picture quality and better soundtrack (it really is pretty good).  No story spoilers, but it is a pretty basic story.  Good vs. Evil.  The  Pikachu's Vacation short is really cute and will appeal to kids who don't  like violence all the way to kids who want to see action (there's  competitions).  As for the movie, I wouldn't recommend it for kids who  don't like the fighting aspect of Pokemon, but rather one particular  pokemon (such as Pikachu or Psyduck).  The story can get quite violent and  my godbrother and godsister (about age 12 and under) really did not enjoy  the violence in the film (violence = evil deeds from the evil side of the  team).
However, if you can bypass that whole violence part of Pokemon,  then it's a pretty good movie.  Though simple in story, it does a pretty  good job capturing the essence of the television show and video game.  You  get to see new pokemon from gold and silver AND... you get a free promo  card!  Well, I did anyway.  So if you've never seen this movie yet, worth a  rental.  If you're a poke-maniac, buy it asap.  If you don't like pokemon  whatsoever... then... er... don't even consider it.  It won't change your  opinion (however, the show and games might).
