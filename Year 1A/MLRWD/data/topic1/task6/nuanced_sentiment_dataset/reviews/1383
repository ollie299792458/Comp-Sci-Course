I find it interesting that if you make a movie with people getting their heads blown off and their guts spread all over the ground most people don't even bat an eye.  But, make a movie about a pederast and people want to form a lynch mob.
  Yes, horrible things happen in this movie.  Guess what?  Horrible things happen in real life.  I think the whole point of this movie was to show some people trying to be happy, but going about it in all the wrong ways.  I think another thing that bothers most people about this movie is that most of the characters are presented (initially) as "normal" people, but we end up seeing them for "horrible, depraved sickos" that they are.  The problem lies in the "fact" that depraved sickos aren't allowed to be "normal."  We're "normal."  Depraved sickos wear hockey masks and do horrible things like in those other movies.  They don't hold down jobs and have families, etc.
  I'm not sure why I'm even writing this "review" except to say that I think this is a great, challenging movie.  The acting is awesome, the plot is interesting, and the problems are real.  
  I also wanted to comment on another reviewer's statement that the scene with the boy and his father at the end of the film was pointless.  I felt that was one of the most crucial, and moving, scenes of the entire film.  Here we have a man who does, what we would consider incorrigible things, but he could never consider doing those things to his own son because he loves him so much.  I'll be .....!  A pedophile with a heart?  Nah...
