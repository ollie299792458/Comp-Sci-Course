This is one of those movies where I felt the trailer was better then the movie itself. I mean the trailer got my attention and I wanted to watch this movie. It looked great and fun. But when we (family) saw  the DVD, it was just `ok'. Nothing special. It's nice, has some good jokes, cute. Nice characters. I liked the little robot, Roofer.

It was `ok' to watch, but that's it. The kids were not really into it. They watched it, but there was no `spark'. Our 5 year old stopped watching after 15 minutes. Nothing compared to any Disney-Pixar movie, or Shrek, or Ice Age, or Madagascar, or.... Well, there are so many really great animation movies. Today for example I saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030ZIZRC">LEGO: The Adventures of Clutch Powers</a> with my son, with which we were so much more entertained then with Planet 51.

I rate Planet 51 just 2 stars, because after watching the trailer I expected much more. So I was somewhat disappointed. Also there are so many really great animation movies these days, I really can't give it more then 2 stars.
