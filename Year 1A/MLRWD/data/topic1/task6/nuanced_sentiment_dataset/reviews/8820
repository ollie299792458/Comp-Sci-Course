This movie is at the same time one of the greatest and one of the most disappointing of all time. The story line couldn't be better, the foresight of the producers couldn't be worse. This movie can only be enjoyed in a theater with a special screen designed for that aspect ratio. This is how I saw it in 1959 in Hollywood. In 1959 there was huge fear with the hollywood  "mucky-mucks" that nobody would go to theaters because of TV. So instead of all getting together and planning a different aspect ratio other than TV's 4:3, which was adopted because of all the old movies it could purchase, Hollywood producers went on an "ego-trip" and developed a numerous amount of different aspect ratios to identify their work from other producers. This is how "black bars" on your TV screen were born. Ben-Hur is among the worst. The total amount of picture on a 16:9 TV,that all of us have, is less than 50%. In the 20's hollywood moguls,owners of studios like Louie B Mayer and others, got together an decided to have "one" aspect ratio in part so that the theaters at the time could show everybody's movies from everybody's studios. If the same thing was done in the 50's that way we would all be better off now. I have a LG Blu-Ray player which allows me to get rid of the black bars but at a sacrifice. I lose 30% of the picture on both sides. When the Chariot scene comes on I switch back to normal. The rest of the movie can be watched without bars reasonably well. I have 3 Blu-ray players from 3 different companies but only the LG can do this.
