I bought this used (new in package) through Amazon, and while the package says it has the bonus dance and the "behind the scenes" chapters--the DVD does not. Only the main two workouts, the slow dance, flex segment and the tutorial are on this DVD.

And as far as the "slow dance" at the end of the first workout section, while you can chapter to it from your remote, it is not separately titled in the menu.  How do I know? I had borrowed the DVD previously, and that one says at the beginning "Sony Music Entertainment" and has a different menu, with a separate chapter for the slow dance, as well as the separate bonus menu.

As to the workout itself, it would have been much better if Ansuya and Kathy had been side by side throughout the video, instead of only during the tutorial.  Also, Kathy's green tie-top in the first section was very distracting with the wide sleeves and the tie hanging down (part of learning is seeing the belly area as well as the arms).

The second section was good, but Kathy's costume did nothing to show off her new-found dancing ability--the skirt was made of a straight front and a straight back, and only emphasized that she didn't have a belly dance type of body (no knock on her, she's in great shape). Could have done without the whooping, however.

The flexibility section at the end is really nice, and good for a cooldown after any type of workout.

I hope she does another video with Ansuya, with side-by-side instruction, and also a lot more profile instead of three-quarter-view camera angles. This is a good beginner's workout, but again, the Goldhil version does NOT have the bonus features.
