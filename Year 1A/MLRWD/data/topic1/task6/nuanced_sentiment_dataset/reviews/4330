Clint Eastwood broke the mold when he starred in "The Outlaw Josy Wales" about a man whose family were all killed by Kansas Red Leg Union Soldiers, and even when the rest of his company turned themselves in to swear Alligence To The United States, Josey refused.  When the Union, headed by the same Red Legs out of Kansas killed the his comrades except for one boy, he turned one of their machine guns on the executioners and then tried to take care of the boy who ended up getting shot while trying to warn the leader of their company who talked them into turning themselves in.
  This is a story about a man who always comes back to help a friend and in the end, rescues a family whose son happened to be a Kansas Red Leg.  He helped them escape certain death from their captors, Commencheros, and then even talked an Indian Chief into letting them live on Indian property and saved the lives of 2 more friends.  He falls in love with a simple minded daughter of the red leg whose family he had saved and in the end, even makes peace with the head of his company, who did not know his company would be slaughtered.
  This movie is based on the end of the Civil  War after the South had surrendered at Appomatox Courthouse.  The men still fighting were called "hold-outs" because they had faced such hurt by some of the bad Union soldiers that they were not ready to give in, yet, and understood considering some of these Union soldiers had taken the families and everything owned by these Southern men; they simply wanted justice and some of them did not feel they had completed justice of family members being raped and killed-their kids just stabbed and gutted right in front of them. War is a terrible thing and this movie shows some of the horror that can come from war, especially when it's fought in the same country you live.
