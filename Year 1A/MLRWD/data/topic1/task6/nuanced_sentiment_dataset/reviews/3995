***Public Service Announcement: If You Liked The TV Show "I Spy" DON'T SEE THE MOVIE***
The biggest thing the clymers who made the movie "I Spy" failed to notice about the original TV show, was that it was a serious TV show about spying and guns and death and stuff, with a special banter between two men who knew each other and sometimes hated their work, but used the comedy to take the edge off the pressure......
I doubt the jerks that made the movie ever saw the TV show........
The original show, produced by Sheldon Leonard and starring Robert Culp as Kelly Robinson a Tennis player, and Bill Cosby, (in the first lead African American role on TV) as Alexander Scott his trainer, broke new ground in educating Americans how their CIA actually worked.
Every show, (now available on DVD) had a serious challange that dealt with real world items, that sometimes required cold blooded justice, and sometimes required agents Scott and Robinson to do things they weren't exactly proud of, but were necessary for the National Security of the country.....they never flintched, but used their banter to offset some of the horror that was going on.....
This terrible film had a fine cast and wasted it on a horrible story, horrible charactor development, lousy premise and the idea that "I Spy" was a comedy........It was not, and while it wasn't expected to be taken too seriously, it started from a serious premise which provided a nice vehicle for the comedy, which was only spoken words between two friends......
I am about to watch one of the DVD's I have to expunge the memory of this incredibly bad film, in the hopes that someday an adult will repurchase the rights and make a really terrific film, and elevate "I Spy" to where it should be.
As for the actors, McDowell is always the best bad guy and Eddie Murphy and Colin Wilson could have been a perfect Kelly and Scott, but in this one their characters are switched, giving Colin the Cosby character, which I guess we're supposed to see as humor but was probably because the clowns making this film didn't KNOW they were switched......
