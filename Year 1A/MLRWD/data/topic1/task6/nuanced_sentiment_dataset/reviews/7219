After really liking a couple of the earlier Judd Apatow movies, I was very lukewarm on "Knocked Up," but I figured anyone could have an off day. After watching "Superbad," I'm convinced he's just phoning it in now.

As the movie starts, I'm thinking "Okay, right, the classic, cliche unpopular-virgin-guys-conspire-to-get-laid-on-one-crazy-night-before-high-school-graduation movie. You've seen this movie countless times before, from "Porkies" to "American Pie" and hundreds in between. So I was expecting some twist or parody of the genre. As the movie ended, I was still waiting. It really IS just nothing more than it appears - a cliche, derivative teen sex comedy. And not any funnier or more clever than any other teen comedy you've ever seen. AND Apatow has already done the virginity thing anyway. This guy is just cashing in quickly while he still has a career left, which won't be long now.

If you've been living in a cave your whole life or you're only 16 and you have no knowledge of the countless movies this mimics or you don't normally watch movies, this will all be new to you and you'll get a few laughs out of it. Otherwise, keep your expectations VERY low.
