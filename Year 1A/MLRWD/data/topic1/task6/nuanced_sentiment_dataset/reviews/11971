Did someone say this is Spielberg's worst movie in a decade? I think it was The Lost World (read the novel and then watch the movie - you would want to confiscate all his Oscars!).

But that is besides the point. (yes, "great" Spielberg is "besides the point"). Don't get mad. Just listen.

If you should watch this movie, it is not because this is a Spielberg movie. If you do, you would end up back here writing a horrible review. You should watch this movie, because in it Tom Hanks has proven that he ziga-light-years ahead of all your cute/handsome/dashing/whatever actors who are not really "actors".

The thing is, that a true "actor" is the one who can make you forget that "he/she" is on the screen. All you should see is the "character" he/she is playing. And Tom Hanks can do just that. You never Tom Hanks - you see Forrest Gump. You never see Tom Hanks - you see Chuck Noland. You never see Tom Hanks - you see Victor Navorski. That is a true actor. That is what acting is about. The key word here is - "convincing".

If you want to, for once, not be bombarded with pretentious glamour that radiates by itself from an actor; If you want to just forget everything an lock-onto the character - then watch this movie.

As for the flaws... well, Spielberg's genes didn't come down the mountain on two stone tablets. So forgive him.
