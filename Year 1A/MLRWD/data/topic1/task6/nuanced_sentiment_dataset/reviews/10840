I have loved motion pictures since I was a little boy. I'm in my 50's now and have seen thousands of movies. Mutiny On The Bounty (1962) is my personal favorite. Why? There is something magical about this movie. First, it is a great story that is well told. Secondly, the acting is superb. Trevor Howard and Marlon Brando play there parts perfectly. And what a supporting cast as well. The scenery is breathtaking. The music is hauntingly beautiful. It displays almost every human emotion there is. It is also a great tragic love story. It is so easy to become engrossed in this movie. Yes, you can have a great movie experience without CGI (computer graphics imaging) Even after watching it dozens of times, tears still come to my eyes at the end every time. The regular DVD version is visually stunning. Even my wife commented how vividly colorful and clear everything looked. It is eye candy. I have watched the 1935 version with Clark Gable and also Mel Gibson's version to give them a fair shake. To me, it is not even close. The 1962 version is so much better. If the last time you saw this was on VHS tape, or if you have never seen before now, I highly recommend you check this out DVD version. If even a little of it's magic works itself into your soul, you will know what I have been talking about. Mutiny On The Bounty (1962) is movie making at it's finest!!!
