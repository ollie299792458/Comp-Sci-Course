I am strictly reviewing the film, not the DVD features.
Many people are complaining this film is too confusing for some, but I must point out that ONLY TIM BURTONS VERSION WAS CONFUSING. I will now explain the ending to those who were confused...
Future humans waged an atomic war againts themselves, destroying the most of the species. Apes however, survived and built a new civilization. Over time, the humans became stupid.
Story:
A time warped astronaut (Heston) crash lands on a world where apes rule over a primitive race of humans.  He then must rely on two chimps (McDowell Hunter) to escape from the planet.
Whats Good:
 Pretty much everything. The story is respectable for a sci-fi film of the 60's, delivering a good message, and haunting finale. Alos, it stands it's own when giving out some great qoutations I.E. Damn them, Damn them all to hell. Notthing to violent,, good for the family. Very thought provoking
Whats Bad:  
The ape make-up takes sometime to get used to. Although not laughable, it is alittle odd. Also, the opening walk through the desert is a wopping 30 minutes. It does a fair job of standing it's own against the book, but not as good.
Final say: 5 Stars : This film is definantly a keeper for the ages.
