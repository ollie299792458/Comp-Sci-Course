This movie is loosely based on DAY OF THE JACKAL with Edward Fox as the jackal and Tony Britton as the French detective trying to stop him before he can act. To those who have seen the original, this is a terrible remake.

To those who have not seen DAY OF THE JACKAL, Bruce Willis makes all of his roles interesting as the killer. Richard Gere plays the role of the detective, but in the movie he is a... wait for it--"Irish Republican Army" terrorist brought out of jail to find the Jackal. I kid you not--an IRA terrorist. We have seen Richard Gere play Sir Lancelot in FIRST KNIGHT with a Brooklyn accent. Now you get to see him as an Irishman with a Brooklyn accent.

Blame whoever came up with this ridiculous idea for Gere's character, because the IRA has nothing to do with the plot. The character could just as well have been a former hit man from Brooklyn. Getting past that for the moment, if you knew nothing about the original movie, it is a reasonably good thriller.
