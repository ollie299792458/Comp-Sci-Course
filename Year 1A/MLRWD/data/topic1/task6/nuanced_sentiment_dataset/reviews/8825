A lot of the other people who have reviewed this drama called it a "psychosexual drama." If by that they mean that it's a drama about a psycho who has sex, well maybe I'll consent to that label. It seems that my opinion of this film does not concur with the other reviewers; still, I will say this: I find this film utterly deplorable. It is a pseudo-intellectual excuse to get Neve Campbell in multiply sex scenes. People who consider themselves to be thinkers will use this film as an excuse to fulfill their lusts. The plot is minimal, slow, and uninteresting. It's similar to the plot of "Wild Things" in that two men think they are manipulating a young girl, but conversely they themselves are being manipulated by her. In both films this secretly genius manipulator in played by Neve Campbell, and in both films she has many sex scenes. In this, she is a spoiled rich girl, and it seems that she manipulates simple because she is bored. You do not even find out what she is doing till the end of the film, though. Up until that point it just seems like a disheveled pile of scenes about characters you don't care about. The plot in this film is just a thin veil, really, to cover up the real point of the film: the sex scenes. The thing of it is, they are poorly done and poorly timed, so the whole point of the movie is blown. Often in this film there are parts in which characters are speaking, but you can't hear them because the music is too loud. Sometimes it's hip-hop, others it's classical (I believe the classical outnumbers the rap), still the music is overwhelming. If you are looking for an interesting psychodrama, look elsewhere, and even if you just want to watch a sexy film, skip this one; it is NOT worth it.
