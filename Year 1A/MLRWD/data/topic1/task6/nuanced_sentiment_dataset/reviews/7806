This cult classic has been sadly out of print on VHS, so I was so happy they finally issued the Elfman brother's masterpiece on DVD.  If Rocky Horror was the "Citizen Kane" of the Midnight Movie, Forbidden Zone is more of a "Ben Hur": an epic you have to watch it entirely through to believe it.

The blend of b-movie camp, Max Fleischer surrealism, Cab Calloway and Jazz Era excess collide with a plot that's probably best left unsaid. Yes, there are plenty of borderline offensive jokes and archetypes that run from anti-pc outrage to cliche back to outrage again, but the punk rock schlock aesthetic that the Elfman brother's had tapped into in the 1980's is as cutting edge then as it was 25 years ago.

What was most suprising were the additional features - you found out the background of the "Mystic Knights" and how talented and energetic the theater troupe that had formed the basis for the film was (many of the characters in the movie were part of a Theater Troupe that would later become Oingo Boingo, Danny Elfman included).  If you have a few films that stand up to repeat, late-night viewings - this is definitely one of them!
