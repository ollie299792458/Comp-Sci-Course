I'll say this for the Road Runner formula; it's incredibly solid and hard to screw up and I'll enjoy anything with the Road Runner.  But I probably could have waited a bit longer for most of the Rudy Larriva directed shorts that make up about half of this DVD if I could have had the rest of the Chuck Jones directed shorts that weren't covered by the Looney Tunes Golden Collections (about 10 of them from 1958 to 1964).  At least none of these double dip from the LTGC's, but it seems as though the manufacturers decided to start at the end of the Road Runner's classic series in late 1966 and (perhaps) work their way back to where they left off in late 1958.  One can only hope.  I loved The Solid Tin Coyote because the Road Runner was actually scared of that thing (unlike anything else the Coyote created) and it actually managed to CATCH the Road Runner (the Road Runner got lucky, of course, and got away).  And of course we get some of the Road Runner shorts like Soup or Sonic, Chariots of Fur, and Whizzard of Ow that Chuck Jones came back to direct in the 1980's and 1990's.  And I'm curious about those Webtoons that were made only recently, are they much good?  Two I had wished had made it to this collection were Beep Prepared (the only Oscar nominated Road Runner short where the Coyote literally goes out in a blaze of glory in a rocket sled to the stars) and Lickety Splat (which had a great running gag with flying dynamite sticks that follow the Coyote everywhere and blow him away about a dozen times).
