I was dismayed when I opened the box of this movie, discovering it was a "flippy" DVD. For those uninitiated, a "flippy" is a 2-sided DVD with both the Widescreen and Standard versions of the film (or maybe the documentary and extras in the back side.

Regretably, this usually is a sign that you'll have to buy another copy in 5 to 10 years; a "flippy" DVD is just an aluminum layer and the necesary data layers trapped inside two thin plastic platters. Your life expectancy of such a contraption depends on the quality of the glue used to hold the thing together. If the glue is poorly applied or becomes porous with age, air will seep in and start oxidizing the aluminum layer... effectively destroying its reflective capabilities, thereby killing your DVD copy.

As expected (I bought my copy in Sept. 2008), the disk's shiny surface has started to darken in a circular pattern around the outer edges, which are surefire first signals of DVD-rot. This blemish will slowly extend all over the disk, and my copy of the "Wedding Singer" will be dead by the end of the year.

If you want to buy a copy of this movie, make sure you're getting a standard DVD, instead of a "flippy"... it will save you the aggravation of having to buy a new copy as years go by...
