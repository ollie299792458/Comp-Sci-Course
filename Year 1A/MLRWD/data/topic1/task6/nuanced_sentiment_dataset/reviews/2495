A guy rubs his dog across a canvas covered with paint because he wonders what will emerge.  Later, minds eager to see life & meaning stare at that same painting in awe and pay 20k to own it.  It's called art.  This is that kind of film.

  A director says "what if" and during the process we can create interesting situations, like this young black kid who is lonely making friends with the sad middle-aged white guy and they somehow help each other.  Somehow this guy living on his front lawn for some unknown reason becomes the catalyst for all these people having realizations and working through their issues.  Also, lets toss in a few yard sale buyers acting like no yard sale buyers we've ever seen...ever...in 20 years of having and going to yard sales.

  Hey, it was a totally fabricated 'feel good' kinda movie.  A few laughs.  A few cries.  A whole lot of whatever in between.  Obviously, Will hit the top of his game in "Stranger Than Fiction", but you gotta sell some drama while the iron is hot.  Let's face it, Will Ferrel has printed a TON of film for a "Chevy Chase type" product and 'Fletch type' movie drama is the reasonable short term move until he moves into the "funny extra" stage of his career.  Quite frankly, I see some good "Steve Martin type" small film productions coming out of this guy for years if he stays in good shape - possibly even at least one "Castaway" type adventure movie.  I probably will always watch a Will Ferrell movie and "like" it at the very least, just because he is a comic of my generation.  Taledaga Nights rules!!
