This is a PERFECT example of an excellent DVD.  It has incredible picture and sound quality, awesome extras, and [best of all] it's an unbelievely GREAT movie.
First of all, the picture quality is great.  I have a regular 36" TV and watching this movie on VHS blurrs some details.  For instance the ending scene with Lector walking away free in some forgein country, unlike on the VHS, on the DVD version, everyone of the dozens of people Lector passes by is explicitly clear and is clearly defined.
Next, the bonus stuff is super.  It has lots of deleted scenes, including a few which introduce the character of Paul Krendler [who plays a major role in "Hannibal"].  Then the Outtake reel was nice, after being so tense watching the movie, it was nice to see outtakes of the characters acting naturally.  The featurette was also nice [for a featurette], but what really blew my socks off was the documentary.  The documentary, entitled "Inside the Labyrinth" was about 1 hr 10 min long, and was incredibly interesting and well put together.  It was surprizing to find all the incredible behind the scenes talent who worked on this movie; like Coleen Atwood, Howard Shore, Kristi Zea.  Also, after freaking me out in the movie, it was neat seeing Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill) out of character.  Exceptional documentary on an exceptional movie.
This is now one of the favorite DVDs, and an incredible addition to any DVD collection.
