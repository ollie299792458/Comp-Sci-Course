Like many others who saw this movie on the first available showing, I was dismayed by this film. All films adapted from books make changes and this is especially true in the Harry Potter series where so many characters exist and the story is both a coming of age teen book and a minor fantasy epic. The problem with the Half Blood Prince is that it does neither well as a film. They added utterly nonsense scenes like the destruction of the Weasley home while doing away with so much of Harry's interactions with his peers like Luna, Neville and even Ginny. Additionally, the way they filmed the movie it makes an incredibly poor showing on home video as it is very dark, not just in setting and tone but the picture as well. Playing it on my smaller television left me utterly incapable of even seeing the picture at times, something that does not happen with any other movie in my collection. All in all, while Half Blood Prince was one of my favorite of the books it is easily the worst of the series and should really only be purchased if you are, like me, the sort of person who has to have the entire collection.
