I remember watch the first episode of Dawsons creek many years ago feeling like a new vision from the Rob Reiner's classic Stand By Me. It was the ultimate show for theyoung people, good actors, wonderfull stories, beautifull places unforgetable moments.

Now it comes the worst thing that coul ever happend: season 6

Everything in this season is wrong(except the very last episode from Kevin Williams) the characters change boyfriends and girlfriends like coins in a store, Busy Phillips it's just another annoying actress trying to show talent who doesn't have in a character who never fits in the show like Andie (Meredith Monroe a lost jewel).

I try many times to watch this season but it was unbearable. Even the first version of the last episode had so many mistakes (including the brainless idea of the granma's boyfriend, the last minute solution to show who much the character change instead to use another deep theme).

The only good thing of this season you can buy it separately in the last episode written and directed by Kevin Williams, it's not perfect but fits better than the rest of the season.
