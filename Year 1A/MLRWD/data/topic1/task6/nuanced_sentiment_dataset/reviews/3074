The thing that plagues "Part 2" is that it's nothing more than an exact remake, featuring a brand new cast and a different killer.  While I found the original a bit more entertaining, generally, if you liked the first, you'll like this.  They're generally the same films.  I was just as scared watching this as I was watching the original when I was a kid.  The gruesome deaths and make-up are well done, and the style of the murders are as fun as they were first time around.  The side dialogue taking place between the counselors as they wait to get killed is entertaining at best, and once again, it works well with a crowd.  The ending is pretty dramatic, as well, regardless of the fact that it's not completely logical.  More deaths, bigger body count--what more could you ask for?  Were you expecting "The Godfather Part II"?
The plot is simple, which works with this type of film, as camp counselors gather to open camp around the same area the first film took place, "Camp Blood".  The aforementioned Crystal Lake has been deemed off-limits, but that doesn't stop foolish counselors from exploring the territory.
It's no "Star Wars", but a classic in its own right.  Not the best of sequels, but a decent outing.
