Why is it that Hollywood cannot make a good movie?  This movie follows a pattern that seems to plaque Hollywood--some great jokes and funny scenes in the first half and then a rapid decline into cliche, formula,  and manipulation in the second half.  Every time you see the marginal notes of the script on the screen you are painfully aware of the incompetence of the writers and director.  In case you do not know what I mean concerning marginal notes, watch the scene when Bullock gets in the boat and starts driving at full speed--the notes in the margins of the script will dictate that "at this moment, Margaret takes control of the situation and reverts to her masculine side, compensating for the emotional (feminine) connection she just felt discussing family with Gramma. This scene needs to move the movie forward by making her vulnerable, especially after she falls into the water and faces her worst fear--not being able to swim (which we made sure to have her mention in the earlier scene).  Let's make sure that she is rescued by the male and then comforted by his strong embrace.  We must make the audience connect to her during this scene, otherwise the rest of the hastily constructed movie won't work!!"
I do not understand why Hollywood needs to emphasize these elements so strongly that it interferes with the viewing of the movie.  As long as Hollywood is crafting jokes the comedies work, but they cannot stop themselves from inserting a strong moral into the movie and this is always the movie's Achilles' heel.  Just watch the first half and you can anticipate how it will end.  So many bad scenes/lines in the second half I wanted go watch a Shirley Temple movie for something good.
