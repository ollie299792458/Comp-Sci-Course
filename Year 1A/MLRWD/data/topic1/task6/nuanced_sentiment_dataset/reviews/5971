This movie was worth watching mostly for the scenery along the Camino. It made me want to go there and see it for myself. However, the acting was not that great. The side characters were more compelling than the main characters. Probably the Canadian girl that Martin Sheen's character meets up with was the most convincing actress.

The thing that annoyed me the most was that I have seen this advertised as a "Catholic" movie and that is a misrepresentation. It shows aspects of a culture that was once Catholic, but it does not have a clear Catholic message. The message is more about finding yourself and being open to making new friends, which are not bad messages, but not specifically Catholic messages, either. Also, the main character spreads the cremated ashes of his son all along the Camino as he goes, which is not allowed in the Catholic Church. The Church allows but does not encourage cremation, and if a person is cremated, his ashes are to be buried, just as his body would be. It is absolutely not allowed to scatter them to the four winds. So if you are not clear on Catholic doctrine, don't take this movie as a good example of what Catholics are allowed to do.

Martin Sheen's character is a lapsed Catholic who is trying to feel reconciled to his son. That is his motivation for doing what he does in this movie. There is no clear conversion to the Faith, just a conversion to being a "nice guy". There is what seems like a conversion, but the very end of the movie makes it clear that the Faith is not as important as seeing the world and being open to people who are different from you.
