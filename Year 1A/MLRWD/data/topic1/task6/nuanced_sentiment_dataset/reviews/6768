This is another one I'm very glad I checked out from the library first. It's an okay strength workout, but I've generally found the Firm workouts to be tougher on the upper body stuff. Also, I've heard people talk  about various Firm instructors having bad cuing skills, but this is the first time I've noticed it. She confused me more than once, though I'm sure if I do it again, I'll get it. As far as the actual workout goes, the only real positive for me was the variation in moves for upper body. There were some I haven't done before, and I was definitely feeling it the next day or so. I am always a little annoyed by the continuous smiles on the backup exercisers, and this was no exception. I just don't think it's natural. But the modifier was the very worst I've seen with her head bobbing and pageant queen hand movements. I focused on Allie Del Rio since she's my favorite. All in all, if you're looking for some good upper body strength training to start out with, you'll probably find what you're looking for here. It just isn't for me.
