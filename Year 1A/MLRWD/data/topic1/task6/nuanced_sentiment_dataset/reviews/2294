I didn't have huge expectations for the film in the first place -- and my expectations were wrong. It was even worse than I thought.

In the first 30 minutes, it's very unclear what's even going on. Sure, it has something to do with the military in the UK/Ireland, but it takes some time to understand the plot of teens creating some sort of VR game in an abandoned prison. Things start to get violent, and we start to see a Matrix-esque scenario where folks get "plugged in" to this virtual world. The film jumps back and forth so many times its unclear how certain things are happening -- such as how one character gets serious physical injuries.

The last third of the movie finally has some tense and interesting moments, but there are still are times when you feel just like fast-forwarding. And yet the ending still isn't satisfying. In terms of special effects -- don't expect much more than explosions.

Due to this violence level it might appeal to those who enjoy violent first person shooter games -- and those folks might also understand the plot better than I have. I don't think this ever showed up at a movie theatre -- but it might as well just be shown on some horror network on cable. A waste of 100 minutes for me.
