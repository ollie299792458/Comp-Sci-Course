I have to admit to being totally surprised by the way I felt about this movie.  I expected to HATE it.  A movie about boxing!!  Not my idea of an interesting, or insightful view of apartheid!  Although it is not nearly as good a movie as it is a book this movie more than delivers the goods.  You have a wonderful more than slightly bitter story about this incredible child growing into a caring and concientious young man truly against the odds.  His guides on his path from boyhood to adulthood are beautifully played by Armin Mueller Stahl, Morgan Freeman and Sir John Gielgud, not an unimpressive list.  Stephen Dorff is impressive as the older Peekay and the actors playing the younger versions also help to create a character that is truly warm and appealing.  The music from this movie also remains one of my favourite soundtracks of all time.  It moves between being uplifting and happy to melancholy and powerful.  It is truly a beautiful soundtrack.  All in all I cannot reccommend this movie enough, if I had never watched it I wouldn't have even know of the book and it is now one of my favourites also.  Watch this movie and I truly believe you won't be disappointed.
