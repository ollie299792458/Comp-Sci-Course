This is a REMARKABLE love story.
Forget *Titanic* and *Gone with the Wind*; those overblown and long-winded epics never get down to the real flesh of what love IS. Forget *Romeo and Juliet*; Shakespeare was obviously  out for the bucks in that one and didn't spend a whole of effort in writing  it.
For the three people in the world who haven't seen it yet, I won't  give away the secret. I'll simply say that the love story that unfolds  between our hero and his lover is remarkable and simple, in spite of and  because of the twist that made this a controversial film.
Steven Rea,  Miranda Richardson, and Jaye Davidson all turn out remarkable performances  in this movie. This film has been the highlight of Davidson's career thus  far (let's face it, he was a mediocre Ra in "Stargate"), but it  lacks for nothing regardless.
The success and clarity with which the film  comes to its theme is also stunning. "It's in my nature." How  simple, yet how eloquent! I can think of no better way of describing this  film.
