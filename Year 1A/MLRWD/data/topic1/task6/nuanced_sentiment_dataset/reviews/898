"Spy" is my favorite Bond movie for many reasons, not the least of which being that it's where Roger Moore hit his stride. He was completely comfortable as 007 and he seemed to be totally enjoying himself.  Unlike "Live and Let Die" and "The Man With the Golden Dud", which both seemed very manufactured and somewhat tired, "Spy" is very dynamic and eye popping.  The production is a great example of tempering huge special effects with both a realistic, sexy romance and some cool humor (Jaws rules!).  The movie knows exactly when to switch gears without leaving us confused or bewildered.  
Villan Karl Stromberg is so in love with the sea that he lives in a submersible lair called Atlantis.  He uses his submarine eating supertanker to hijack nuclear subs and use them to start World War III.  All this with the purpose of creating a perfect world beneath the sea.  Kurt Jurgen's is evil, yet reserved in his performance.  It makes for a classy, yet seriously derranged bad guy.  An over the top villain would have overwhelmed the movie.  Barbara Bach's character is a mix of naive feminity and fierce determination.  This makes her an alluring love interest for Bond as well as a strong competitor.

The producers where prevented from using Ian Fleming's original story so they decided to go back to "You Only Live Twice" and improve upon it with huge success. The movie shines - the locations are beautiful, the cinematography is outstanding, the humor works at just the right places, the writing is tight and the production values are top notch.  
Like I said earlier, the movie is goes all out to WOW, but unlike Moonraker, it never gets too big to border on the absurd or desperate.  Its just a fun, larger than life, energetic, casual film that has outstanding "rewatchability".
The score is OK, not the best, but the main title song "Nobody Does It Better", performed by Carly Simon, is the series best.
You'll love it!
