Boys from hell's kitchen get in jail.  Tortured and raped by guards.  Grow up and seek revenge Monte-Christo style.  The plot is good, if a little bit too straightforward.

The most interesting character in the movie by far is Father Bobby (De Niro), a 'cool' priest who is as comfortable beating up an abusive father as preaching.  There's Fat Mancho who gives out street wisdom to kids; Danny Snyder (Dustin Hoffman), the lawyer whose skill consists of muttering to himself.  These characters keep the movie interesting.

The boys themselves, however, have little individuality.  And like all coming-of-age movies (American Graffiti, Stand By Me, October Sky), there has to be oldies playing, and the number of boys has to be exactly 4.  Young Carol is an underdeveloped character whom the director expects the audience to remember later on. The prison guards (Kevin Bacon, Terry Kinney) do what the plot expects them to do, and King Benny provides simple mob flick entertainment.  The grown-up boys developed some characters but, ironically, even with the Monte Christo plot, one cannot help but get the sense that the boys, whose lives would have otherwise been very unextraordinary, were saved by the tragic event.
