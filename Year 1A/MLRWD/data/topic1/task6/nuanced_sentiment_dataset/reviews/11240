This is a very good movie for Disney lovers with children (or real die hards such as myself). Several notes: This is a House of Mouse Christmas Special! If you've never seen the House of Mouse TV show you are likely to feel cheated. Several of the complaints here are that this is just a compilation of old cartoons and some new ones loosely tied together by a weak plot... That's exactly what the House of Mouse show is! So anyone who has seen the show is not going to be disappointed. Second, this isn't Once Upon a Christmas repackaged. None of the three stories from OUaC are even on this program. Last, several people conistantly have issues with Disney previews. True, the previews start but then you can either push main menu or chapter skip, either one of these will get you to the main menu really fast. Sometimes one or the other doesn't work but I've yet to come across a Disney DVD I couldn't skip the previews on. The catch of course being you do have to watch the Disney logo but the previews are so easily skipped I become frustrated with the complaint.
