2.5 stars

This was a rather simple, formulaic film reminiscent of Hollywood in the 80s. However, I was completely surprised that I enjoyed the film, and found myself laughing at several points.

I don't want to come off as being bigoted, but I'm very, very puzzled as to why some cultures immitate, if not emulate, others - especialy when what the imitating culture is doing fits them about as well as a size 2 dress fits a four hundred pound woman. I don't think for one second that Jamie Kennedy believed that "B-Rad" was exactly who he was, even though the film ended with what seemed like acceptance. It was a complete mockery of said imitation, and Kennedy did a good job of demonstrating how poorly he (and thus an entire culture) wore his "behavior" because, simply put, he just looked silly.

That said, we know that B-Rad was K-Fed. And K-Fed is, frankly, the biggest joke on the planet. That did increase the enjoyment considerably.

I wonder if K-Fed knew this character was modeled after him, and that it was mocking him. I doubt it. He's not that smart.
