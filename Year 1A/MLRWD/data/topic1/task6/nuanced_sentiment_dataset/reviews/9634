This is a horrible movie.  Do not watch it.  It is barely possible to understand what is going on.  Every five minutes the story jumps somewhere else without any transition.  Random characters pop in and then go away five minutes later.  The plot is virtually non-existent.  The story was apparently (very badly) adapted from the comics - this pacing may work in comic book format, but not in a movie.

This could have worked if the movie was spread out over a dozen 30-minute episodes.  However, as things stand, this is unwatchable.  People that loved the comic this is based on may like it, but if you like movies you will almost certainly hate this.  This is like somebody stuffed loosely related random scenes on a DVD and sold them as a movie.

The voice acting is not that good either.  Most of the characters sound like they are reading lines from script without any understanding of what is going on.  Almost a monotone in places.  Not that they had much to work with, considering the dialog they were presented with.

The only good thing about this movie is the art.  I liked it, but then again I am not an expert.  Seemed pretty good to me.
