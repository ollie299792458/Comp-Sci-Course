This movie only runs an hour and a half, but the dragging pace of the plot makes it feel like a minor eternity.  The characters aren't unsympathetic, but everything creeps along at such a low-key, glacial rate that by the time the story came to a merciful conclusion, I found it hard to muster much feeling for them one way or another.  The basic concept could have been interesting ("what *would* you say if you met yourself?"), if the story had been constructed so as to keep the viewer's attention, but it just wasn't happening.  There's a bit of tension leading up to the inevitable exposure of the "great deception," and there's a very cool scene with a saw - but that's about the best I can say for it.

Wish there had been more focus on the newly-discovered planet and perhaps getting a trip to "Earth 2" underway during the movie itself, rather than just having it be a background for the rest of the "action" (I use the term loosely), because that might have saved this movie and given it the electricity it needed to really showcase its theme.  I'm not bothered by the questionable realism of having a precisely parallel world existing in the solar system that had never been detected before (though it would have been fun to explore that issue in much more detail) - I am a sci-fi fan, so I can forgive a lot of questionable realism as long as the rest of the story keeps me engaged.  In this case, you will waste an hour and a half of your life on this film, and my advice is to watch something else, or read a good book.
