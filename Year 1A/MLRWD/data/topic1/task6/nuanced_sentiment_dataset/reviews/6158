When a film preaches such drivel, it's a sad sign that so many folks love it. The moral is: if you are nuts with obsessive lust for someone and call it love, your family will get totally behind you, even if you "steal" the woman from your brother. Besides, your brother will go after the hot gal who likes you the day after you kiss his girlfriend and will somehow forge a lasting relationship and attend your wedding to his ex a few months later.

I really wanted to like this film and I appreciate Dane Cook playing someone who is actually kind of nice. I'm embarrassed for Emily Blunt, with what started as a great character and becomes reduced to another script convenience.

Also, it felt like the director did almost everything they could to squelch comedy. Was there a "no comedy allowed" clause? The comedy that made it in was for the most part, mean. Sure, my family makes me sleep in the laundry room and starts the dryer every night as I go to bed with nothing but a steel-toed boot in it.  "This corn is like an angel" was the one funny part. Forget the shower scene.

In summary, this is serious movie for those who think all problems must work out conveniently and in their favor, and with no repercussions. Reminds me of the tripe that is "He's Just Not That Into You". If you liked "Dan", see it right away for more Cinderella reassurance...
