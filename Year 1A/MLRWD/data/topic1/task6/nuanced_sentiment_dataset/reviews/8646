As it may help you to have more fun, if you think that 007 movies are the most unrealistic things you have ever seen, it's only because you never gave Spriggan a chance.
  The plot is an excuse for some of the greatest action scenes ever seen on anime, it revolves around Noah's Ark and a black-ops to prevent it being stolen (note that there's nothing that suggests that the original researchers of the Ark where to put it to good use, anyway).
  While watching it you may see lot's of action, but very few are made by the main character, who is Spriggan number one. Instead, another Spriggan, who doesn't even bother to tell his rank, does so much stuff that at some point you start to wonder on what the main character can actually do being number 1, what would open the path to a sequel so fans could wait for even better action (this movie is a small part of the original manga).
  If you're in for action and don't care for the lack of a plot, Spriggan will be an amazing movie to watch, as it is very well done and has great sound.
