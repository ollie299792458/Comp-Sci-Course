I like others here are truly devoted to the X-files. When this season started out I had a hard time with Robert Patrick, not because I don't like him but he isn't Mulder. The character's attitude was almost too much and too opposite to take in the beginning but he did come around and in fact showed why he was picked for this job and how good the writers were. I liked how the writers move in agent Reyes with Doggett and I agree if they wanted to go maybe a couple or so more years they could have done it even without the Scully character. That doesn't mean Scully wasn't great but in fact that the new actors were holding their own. After Mulder comes back and then you have Mulder, Scully, Reyes, Doggett and of course A.D. Skinner you can really see how good those actors were in this series and how well cast they were. But after watching 8 out of 9 seasons in succession one funny thing that I related to was that the characters were trying to do their jobs amidst of all the political stuff of the FBI, which was not unlike my 12 year careeer in the Navy. Even though I liked all the seasons I particularly like following the alien abduction and or colinization parts, but I also know that without the other "side stories" it may have gotten old fast.
