Was curious about this film since it includes two of my favorite actors, James Franco and Javier Bardem. I didn't read the book prior to seeing the film. Julia Roberts was refreshing; I felt she was at ease in her acting and not trying so hard as I've often seen in her previous films.

If you've ever experienced a failed marriage and have a sense of adventure, in a modern way, you may relate well to this film.

Three men, three countries, one final positive outcome for her. (What a fairytale!)

Julia Roberts plays a soon-to-be-divorced woman fortunate enough to be able to travel long term and to the places she has chosen: Italy, India, and Bali. We see her willingness to explore her inner self, meet new people (mainly the non-threatening kind), and connect the hurt pieces of herself to the world. The best character and acting job goes to Richard Jenkins (Richard from Texas); his sincere portrayal of a man haunted by his actions hit me hard.

We see the guilt for her husband (Billy Crudup), the fling(?) with David (James Franco), and her bond to Philippe (Javier Bardem).

I could relate to all three relationships so I found the film enjoyable.
