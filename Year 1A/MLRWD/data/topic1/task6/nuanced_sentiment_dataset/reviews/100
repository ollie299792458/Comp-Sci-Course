I've always had a fondness for Disney musicals, particularly the old ones, so this DVD seemed like a perfect choice.  Overall, I thought this was a pretty spiffy film, though it seemed patched together in spots.  
The  video portion was very clean, though this digital transfer really lets you  see flaws in the original print. Watch the segments where Donald is  "behind" the Cookie Lady in "Baia," and you'll see the  woman is dancing in front of a projected image.  Most of the time the  animated characters are "layered" on top of the live-action  reels.  I'll grant that given the age of the film, the visuals are fairly  impressive, but with the animation technology available, one would think  Disney would "clean up" some of the imperfections.
That goes  double for sound, which in this release is dead Mono.  Even simulated  stereo would do a better job of reproducing the dynamics of the great music  of this film.  Speaking of which, the music selections (and accompanying  dances) are the highlight of the movie.  I was particularly impressed by  the wonderful "You Belong To My Heart," which segues into a  mildly hypnotic, almost hallucinogenic segment with "animorphic"  images and brilliant colors.
Though there is a plot to all this (Donald's  birthday tour), the story is little more than a South American travelogue  as envisioned by Disney.  That means a lot of American extras playing  Brazilians and Mexicans, though not all.  I think most kids (and some  adults) will appreciate the camaraderie of the three Caballeros, but  Donald's randy behavior is a little off-putting.  Disney left little doubt  that at least one of the 'three gay cabelleros' was perfectly  'straight.'
This film is, of course, a must-own for any collector of  Disney animation, but for others the choice is less certain.  The music and  elaborate dance routines are worth a peek at the very least.
