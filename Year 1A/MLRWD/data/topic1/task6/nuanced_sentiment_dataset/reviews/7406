I remember the 79 version with Carol Kane and Charles Durning and it was horrible.This polished remake is filled with modern technology and suspense that one forgets the cheesey acting.Whats cool is there is no connection between caller and callee.Its amusing to me that the killer is always 6 ft tall and built like a brick s##T house.Anyway our star Camilla Belle{the ballad of Jack and Rose}takes on a baby sitting job as a punishment for using up minutes on the cell phone plus grounded for a month.The couple is wealthy and the house is a castle.She begins receiving phone calls,first pranks then heavy breathing.To fill you in on everything else would be wrecking the movie.Its a good little suspense movie from Simon West{Con-Air} and it what a price for punishment for racking up minutes.Thanks Dad for making me affraid to answer the phones for the rest of my life like,Now I know how vets feel! Thank god its only a movie because in real life normal people would of unplugged the phone or took the kids and ran out the house.
