I wish my children had never seen this movie, but since I made the mistake of trusting Disney and since it reappears on TV frequently, I've used it as an opportunity to talk about the blatant (but politically-correct) racism woven through it.  My point to my children:  racism is wrong, no matter who it's directed at (a point that goes directly against the main theme of the movie).
In this movie, there is one and only one exception to the rule that all Native Americans are good and all English are bad.  John Smith is the exception that proves the rule - other than him, all British are evil (and crude, dirty, greedy, etc.).  The Native Americans aren't all quite perfect but all come around in the end, while the English are clearly rotten to the core, and the world would be a better place if they were all gone.
Get this movie for your children IF you want to teach them to use skin color as a way of predicting good versus evil.  And don't worry, they won't get the wrong, racist lesson that dark skin is bad - they'll get the politically-correct lesson, that people with white skin are bad.
