...and the worst movie I've watched in a long time.

Woody Harrelson is on screen nearly every second, and his considerable talents are wasted. Similarly wasted are serial cameos by an ensemble cast (including Sigourney Weaver, Steve Buscemi, Anne Hache, Ned Beatty, Ice Cube and many others). Each must have been working off some obligation to the studio have themselves associated with this wretched, nearly unwatchable piece of one-dimensional nonsense.

Worse than the waste of all that talent will be the waste of whatever it costs to place this movie in your range of vision (even if its free!), and the following waste of the nearly two hours of your life you won't get back.

How a film incorporating bigamy, police brutality, toe-sucking, serial infidelity, murder, robbery and police corruption could stay soporific from wire to wire is anybody's guess...but it happens in this movie. And you won't know any more about *any* character --including Harrelson's, glowers at the screen with a cigarette burning nearly the entire movie-- at the end than you did at the beginning.

No plot summary is needed, because hardly anything changes. No spoilers are possible, except for this one: when the end rolls around, NOTHING has changed!

You've been warned!
