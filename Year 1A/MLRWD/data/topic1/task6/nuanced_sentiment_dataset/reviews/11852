The teaser on the back of the box proclaims "Jaws in the snow"!  Well, yeah, uh huh, I guess.  Neither my husband nor I thought this movie comparable to Jaws.  It held our interest for the most part through the whole 93 minutes but at the end my husband's comment was "That's it? It's over just like that"? And yep it was over.  Sorry to say I happened to empathize more with the hungry wolves than I could with the three weasels just intent on sneaking in one last ski run.  Though I do not feel they deserved all the hardship they endured they certainly contributed to their unfortunate situation by making a poor decision to insist upon that final, fateful run.  Then, once they were truly in a jam, the bad decisions just kept mounting up. I found some of the conversations and extended silences high above the slope to be asinine and occasionally boring.  Without giving away too much of the plot-line I just can not go into further detail here. Let me just say that some of the actions did not make sense either. I found the ending less satisfying than I would have liked. I have got to say, though, that the feeling of cold - severe cold - was superb.  I shivered right along with the three stranded young people.
