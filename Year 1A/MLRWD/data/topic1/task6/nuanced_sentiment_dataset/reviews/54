Rather than review the acting and overall story of this movie, my review will focus on the BD transfer.  I would give the picture quality three stars.  The picture quality in the first half of the movie is bad.  The outside shots are either too blurry or too soft.  I was especially disappointed in the early scenes where Hillary Swank is exploring the forest.  But this doesn't compare with the evening/low light shots.  This movie has a lot of night time shots and boy does the picture take a nose dive. The picture is filled with a lot of grain and the image is over saturated. A lot of the skin tone from Hillary Swank is lost during night shots. Her skin looks a little on the gray side.  All is not lost.  In the second half of the movie, picture quality really improves.  The day time shots in particular show a lot of detail and depth.

As far as audio is concerned. The audio in the first part of the movie was pretty bad. It was hard to hear conversations. I had to boost up the volume in my receiver a number of times. However, things pick up in the second half and the audio sounds clear. They even make good use of the rear sound channels.

Overall a disappointing transfer.
