The story unfolds in a small, seaside Danish village.  We watch patiently as the minister and his two lovely daughters lead their church and community through enlightenment and devout prayer.  Rather than seeking marriage or fame, the sisters' faith and devotion to God keep them in this picturesque little hamlet well into late age, long after the minister's passing.  At the request of a dear friend, the sisters are urged to take in a Parisian refuge in an effort to save her life during her government's turmoil.  Babette becomes cook and housekeeper for the ladies.
Many years later, Babette learns she's won the Paris lottery and decides to host a feast for the kindly sisters and the community that took her in.  Though slow moving at first, the story gradually picks up momentum, interest and laughs along the way.  The highlight is in the preparation and presentation of the feast itself; to the simple people of the village who have never before experienced such an exotic fare.  Unbeknownst to everyone, Babette was the head chef at one of Paris' foremost restaurants and a personal favorite of Parisian royalty and dignitaries.
A delightful film and a treasure for any international collector.  The characters are realistically wonderful and cast beautifully.  While filled with many charming moments and excellent performances, the entire film is an absolute delight and highly suitable for family viewing.  Although some parents may be hesitant to introduce a foreign language film (with subtitles) to their children, it has been my personal experience that children can embrace the important elements, plot and humor of this film, irrespective of individual reading proficiencies.  This film was purchased at the urging of our children and says a lot for the uniqueness and originality of Babette's Feast.  A true delight for all.
