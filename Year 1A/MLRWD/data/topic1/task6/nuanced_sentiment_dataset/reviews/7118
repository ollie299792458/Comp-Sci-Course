Well, another natural disaster movie begins so very promisingly and ends so disappointingly.  Peter Fonda's role was the best part of the movie ... you can have the rest.

I saw it coming about halfway through the film when Luke Perry's character commented that his own equations were the basis of Peter Fonda's EOTW conclusion.  My heart sank as the rest of the film was dedicated to the search for where he went wrong, turning out to be a plus sign where a minus sign should have been in his original calculations.

The sun stopped spitting fireballs at the Earth, no more cities or forests were laid waste, the bad guy was shot by the woman he'd terrorized, and the rains came and made everything better.  Like, bummer!

I'm still searching for that EOTW via natural disaster movie that really *does* conclude with the end of the world.  Does it exist out there somewhere?  It must.  I'll continue to look ... and no doubt encounter many more disappointments along the way.

This film was, bottom line, a let-down to the genre of natural disaster films.  I could have done without it.
