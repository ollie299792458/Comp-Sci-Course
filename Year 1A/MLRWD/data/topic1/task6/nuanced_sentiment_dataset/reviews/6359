This is a fine satirical horror story for your committed humanist.  Here the world ends with whimper not a bang, but that not unusual.  What makes this unique is that you will look in vain for quiet nobility in this small work.  No Jane Alexander (as in "Testament")  Here everything is debased.  No one believes in heaven anymore, least of all the grieving widower who is the central character.  His best friend has launched a debauched personal survey of human sexual expression.  Spirituality has deteriorated to "Christmas in July" for one family.  Music has evaporated to elevator music and mass "air guitar" concerts.
The movie is about the last 24 hours of our planet viewed from the perspective of  a grieving man in a medium size North American city.  To its credit, it doesn't go down the path of "Armegeddon" and "Deep Impact" and spend its time noisily trying to save the world, but quietly inspecting how modern society might greet an inevitable Doom.  In my review for "Left Behind" I suggested that this is what a Post-Rapture world might look like, shorn of truth, beauty and compassion.  I also think this film's judgement of contemporary society is quite similar to that of Stephen King in "The Storm of the Century."  We are as far from Hollywood's "The War of the Worlds" as Stephen King is from Huston's "The Devil and Daniel Webster."
The stars are for bravery, in showing such a bitter vision to the world.
