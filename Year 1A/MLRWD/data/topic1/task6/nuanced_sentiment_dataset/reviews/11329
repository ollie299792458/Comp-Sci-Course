This movie lacks in cohesion and cinematic poetry compared to the original "Infernal Affairs" movie. The music score for the background effect is unparralled in the original. Although casted w/ remarkable, renowned actors, the Departed characters just didn't mix and match well and "departed" themselves from dramatic flavor that defines and balances the whole movie. For example, Dicaprio (good mole) and Sheen (his boss) just didn't connect throughout the whole movie. The interaction w/ gang members and police force members seemed dry and disattached. See the original and its bonus feature and you'll know what I'm talking about. As in any good guy, bad guy cop movie or mob movie, there's suppose to be a sense of brotherhood and family in the gang/mob and even in a police unit. Isn't a sense of brotherhood and belonging one of the attraction to Gangs? Granted, there's betrayal or a mole, but that's always the case anyway for great drama. And come on, these are Irish mobs we're dealing w/, there's a reason for St. Patrick's (or I'm proud to be Irish) Day. Family, struggle, and the Church are bonded like DNA. The Asian original is similar, Buddhist outlook, family, honor, and brotherhood. Perhaps I'm missing something Scorcese was trying to deliver in his cinematic style. Asians love American flicks, we'll see how this movie does over there, and if they've seen the original, this one just might be deported.
