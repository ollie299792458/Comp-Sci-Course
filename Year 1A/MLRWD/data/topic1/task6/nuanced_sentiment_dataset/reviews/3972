It was a really unique show, that was so well written, acted and produced that it not only survived it's awkward position in the network programming, but it thrived and built up a large, intelligent and dedicated audience.

  It went out on top and with class, and I'm happy to see it back again in this format.

  The cost is pretty steep for the amount of content, however the tremendous cost and negotiation involved with the music licenses (which are shockingly expensive beyond what most people would ever guess) have set the price.  This and future sets will likely carry a hefty price tag, but I'm pretty sure it was this way, or no way at all.

  One thing they did, unfortunately,  to bring the cost down (slightly) was to use double-sided disks which was clearly, from the reviews (and in my own humble opinion), an awful mistake.  I'm already paying big bucks to get my eight episodes, so I would really rather have dropped the extra buck or two for good quality, single sided, nicely labeled disks, and I pray the studio took their lumps on this grave error and ship us a nicer product for the remaining seasons (and some kind of paper insert, even just one loose page for God's sake, would be appreciated).  Keep the goofy box jacket (which was admittedly eye-catching the first time) and use the savings to upgrade the actual product in the box.  5 STARS for the content, 3 STARS (maybe 2.5) for the physical product.
