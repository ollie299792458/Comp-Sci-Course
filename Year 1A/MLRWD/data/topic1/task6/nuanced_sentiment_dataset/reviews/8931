Only an actor of Keitel's incredible talent can take a character that you don't know whether to hate or pity , that has only bad qualities, goes on an endless spree of degenerate gambling, drug use, sexual devient behavior and police corruption and make them 100% believable and engaging. You can really picture LT as a real person who has lived the way he does in the movie for a long time and is finally hitting comlete rock bottom. A truly masterful performance.  Anyone who has known someone whose life is spiraling downward due to addiction can understand the excellent portrayal and the final price LT pays is the unfortunate end that the real world dishes out 95% of the time. This movie doesn't have an incredibly complex plot or meaning but I would somerize the meaning to me as forgiveness for some people can only come after death  because there isn't much forgiveness in the real world for the truly lost soul.  Bad Lieutenant (he is never given a name) is a truly bad person who no matter how hard they try can not change due to weakness and he pays the price for his weakness. Sounds like a lot of real people to me. Buy it if you enjoy great acting.  Keitel rules!!!
