If you're going to see this delightful movie, the first thing you need to do is to shut down your critical faculties.  Don't ask questions about the state of Ewan McGregor's marriage, or the logic of moving thousands of salmon, or the likelihood of a woman hugging an Arab sheikh in a Muslim country, or the ease with which people travel long distances, and so forth.  It doesn't matter because the gentle tone of the movie - even with the satirical edge of Kristin Scott Thomas' extremely obnoxious but funny Assistant to the Prime Minister - just carries you away.  It's sweet, it's charming, it's not cloying and it definitely draws you in to the story.  This is the first movie I've been in a long time where the character of a Scot is a key plot element.  [What was the name of the wonderful one years ago with Peter  Resier (?) and Burt Lancaster as Texans looking for oil off the cost of Scotland?]  Ewan McGregor gets to use his own Scots accent and is just wonderful and appealing in his role.  Emily Blunt is also good, as she rolls with the plot.

If you're in the mood for a lovely, gently comic, romantic movie, this is the one.
