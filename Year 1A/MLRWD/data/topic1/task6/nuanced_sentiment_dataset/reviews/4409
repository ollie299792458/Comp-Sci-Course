I knew going in that this would be another "we need socialized healthcare" type movie but I really like Denzel Washington and James Woods.  Yes it's easy for Hollywood elites earning 8 - 15 million per picture to think that socialized medicine is a great idea.  Luckily these idiots only have to make movies that portray their view in a utopian world where they all wear rose colored glasses.  These bozo's would never have to live with the socialized system but you would so before you go running off and whining to your congressman about Clintonized health care educate yourself on some economics and history.
Denzel puts in another wonderful performance.  He is great at changing emotions and bringing his character out so you can empathize with him.  He is just a great performer.  I have always loved Woods' work and this performance was equally as wonderful to take in.  Duvall plays the same police officer as he did in "Falling Down" but it's a good character.  Ray Liota is fine as the politicized police chief making sure things `turn out okay' as it just happens to be election time etc.
So we get a lot of great performances but it's all washed away in the end.  Instead of the enjoyable ending we get to see all of the holly libs and top democrats getting their free airtime "commercials" on the celluloid much like Steven Segal's shameless tirade at the end of "On Dangerous Ground" where after using half of the northern hemisphere's gasoline making his dumb movie he goes after Evil Big Oil like they're the anti-Christ but they sure made his movie better and the explosions bigger.
The performances in John Q are great but overall it's very unsatisfying.
