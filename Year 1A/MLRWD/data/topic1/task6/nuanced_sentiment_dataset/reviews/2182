Halloween 5 picks up right were 4 left off.  It is a year later, and Jamie is in a children's hospital, now unable to speak (for reasons unknown and confusing.)  Michael awakens again from the mine shaft (didn't someone think to see if he was dead, since this will be his 4th time returning to kill) and immediately starts his senseless killing spree.  We see Rachel die in the first 20 minutes of the film, quite a disappointment.  Michael now wants revenge, and is after anyone that stands in his way (and even people who don't, for no apparent reason.)  He is chasing Jamie again, trying to kill the last of his bloodline.  We return the the Myers house this time, which in no way looks like the original Myers house from the first Halloween.  Dr. Loomis returns again, stopping at no cost to destroy Michael.  We are introduced to a man which all we know about him is that he wears all black.  In no way is he explained.  In the end we are again set up for a sequel, but a very fuzzy ending.  Halloween 5 does not do justice to its predecessors.  A few good points though are the classic Halloween music, and Danielle Harris' portrayal of Jamie.
