This seemed like a really intriguing movie to me, and I was quite looking forward to seeing it. I rented this movie because I am a Jeremy Irons fan, and because it really interested me that he plays two people. Irons was excellent, and most of the time, you forget that it really is just one man playing both of the brothers. But at times, I was a bit confused. The brothers assume each others identity depending on the situation, and sometimes I couldn't tell which brother was which.
The movie started out pretty good, but half way through, I started losing interest. Both of the brothers get involved with drugs, and that kind of brought down the movie. Sometimes it got a little hard to watch. And by the end of the movie, I just wanted it to end, and I was extremely disappointed with how it ended. It got really weird and the subtle intrigue of the movie was lost, and the movie became gory and violent.
So, it was OK to watch once, but I would never want to watch it again, at least, not any time soon. The first half was really good, but then drugs come into the movie, and it starts to get weird and tedious. I can't even recommend this movie to Jeremy Irons fans, because it's so bad, he's not even worth it.
