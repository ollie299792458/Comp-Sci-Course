It seriously ASTONISHES me that anyone would give these woman a "workout" dvd contract to try and help people lose weight. I have not read their books, but based on their performance in this dvd, I WOULD NEVER listen to what these women have to say. The entire workout video was a JOKE. Boot Camp? More like sleep-away camp with all the giggling and complaining. Their girly "too cool" banter during the duration of the video is extremely obnoxious, and its immediately clear upon the beginning of the dvd that they have NO idea what they are doing. Half of the video they are paused and looking to the person behind the camera to see what they are suppose to do next! They have no idea what the proper names of the moves are, and are not doing them properly at all. Half of the time the camera man is zoomed in on the women's faces so you cant even tell what you are suppose to be doing! They do not announce the workout changes, or explain at all what you are suppose to be doing and its extremely hard to follow along. I didnt even break a sweat! In all, this is a PATHETIC excuse for a workout video and a complete waste of money. Im extremely upset that I opened the packaging at all, as I cannot return it now and get a FULL refund. Its so sad that women across the country want to listen to what these flaky, ridiculous women have to say. I would not recommend buying this dvd unless you want to get a good laugh.
