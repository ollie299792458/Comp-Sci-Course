it for me.  It showed too much so that I really couldn't be surprised nor leave me in suspense.  However, I liked the movie.  It's one of those movies that I would watch on a weeknight.

Let me get to the gist of the movie.  In rural Vermont, lives a seemingly happy affluent couple with a college-bound kid.  His wife, having recovered from an automobile accident a year ago discovers things that didn't seem right.  A falling picture, unlocked doors, uncontrollingly barking dog, and a phantom woman appearing in her bathtub.  She first sought help through a psychologist, then a psychic who happens to be her best friend.  After weeks of trying, she looked at a newsclipping of a missing girl and finally realized that her husband was having an affair with the college student who is missing.  Things went downhill after the discovery.  She finds out that her husband was the killer.  A struggle ensured until a badly decomposed body came up from the car and free his wife, while leaving her husband to drown.  It's a case of reaping and sowing.  It's like payback time for deceiving his wife, carry on an affair with a student and killing her afterwards, declaring his wife insane, then finally try to kill her.

His wife finally got her sanity back at the end of the movie.
