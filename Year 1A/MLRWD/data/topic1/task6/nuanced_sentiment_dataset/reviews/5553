This film is just as charming & funny as when I first saw it in 1987. Unquestionably, one of Martin's best, ranking alongside "L.A. Story", "Planes, Trains & Automobiles" and "Parenthood".
Only Martin could weave a whimsical romantic tale of a Seattle fire chief (with a prominent proboscis) who adores the beautiful Roxanne (Darryl Hannah, naturally),who's infatuated with the hunky new fireman (timid but likeable Rick Rossovich)who likes her too---but is terrified of talking to her.
Martin modernizes the Cyrano deBergerac story with wonderful comic touches: A "sword" duel with tennis rackets & ski equipment; Martin contending with a hopelessly inept fire crew; a show-stopping bar scene in which Martin cuts a bullying lout down to size with a "nose joke marathon"; and Martin coaching a bumbling Rossovich on how to romance Hannah. Yet, Martin wisely retains the heart of deBergerac's original themes: Believing in oneself and the delirious intoxication of being in love.
An overlooked comedy---and if you're a Steve Martin fan, then this one's a must!
