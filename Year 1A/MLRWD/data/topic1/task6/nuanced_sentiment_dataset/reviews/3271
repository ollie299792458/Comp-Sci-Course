I swore to God that this movie has got to be the worst movie Ben Stiller has starred in, and I hate all those Ben Stiller movies out recently. God, that guy is a sellout. What's that? Jack Black's in there too? Hey, Mr. Black, why don't you work on another Tenacious D record and stop starring in lame ass movies? Comedy has tended to suck ever since Chris Farley died. Well, you have Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell and David Spade, but Farley was the guy who would have made these movies worth watching.

Anyways, the movie is unoriginal and full of poop humor. Jack Black invents a spray can called "Vapoorize", in which it makes dog poo disappear. Stiller takes no say in his idea, and when Vapoorize makes it big, Jack Black is rich and living the style of a sellout while Ben Stiller is green with envy. Probably the only good part of that movie was when the dead horse was floating on the river. "I don't care who you are, that's funny right there." - Larry The Cable Guy

Otherwise, don't buy this movie, as I already told you about the good part. Stick with your Chris Farley movies and watch a true actor show that Ben Stiller poser off. Long live the legacy of Chris Farley!!
