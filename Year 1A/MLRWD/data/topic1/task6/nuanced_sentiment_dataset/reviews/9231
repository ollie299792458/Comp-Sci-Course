We all have seen this type of story before .... good looking guy who likes coworker but to shy to ask her out. The pretty coworker that is waiting for the shy to ask her out. Add in the best friend who provides comic relief to the story. All the cliches are here what I liked about ATM is that the core of the story could actually happen to someone. Now with that said you do have to suspend disbelief for this film. Here are some examples why - They park roughly about 40ft away from the ATM vestibule in an empty parking lot. The security guard only makes one trip around the parking lot when those guards make their rounds every hour. None of them carry their cell phones with them. The killer doesn't try to open the door at any time. The fact that they're in the ATM vestibule for a long period of time kicking & smashing the cash machine in front of the camera and the police does not show up once. There is three of them and one killer with apparently no gun on him, why not try to attack and take him down or run out in all different directions, at least two will survive. Similiar in nature to the movie Frozen instead of wolves waiting to kill it's a psychopath. But none the less an interesting little thriller with good acting from all three leads. The one thing I didn't quite like or get is that the film never really explains why the killer is doing this or any type of background on him. By the ending shown I understand he seems to be plotting & doing this to people at several ATM places. So it must be a game to him or a thrill kill type of thing? I will say the movie does make you consider always carrying cash on you!
