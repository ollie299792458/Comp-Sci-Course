One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is unforgettable. Filled with great acting, a gripping storyline, and a terrific message, this is one movie that you will remember. It is nothing like the average, worthless flicks currently in theaters. It's about hope, overcoming difficult situations, and conformity.

Randall P. MacMurphy recently gets sent to spend time in a strict mental institution after commiting assualt, among other crimes. To see if there really is a problem with his mind, the nurses observe him for a period of days. But as soon as Mac arrives, things change at the quiet hospital. He befriends the other patients, and teaches them many valuable lessons -- like how to fish, or how to really set off Nurse Ratched -- probably the most evil of characters in movie history.

The emotional conclusion is not one of dissapointment, no matter how sad it gets. You'll see why this deserves such recognition as a great work of art.

Great peformances and overall talent really make One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest worth watching over and over. This has to be Jack Nicholson's best. Amazing writing and character development progress better deeper into the plot. You really care for the characters unlike anything else. I wish more films like this were made.

And don't forget about the extras. There's lots to fulfill your needs with details about this masterpiece.
