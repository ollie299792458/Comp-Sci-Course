I've seen a number of reviews of this movie, ranging from 'horrific' to 'outstanding' and I must say, I'm somewhat disappointed in the way some people are going about viewing the film. Don't be fooled by those who claim the movie 'sucks' just because it lacks today's special effects and gore. The Vanishing has potential for people of all ages. I, myself, am a mere senior in high school and was thoroughly horrified by the ending. It's true that today's society has been jaded by what is shown in the movies, on television - Heck, even in the news. Everywhere we look, it seems to be just more blood and gore. The wonderful thing about this movie is that it has the ability to reach through your heart, to your spine and just start twisting it about like a dog with a chew toy. It's true, there are no bloody decapitations or gut wrenching gore - but that's not what the movie was about. The movie was able to show an audience the ability of obsession to drive the very essence of your being to the point of no return (This could be said for either Rex or Raymond). We mustn't look at the movie from today's standards of what would be classified as 'horror'. We must open ourselves up to the horrifying truths of the conscious and the unconscious and allow the plot to drive us further towards the edge of our seats until the very last minute. Tell me, friends, would you consider yourselves obsessive over anything at all? If so, take a look at this movie. Let it capture your attention... let it move you... let it help you see yourselves in a way never before possible. THAT's what The Vanishing is all about.
