HOW can Polanski justify making this movie!  was it all to push kiddie porn?!! for underaged sex!!!  I mean geez, everybody who watched this whole movie from beginning to end, deserves KUDOs cuz I couldn't do it, even if it's free!!!  STay true to the author and history of the milking cows by DURBEY-FIELD and ALEC.  And no justice to the best part in the WHOLE BOOK-- that one spot in the ceiling getting bigger and bigger as he continues to talk to Tess, then soon drips blood. OH! The best!!!  The movie pandered too much for what the director and producers wanted to push for their own selfish ends by making this movie, and therefore, their true intent comes straight through, doing no justice to the key elements in the book, the cows eating GARLIC, and her always milking a bit profane with her puckered lips on the cow, and giving people the spooks, definitely off the mark in this movie.  It needs a major remake by someone who understands the historic value of the classicism of this novel, played by actors who also understand Alec and the priests who followed Tess around at all times, including ANGEL, and her final exit through STONE-HEDGE.  If everyone understood the key elements, I wouldn't say it's ROTTEN.
