One of the great things are the recommendations that come my way.  
"My Favorite Broadway, The Leading Ladies: Live At Carnegie Hall" was originally produced in conjunction with the excellent "Great Peformances" PBS series.  I think I've seen this concert telecasted twice on our state educational network, usually shown as part of the periodic fund raising.  
I viewed this DVD on a new 32" Sony Wega with a modest home theatre system -- great spectacle and sound reproduction -- thus I'm a pretty excited puppy dog. 
I'm a Julie Andrews fan and wish she could have sung a couple of songs for this concert, but it was good to see her and I enjoyed her introductions.  
I have several favorite performances, especially Karen Ziemba and the Rockettes, "I Wanna Be a Rockette."  Karen is also marvelous with Bebe Neuwirth in a number from "Chicago."
If you love musicials, live theatre and great performances, don't miss this special concert -- live at Carnegie Hall.
