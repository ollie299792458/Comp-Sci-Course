While it might appear to some that this is just another college frat movie that has a lot of drinking and women (and drinking women) because that's what college guys like and will pay to watch, it's just not that simple. It's like calling South Park just another funny cartoon, or Team America just being a comic version of Thunderbirds.

They don't insult the intelligent viewer's intelligence. The gratuitous elements are clearly just that because they don't try to hide them with some lame excuses - it's all blatantly obvious, the [...], the excessive drinking, the making fun of Germans, etc. Many "standard" jokes are turned around, then enhanced to take it to a level that rivals the South Park crew's. The bad taste jokes are in such bad taste that there's nothing left to doubt that it's for plain fun but in a rather unspeakable way that makes you think twice before you think about talking about it around the water cooler from fear that an HR rep will overhear you.

It's razor sharp in its delivery, and it's as much a parody of regular frat flicks as it is one itself.

So if you think that this is just another Porky's, Old School, Van Wilder or the like, and ready to pass it up because you think you've seen it all before, well, think again.
