I've never seen anyone as comfortable with a guitar as Stevie Ray. The music was channeled through his heart, unlike someone such as Eric Clapton who first filters it through his mind, and is much more about technique. Stevie Ray truly felt it in his soul.

His studio recordings were fine. It was in live performance that his true gift was revealed, though.

If Montreux '85 doesn't make a believer out of you, nothing will. You don't even have to like his music to appreciate his talent. I don't like all of his songs, but I certainly recognize the skill in them. His pairing with Johnny Copeland on second guitar on their three song set is brilliant.

Stevie Ray Vaughan was only about 30 years old in 1985, so he still displayed alot of youthful energy and showmanship on stage.

Imagine what he would have been as a more mature elder statesman had he lived. Had he become centered, like Eric Clapton has in his own life, Stevie Ray would have been more than just a cash cow for the record industry. He would have been something otherworldly.

In the blink of an eye, he was gone though.
