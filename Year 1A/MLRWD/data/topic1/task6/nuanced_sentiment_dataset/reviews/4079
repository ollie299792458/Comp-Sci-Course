This movie is of the new age of psycho supernatural dead folks haunting you thriller genre starring Demi Moore. And I think the only reason I even rented it was to see Demi Moore on the screen again. Not since The Seventh Sign and Ghost have I seen Demi in a horror, supernatural movie. This movie was on the Sixth Sense, The Eye, and Ring, coat tails. Demi was of course good and her acting flawless, but the movie lack something. It lacked a real plot. I mean all the elements were there, son dies, woman leaves town, goes to remote island, and strange things happen. But there were three to four stories all going at once. It shouldn't have been a movie but a book, with all the plot twists and storylines. Now it had an original twist in the ending, but why did the plot twist like it did and why were the characters developed as such. These are questions I have to ask the writers. I mean you really had to use your noggin to put a reason to the madness, but you could not figure it all out from any clues or anything else. You cannot come in on the middle and understand what is going on or even answer the phone, for you got to see it from the beginning to the end. Rent it at your own expense.
