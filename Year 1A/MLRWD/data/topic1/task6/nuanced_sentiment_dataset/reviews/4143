The acting in this movie is very good, particularly Susan Sarandon as the just barely holding it together mother, and excepting Ryan Phillippe, who plays Igby's Republican brother as an emotionally dead automaton, but without the quiet emotional resonance that Kieran Culkin manages to suggest for his character.
  However, this seems to be a case where the writer should not also have been the director, because while the script had some good moments, it was not nearly as clever as it thought it was, but an innovative director might have made something of it. Instead, Burr takes cliches and stereotypes, and instead of playing with them, as you think at first he will, he seems to be entirely serious about them. For instance, are we really supposed to take seriously a romantic relationship between a 16ish boy and a college woman? (Particulary silly is the sex sceene, precipitated by the boy being beat up and the woman wiping the blood from his face. To make it worse, Burr makes the--thankfully brief--sex scene begin with a long, long sweep across the floor, pausing on each bit of the the discarded clothing. This camera sweep distracted me so much from the mood of the movie that I found myself consciously hoping that this was some sort of parody, that the end of the camera sweep would not find the two in bed, but of course it does.)
  The movie comes across as the fantasy of a teenage boy who thinks he is more interesting and important than he is, which would be fine if the movie were commenting on that fantasy in some interesting way, but instead Burr seems to be participating in it.
