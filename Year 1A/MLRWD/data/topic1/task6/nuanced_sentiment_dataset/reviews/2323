I don't review many movies, and will leave the synopsis to the people who have already reviewed and done a great job at it. I will however, say that  I was so impressed by this movie. Its messages are potentially life changing. I loved Jeff, appreciated his mom's (Susan Sarandon) frustration with him being 30 with no seeming direction in his life. Her husband had passed away some years ago and she is now ready for companionship. Her openness and innocence in her search was poignant and beautiful (plus she is one of my favorite actresses of all time!). The end result of her search was surprising, but somehow so right. My own husband was quite ill at the time I saw this movie, and has subsequently passed away. I related to her lonliness and need for companionship and have thought about and recommended this movie to several people. I have had lively conversations with them about the different messages that are sprinkled throughout the movie. I love, love, LOVED the ending. I was overjoyed to see Jeff fulfilled in his search for his own 'signs'. I even loved the obnoxious brother and his finally seeing the 'light'. Jeff kept giving him really good advice, which was largely ignored because he was so focused on Jeff being just a lazy stoner, and wasn't paying attention to anything but his own selfish motivations. It was fun to see that in the end he realized that Jeff had been right. He wound up with a new found respect for his brother, which was so good to see. I think the filming could have been a little better, but I was so happy with all the stories going on in the movie that I hardly noticed that it wasn't super pro. I recommend this movie, for the fun factor and especially for the messages. Pay attention!
