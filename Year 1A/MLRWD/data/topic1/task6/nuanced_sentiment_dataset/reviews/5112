Bryce Courtenay must have not been paying attention when he sold the movie rights to his awsome book by the same name.  The Power of One is about the flame of independence that burns in each of us that must never be allowed to go out.  In the book, it has been bastardized to mean the power that many people have if they are united in purpose.
Don't get me wrong; the movie is still pretty good, with amazing acting, a compelling story, vivid African landscape, and of course Hans Zimmer's music.  The first time I saw it, I would have rated it five stars...right up until I read the book.  The movie simply can't hold a candle to the book.  Half of the movie is constructed around literally one paragraph of the book.  It creates characters (including the love interest) out of thin air, while leaving out characters that made Peekay into who he was.
Another reviewer wrote that Peekay was colorblind.  Far from it.  Peekay knew and understood prejudice from his earliest days, but also understood that prejudice was not limited to color.  Zulu looked down on Shangaan; Afrikaner hated English.  The overwhelming theme is not racism so much as tribalism.  Were they Afrikaners, English, Zulu, etc., or were they South Africans?  In the book, Peekay constantly has to balance who he is as an individual with who he is in relationship to society.  He MUST maintain his own flame, yet he must also live in society.  A far better concept than movie.  After all, the perpetrators of apartheid had just as much "Power of One" as the heroes of the movie.  So watch the movie, then read the book, and if you're like my wife who was afraid of the book because of the way the movie ends, don't worry; the movie never happens in the book.
