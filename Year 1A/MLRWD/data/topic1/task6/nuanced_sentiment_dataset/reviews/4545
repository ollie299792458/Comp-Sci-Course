My copy of A Hard Day's Night came this morning.  I was very disappointed in the sound.  I didn't know why; but a friend of mine from the great state of Georgia, David Powell who knows his stuff sent me information that made me realize why I was not so happy with it.
"The new DVD re-release of A Hard Day's Night seems to be a controversial subject of debate on many internet forums. Let me see if I can get this right -- The movie was originally in mono. For the new DVD they've gone back to the stereo mixes of the songs to create a 5.1 surround mix. The movie's dialogue, however, is still mono, so it switches to stereo only during the featured songs. The trouble is that the DVD's 5.1 stereo mix sounds worse than the original 2 channel stereo versions of the songs. Rather than spacious, the music has evidently been compressed for this digital version. There is some talk also that certain songs, such as "Can't Buy Me Love", are actually just re-processed mono rather than true stereo. 
If all this sounds confusing -- it really is, the new DVD apparently uses the wrong aspect ratio for the picture!"
