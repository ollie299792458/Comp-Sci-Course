AS A LONG TIME FAN OF FRANK ZAPPA, I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THIS DVD ON THE SHELF AT MY LOCAL DVD SHOP. SO I BOUGHT IT AND TOOK IT FOR A TEST DRIVE.I GOT THRU THE FIST DISC (VERY LONG) AND WAS OVERWHELMED AT THE INCREDIBLE MUSIC THIS GROUP OF MUSICIANS PUT DOWN.IT WAS AS CLOSE TO THE OLD STUFF AS YOU WILL EVER SEE.TOWARDS THE END OF THE FIRST DISC THEY BROUGHT OUT A GUY NAMED TERRY BOZZIO FOR A COUPLE SONGS.THATS WHEN I STARTED LOSING INTEREST.JUST BECAUSE HE PLAYED WITH FRANK IN THE EARLY DAYS HE JUST DIDN'T FIT IN ON THIS DVD.
THE SECOND DISC STARTS OFF WITH HIM DOING "BLACK PAGE" A CHALLENGE TO ANY MUSICIANS TO DUPLICATE.THATS WHEN I STARTED TO DRIFT INTO OBLIVION
WITH SENSORY OVERLOAD.AFTER ABOUT ANOTHER 10 MINUTES I'D HAD ENOUGH AND STOPPED.I'M SURE THE REST OF THE DVD IS OF STELLAR QUALITY BUT I PROBLEY WON'T REVISIT IT.
ANOTHER ITEM THAT HAS ALWAYS BOTHERED ME WITH CONCERT DVD'S IS THE BLENDING OF 2 OR MORE SHOWS TO CREATE 1 GREAT SHOW.WHO CARES ABOUT AN OCCASIONAL BAD SONG OR NOTE. I THINK IT ADDS ENHANCEMENT TO THE WHOLE SHOW. AFTER ALL,  HOW MANY PERFECT CONCERTS HAVE YOU SEEN? AT THE END OF THE FIRST DISC DWEEZIL CHANGES CLOTHES AND THEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND DISC HE CHANGES BACK AGAIN. NOTHING IS MENTIONED IN THE LINER NOTES ABOUT THIS CONCERT BEING 2 DIFFERENT SHOWS.
OVERALL I WOULD SAY THAT THIS DVD IS VERY GOOD BUT UNLESS YOU'RE A HARD HARD CORE ZAPPA FAN YOU'LL PROBLEY WATCH THIS DVD ONCE AND PUT IT AWAY.I GIVE DWEEZIL HIGH CREDIT FOR UNDERTAKING THIS PROJECT IN TRIBUTE TO HIS FATHERS MUSIC. I DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE COULD HAVE PULLED THIS OFF THE WAY HE DID......
