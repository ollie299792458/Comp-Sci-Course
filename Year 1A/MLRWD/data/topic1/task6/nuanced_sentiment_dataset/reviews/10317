Chinatown doesn't only hold up because of the excellent story.  Because of the excellent DVD quality it's really hard to identify the time it has been made. Off course we know it's from the seventies because it's daring, weird and highly original and accompanied by one of the best soundtracks ever written (Jerry Goldsmith). Not daring &amp; weird in a far fetched Polanski kind of way, but really believable and disturbing.It's one of the top 5 masterpieces ever made.The film also has a couple of kneeslapping 'unneeded' hilarity, for instance the scene where Jack Nicholson inspects one of the waterpipes with a couple of policemen, (we are now 1 h 39m 30 s into the film) when suddenly one of the cops makes a loud hickuppy kind of sound. They look at him and do not react. It's so sweet! I rented this copy but i'm going out tomorrow to buy it. The interview with Polanski &amp; writers is far to short, but it's there, so that's good. The 5.1 surround sound is adding to the mood brilliantly. Wow!
