I'd only had an inkling of the massive production quagmire that this movie went through [..], but when I finally saw the movie on DVD I was astonished that it wasn't promoted properly.  "Fanboys" barely cracked the 500,000 dollar mark, and it could have easily made a few million.

Now, it's not a great film, but it's a very enjoyable movie.  Granted, I had no expectations, but I was still very pleasantly surprised at how funny it was and how much I liked the characters.  As others have mentioned, it's not a deep meditation on the meaning of geekdom like "High Fidelity" or "Galaxy Quest", but it's lots of fun.

It does have a very slapdash quality to it, but what road movie doesn't?  I enjoyed the whole entire movie, but the closing line doubled my appreciation.  If you're a fan of the original films, but not of the new ones, you'll have fun.  Some beers wouldn't hurt!

Oh!  Even though the film will likely never have a soundtrack, if you're wondering what that really smooth neo-soul song is that's playing when Windows goes to the coffee shop to meet his online sweet thang, here's the link to purchase it:

If you like your R&B low and slow and sex-ay, you won't be disappointed with this purchase!  I wasn't!
