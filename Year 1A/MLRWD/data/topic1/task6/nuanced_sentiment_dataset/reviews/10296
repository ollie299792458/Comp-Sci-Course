As an historical documentary this film suberbly recreates the atmosphere of a mid-19th Century British Cavalry regiment at home in the UK (only in the last third of the film does the scene shift to the Crimea).  As a movie, however, it fails to engage the casual viewer, who will undoubtedly prefer the ahistorical 1937 US version, for the simple reason that the latter tells a story while the former tries to give a history lesson.  There is little here to stimulate the emotions and interest of non-historians; even the few action sequences, staged in a very accurate manner and with great attention to detail, are murky and uncompelling.  
For the historical buff, the film does have spot-on characterizations of Lord Cardigan and Lord Raglan, and it does an admirable job of actually depicting what the Battle of Alma looked like.  But the animated 19th Century political cartoons, a good idea in theory, actually disrupt the gritty realism of the rest of the movie, and give an anachronistic Monty Python overtone to the whole film.  It makes you wonder if perhaps these sequences were added in post-production, in an attempt to give some unifying clarity to the string of disjointed episodes that mark the real-life scenes of the movie.  
The DVD edition of this film is "bare-bones"; the case contains only the disc, no printed material, and there are no special features worth mentioning.
