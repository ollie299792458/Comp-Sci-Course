The film is marvelous, but it's been dissected to death; consequently, I can't add any comment you haven't already heard. Lovely Technicolor cinematography of the outdoor frontier, rich period costuming, art direction, and a top-notch score of songs, including "The Deadwood Stage," "I Can Do Without You," "Windy City," "The Subject of Harry," and "Secret Love." Two special moments for me are Howard Keel singing "Higher Than A Hawk" to the oil portrait of Allyn McLerie, and "A Woman's Touch," which shows McLerie and Doris Day become sisters in solidarity. They clean the house (in fact, renovate it) while discovering Calamity's femininity at the same time. At the end of the scene, our heroine is in a dress and quite the looker. There's no shocking sexist message here; it's a musical showing how a woman 'gets her man.' I don't think in 1953 you could've asked for more. On the other hand, most of Day's scenes with Keel are a locked-horns battle of the sexes- no question. They compliment each other beautifully, right up to their near-romantic duet of "The Black Hills of Dakota." Enjoy the film again, and look between the lines- some of it is quite timeless.
