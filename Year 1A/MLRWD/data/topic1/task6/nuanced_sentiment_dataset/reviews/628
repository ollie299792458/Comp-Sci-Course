This is a complete waste of a great cast. I'm midway through the film and all I can think is that Stone's liberal politics (the belief that failure is what to strive for and losers should be emulated and rewarded) has been made into the worst football film ever. Filled with caricatures and stereo-types, class warfare and ridiculous plotline (or lack thereof) all for the purpose of saying has-beens and failures is what lifes all about. It's all summed up with Pacino's assinine "my life sucks" speech right before the playoff game... seriously, Ollie, stick to movies about hollywood and music.

I thought it couldn't get worse, until the 'money grubbing, non-team player', after actually getting the team to the playoffs in the first place, isn't allow to start. Then when the has-been folds mid-game and he's allowed back on the field, Oh! What a surprise! He's learned the errors of his ways (and it only took 2 quarters of the final game) and he's now a team player... and guess what, all is forgiven and his team mates love him. What a load of crap.

Finally, Cameron Diaz, after being busted DURING the final game for attempting to move to a more profitable location, sees the error of her evil capitalist ways in the closing credits and gives a speech that is so contrived and inpausable that all it accomplishes is making me want to throw up.

I only wish I'd bought it for the $0.01 it's going for now, so I'd feel better when I throw it in the trash.
