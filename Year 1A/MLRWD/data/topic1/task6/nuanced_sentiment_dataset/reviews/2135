I ran out and bought a copy of this movie the day it was released. If you haven't done so yet, please don't bother. I honestly thought that this movie would scare me or at least give me that uneasy feeling that you sometimes get until the sun comes up in the morning. I couldn't have been more wrong. Except for the tension-filled, opening scene in the little boy's bedroom, which gave me a false impression of the rest of the film, this movie is slow and predictable. In the end, it leaves you at the same time wanting more and wishing you hadn't wasted the 89 minutes that you did already. The ending of the film is the worst, with nothing but an over-done few minutes of graphics which were neither satisfying or impressive. Not to give anything away, but a 12-year-old aspiring filmmaker could have come up with a more exciting and original plot for this outing. The makers of this film learned nothing from the huge and deserved success of films like "The Blair Witch Project", which taught us that you don't have to see the "bad guy" to be scared out of your mind. In no case could this truth be put to better use than in a film about our oldest childhood fear of what's under the bed or in the closet after the lights go out. If you want a good scare, look elsewhere.
