I'm tired of some fans bashing the Yes West lineup! This is a great video, particularly with the Charlex effects off. The funny thing is, this show doesn't even capture YesWest at their best. I've heard better performances from 1988 and 1994, but 9012Live is still amazing. Yes ROCKS! Like most Yes fans, I like the Yes music of the 70's the best, but... lately I'm nostalgic for the 90125 lineup.  In the 80's and early 90's the band played the songs with fire and energy, just like they did in the 70's. Now Yes plays carefully and slow - great in person but sometimes painful to listen to at home.  Since 1996, the performances I've seen on DVD just seem lackluster and tired, with the exception of House Of Blues, the best modern recording of Yes.  I suspect the reason for this, tho I hate to admit it, is Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman. Rick is great for his personality and sense of humor, but I always prefered Tony Kaye's simple playing and much more enegetic stage performance. Trevor Rabin also seems to have a lot more fun on stage when compared to Steve Howe*. As for Jon and Chris, well, they always seem to have fun! Bottom line - if you want to LISTEN to great live Yes, get a bootleg from the late 70's. But if you want to WATCH great live Yes, get this DVD or House of Blues.

* Retraction after seeing In The Present Tour: Steve has been bursting with energy since Yes reformed in 2008, and must be considered THE Yes guitarist!
