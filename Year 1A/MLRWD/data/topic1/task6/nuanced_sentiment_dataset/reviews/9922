I was so disappointed in Kevin Costner for starring in such an unrealistic, ridiculous movie as this was.  The only reason I watched the movie was because he was in it.

In the movie he is a divorced writer dad who takes his teenage daughter and young son to a small town in the middle of nowhere in South Carolina to live in a huge house in the woods where there are no nearby neighbors.  Right off we know something is wrong with the place when the girl goes to see her room and follows muddy footprints up to her room that lead to an open window.  Now, wouldn't you expect the girl to tell her dad about the footprints, especially since she is all huffy about moving there in the first place?

Later the girl discovers a mound on the property that later they are told is an ancient burial ground.  The girl keeps hanging out at the mound and coming back home covered in mud which seemed very odd to me, but not as much to her dad who is afraid to stand up to his moody daughter.  When he notices a horrible rash on her neck and finds her vomiting, does he take her to the doctor?  No.

The whole movie was very unrealistic, especially anything involving the mysterious mound.  I'm trying not to give anything away just in case you don't take my advice to skip this one.
