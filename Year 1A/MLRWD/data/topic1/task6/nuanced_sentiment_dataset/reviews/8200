Creme brulee, Nebraska steak, a good Merlot, a Guinness stout. All wonderful but put them together in a bowl and you get a mess. That's how this movie played out to me. Story components ("Tribal" warfare, Tammany, draft riots) with a lot of potential but which, as told, made no sense together.
Then there were foreshadowings that didn't, stock scenes, and undeveloped plot facets -- Conspiratorial meetings between Leo and the Chinese that are never explained. Hate me love me meetings between Leo and Cameron that seemed more worthy of a Sandra Bullock movie. A disgraced Leo's ability to attract Tammany's attention and unite the Irish in under 5 minutes...
It all leads up to an anti-climax that had many in the audience letting out chuckles -- Bill and his ninja attacks on Leo (that's honorable fighting?), McGloin bullrushing 5 soldiers with rifles aimed armed only with a knife?!  Made no sense to me or some of the other folks in the theater
Sorry to all those playing this up as Oscar material but I just don't see it
