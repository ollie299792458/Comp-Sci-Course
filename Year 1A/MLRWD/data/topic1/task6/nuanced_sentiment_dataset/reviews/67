There is something amusing to me when people simply spit out famous actor's names and presume that means you are getting a good movie.  For years, people bemoaned Pacino and De Niro didn't really have a scene to together in 'Heat,' so I suppose this is their remedy.

Ah, this film is a masterpiece.  Two famous actors who have nothing left other than the relative fame of their names do what they do: act like De Niro and Pacino.  For years, people have extolled the virtues of their respective movies but what nobody wants to admit is that Pacino and De Niro have played themselves for years.  They don't really have any particular skill other than playing the same character over and over again.

Both men make the same faces they always make; Pacino requires a barking soliloquy at the end of each movie.  De Niro's mouth turns down at the corners all the time.  The acting is just silly; these are two overblown actors, at least a decade past their primes (likely more), together in a movie in the hope the combination of their respective names would somehow make these utterly unremarkable movie marketable.

You have to buy De Niro as virile enough to have Carla Gugino as a girlfriend and, in order to demonstrate his manliness, they have to show an elderly De Niro in various sexual poses which serve to disgust as opposed to convincing you he's a man of 'action.'  If you survive the gag flex of those utterly unnecessary scenes, you get the reward of two actors acting for a paycheck.  If you must watch this movie, get it from a library.
