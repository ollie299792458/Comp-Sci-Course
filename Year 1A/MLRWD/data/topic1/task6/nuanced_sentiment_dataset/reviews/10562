Oscar-winner Julie Andrews ("Mary Poppins", her first movie) and Shakespearean actor Christopher Plummer ("Somewhere In Time") team up in one of the greatest movie musicals of all time. I won't go over the plot, as it's classic. The acting in this movie is top-notch, especially from Mrs. Andrews and Mr. Plummer. The songs are also classic ("Eidelweiss", "I Have Confidence In Me", the touching "Climb Every Mountain" and the heart-rendering "So Long, Farewell", among others penned by the dynamic duo of Rodgers and Hammerstein ["The King And I", etc.]) This movie won 5 Oscars in 1965, including Best Picture and Best Director. Julie Andrews should have won another Oscar for her unique portrayal of Maria and Christopher Plummer for his excellent portrayal of Captain Von Trapp. No matter how many times I see this classic film, the end almost makes me cry. No matter how many films they keep doing, Julie Andrews will forever be remembered as Mary Poppins and Maria and Christopher Plummer for his role as the Captain. No other actor could've done it better than they did. This is a movie I would definitely recommend for the entire family. Rated G.
