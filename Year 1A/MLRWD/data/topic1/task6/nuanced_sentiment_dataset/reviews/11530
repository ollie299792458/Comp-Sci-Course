Talk about your cinematic debacles!! Man oh man does this film reek of the stench of god-awful quality oblivion, I've seen many films in my day but this movie is the epitome of tremendously pathetic filmmaking if I've ever seen it. Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Eaten Alive, Poltergeist) should have certainty known better when he made this humiliatingly deplorable Sci-Fi Epic to end all others. Personally I've seen Mystery Science Theater 3000 movies that are leagues better than this film in character development, plausibility, musical accompaniment, direction, acting, and about anything thing else that really counts. Gosh, Manos the Hands of Fate was a more entertaining than this disgusting blemish of a film. With a substantial production budget, direction by Tobe Hooper, special effects by genre legend John Dykstra (Star Wars), and the screenplay written by the Sci-Fi legend Dan O'Bannon (Alien), you would at least pray they could have concocted something more substantial than a atrociously dreadful Space Vampire Disaster Epic that has great visual effects, sets in Pinewood Studios (where the Bond films were shot), and stars a stark naked space vampiress (for almost the entire film) played by Mathilda May. What's so troubling is this film blunders every conceivably enjoyable film element into a cataclysmic floundering that I will never ever forget no matter how much I may try.
Though Lifeforce does have a fine DVD presentation, I wouldn't even bother dredging this stinkball from depths of quality purgatory unless you're in the mood for unbelievable torment brought to you in the comfort of your own home. Not even the Pope could pardon this debacle.
P.S. This rates right up there with It's Pat
