Fellini Satyricon is self-indulgent, and made as though everyone on the crew were wasted.

The film can't seem to decide whether it wanted to be filmed in English or in Italian.  Some of the actors are clearly speaking in English, but were dubbed (poorly) into Italian.  It comes across as haphazard and unnecessary.  The acting itself is over-the-top to begin with.

The visuals are excessive as well.  Although it intended to show the excesses of Roman life, it does so in such a blunt, repetitive way that it insults the viewer.  How many times do we need to see animals sliced open and plates full of snouts?  Or people farting or drinking to excess?  Or people grabbing for Gitone?  It lacks the creativity, wit, subtlety and imagination that the original book may have had (which I have not read).

Surrealism is much more creatively handled by films such as Un chien andalou, and sadly, Satyricon is even more confusing than that.  The plot attempts to take on the fragmented remains of the book, but it ultimately leaves the viewer confused.  Supposedly the film is about redemption, but the film has few, if any, redeeming qualities, thanks to Fellini's autocratic and heavy-handed approach.
