I guess misery truly does love company - because, after reading alot of these other reviews, I must admit I'm happy to see I wasn't the only one stuck with a terrible DVD purchase - from Amazon, who I've always trusted and never had a problem with.  I love this movie and always viewed it on tv or my VHS copy, but I wanted to share it with a younger friend who'd never seen it and only had a DVD player.  It was a dang good thing I decided to watch it before I gave it to her for viewing.  The synchronization (dialogue to mouth) was terrible, like a lousy kung-fu movie !  And the  worst part was that the pivotal courtroom scene - the one that earned Cary Grant an Oscar nomination (won't say more than that for spoiler reasons) was MISSING from the DVD.  Gone...pffft - just jumps from the scene where he goes to court to the scene when he comes home.  I was livid and sad at the same time.  Never again.  Folks - take heed from the others here and DO NOT BUY THE DVD.  Buy the VHS copy which I'm certain isn't as bad..at least until the real thing is released.
