I am a market freak.  I am very distrustful of the Bigs--big government (BG), big corporations (BC), and big unions.  I was very opposed to TARP.  I had my doubts about "too big to fail."  It seemed to me to be a bailout of the mistakes of BG and BCs.  HBO's movie is an incredibly good production of the inside story of what happened.  In a sense, I was right and wrong.  BG and BC did screw up royally.  But I now realize that that is irrelevant to a large extent.  Given the situation they found themselves in, did they have to do TARP?  I am at least open now to the possibility that the US and global economies might have melted down if we did not.

The film does not help on the key policy question of how to avoid future crises.  But one cannot help but be sickened by the corruption of BG and BC.  My hostility for BG and BC deepened, but I realize that was a separate question of whether TARP was necessary.  The fact that no one has gone to jail for putting the US in this position is very disappointing.  The film proves that we have no accountability for government officials.  Thus I am pushed further into believing that we need to get government out of the economy and make it clear that government will not bail out corporations.  Predictable, yes.  But as Heller points out in Catch 22, "Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you."

HBO has done a magnificent service to America with this film.  We need to understand its lessons.  We have many crises that we must address in the future and the American people are fed up with the complicity of the Bigs.
