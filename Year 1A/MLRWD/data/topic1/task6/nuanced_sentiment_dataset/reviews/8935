I was about to write a review when I discovered one that said everything I wanted to say, except to note that Erich was a fraudster and convicted embezzler, and reprinted it below.

- Primitive savages (i.e. non-Europeans) weren't intelligent enough to create these monuments, and their own great civilizations for that matter, all on their own. Thus, those outside influences that created these civilizations MUST have been aliens who, coincidently, looked much like Europeans. -

It's not difficult to counter Von Daniken's claims. From a scientific standpoint, he has a theory and twists "evidence" to support it; evidence that would counter his hypotheses is conveniently ignored. In fact, he rarely uses any evidence at all. He merely dismisses the accepted ideas out of hand, and then floats his own ideas as if these constituted evidence itself. When he did try to present physical evidence, as he did with pottery depicting flying saucers, these were proven to be frauds ("Nova" found the potter and Von Daniken had to admit the fraud he perpetrated when confronted). This, boys and girls, ain't science.

I'm torn in rating this book. On the one hand, I found myself laughing a great deal, so in that respect it provided me with a great deal of entertainment. However, it has also contibuted to a lack of scientific understanding of many people today. There are those who accept it without question, and I find this fact scary as hell.

Here, here.
