Marnie, to begin with, is not what you would call a very good film. In fact, it's so bad it's good (how's that for a cliche?). But it wasn't, and still isn't, worthy of a "collector's edition" DVD. However, Universal felt it was neccessary to put this DVD under that category, and, well, you can't do much about this; but when you get a glimpse of this DVD, even if you do love Marnie, you'll be wondering why they called it such. In it you will find a docmuentary, a stills gallery, the theatrical trailer, star and director mini-bios, and scene selection. This sounds more like a normal, slightly advanced DVD than a "collector's edition." This is very poorly packaged, and in fact the only good things about this DVD is the trailer, the documentary, and the movie itself. If you were going to blow ... on it, do so for the movie, which despite its many, glaring flaws is actually pretty good in its own right, and for the excellent documentary, which would seem more diserving for a movie like "Vertigo".
