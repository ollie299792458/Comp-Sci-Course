I bought the dvd version of this elsewhere too, but it is so visually stunning in content that it can only be enhanced by the quality of the technology on which it is presented.

It is basically an action adventure series but being set in current areas of conflict we sometimes get a feel of what that is like for the real people involved in that work, even if the stories presented take the same kind of liberties with reality that a purely fantasy action adventure takes.  We know the hero won't be killed, at least until the last episode for instance, can do amazing things when injured etc, but the reality context nevertheless creates a bit of extra oomph I find.

I loved it as action adventure, and it has stories at several levels.  An episode mission, an overarching series line which was very good, buddy stories within each episode.  Each aspect includes its own tensions and really gripping tension a lot of the time.

Good value entertainment for me with a very good cast.
