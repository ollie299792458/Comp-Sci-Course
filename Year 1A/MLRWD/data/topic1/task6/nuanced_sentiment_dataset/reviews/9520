this is an odd little movie about vampires being the guardians of humanity and they have a murderer in their midst. now its time to find the killer and put an end to his reign of terror once and for all.
set in the 1960's created by primitive science and breeding projects sometime in the early 18th century. At first, these Vampires were hunted by mankind, burned, tortured and killed. However, they eventually became a part of the Church, to create a new religion so to speak, ovampires as God's servants to mankind which I must admit was wierd but definately a cool premise.

The background is a little hazy, which is fine since films like "the breed" pull off about the same quality with less action and do it well. but that doesn't detract from the story, about a female detective in the city of Jamestown (feels a bit weird again and one of the characters says something about a queen? when did america get one of those?) who is investigating a series of Jack the Ripper-style killings with the help of a vampire 'priest', Brother Silas. A very strange but fairly unique vampire film worth a look
the special effects could have been a little better so I took off one star for that and lack of good special features.

3 Stars and I love vampire films but this just is not up to snuff with todays technologies. it has so much promise and even better a unique tale that fell totally short. also the bullets used to kill the vampires are the most innovative idea I've sen yet. (just remember it was filmed entirely in new zealand) loss of another star due to low quality special effects.
