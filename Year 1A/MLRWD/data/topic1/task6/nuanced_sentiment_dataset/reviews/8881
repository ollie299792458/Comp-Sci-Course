This movie is really, really, really bad. Cardboard was never considered in movie history as a viable monster threat, however in this movie everything is cardboard! The one eyed monster (not cardboard) that is slimy and scary that infects humans turning them into slimy one eyed monsters is scary, it will make you want to scream and run in agony! why? Because the movie is filmed in everybody's favorite Red and White film- yes red and white not black and white film, so it is impossible to really see what is going on in the movie(the light on Mars is red). When you compare the acting to the backdrops and cardboard sets, the acting is good, you actually start to get attached to the characters, for example the fat guy with the freeze ray gun that he talks to, the doctor who is amazed that there would be a giant cardboard spider on Mars and a lake of pure ammonia.
  The plot of sending folks to Mars in a rocket ship was a popular theme back then, but this movie could not come up with its own variant, so the writers pulled from the other movies hoping that the moviegoer would not notice. If at all possible get some other movie to watch  -  like something done by High school drama club would be better!
Did I mention the cardboard monstes!
