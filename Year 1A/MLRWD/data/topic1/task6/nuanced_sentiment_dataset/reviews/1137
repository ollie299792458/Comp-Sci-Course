Usually I am not into gangster films.  The annoying trait, many of them possess, are the heroic portrayals of men who engaged in criminal behavior.  Often they are shown as people who had to do it, because they had a hard life.  I disagree.  They had a hard life because they chose a life of crime and all the drama that came with it is their fault.

In this movie, I found none of that.  Danny Greene, in this film, is not glamorized in any way.  The film just tells his story and it was very interesting.  There are alot of ups and downs in his life and it is his fault because he makes bad decisions.

The movie is about one hour and thirty-five minutes not counting the credits at the end.  The film moves by very fast and, because of its quick pace, one does not feel bored watching this film.  Even though the film is not that long, the character of Greene is well-explained.  He sometimes has too much pride and that causes him to get into a lot of unnecessary conflicts.  Ultimately, he pays a price for it.

The setting of the film adds to the flavor.  Everything, from the cars to the homes, looks rundown.  Overall, five stars for the movie.  Very entertaining and fun to watch.
