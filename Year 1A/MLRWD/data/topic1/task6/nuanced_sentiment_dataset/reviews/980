This is undoubtedly the best vampire film in existence.  The characters are cast perfectly and the acting is projected beautifully.  When watching this film you don't view them as being killers.  You will find yourself falling in love with the characters and developing a sense of sympathy and passion for them.  
  The story is amazing and follows through with the novel by Anne Rice.  I tells the story of Louis who is tormented in life from the death of his wife and child.  He is then tormented in his immortal life because his mortal soul never really leaves him.  Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, and Antonio Banderas make up the powerful cast to this film that no other film about vampires will ever live up to.

  I absolutely loved this movie.  I love it even more every time I watch it.  This is by no means a horror film.  It is too beautiful to be included in this genre.  If you have not seen this movie yet you are missing out on one of the best films ever created.  I highly recommend seeing this film.  You will not regret it.
