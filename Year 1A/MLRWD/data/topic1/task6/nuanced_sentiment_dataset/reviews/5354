Dark Water showed great promise. Good actors, intriguing trailers, the credit given to the movie by misunderstood confusion with other Japanese-to-American thrillers. So where did it go wrong? After about the first hour. If you are patient enough to sit through a slow moving plot, the first hour of this story is fine. Tense moments, flashbacks, creepy environments, and anguished characters will keep you busy while you wait for the resolution, which promises to be something worth waiting for.

Then comes the let down. The seemingly deep characters become shallow, plot seems to be wrapped up, but it's not, and (**SPOILER ALERT**) Jennifer Connelly's ex-husband the movie has been trying to paint as a ruthless, adultering, manipulative, arrogant thug, becomes the hero-father-figure.

So why exactly is the water dark? The movie never really explains, but I am guessing it's because regular water wouldn't have fooled people into thinking this movie was anything more than an ordinary plumbing problem. Another guess - because in the dark is the only place the moviemakers could lead you into believing the illogical and desperate plot presented here.
