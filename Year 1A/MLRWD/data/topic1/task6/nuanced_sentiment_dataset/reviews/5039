After years of waiting, its finally available! One of the all time classic shows! I saw this first in a theater in San Diego California back in 1981. I still have the ticket stub as it resembales a concert ticket. Bought the VHS when it became available a year or so later, and literally wore it out. Now FINALLY on dvd!
 Yes, its a bit pricey for the contents in this nice tin box, but what the heck its AC/DC with Bon Scott! Say what you will, but I am nowhere near a fan of Brian Johnson as I am of Bon. AC/DC is, and always will be the best with Mr. Scott.
 Very nice job with the video and audio on this dvd, box contains a handful of stills from the flick, a decent booklet, guitar pic, and card. All housed in an embossed black tin with Angus's classic pose. I would love to have seen more, but I'm not going to complain, waited to long for this to hit the streets.
 I'm in my early 50's and rock just like i did when i was 21 and saw this for the first time! If you are a fan of AC/DC, and classic hard rock, this is a must!!!!
 Enjoy!
PS. forget the dvd extras, all you need here is the flick!
