it is a brave thing to join the armed services to protect and serve our country... I am very thankful to all the men and women who are now serving or have served us in this way... my dad was in the Marine Corps for 30 years, my brother is now retired from the Air Force and one of his sons is currently in the Marines, soon to head off to Afghanistan... being a Christian, the thought of killing another human being is a very sobering thought... eternity is vividly in the picture... so how should a young person who is walking with God in their life, deal with the questions that toss around in your mind??... Sergeant York wrestled with these things... in this movie, the director did an awesome job of showing a very real relationship between the soldier and his God... and I would recommend this film to share with others who may be facing the same questions, either from their past experiences or from the possibilities that lay ahead in the future... this is one of the favorite films of all time of my husband and I... if you haven't seen it yet, you really should see it
