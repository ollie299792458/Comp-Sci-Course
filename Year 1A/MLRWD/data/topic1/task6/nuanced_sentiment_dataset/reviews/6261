This is harsh critism coming from me, Lover of All Disaster Flicks, but this movie just wasn't up to par. It had a smart plotline, a good cast, and witty banter. It had an interesting spin and a new feel to it, and yet it failed. Miserably.
The biggest reason is poor effects choices. The big buck scenes were too pat, and not even remotely within reality. You can smarten up a dumb movie and be successful, but you will never win by dumbing down a smart one.
If you have ever taken a science class at all seriously, or watched a Discovery channel special, you will be sorely disappointed in whomever was the scientific advisor for this film. 
This movie was a huge disappointment, because watching it you could feel how much better the movie could have been if they chose to keep to the facts instead of trying to wow the audience with cheesy CGI horrors that seemed to only target landmarks and leave everything else alone.
Side note: humans can do many things despite pain if they are determined, but if a human being dies when its internal temperature hits around 120 degrees, and you have a fancy-schmancy suit that will protect you up to 4000 degrees, do you really think ANYONE could walk and think in an 8000 degree tunnel while said suit is melting off? I think not. Human willpower is cool, but it doesn't grant god-like powers.
