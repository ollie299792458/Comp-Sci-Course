About the only worthwhile thing about this DVD is the presentation in the widescreen format.  Well, that and the trailer.  After surprising Jaws fans with a Special Edition of Jaws 2, MCA basically dumped the last two series entries out as bare bones discs.  Too bad, I would have loved to hear about the making of this movie (not to mention see Jaws the Revenge restored to its original theatrical version).  A 35 foot great white shark slips inside a newly built aquatic amusement park, where it promptly gives birth.  Her baby is caught and dies while in captivity.  Mother is not pleased.  A monster sized great white shark attacks an amusement park.  Just who thought that this was a good idea?  On the plus side, Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong make for a credible couple in love, the mechancial big shark looks decent (and it growls!), and director Joe Alves strives to make the attacks unique by offering shark's throat views of the gnashing and gulping.  On the downside is the silly premise, the slow pacing (the movie is almost all talk and no attack action, which jettisons all chances for suspense or thrills), and, being a 3-D movie, things are always getting shoved into the camera and this stops the already far too slow moving movie dead when viewed flat.  While Jaws was/is a classic and Jaws 2 just a passable summer movie, Jaws 3 will only appeal to bad movie fans looking to laugh at something not meant to be funny.
