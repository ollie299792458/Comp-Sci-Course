Nothing is like it seems to be. The today media culture offers a lot of human stories in the TV-landscape. 24 hours of destinations, lies and Talkshows. Problem of every kinds of television-projects like soaps, talkshows or Big Brother is that it is reality, but every person plays a roll in this drama. So: what is the next step in the media culture? 
The Truman Show brings us to the next step. Real reality show. An interesting film about this future. Nice to see, but in the end a bit dry. Truman has to die on his way to step outside (t)his world. And the whole world keeps watching. And nobody helps. Thirty years Truman lived in this worls calles Seahaven. Nobody cares about his feelings. Only Sylvia. A good reflector of the modern media world. 90 percent egoism and 10 percent solidarity. Good shown in this movie. An Truman is only one example for this society-mirror. Talent Shows like American Idol brings everyshow. An interesting film about this future. Nice to see, but in the end a bit dry. Truman has to die on his way to step outside (t)his world. And the whole world keeps watching. And nobody helps. Thirty years Truman lived in this worls calles Seahaven. Nobody cares about his feelings. Only Sylvia.

Problem of this film is only the fact, that it is a product of Hollywood too. A classical happy end story that keeps every shock from the viewer away. So it lost its thought provoking character.
