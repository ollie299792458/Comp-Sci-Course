To his credit, English historian and broadcaster Michael Wood does a great job of making several aspects of the Indian history accessible to a wide audience.  Although Wood mainly focuses on India, he also looks at the contribution of what are today's Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, to name a few countries, to the history of India.  Wood gives the 50,000-foot view of for example the Harappan civilization, the Buddha and Buddhism, the Chola Kingdom, the Mughal Empire, the British Raj, and India's struggle for freedom.  Wood spends much time on exploring the life of ordinary Indians.  What viewers glean from watching this series is that most Indians remain close to their cultural, religious roots while being open to change.  However, "The Story of India" DVD box set is ultimately a disappointment.  Whoever is looking for an in-depth documentary about the history of India and its interaction with the outside world will be disappointed.  Those viewers will gain more by reading "India a History" by John Keay, "After Tamerlane the Global History of Empire Since 1405" by John Darwin, and "A Splendid Exchange How Trade Shaped the World" by William Bernstein.
