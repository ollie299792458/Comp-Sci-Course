With lavish sets, tasteful color, hummable tunes, and two well-cast parts (Moody and Wild), this can hardly fail to be a pleasant slice of solid  entertainment. But to the viewer from Ft. Lauderdale and all cinema buffs  out there, I cannot stress enough that maestro David Lean's 1948 filming of  "Oliver Twist" is the one to see! (See my review--and  Amazon's--for the Criterion DVD edition.) For all that "Oliver!"  provides in the above categories, "Oliver Twist" blows out of  sight. Acting, script, music, everything truly represents cinema at it's  utmost brilliant! For you visual connoisseurs, the spellbinding photography  and art direction is the greatest ever crafted (you Welles and Kubrick fans  which is an ordinary series of shots in Reed's "Oliver!", becomes  the most brilliant five minutes in film history in Lean's "Oliver  Twist!" P.P.S. Just to prove that I'm not an easy audience, check out  my review for "Citizen Kane!"
