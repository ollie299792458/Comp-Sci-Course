I am so glad when this dvd along with my other orders came two days ahead of the delivery date.. But when i began watching it i began to be disappointed that the movie subtitles are only in french and spanish when the product description in your site states that it has english, french and spanish subtitles. If i like a movie, i watch it  twice. First with the subtitles on to concentrate on the dialogues ready with my pen and paper to scribble down some intersting movie quotes and twice without the subtitles to concentrate on the actors' acting. This dvd doesn't even have the special features it claims to have  namely: 1. Collectible booklet, 2. Exclusive interview with Dustin Hoffman and 3. Behind the scenes and making- of documentary. It even has a poor audio quality in  such a manner that when characters are talking i have to turn up the volume to hear what is going on in the scenes and when the soundtrack is playing the music of simon and garfunkel, i have to turn decrease the volume because that is when the audio is at its highest. Quite disappointed.
