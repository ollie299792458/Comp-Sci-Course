I am a fan of HK cinema and wuxia films, but this movie made me want to tear my eyeballs out. And ram pencils through my eardrums. The acting, dialogue, and plot of the movie are hideously bad, and I would be tempted to say that any of the positive reviews on here must be astroturfers for the movie studios, except I am open to the notion that some people could actually enjoy this movie. After all, someone has to watch all of those hideous reality TV shows, right?

I'm trying to search for anything positive to say about the movie... even the lauded team-up between Jackie Chan and Jet Li didn't pan out in the movie. There were so many things they could have done, but all the opportunities were wasted, such as when JC and JL were arguing over how to best train the clueless white guy - that could have been a great scene! But it wasn't.

And if the idiot white guy was such a big fan of martial arts movies, why didn't he understand he'd have to go through a tough training montage sequence like everyone else? The guy is a hate-able moron.

The cute Chinese girl utters her dialogue like she's a wooden robot.

And yeah, that about covers it.
