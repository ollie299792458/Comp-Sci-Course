First off, this movie was better than I expected. I really did not care for this director's earlier efforts, BOOGIE NIGHTS and MAGNOLIA. And I can only handle Adam Sandler in small doses. But a friend strongly recommended this, so I broke down and gave it a shot. I actually really enjoyed Sandler's offbeat character, and the story (particularly the love story portion of it) was very interesting, as strange as it was. 
That being said, I have a question for anybody that saw it in the theater. At the end when Sandler confronts Philip Seymour Hoffman in the furniture store, did he passively walk away after confronting him, or did he smash the store up? Now, my friend and I rented it from Blockbuster, and they are notorious for editing their movies (I am not sure how they can get away with this, but another friend bought Taxi Driver from them and it had much of the violence removed, and the Mulholland Drive I purchased from them actually blurred specific areas during a nude scene). In the version of PDL we rented, Sandler confronts Hoffman, and then quietly leaves the store, but my friend insists that in the theater Sandler acted much more violently. If anybody can shed some light on this, I would greatly appreciate it, and I can be reached at Chewms5@hotmail.com. Thank you.
