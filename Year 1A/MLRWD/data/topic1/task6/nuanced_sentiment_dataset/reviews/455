at present i don't know quite what to make of the simpsons.  given the paucity of newer eps and the increasingly erratic nature of the guest 'stars' (everyone from a lapdog to a parasite (read 'socialite')) one could be forgiven for thinking the simpsons is dead.  yet a decent enough movie would suggest all is not yet lost, even if they did draft some of the older writers back for it.  as another reviewer has pointed out this is probably the last of the really good series so we might as well enjoy it while it lasts.
but this is the point where the cracks begin to show.  a change from the occasional joke falling flat to entire subplots (senor ding dong?) and even whole episodes ('30 minutes over tokyo'), seemed somehow that the nature of the humour changed.  and yes, no-one needs to hear 'i will always love you' again.  in any context.  ever.
said that the treehouse of horrors episode is very strong with jerry springer allowing himself to be send up, homer finally getting the haircut he wanted and itchy and scratchy attempting to get their own back on those people who watch to get a thrill on the violence ('hey lise, we're in a cartoon'.  'how humiliating').  elsewhere the hippie ideal appears to be well and truly dead as homer does his best to ruin said hippies livelihood, homer wimps out on the 'opportunity' to become an organ donor and becomes an inventor ('you've got it set on "wh0re"').  there are the usual disturbing. brilliant moments; willie gets shown to be not the man you think he is (and finds a use for vim and brillo pads most of use have never considered before), the caholic church makes a few...'changes'...and watch superintendant's reaction when ralph mispronounces his name.
4.5 stars, round up.  probably the last time too
