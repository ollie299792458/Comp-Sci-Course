Jessica Biel proves she can act.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that this is a mediocre movie.  However, it is still worth your while to rent.

The story takes place in a former mining town.  The mines had shut down years ago.  Now, with no source of employment and income, the town is in the grip of poverty.  Poverty destroys people.  It is the killer of hope.  Jessica Biel plays Mrs. Denning, a nurse.  She tries her best to provide medical care to the community.  She was married to a much-older man, the town doctor, until he passed away some years back.  For quite some time now, children have been disappearing.  No one knows where they end up.  Law enforcement is baffled.  One day, Mrs. Denning returns home from work, just in time to see a mysterious figure in a rain coat abducting her son.

Anyway, I do not want to spoil the plot for you.  Jessica Biel and William B. Davis (Mulder's adversary from the X-Files) head the cast.  The scenes of poverty in the movie can put you into depression.  But if you are in a certain mood, this might be something that might interest you.  Especially if you like surprise endings.  The theme is also thought-provoking and might make you question the wisdom of allowing poor people to have children.
