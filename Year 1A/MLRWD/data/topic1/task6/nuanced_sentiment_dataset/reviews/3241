What drew me into season 1 was Ellen as the innocent pawn who quickly learned and adapted. I started watching season 2 hoping to see her continue to play in the dirt but try to keep clean. That didn't happen and left me without an interesting character to follow so I'm not planning to watch any more of the series.

I think to be interested in Damages you have want to follow a story of power plays taking place in a legal fantasy land. Do not start watching Damages if you are looking for even a semi-realistic portrayal of the legal system. The legal system is just a setting and everyone is corrupt. Or, in the show's words, "nobody can be trusted."

Despite my problems with the story, the acting is top-notch. The combination in my opinion makes for an average TV show. That is to say, Damages is on-par with other legal soap operas available to you to watch.

If you do watch Damages and are having trouble following the story, just quit watching the flash-backs and flash-forwards. They are only there to mislead you.
