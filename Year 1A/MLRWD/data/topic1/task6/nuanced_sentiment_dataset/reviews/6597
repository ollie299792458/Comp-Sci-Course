The statement "if it isn't broke don't fix it" could have been written for this remake. Redoing this movie was a dumb move. If you are going to rescript something, at least make it better not worse, cutting out the aspects of the movie that contributes to the fullness of the picture makes no sense. Other than a few notable actors, the cast wasn't interesting, they didn't generate the charm of the first. The original cast engaged the audience, whomever cast this film did a poor job, the worst being Sebastian, Charles and Anthony Blanche. Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews were very handsome guys who made the movie & their characters charming, interesting and appealing. The classic devilish charm of Nickolas Grace is unmatched in this lame remake. Matthew Goode is a poor selection for Jeremy Irons, he is plain, Jeremy Irons was (and still is) very handsome, Goode's Charles Ryder is weak. The worst of the worst is Ben Whishaw for Sebastian Flyte. Who bungled that one! Anthony Andrews was gorgeous, and possessed a warm appeal. Ben Whishaw is far less attractive, something of a gothic wannabe portraying an outdated stereotypical dud of a character with no style or charm whatsoever. The romance in the original is heartfelt, charms, and keeps you interested. In this version, it's flat, boring uninteresting. Whishaw said he never heard of the first Brideshead nor did he ever see it. Being an actor I find it hard to believe he never heard of it but, it would have served him and the audience well had he (and obviously the writers) watched the original, maybe he (& they) could have drawn something from it to give a better performance (and a better movie). Remakes rarely best the original and I would not recommend this movie, at least I would recommend seeing the original '81 version first, otherwise you might get the impression that the original was as big a waste of time as this remake. .
