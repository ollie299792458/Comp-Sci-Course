After years of using a VHS recording of 'The Hiding Place', I ordered a DVD copy for myself and several others for gifts.  Don't know how the product could be any better, and will keep it in my video library, replacing the VHS copy.  The movie itself well scripts a biographical story that gives an excellent history lesson, as well as opportunity for self analysis of Christian strength and general endurance under greatest of tribulation.  In lieu of reading the book, I showed the film to a group of literature students, most with lower reading levels, and most without much background knowledge of the time period of the setting.  Throughout the showing of the film, we paused the DVD and discussed various topics, including time period background, setting, plot, and some character development.  At the conclusion of the movie, students were asked to respond to one question, giving support to the respective answer:  "Do you think you could have survived in the concentration camp?"
Responses varied, but all were well supported with some detailed information.  Of greatest surprise to me, was one student's response:  "No, I wouldn't have survived the first day.  I don't like being told what to do, and I sure wouldn't have taken anything from those guards.  They would have shot me first thing, and I wouldn't have had to go through what she and her sister did."
Everyone has their own "hiding place", but how many have a hiding place within a hiding place where their faith and trust in God will keep them through all things, in all things.  Highly recommend 'The Hiding Place' as a must see at least every 2-4 years.
