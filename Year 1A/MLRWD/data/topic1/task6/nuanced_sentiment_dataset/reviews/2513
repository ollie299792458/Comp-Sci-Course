I had expected the 50th anniversary edition to be the DEFINITIVE release of Oklahoma, and had looked forward getting the Todd-AO version on DVD.  I should have saved my money.

The Todd-AO version looks absolutely HORRIBLE.  It's very, VERY soft, and perceptibly out-of-focus. What should be incredible detail shown by the Todd-AO lens is gone, and the picture is instead orders of magnitude softer than the CinemaScope version.

If you're buying this for the commentaries or for the CinemaScope version, go ahead, but if you're buying it for the Todd-AO version, please SAVE your money and instead write Fox and get them to re-release this properly remastered.  I would have thought they just sent the THX LaserDisc to the telecine, but even it had better color than the Todd-AO DVD does.

Sadly, even the special Todd-AO shorts are a bit fuzzy, but nowhere near as bad as the film itself.

As an aside, why in the heck would anyone do a documentary comparing CinemaScope and Todd-AO in 4:3, especially on an anamorphic DVD?!?!
