Perhaps one would need to see the whole movie to make this decision.  I couldn't.  I've never had a strong stomach.  I love thrillers, abhor horror.  The difference is that horror relies on splatter, thrillers on playing with your mind.

I thought this movie was more thriller than horror when I rented it.  If it was truly in the vein of Seven, then the movie really wouldn't be overtly graphic.  It would just be outrageously disturbing.  Disturbing is fine.  That's why Seven and Identity are a couple of my more favorite movies.  They are psychologically disturbing without offending your visual sensibilities.  I was hoping Saw would be that way.

I think this is a movie that will appeal to many people.  If you like horror, or if gore doesn't bother you, this movie has a great premise and some decent acting.  (If you rent this movie hoping for some redeaming message, stay away.)

For me, though, the movie was so relentlessly brutal that I just couldn't watch it all.  So, if you're like me and you enjoy movies that play with your mind and not your eyes, stay away from this movie.  If you're the kind of person that likes your mind and eyes being played with, you'll probably enjoy the movie.
