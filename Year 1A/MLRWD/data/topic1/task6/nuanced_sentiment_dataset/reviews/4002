This film is interesting in a family's treatment of a mentally person who really just happens to be famous. It's kind of like all the recent documentaries like Stevie and Capturing the Friedmans in this sense. Kind of makes you squirm kind of makes you watch on (I guess for some). But as an examination of a very talented person who fell on very hard times due to schizophrenia which may be genetic or may be pushed on by acid or shock treatment it left me feeling sad and empty. It shows everyone's view of Roky through their own self-interest. I think most people in this film have little understanding of mental illness. The seemingly sanest younger brother even blows it on his mentor's (and his belief too I'm sure) thoughts that Roky had to go mad because there was so much chaos on in the house so little lack of love. My guess is...probably not... given the mental illness of the mother and the symptoms of roky. Schizophrenia just doesn't manifest itself because there is too little love in the house. If so, many depressed people would become schizophrenics. I'd prefer just to hear Roky sing and watch some performances. I think he'd be happier with that too - with that being his legacy, as opposed this film which forces itself into his private world.
