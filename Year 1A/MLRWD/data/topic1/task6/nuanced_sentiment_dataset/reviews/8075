If you're looking for a great and intelligent action film, this is it! Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood team up to rescue a captured American General before he can tell the Nazis anything about the Allied invasion of Europe. Or so they think?

When I first watched this movie I was totally amazed and dumbfounded by the plot twists, particularly the big one, and had to watch it over several times. This is NOT just another adrenaline soaked action film fueled by four letter words, shallow characters, and mindless explosions. Brian G. Hutton and Alistair MacLean craft a plot so clever and amusing, it will leave you scratching your head long after it is over. Then when you finally do figure it out, you'll smile at its simplicity and brilliancy.

The mood and atmosphere of this movie simply speaks espionage and secrecy. It hails from the days when characters and plot drove the story, not the action. From the captivating score to the incredible scenery, 'Where Eagles Dare' is a classic. Highly recommend it!!!
