This is a thrilling film to take a dip in.  As the protagonist author searches for inspiration in a French Chatuau, the owner's daughter takes a visit and ruins all the peace and calm a writer needs.  Or maybe inspiration doesn't come from peace.  Maybe inspiration is soaked with sexual tension and bloody mystery.  This is a great film to watch if you enjoy a good mystery that has a depth deeper than most people aquire in their life time.  Keep in mind, however, it is not a film for the easy-dulled mind.  A viewer should be open and patient with this movie.  Like a glass of wine, there is a certain aquired taste that this film demands.

Another delicious aspect of Swimming Pool, besides the oozing French eroticism (Ludivine Sagnier is one sexy Femme-Nakita), is the aspect that isn't said in the film.  It's the part that is not addressed in direct dialogue with the characters.  It's he mysterious scar on the French teenager's belly.  It's the reason the writer sees a different girl with the owner and not the girl by the swimming pool.  It's the reason that makes films great.
