Hitchcock has made a handful of masterpieces.  On top of that, he's made quite a few movies that are enjoyable.  Then, he has a few that just annoy me.  But this movie doesn't fall into any of those categories; it's just too bland.

The plot seems like it could work.  You have an American scientist who's on a trip with his fiance.  He behaves mysteriously and tries to get away from her.  She follows him and the two of them end up behind the Iron Curtain in East Germany, where he plans to defect--or so he says.

Paul Newman is the scientist and there are plenty of chances for tension in the movie, but it just never happens for some reason, despite the fact that he's caught in many tight situations.  Newman is a great actor, but he doesn't fit in this role.  Hitchcock's leads are usually have enough charisma to light up the screen, but that doesn't happen here.  Then there is Julie Andrews as his love interest.  She brings absolutely nothing to the table.  Perhaps that's not her fault as her character is pretty one-dimensional.

It's hard to say why this movie seems so flat.  Perhaps it's the stars, but there are certainly problems with the script and even, surprisingly, the direction (too long).
