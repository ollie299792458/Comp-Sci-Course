I gotta admit, after seeing dead ringers and naked lunch I was expecting a very weird disquieting movie.  I won't rehash the plot details, but I really enjoyed the entire movie. Yes, it has a vintage cronenberg "odd" feel to it.  No surprise there.  What was surprising were the moments I actually laughed out loud.  Judging from  the funeral quiet movie theater, this film was probably lost on many who were expecting a romantic comedy or some sort of action flick.  On many levels it provoked a strong reaction.  What more can a jaded movie lover ask for?? This is what I  had expected "legends of the fall" to deliver.... It was original and refreshing after most of the '05  ho-hum rehash.  I felt the movie lets YOU figure out the meaning without spelling it out for you, or tying it all up in a neat bundle. Even the ending came at the "right" point for me...I was snickering at the audience members I imagined were disturbed.  The acting from the entire cast was superb, with kudos going to harris in particular.  Viggo has proven his acting chops to me long ago (starting in boiling point) and his wife in the movie, Maria Bello, did a fine job also.  William Hurt was excellent in a limited role.  Please don't bring any young kids, but I feel this may be the best '05 movie to date.  (To my pleasant surprise!)
