This swashbuckling funfest, written by Graham Chapman (who plays Yellowbeard) and Peter Cook (Lord Lambourne), had been off the shelf for much too long! Both are gone, but we have their humor in this film...
Captain Yellowbeard, betrayed by his right-hand man Moon (played by Peter Boyle) is sentenced to 20 years in prison. Right before he's to be released, Her Majesty Queen Anne furthers his sentence another 20 years and the pirate escapes to find his intellectual son, Dan (Martin Hewitt).  He, Dan, Lord Lambourne, and Professor Gilcrest (you will recognise this actor as having played the ghost Marley in the Allistair Sim version of A Christmas Carol) go on an adventure to find the treasure.
Eric Idle, Cheech and Chong are cast members,  and the late, dear Madeline Kahn as Dan's mother steals the picture! Even David Bowie has a cameo part! This was Marty Feldman's (Igor in Young Frankenstein)last movie. As a matter of fact, he had a massive heart attack while making this, and had he not been on this rural location he might have survived.
Go on! Take a walk on the wild side and see this movie~
