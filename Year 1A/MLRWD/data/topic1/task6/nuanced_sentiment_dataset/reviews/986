I recieved my copy of The Kennedy's over a week ago and finished watching it,and found it to be quite revealing and well acted,even though the actors Greg Kinnear and Berry Pepper didn't look axactly like thier character's. I think Tom Wilkinson did a realistic and outstanding portrayal of father Joesph P. Kennedy who was a manipulative and over bearring head of the Kennedy family who pressured his sons into politics,and raised them to be womanisers,and to get thier way,no matter who they steam rolled over to get it. Yes I think the Producer did his research very well,and it was a very accurate portrayal of Joesph Kennedy,Rose,and John and Robert,but only scratched the surface in telling the story,and would have needed at least another four or five more episodes to have covered more of thier story,including more about the Marilyn Monroe affair and the Cuban missile crisis,and there would have still been more to tell,and explain what really led up to JFK's assassination?
 For those who really enjoyed this mini series and would like to find out more and and like to read. I recommend "Kennedy Must be Killed",A noval by Chuck Helppie,that is well reaserched and covers alot of the same ground,and more in the portrayal of the Kennedy family, and the most likely motives behind the Assassination on Nov.22,1963. A work of Historical fiction,it points out why JFK acquired so many enemies and thier most likely motives for wanting JFK out of the White House at any cost? In my opinion,the only thing that is fiction about the noval is the storyline and some of the fictional characters,that was written for entertainment purposes,but mainly to get the point across. This noval is also available on amazon.com
