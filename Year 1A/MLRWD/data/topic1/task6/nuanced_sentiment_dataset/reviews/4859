I plan on buying a copy after watching the library's copy multiple times! I was pleasantly surprised that it was not obnoxious like so many child-star-diven films.

It was refreshing to have child characters (the Chupmunks and Chipettes) show good manners, caring towards eachother and the adults, and respect for authority. Even in high school, a notorious place for youth to be profiled being disrespectful to authority and rebellious.

The story is believable in many points, from high school bullying and wrong priorities (jocks), to adolescent crushes, star struck young people with a dream (Chipettes),and crooked managers. Theodore's reactions to siblings fighting was touching, and gives the "slower" child a character to connect with. He is sensitive to home disruptions and the others look out for him. Nice.

There was only one disgusting joke about "dutch oven" and passing gas in bed.

That's great for a juvenile comedy! I can live with that.

Better, it ends happily.
