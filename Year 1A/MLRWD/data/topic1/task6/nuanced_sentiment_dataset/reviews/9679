Rob Reiner, coming off of a divorce, was inspired to create, with screenwriter Nora Ephron, a story of love in adulthood. From that idea, and working with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, comes this delightful and whimsical work. Simply a comedy on the surface, there are hidden themes of love and friendship throughout, as well as the essential question: can romantic love come out of friendship? Well, having experienced a similar situation in real life, I can attest that this movie answers the question perfectly. Not a "love at first sight" movie, we see the 13-year progression of Harry and Sally's relationship, and how it is affected by such things as their attempting to set each other up with their best friends (Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher, in scene stealing performances). The DVD edition of this movie is a beauty to behold. New York has never looked lovelier (particularly the Central Park in fall scenes, which are gorgeous). Fabulous sound, which showcases the lovely score and Harry Conick songs. Includes a Rob Reiner commentary track, which has great anecdotes and stories about the genesis of the film.
