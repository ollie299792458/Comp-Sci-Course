What could be worse than two sadists invading your home not to rob you but to simply subject you and your family to extreme humiliation and torture?  Unfortunately, this is exactly what happens to the unsuspecting vacationing couple of Funny Games.  Two neatly dressed normal-looking young men intrude into the family home and subjugate the family by killing the dog and disabling the father, leaving wife and a kid await in horror for what happens next.  
From this point on the whole movie becomes a torment for the audience rather than home entertainment.  We become viewers of extreme cruelty and sadism frivolously delivered by the two gloating maniacs.  As the film progresses it becomes a challenging exercise in patience and emotional endurance.  The movie is not actually scary per see but overly frustrating.  Half into a movie I loathed the intruders so much that the scene where one of them gets hurt gave me more satisfaction then any violent act against a villain in any movie I can remember.  The message of violence is highlighted strongly by Henke's treatment of the material.

Overall, I never thought that I could see a more disturbing film than Event Horizon.  But Funny Games showed me not just that Even Horizon could be outdone but that the greatest horrors do not reside with mysteriously evil aliens, ghosts or monsters but could simply be found in our seemingly friendly neighbors.
