Captain America has always been one of my top 5 favorite comic book characters,so when this became available on DVD I just had to have a copy.And since I already owned a VHS copy I already new what I was in store for.This is your typical Republic movie serial.It has great production values,great special effects and fantastic fight scenes.The villian played by Lionell Atwill is great and Lorna Gray as the heroine is beautiful.Dick Purcell as the hero is however only serviceable.The biggest problem with this movie however is the fact that the hero really isn't Captain America.His secret identity is no longer that of U.S.Army soldier Steve Rogers.Here he's crusading DA Grant Gardner.There's no shield,no kid sidekick Bucky and his costume is missing more than a few of it's accessories.And even though it was made during WW2 the good Captain isn't taking on the Axis powers here.This has to be one of the worst adaptations of a comic book to the screen,ever.Once again it's a good serial,but Republic would have been better served calling the hero the Americommando or something similair.Or maybe just bringing back the Copperhead character from the Mysterious Dr.Satan.I can only recommend this to fans of Capt.America as a curiosity piece.
