I watched this last night with my wife and friend. The only reason I watched the whole thing was because neither one of them were saying anything negative yet none of us were really laughing either and I didn't want to be the bad guy to ruin it. Occasional cheap chuckle. This movie was a huge disappointment. I agree with "dumbest movieever: when a movie is hyped this much on tv its either because the producers think its a runaway hit or because its so bad producers are trying to recap their money.this movie falls in the latter category." The number one positive reviewer said this is a typical gotta be stoned to enjoy movie. No, I'm a BIG fan of Half Baked and Friday and Grandma's Boy and even stoned wouldn't have enjoyed this film. The is your typical dumb story in this case about a "lazy stoner is the sole witness to a murder by an evil drug lord and a corrupt cop. Marked for death, he runs for his life, dragging his dazed dealer and his supplier with him on a hilarious pot-fueled adventure." The dialogue in this is just beyond terrible from even what you'd expect from a pot-fueled movie. Left my wife and I looking at each other like could this be any worse?! This is directed by Judd Apatow who also directed Knocked Up which I really enjoyed. Either weight until HBO is showing this for free so you're not out the $5 that blockbuster wants or the $15 WalMart wants or trust me on this and save the 117 minutes of your life that this movie runs. . .
