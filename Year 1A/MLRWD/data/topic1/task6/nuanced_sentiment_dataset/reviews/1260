Went to see this movie, ALL excited to actually meet Edward and Aline on the big screen.....WHAT A JOKE. The BEST and most loyal to the game part of the movie were the WORDS spoken in the beginning!!! All this army crap and warehouse? Where in the game is THAT?? Plttttt I say. They should've taken the helicopter and gotten ambushed like in the game and landed on this Shadow Island. Then they could've went all crazy with the different monsters and stuff....but no. LOWWWWWWWWWWWW budget= total crap. Even the monsters were NOT from the game. What a HUGE disappointment!!!!!!

Do NOT see this if you love the game- if you've never played it, then you'll be entertained. But otherwise- it's crap. That's really all I can say. Even as an independent movie, it's quite foolish. And Tara Reid as Aline? LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Aline was NEVER that wimpy in the game- sometimes she surpassed Eddiecakes in that department!!!!!

So- to conclude- Fans- DON'T see the movie. Non-fans- DON'T see the movie either- unless you're on a date and get in free :)
