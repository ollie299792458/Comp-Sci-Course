As far as the genre of traditional superhero stereotypes goes, HANCOCK (I would rate 3 & 1/2 stars) is different to most.  With plenty of imperfections and an attitude to match, HANCOCK is a character that appears to have lost his way.  At times this coincides with the movie plot also losing its way, but that may have more to do with the screenplay being rewritten a couple of times and also being shelved for a while before production finally started.  I don't believe Will Smith's acting has anything to do with that shortcoming.

In terms of entertainment value, I enjoyed it, and so did my family - with some qualifiers; it's important to not take the movie too seriously, and I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 11-12yrs.  It is meant to be different, and is not easy to classify into comedy, romance, or just plain action!  Yes at times HANCOCK over promised and could have been better and explored some of the main character's past a bit more.  Maybe an opportunity gone begging - but still plenty of other material that does deliver some unique and unexpected scenarios.  HANCOCK reminds me in a way of the original Stargate SG1 movie, which could have been so much better but all was not lost when it was turned into an incredibly successful TV series.  HANCOCK is still good value - plenty of laughs.
