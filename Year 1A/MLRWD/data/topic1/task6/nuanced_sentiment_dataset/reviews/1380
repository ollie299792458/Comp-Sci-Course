I certainly admire what the filmmakers of Gotham Knights were trying to do.  This is a highly stylized interpretation of Batman, similar to something you might have seen in the early "Legends of the Dark Knight" comic book series, as compared to the standard fare in "Batman" or "Detective" Comics.  The artists are mostly anime, by the look of it, and there are some neat ideas flowing around and through this feature.

As a series of vignettes, people are going to disagree about what stories work and which don't.  For me, the first story is one of the strongest - about how people perceive Batman.  Here the stylized art works especially well because the kids telling the stories of what they've seen are not really sure about the details, or can't describe them well.  The jerkiness and muddiness of the animation is annoying, but it fits the story perfectly.

Unfortunately, the animation is the weakest point of several of the other stories.  Call me traditional, but Batman is a very American entity, and the cleaner/younger/wide-eyed anime style simply clashes with the content, and it does not fit as well as the dark and gritty American style of other Batman comic books and graphic novels.  The original (mid-90s) Batman: The Animated Series style was much superior, in my opinion.  (This 2-disc special edition offers viewers the chance to check this for themselves, as it includes 4 episodes from the Animated Series.)

There are many good points about this film, but it just doesn't come together for me.  Certainly it isn't as good as the bulk of the Animated Series (the Bruce Wayne-as-Batman series, not the atrocious Batman Beyond).  There are also some good DVD extras on this 2-disc set, it's certainly worth getting this disc instead of the 1-disc version.
