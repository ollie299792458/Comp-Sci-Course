Where to begin describing this execrable film? Originally proposed as a big-budget 3-D feature, it degenerated into this final product.
Fulci was ill during the making of the film and Mattei and Fragasso stepped in to assist and complete it. The result is a terrible mess, similar to Mattei's brutally inept "Hell of the Living Dead". Reports vary regarding how much of the final product was Fulci's. I was able to identify only two scenes that looked like classic Fulci: a brief shot of backlit zombies standing around a bus (composition and lighting similar to "City of the Living Dead", and a female protagonist-become-zombie (make-up similar to Fulci's "Zombie", aka "Zombie 2"). The remainder is a wretched piece of dreck lensed with a cheesy 80s vaseline-soft-focus look and the worst zombie make-up this side of your local drugstore. 
The interviews, however, are worth the price of a rental: Fragasso and Mattei describe the scattergun way the movie ended up being assembled. Most interesting were the comments of the two stuntmen/actors in the last interview segment, who state that Fulci was so ill, he would describe the shots he wanted to them and let them set them up. This explains much! Unless you enjoy trying to figure out who-filmed-what, you will beg for 96 minutes of your life back after seeing the film itself. 
Sime final thoughts regarding the particulars of the disk: Despite anamorphic enhancement, the disk is peculiarly grainy (like much of Media Blasters' output, I'm afraid). Some of the more graphic gore scenes have additional grain and washed-out colors with fuzzy edges, making me very suspicious that they came from a different video master (similar to Germany's ASTRO DVD, which often reinserts scenes from uncut Dutch VHS tapes into their heavily censored masters).
Bonus: the DVD makes a dandy coaster--or (after 45 seconds in a microwave) a lovely Christmas tree ornament.
