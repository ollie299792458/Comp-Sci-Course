Great Michael Mann actioner with an amazing Jamie Foxx performance and Tom Cruise playing a human-terminator heavy.

Cruise's role is a hit man trying to take out multiple targets in a single evening, who hijacks a cab driven by Jamie Foxx.

Apparently the critics weren't ready to see Cruise playing a psychopathic professional killer, because the film got mixed reviews and a lukewarm reception from the audience.

I love the film and admire Cruise for having the guts to take a role so far against type for him.  He absolutely nails it!

Foxx matches him stride-for-stride as the cab driver with the big dreams who finds himself still driving a cab 12 years later.  The arc of his character, and the subtlety Foxx brings to the progression, are amazing.  His character's turning point in the movie is one of the most compelling moments I've seen on celluloid.

The action elements fly off the screen too.

The film was shot mostly at night in hi-def video, and bluray transfer is generally regarded as one of the best ever.  Ditto the soundtrack.  This is probably why the bluray price is holding above $15 for so lon.

R-rated for startling and graphic -- not gruesome -- violence, and language, and deservedly so.

Defiitely a mandatory purchase for serious bluray collectors.  Five stars!
