This expose of Star Trek fandom was interesting and well-done.

I loved Denise Crosby as the interviewer. I remember this movie coming out in '97 and I have finally had a chance to see it--wow, do the eyeglasses everyone wears look huge!

The documentary covered all aspects of fandom and treated the super-fans with respect, despite their eccentricities. We're shown interviews with original cast members, although I would have liked to see some of the DS-9 actors portrayed. Kate Mulgrew does an hilarious Seinfeld-like bit on the difference between Trekker and Trekkie. Brent Spiner and Denise discuss the erotic Trek artwork of fans--especially with humorous regard to their own on-screen sexual exploits. Was it telling that Will Wheaton (the despised Wesley) avoided looking right at the camera during his interview? The young Crusher character was practically a parody himself--hardly one to comment on the fans.

Meeting most of the intelligent fans was fun, though that strange transvestite seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever; I could have done without him. I could also live with less Klingon representation in the documentary.

I thought the teenage boy collector fan was great. He really knew his stuff, knew the value of his memorabilia, and provided a lot of information and intelligent commentary. He gave the impression that he still had a life.

Overall I enjoyed Trekkies and am looking forward to watching the sequel.
