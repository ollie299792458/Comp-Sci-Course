This is one of the most interesting movies I have seen in very long time.  The characters and the plot seemed a bit unreal. Although this movie was unreal the characters alone were interesting.  In this movie there was a prostitute, an African doctor who was accused of murdering his wife, an immigrant who doesn't suppose to be working and suspicious hotel workers.  All of these characters had their own issues and all had to deal with their issues separately.  For example the African doctor throughout the film was known to keep too himself.  He didn't sleep at all, he worked from day to night, and he didn't tell much about himself.  The plot as well seemed a bit unreal.  The African doctor went to unclog the toilet and he found a heart which was stopping up the toilet.  He then figured out that their was an underground business that would take organs from immigrants, to sell them to people who needed them, and in return the immigrants can get a passport.  At the end the African doctor had to save the day.  This film was somewhat practical but what made it interesting was the idea of a dirty, suspicious, distrustful underground business that ran in Europe.  The characters and their personalities in relation to their problems in life made it even more interesting.  I would encourage anybody to look at this movie.
