"My fair lady", an adaptation of George Bernerd Shaw's play "Pygmalion".

From my point of view the movie, My Fair Lady is a fairly good adaptation of Shaws play'. It is true that some of Shaw's original ideas are missing or are misinterpreted. From the point of view of producers and directors, it is understandable that they had to change the play in its movie adaptation in order to make it interesting to the viewers and maintain profits. For example the people at the horse races dressed in black and white was a funny scene, but it wasn't anything like that in Shaw's play.

Overall the movie for me as a 16 year old who is more interested in action movies from this century was not one of the most exiting I have seen. I must confess I fell sleep watching it, but in the the time the movie came out it was a huge succes.

Earlier I was talking about the diferences between the movie and the play but there are many aspects of the film that were very succesfully passed from paper to film. For example the character of Henry Higgins maintained the feeling it gave us when we read the play. Rex Harrison's performance as Mr Higgins was indead one of the best Ive seen. He really kept the satire in his character. When Eliza embarassed him at the tea party and he put the tea cup over his head and turnd away, it was a funny bit of satire

Audrey Hepburn also had an outstanding performance. We could see the changes in Eliza very clearly as she became more educated and changed from a flower girl to a lady.

We could see how Eliza started to talk differently and act differently. She becomes a lady at the end of the  movie and we can see that she cant return to the streets.

In this way the movie and the play were the same.
