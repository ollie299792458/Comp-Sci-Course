I have been using THE BIG BLUE in my marine biology classes for the last 12 years (I use NEVER CRY WOLF in my  biology classes and GORILLAS IN THE MIST in all my zoology classes)..... for a pre-Christmas vacation treat and escape from the tedious work load. Well, after seeing all versions in all modes (BIG SCREEN / VHS / BIG SCREEN(Director's Cut) / DVD )I have to make a choice which is BLUE is the BLUEST  .... Now of course, just like falling in love, the "first is always the sweatest", the use of the Bill Conte's synthesized air-flute which is ("Remembering a Heart Beat"/E. Serra) so crucial to the film in it's ever returning call to Jacques and his "Other (IT'SA BETTER PLACE" World" makes the American version a shorter package. The editing is not perfect but good. But, as I sat through the longer DIRECTOR'S CUT I said ....... boy, that and this and that sure could be cut and the Serra score felt choppy in parts and then I returned to that haunting Conte air flute and the dolphin in the night ( the one who didn't feel so good in captivity - like Jacques )......... and then I realized - "my first BLUE was my BEST and BLUEST BLUE"..... and the ending leaves the classes with much discussion. THEY LOVE IT and I LOVE THEM LOVING IT. And the meaning ....... that's an easy one - in this world there are those who try and conquer (Enzo) Nature and there are those who live in HARMONY with it (Jacques) - the choice and ending are obvious whether or not he lives or dies (American version) ................ and that dolphin and call is in all of us.
