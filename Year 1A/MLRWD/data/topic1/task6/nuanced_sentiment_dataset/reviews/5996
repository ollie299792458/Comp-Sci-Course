First... I LOVED this movie, and not just because of the 'manly men in TIGHT tights' eye candy, although that WAS a nice touch...
Mel Brooks pokes fun at every Robin Hood movie ever made, but doesn't stop there; he makes fun of some of his own movies and cinematic style... this is seen in the opening scene where the village is burning down, and the villagers, who have had ENOUGH scream in unison: "Leave us alone, Mel Brooks"!
Am I the only one who has noticed the almost eerie resemblance that Amy Yasbeck has to the late Madeleine Kahn?
The body language,  especially that little thing with the tongue and lips, the almost-lisp, the voice that can turn clarion at a drop of a hat and the comedic timing in general... she doesn't look quite like Madeleine, but she certainly plays like her...
I recommend this movie, 'specially if you have seen the other incarnations of Robin Hood (especially Mel Gibson's) and other Mel Brooks movies... there are a lot of sly in-jokes from both sources, and the movie is much funnier if you have the background.
