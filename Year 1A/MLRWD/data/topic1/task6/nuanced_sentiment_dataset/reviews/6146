In 1958 my dad took me to the movies for the first time in this country.  As was common back then, we sat for a "double feature".  The first was the 1958 version of "The Blob", with Steve McQueen.  The second was "I Married a Monster From Outer Space".  I saw the 1988 remake of "The Blob", but the second movie seemed to have faded into obscurity. I couldn't remember the name of this movie and for years tried to find it.  My dad died this past Christmas Eve and I became determined to rediscover the name of the movie and to locate it.  That finally happened last month, about a half year after my dad's death.  I found it through Amazon.  Although the movie didn't have the same impact on me now at age 55 as it did when I was eight, it was still worth a look, if only for nostalgia's sake.  Although the special effects don't come anywhere close to what's available today, the acting was decent and the premise is still viable; note the recently released "The Forgotten" and "War of the Worlds" about technologically superior extraterrestrials invading our space on this planet.  As in "War of the Worlds" we humans triumph over the alien invaders with a little help from other earthlings not of our species.
