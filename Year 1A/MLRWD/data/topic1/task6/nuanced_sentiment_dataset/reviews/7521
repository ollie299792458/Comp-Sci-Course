A highly recommended release for anyone involved in 60's / 70's rock bands and / or rock festivals.  If you are a  Hendrix fan it's a MUST HAVE item.

This is Hendrix in his final days, just  a couple of weeks before his tragic death on 9.18.1970.  The last major event on which he was involved and this time as the Blue Wild Angel as he told to one of the masters of ceremonies DJ Jeff Dexter.  Isle of Fehmarn Festival in Germany would be Jimi's next move.

Hendrix sometimes looks tired and a bit out of concentration.  Just take a look at him while playing Red House with the Gibson Flying V guitar (he doesn't look very comfortable) or at the end of the show when he dramatically throws his Stratocaster into the floor.  Despite these small facts, most of his performance is absolutely brilliant even when his pants split and HAD to dissappear from the stage just a couple of minutes not without telling Mitch and Billy about his "problem".

There are some songs that were actually performed and available on audio CD but not on film: Midnight Lightning, Hey Baby (New Rising Sun), and Hey Joe.  "Hey Babe.." as performed on the event, is heard during the last minutes of the film, which is sad because these were in fact the new numbers (" Hey Babe" and "Midnight..") Jimi was testing for his next new record.

Great interviews and facts of the event courtesy of Billy Cox, Mitch Mitchell and Gerry Stickells.  "Pictures in picture" sequences of 4 songs are just incredible as they allow us, who weren't there, to get a complete vision of the stage and performers.  I wish more song were available in this format.

One additional fact is that Hendrix dedicated Foxey Lady to "the cat with the silver painted face".  Well that "cat" is no other than Nick Turner a founder member of the psychedelic tribe known as Hawkwind (they were performing along with Pink Fairies in the Canvas City stage).

Hats off to Murray Lerner, the man behind this fantastic film.
