The Wild Bunch is, without a doubt, one of the greatest westerns that has ever been thought up, but it is also quite controversial.  The romantic view of the Old West is shattered in this 1969 film; no sign of John Wayne anywhere, and most of the cliches found in a typical western are nonexistant(not that I dislike typical western movies, they're actually quite entertaining).  Sam Peckinpah, a master of improvisation, creates an unforgettable movie that is not only responsible for redefining cinematic violence, but also carries with it an engrossing story of friendship, betrayal, and the dying west.  I didn't feel a Director's cut was needed for this film though, because the original version moved at such a lightning-fast pace.  The restored scenes may interest some viewers, but I just wasn't interested.  That is probably why I don't own this version of the movie.  I'd prefer that other Sam Peckinpah flicks be restored, preferrably Major Dundee.  Besides that, the DVD still captures all the explosive action and catchy dialogue.  I particularly enjoyed the presentation of the credits, and Jerry Fielding's music adds to the realistic atmosphere, and that's not a bad thing.  If you're looking for a great action flick with a plot, The Wild Bunch is a winner for a weekend rental, but RENT this version before you buy it.
