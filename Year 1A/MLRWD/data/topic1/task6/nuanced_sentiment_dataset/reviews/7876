The original Jeepers Creepers was surprisingly good, primarily for two reasons: It was centered on the brother-sister relationship between Darry and Trish (Justin Long, Gina Phillips), who had a great screen chemistry, and the Creeper had some panache and humor.
Both of those elements are missing from the sequel. Writer/director Victor Salva gives us too many important characters. The teenage characters are not exactly interchangeable, but there is not enough time for them to truly emerge as individuals. 
The Creeper character is also disappointing. In the first film, when his true nature (is he an insane human being, or a supernatural creature?) was revealed only slowly, the Creeper was seen whistling a tune while going about his grisly work and jauntily adjusting the angle of his hat. In the sequel, perhaps because he's on the final night of his feeding cycle, he is humorless.
There is also no more information about the Creeper's origin or his essence. Like a force of nature, he just is.
On the positive side, Salva does some interesting things with the chaacters, especially as they realize that the Creeper has marked some of them for death and not others. Salva's innovative directing delivers several interesting and surprising shots. And there are a fair number of shocks and thrills.
Ultimately, it's a good sequel that could have been better.
