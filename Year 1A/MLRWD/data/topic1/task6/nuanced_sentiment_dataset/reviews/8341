Going into this film I was already a bit apprehensive, based on the little exposure I had seen on tv and the smoky trailer I had watched online.  At the same time it was easy to believe that good things could come of a movie with a bit of mystery and a cast including Ben Kingsley and Collin firth.  Unfortunately the editorial review is all to accurate from Amazon.com, if not hard enough.  Even the larger name actors in this struggle with what is a dry and bland story that draws on from Rome to Brittania.  Also the lack of budget in this movie is painfully awkward as it comes off more like a SciFi Original rather than a blockbuster.  I am frankly surprised that any buzz at all was ever created about this movie, as it never even popped on the entertainment radar.  Even more surprising is the 4 or 5 star reviews, which I can only assume thought this film was in fact a comedy.  Which after about the first 45 minutes of the film I was of the same opinion and could barely stifle my giggling.  Do yourself a favor and watch any other King Arthur movie and be more entertained.
