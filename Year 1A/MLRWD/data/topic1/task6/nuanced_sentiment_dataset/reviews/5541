At first glance this movie looks WAY better than any other public domain version released.  But if you look closer, it has it's shortcomings, as have been addressed by others.

Only a very discerning eye will be able to see the "stretching" of the screen to fit the 16x9.  But the cropping is noticable.  Many points Gulliver's head is cut off and other details at the top are cut off.  The DVD points out that you'll be able to see more on the sides than ever before.  Which is true, there is slightly more you can see on the side you couldn't see on other versions, because I believe the original theater ratio is slightly longer than the 4:3 TV screen.  But, the amout cut off at the top is more than is extended on the sides.  So, where's the benefit?  Never understood why they don't release these older movies with a very small bar on the top and bottom to keep the original ratio.  Also, it seems when they cleaned up the film they took frames out or something, because it's not as smooth as the original version, which was extremely smooth animation, as most Fleicher products were.  It's very noticable when the film pans, there is a definite judder that was not there in the original.

On the other hand, it's very bright, colorful, crisp and free of screen debris.  It looks great for the most part.  Just wish they would have gotten the screen ratio right and kept the animation smoother, even if it meant not cleaning it quite as well.  I recommend it, but you have to get past the shortcomings.
