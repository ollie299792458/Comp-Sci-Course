I honestly do not know what was going through Robert De Niro's head when he chose to do this role. This is one of his worst performances. His acting is very unbelievable as if he isn't even in the room. It's almost like he isn't even trying. I am used to De Niro doing various roles over the years such as Meet the Parents/Fockers and Analyze This/That but this was one role he should have let go by. As for Dakota Fanning, she was way to young to attempt a role like this. If her manager was trying to expand her resume with this film, they failed. She just couldn't pull it off. She needs to work her way to roles like this. The film had possibilites and I think with different actors and some tweaking of the script it could have been a decent film. If you still want to buy this film be my guest, but this is best left as one of those films you watch late at night after channel surfing. Also the alternate endings are a joke. Be prepared to watch the same scene four times in a row with subtle differences between all of them.
