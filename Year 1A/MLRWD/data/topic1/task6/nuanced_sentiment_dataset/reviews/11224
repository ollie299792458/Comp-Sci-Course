WaHoo!  Now we can get to some REAL captains who know how to act and have more than one big role in their movie careers.  The movie was clearly meant to be a final passing of the torch type of thing between the original Star Trek and the TNG crew, which is utterly superior.  The movie itself, albeit an odd-numbered Trek movie, is not too shabby, seeing as it's the TNG's first trek onto the big screen.  Data is pretty funny in this movie, and pretty much steals the show.  The villian Sauron is quite a forgettable one, but does pose interesting questions and motives, which always makes a character more believable.  But, the topper of this movie, is that Shattner is dead, the final end to the original Star Trek saga.  And by the by, as a Side-note, here are the series in their order from best to worst: TNG, The first three seasons of Voyager, the original, and DS9.  Oh yeah, and the new one "Enterprise" is tied for dead last.  Just a side note.  Good movie, not great, buy it if you need it basically.
