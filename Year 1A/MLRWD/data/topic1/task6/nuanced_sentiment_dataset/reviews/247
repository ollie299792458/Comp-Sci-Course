Dark Harbor was released in theaters January 1, 1998, released on video December 19, 2000 and runs 89 minutes.  Artisan Entertainment is the studio and casts Alan Rickman as David Weinberg, Polly Walker as Alexis Chandler Weinberg and Norman Reedus as the young man.
The movie takes place in the Northeastern US and  begins with David and Alexis Weinberg driving to catch a ferry, but running late.  It is rainy and foggy and the suspense begins to unfold when they find a beaten, young man on the side of the road.  Alexis talks David into helping the young man and they give him a ride.  When they reach the ferry, they drop the young man off and continue on their way to their country home.  They believe this will be the last time they see the young man, however, their lives, unbeknownst to them, will never be the same. The young man shows himself again and spends time at their home with them.  The last scenes are very dark and the end has a twist that noone could have seen coming.  
Dark Harbor deserves a three out of five star rating due to the story line and unexpected ending.  If one were to watch it a second time, he may see signs of what is to come in the last scene of the movie.  Viewers, though, will be anxiously watching to see where this thriller will take them.
