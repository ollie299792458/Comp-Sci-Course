I was excited to see this movie.  The previews made it look like it could be a funny, Men in Black sort of thing.  It wasn't.  It was S T U P I D!  The jokes were forced and misplaced.  They were old and rehashed jokes from movies before.  The plot was extremely predictable, and lame.  The acting was rather poor, and the characters were poorly developed and not very likable.
I will admit I laughed a couple of times.  One being when Prof. Block was getting sucked up the anus of the large creature at the end.  Sick, yes, but funny.  But to wait through 2 hours of stupidity to get to that?  NOT WORTH IT.
Overall I was entertained by the visual effects, and the fun creatures they created.  But, it just wasn't worth it.  I'm glad it was a preview that I paid nothing for, or I would have been demanding my money back!
I give this movie 2 stars, only because I stayed entertained.  Mostly by the visuals.  Even though the visual of the flying dinosaur looking thing with the girl in its claws was some of the hokiest special effects ever...
