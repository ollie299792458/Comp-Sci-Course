For those of you who own Criterion DVDs already, you know about the high quality and what to expect. If you don't own any Criterions, and you love 'Fear and Loathing...', buy this DVD right now [although I warn you that you may unfairly- or quite rightly- judge all other DVDs you get after this one].
Dr. Thompson's Gonzo commentary [well, really, it's producer Laila Nabulsi asking him various questions] is fantastic- he even tries to call Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro, respectively, towards the end of the commentary, but seeing as it was well past midnight, neither answered the phone.......
Also included is the weird but interesting 'Omnibus' BBC documentary piece- as if the DVD wasn't cool enough, this alone makes it worth owning.......
Hell, even Johnny Depp reading various correspondence to and from the Doctor is entertaining. And that's only scratching the surface- there's so much more on the second disc, not to mention the other two commentary tracks, which are also incredibly fascinating....... Even the packaging is cool!
I can't say enough about it. If you're only curious about the film and haven't yet seen it, go read the book and dig that first. Then come back and get this DVD. Hours and hours and hours of pure Gonzo entertainment await you!
