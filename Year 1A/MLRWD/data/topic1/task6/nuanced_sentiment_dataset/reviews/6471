This was one of the biggest movie surprises of the late 70s.  It's absolutely incredible, the scope of a director who can follow up the cramped quarters & pent-up energies of "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest," with the exlplosion of the psychedelic generation in "Hair."  But Milos Forman accomplished just that.

Forman imbues this movie musical with distinctive touches all his own: particularly the dizzying 360-degree spin around the lead singer in the opening "Age Of Aquarius" number; the endearing comedy of the "Black Boys/White Boys" number; protagonist Bukowski's drug initiation in the extended "Hare Krishna" number; and (my very favorite) the unexplainable warmth and human celebration of the "Good Morning, Starshine" number (shot entirely in close-ups and medium shots, in a convertible car!).  The emotional lift experienced when the camera finally trucks back from a group of characters we've come to know & love, is beyond words.

Twyla Tharp adds her renowned choreography to all songs; director Forman gave her a free rein on all of them.

This disc has both the formatted & widescreen versions; the latter is obviously preferable.

It'll be fascinating to many who've only been familiar with Treat Williams, John Savage & Beverly D'Angelo through their subsequent work, that they're ALL terrific singers & dancers!
