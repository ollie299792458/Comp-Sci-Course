A simple story about a New England resort community that is terrorized by a giant killer shark.  Half of the movie focuses on the shark attacks, human reactions, and character development between Brody, Hooper, Quint, Mayor Vaughn, and so forth.  The second half of the movie focuses on human intervention - Brody, Hooper, and Quint try to kill the shark.  In between there is Oscar-winning film editing, sound, and a now-classic score by maestro John Williams.  'Jaws' was unjustly ignored at Oscar time, especially for screenplay, acting (Scheider, Dreyfuss, and especially Shaw), and director Spielberg.  Roger Ebert was right when he reviewed this movie - "In keeping the Great White offscreen, Spielberg was employing a strategy used by Alfred Hitchcock throughout his career. 'A bomb is under the table, and it explodes: That is surprise,' said Hitchcock. 'The bomb is under the table but it does not explode: That is suspense.'" Spielberg is doing the same thing for most of this movie. The audience doesn't see the shark, but the underlying result of its actions. So, for the audiences who claim this is simply slow-paced fluff where the shark is hardly seen for about three-quarters of the film, put Mr. Ebert's review of the film into your pipe and smoke it.
