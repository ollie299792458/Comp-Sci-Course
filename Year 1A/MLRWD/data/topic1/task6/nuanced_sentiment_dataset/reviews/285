After all the success he's had with the Spiderman movies, Rami has decided to return to his roots: freaky horror movies. Like Dario Argento and Tobe Hooper before him, Rami did amazing things with the horror genre with his Evil Dead series. What he did was combine gruesome horror with dark comedy. The end result was that Rami changed the genre forever. If you're going to make a horror these days, you had better have a sense of humor, too. Drag Me to Hell takes Rami back to his roots in a big and entertaining way. Allison Lohman plays a kind young woman who has to prove to her boss that she can make hard decisions. So, she denies a gypsy woman an extension on her mortgage. Enraged by the indignity, the gypsy casts a curse upon Lohman. What happens is three days of torture before she is dragged to Hell. What follows over those three days is a series of completely demented and darkly funny episodes. The entire cast is excellent as are the special effects, which take their cue from the bizarro effects from Evil Dead. This movie is destined to be a classic.
