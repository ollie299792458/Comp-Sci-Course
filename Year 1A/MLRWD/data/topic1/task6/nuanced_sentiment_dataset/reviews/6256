I am a big Superman fan. From the comic book collection, to the movies, to my T-Shirts. I love Superman.

I went to this movie 4 times before it left my local theater and once at an IMAX 150 miles away, (big mistake). And everytime I saw it I kept wondering how old is Superman supposed to be when he left earth in search of Krypton?

Brandon Routh looked to be in his early to mid 20's. (he is actually 26). So if he left 5 years prior to the start of the story line, he would have been 19 or 20 years old.

Lois Lane,(Bosworth) looks to be about the same age as Clark Kent/Superman. (When she is actually 23).

So when does this relationship between the two begin?

How old is Lois Lane supposed to be when she gets pregnant with Superman's son? 18?!?!?!?

Doesn't Lois Lane go to college after high school?

Doesn't Clark/Superman travel to the Northern Pole, after his earth father, Jonathon Kent dies, and spend 10 years learning about his origins before going to Metropolis?

These may be picky things and my wife tells me that they are actors playing an older role. Well, isn't this Hollywood. Can't they find someone in or at least around their 30's to play the part, or at least make them look a little older. They billed this thing as continuing where Superman II left off.

Casting wrong for Superman and Lois.

One last gripe.  Why do the wrtiers use the word SAVIOR at least 4 to 5 times when referring to Superman?

Superman has always been described as a HERO.

A savior (to me) denotes religion and/or some kind of spirituallity.

It would have sounded better for the line to have read, "The world doesn't need a HERO" or "I hear the world crying out for a HERO everyday, Lois."

Just a few bumps in an otherwise good movie. It could have been great.  Maybe they will contact me before the next one.
