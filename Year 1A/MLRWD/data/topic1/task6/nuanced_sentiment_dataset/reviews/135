Dwayne Johnson also credited as "The Rock" has become a very entertaining actor. Myself, I love all of his movies, there is no one better to play "I'll kick your ass and feel good about it" other than The Rock. Then you think about other muscular actors, for example Arnold Shwarzenegger, he was Mr. Universe but does it show in his movies? No he's all about guns, he doesn't put his strength to his advantage in his movies besides hauling around a coffin full of what? GUNS in T3. The Rock makes each movie memerable, somthing you can always keep and enjoy. There IS NO ONE BETTER than The Rock to play such a role as The Scorpian King. He is the top of the line and I hope he makes a lot more movies, he will be the next kick ass major actor bigger than Stallone, bigger than Shwarzenegger he's a star. The Scorpian King is sucha movie that you can keep and watch over and over, The Rock hits this over the fence out of the park and right into your DVD collection believe me he's deffinately worth the price.
