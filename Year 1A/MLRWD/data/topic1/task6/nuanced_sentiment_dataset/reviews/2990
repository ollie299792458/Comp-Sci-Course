Re-Animator is so ludicris that it's kind of like watching an accident and you can't look away and you are not helping either.  The theme is campy, the story is pure dribble but the actress is gourgous the special effects are gross and let's face it this movie was not made looking for an academy award.  Tell me this, when was the last time you saw a guy holding his own detached head and talking to himself and assulting the love intrest of the story.  Oh and by the way the 1.5 stars was for the actress.  I waited a long time to get this on DVD and jumped at the chance to add it to my collection.  I know I'm not saying much about the character development or the nature of the plot, but you have to have those things in order to develop them.  No, this is just the perfect crazy late night 3:00 AM movie that Elvira would show and wise-crack throughout the entire viewing.  Not being anywhere close to 18 years of age anymore I still enjoy the nutty & the absurd from time to time.  Oh there is one hilarous scene where a reanimated black cat takes his anger and frustration out on the "mad doctor" that has reanimated it and after killing the poor kitty for the second time reanimates the poor thing again.  This movie is not for everyone, it's a minor twist on the "living dead" theme with Tony Todd, but I enjoy the utter lack of good taste and imagination from time to time.
