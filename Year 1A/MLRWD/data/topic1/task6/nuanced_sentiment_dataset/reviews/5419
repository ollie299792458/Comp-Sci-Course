Among alligator and crocodile movies, this is one of the best. And the copy on this DVD is fine, with one minor problem. This was produced with no enhancement so you have to set your player to send the signal at 480p to get the correct aspect ratio. Other than that it's a great thrill ride.

The acting is fine but the real draw for me from day one was Betty White. She shows the bent sense of humor she is so repected for now. Remember this was 1999. And when I saw Kingdom of Heaven, I was surprised to learn that one of the nastiest charactors was played by Brendon Gleason, who I mistook for a down-Mainer.

This is a great representative of its genre and should be a film enjoyed for what it is, no more, no less.

(I expect this next section to be edited out. That's fine. I started watching the movie and the disc is damaged. I can find no way to contact someone about this. The returns page won't give me a reason for the return so I can't contact anyone. Not good.)
