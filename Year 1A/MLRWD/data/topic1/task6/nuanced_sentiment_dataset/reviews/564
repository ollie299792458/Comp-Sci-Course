Despite its plodding plotline, "Caligula" excels in its sheer extravagance. There seems no better subject for such a movie than the emperor Caligula, and the movie is a fascinating clash of the excesses of ancient Rome and the excesses of modern Western society. It is so mindnumbingly lavish that one cannot help but enjoy it. Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole and Helen Mirren make excellent performances, which none of them have yet publicly regretted, but it seems their presence is more significant as names on the movie poster than adding any real quality to the movie itself. The true credit of the movie's succeses go to Danilo Donati, who created the sets and costumes (also Fellini's art director), and Bob Guccione, the producer who pushed the limits of the movie's decadence (also founder and publisher of Penthouse, the company that produced "Caligula"). Gore Vidal's original screenplay is reportedly nearly unrecognizable in this final cut of the movie, which is unsurprising given the unremarkable dialogue and storyline that does little more than fill in space. Nonetheless, "Caligula" is delightfully repulsive, the height of trash, and a rightful classic
