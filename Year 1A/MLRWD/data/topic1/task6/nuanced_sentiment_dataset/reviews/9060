WWII in HD does a good job of using personal stories to tell a larger tale.  Gary Sinise is a great narrator.  The real-life soldiers/sailors/marines are terrific and their story is worthy of being told.

The production suffers from two main problems, that pull it down from being the best of class in the area of color WWII documentaries.

1) There is heavy use of colorized film.  For example, you can now watch General MacArthur wade ashore in a film you've seen before, but now it's in color.  I found that to be too distracting to abide.  There are many, many other cases of film colorization, this is just the most shocking.

2) There is a lot of unnecessary back and forth... from Leyte to Europe, then back to Leyte, then back to Europe, then back to Leyte, then to somewhere else in Europe, then back to Leyte...  At each transition, there is a high-tech, google-earth-like movement across the globe that I found out of place and amateurish given the seriousness of the subject.

I found "World War II - The Lost Color Archives", sold right here at Amazon.com (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767026977">World War II - The Lost Color Archives</a>), to be a much more satisfying experience.  That documentary does a better job of using its 100% authentic color film to tell the story of WWII.

While "WWII in HD" is not the best documentary, either about WWII, or in the sub-genre of color presentation of the war, it should be considered a quality addition to the canon.  In other words, if you own several other documentaries, you should consider getting this one too, for what it adds.  However, if you are looking for one or two, definitive, documentaries to watch, then I'd suggest going elsewhere.
