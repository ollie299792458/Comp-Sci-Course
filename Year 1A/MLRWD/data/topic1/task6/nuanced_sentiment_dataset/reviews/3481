My husband is 10 years older than I, and saw the movie in elementary school with his mom.  I had never heard of Billy Jack or Tom Laughlin before.  I appreciate all the comments here for breaking open and examining each piece of the film's method and message.  The woman who wrote about the racist depiction of Native American activism and spirituality had a good point.  The person who said, hey, people loved it for the action and not the message (hence the bombing of the second movie) also had a good point.  Although I found Laughlin worth watching, my own fondness was more about the message of the school and its teacher.  Sure, it was wrapped in some overly sappy lines and placed in a school of overwhelming (read "nauseating") peace and love.  However, the core message of refusing to toss out "bad kids," creating opportunities for learning through tapping into one's previously undiscovered creative interests, standing up to those who abuse their power and authority, and reexamining and discarding the race-rules about who we are supposed to hang out with---well, those messages are still worth listening to today.
