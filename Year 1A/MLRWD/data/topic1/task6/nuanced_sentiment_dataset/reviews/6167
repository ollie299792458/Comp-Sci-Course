Me and my girlfriend rented this movie out of boredom (the new Indiana Jones movie was coming out so we wanted to refresh our memories of the first ones but our movie rental place didn't have them all so our friend who works there recommended this saying it was "almost" Indiana Jones). Now, normally, we're (mostly my girlfriend) are very critical about the movies we watch (Highland the source, Indiana Jones: The crystal skull both got very low thumbs down). We knew the ending before the movie even began and the special effects just weren't that special. But we watched it anyway. Then we watched it again. For some reason, this movie is amazingly addicting. The theory is that the actors relationships between one another and easy plot line make up for the not-so-special effects and the historical inaccuracies (though my girlfriend would argue with Joshua Koppe saying that most of ancient Christianity is based on Pagen theology so it makes it slightly more accurate). Newhart is phenomenal in his role (memo to self next time I want to call in the Marines) and Wyle/Flynn makes an amusing contradiction to the seriousness of surrounding characters. We also were impressed with the producers' ability to keep the flow going in between movies (there are just some sequels that should never have happened) We are hoping that a new Librarian comes out soon. Definite must see if you want to relax after work and don't want to think really hard about what your watching.
