Ok, first things first, being a big Mel Brooks fan, I already own four of these eight films on DVD.  (Why Fox is claiming "The Twelve Chairs" has never been released baffles me.  THEY released it themselves about five years ago and quickly discontinued it.  I bought mine when it was realeased, but I digress...)  So that means I have to pay an average of twenty dollars each for the other four.  Ok, I can live with that.  Still not a total rip-off, but a slap in the face to dedicated fans nonetheless.  As for the minimal bonus features, another disappointment, but as I usually only watch them once, that's not so bad either.

Alrighty then, today I receive my much anticipated order and become almost ill to see that the individual movies are encased in those slim flimsy plastic cases, lately popular with television series releases.  While I prefer them to the large cumbersome gatefold packaging for multiple disc sets, this is the first time I have seen it used for actual movies that aren't sequels.  As I usually discard the stupid box movie sets come in and file the individual films alpabetically this is just too much to tolerate. The individual movies will be hard to be seen among the bigger boxes, but, yeah, that's my choice.  But hey, they didn't include any little booklets in the film boxes or the set.  There's no chapter information listed either.

I'm surprised Fox actually bothered printing graphics on the actual discs.  Ok, now time to get happy and jump up and down and be oh-so grateful that "Silent Movie" and "High Anxiety" are FINALLY on DVD!  (Here's hoping they look decent...)
