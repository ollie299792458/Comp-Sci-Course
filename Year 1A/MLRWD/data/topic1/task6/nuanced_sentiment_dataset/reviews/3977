What is special about this film is that it was the only queer- themed general audience film to come out of East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall, reunification, etc.  Apart from that, it doesn't have a whole lot to recommend it.  Thin characterizations, a decidedly underwritten script, fairly generic "coming out" situations, sluggish pace, confusing holes in the plot and incomplete story lines (what exactly happens to the baby the lead appears to have fathered with his girlfriend?) combine to make this film fall far short of its potential.  A climactic monologue delivered by an elderly survivor of the Pink Triangle and the concentration camps doesn't manage to lift the material to the level of seriousness to which it appears to aspire. (I found myself wishing they'd told the old man's story instead of this one.)  The erotic material, by today's "Queer as Folk" standards, is remarkably tame (although the lead is attractive enough) and certainly doesn't feel as ground-breaking as it may have when the film was released 12 years ago.  Image quality on the DVD is excellent; subtitles are clear and readable.  Worth renting, perhaps, but not worth buying, even at Amazaon's generously reduced price.
