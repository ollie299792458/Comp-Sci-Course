I wanted to see Castaway.  I really did.  But I had to take my little brother, and my dad was the one paying for the tickets, so I HAD to see it.  Plus, it had good reviews from the critics, so I figured it couldn't be all bad, right?  WRONG.

"The Emperor's New Groove" is unfunny, simplistic, and stupid.  Despite the talent that went into it, it was awful.  The best character was the squirrel, I swear.  The jokes weren't funny, and I found myself constantly praying that the witch, would catch Kuzco and kill him.  The film was so Un-Disney I almost cried.  The reasons why:

1. Lack of music.  There was no music!  Disney was one of the last film companies to make musicals, and now it is no more.  I guess the musicals are a lost genre, which [...stinks], because Disney really did have great music.

2. Lack of terrifying bad guy.  Look at all the past Disney classics.  You have Ursula, Millicent, Cruella DeVille, Scar, and others.  What do they all have in common?  They're all terrifying.  However, in an attempt to make the witch (I don't even bother to remember her name) funny, they just made her unscary and totally retarded.

3. Bad animation: I totally loathed the animation.  Where was the detail, the beauty, the grace that all other Disney movies had?  Nowhere!  This movie was badly drawn, above all things.

I don't know what Disney was thinking.  But whatever it was, it wasn't about making a good movie.

And you know what the worst part is?  My little brother got to see Castaway anyway.
