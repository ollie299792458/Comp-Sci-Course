(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick the DVD special features)
Those Extras:
Commentary:  A lot of fun.  You get Carpenter and Russell together and it's giggle city.  Kurt's infectious laugh is almost all that's needed to recommend this.  Though they stray from the film too much, they always catch themselves.
Deleted Scenes:  Plenty to chew on.  Mostly extensions of scenes we already know.
Behind the Scenes: A quickie featurette from the set in '86.  Most of it was done during the alley sequence early in the film, so not a lot to get into.
Misc:  Tons of little things are real eye openers: interview with FX guy Edlund; so dopey it's hilarious music video featuring Carpenter(!) not only rocking out, but singing to the film's theme!; I usually don't mention trailers but there are six(!!) to choose from, even the pay-per-view one!
Overall: Not many others will rival what this one has to offer.  Some bloopers and new interviews would've made it flawles, but as it is, no complaints.
