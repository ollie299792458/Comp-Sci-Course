What can I say, VICE defined a decade and a generation. 1984, I was fifteen years old and never spent much time in front of the tube. Who had time? To much was going on outside, especially on a friday night after the week was over. Then It happened. Not a soul was outside one Friday night, the buzz earlier that day was that some new TV show was coming on that night. I really didn't pay it that much attention and didn't care! (Had girls on the brain) So I went in the house, jumped up on the bed, kicked back and tuned in to see what the hype was all about. When the end credits rolled and I picked up my jaw, an impression was made forever. I just purchased this DVD set and there was just one scene I had to see first which appeared in the Pilot, not an episode, a scene! The one and only scene that defined VICE for decades to come. A scene where not much at all was said between Philippe Michael Thomas and Don Johnson because of an eerie song pumping in the background followed by Phil Collins haunting voice (In The Air Tonight) that put you right there with them. Their faces, serious and cold, two vice cops with two separate vendettas but one gold, cruising down the Miami strip at night with one thought in mind, Calderone. Tubbs loads his shotgun while Crocket whips the Ferrari Daytona Spyder in and out of traffic.

  Crocket
  How much time do we have?

  Tubbs
  Twenty five minutes.

 This scene has been talked about and discussed for years after and will always be remembered.
