Hi... I am a BIG superman fan. I just got the Complete Superman Collection on DVD. I loved the first two as most people cause you could feel (specially in the first one, although I really enjoyed the second one... Donner's direction anyway) the Superman Legacy flowing from start to end, you could feel these movies where made to tell a story, not to rip of money. This 3rd installment IS a good movie. Let's see why: - It has good special effects (although you CAN see wires... by BAD effects I would mean Superman IV - It has good sequences. - If you're a Superman fan it's a must have. - Superman vs. Clark &gt;&gt; AWESOME! - Clark going back to Smallville. - Christopher Reeve's natural flying acting, you'll believe he does fly.
Now to its flaws:
- Richard Pryor... he doesn't belong here. - If one says Superman 1 &amp; 2 you really get a picture of Superman in your mind, if one thinks about Superman 3... you don't. - It seems this movie was made as a comic relief barely featuring Superman... - You don't get the same feel as the first two... the beggining scene has a completely different theme and opening credits. - THE ENDING WITH CYBERWOMAN!!... I just hated that and was totally unnecessary. I mean TOTALLY. It ruined the ending for me and brought the movie down as well. - Special effects ARE GOOD, although they could have removed the wires as in the previous films, cause you can see wires almost anytime here. (I'm a 3D / special effects animator so I know how it works!) But not that big... the scenes where done perfectly and Christopher Reeve is a unique Superman, he fly-acts very naturally.
All in all, I REALLY enjoyed the movie... although the ENDING was a bit lame. If they would've removed the Cyberwoman scene it would've been GREAT. IT DOES NOT have the same feeling as the first two, but what the hell, at least it's no Superman IV.
