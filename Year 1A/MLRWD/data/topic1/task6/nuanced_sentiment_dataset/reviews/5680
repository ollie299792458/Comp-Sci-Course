The Babylon 5 Series is probably the best Science Fiction Series for TV ever made.

You must endure the first season (which has lots of hints needed for later)!

The series was plagued by politics as is all science fiction due to the costs vs. the costs of adult comedy & non reality reality shows. So the series is kinda out of order.

Season 4 was the end of the show. So the very last episode of Season 4 should be watched after the entire series, movies, and sequel series (Crusade & Jeremiah).

The prequel ("In the Beginning") was actually released in Season 5 when TNT reran the show and contracted for Season 5 and some movies. (The prequel is told as a "past history" so a few hints from season 1 are given early if you watch the prequel first.)

So watch "In The Beginning" > "The Gathering" > Season 1-4 (but last episode of season 4) > Season 5 Episode 1-3 > "Thirdspace" rest of Season 5 but last episode > River of Souls > Call to Arms (the prequel to Crusade) > "Lost Tales" > Last episode of Season 5 and then last episode of Season 4.

Then optionally watch or insert after "Lost Tales" the rest of the story...

Crusade Series (dropped by TNT after show 13)... OK, not great to watch, but could have been if profit had not gotten in the way.

Jeremiah Series (cut short too).  OK, not great to watch.

I will try and make a better "chrono" later on my website [...]
