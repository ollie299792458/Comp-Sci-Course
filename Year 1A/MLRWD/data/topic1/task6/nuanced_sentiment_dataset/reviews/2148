If books are generally the best editions of any given story, then the first movies adapted from them are usually the best.
"Body Snatchers", which is based on the book "The Invasion of the Body  Snatchers" by Jack Finney, is the third adaption of this story, via  VHS. There is one black and white version from 1956 which I haven't yet  seen (which is really a paraody of the 50s fear of communists, or so I  hear) and then there is a 1970s version starring Donald Sutherland,  Veronica Cartwright and Jeff Goldblum, which scared my hair gray.
This  movie is the americanized version of an alien tale. It is over-done to the  point of glowing, it is so polished. Some people like perfection, but in  horror movies, especially "hokey" horror movies, I like a few  flaws. This movie has the sense of having been regurgitated through the  ages. Nothing in it seems "new". Despite that, the youthful cast  (practically all the main characters are "kids") do the best job  possible, given the circumstances. I rate this movie a 6 out of a 10. It is  a good thing to pick up if you're looking at the video store for a  last-minute rental, and are stumped, but if you want a thriller for a  birthday party or something, see the 70s version.
