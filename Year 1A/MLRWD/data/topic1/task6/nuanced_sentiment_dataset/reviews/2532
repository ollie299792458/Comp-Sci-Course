Based very loosely on the rather interesting 1991 book "The Feather Men" by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, "The Killer Elite" shows Hollywood cowardice at its best: successfully emasculating, with formulaic, politically correct stereotypes, what should have been a very good film.

While normally enjoying Jason Statham in the various characters he has played on the big screen, watching his character (Danny) and his group of thuggish assassins murder British Special Air Service (SAS) veterans was extremely difficult. And why, you may ask, do Danny and his team kill these SAS veterans? According to the film: in order to save an absurdly cast Robert De Niro. After watching De Niro for about a minute, I would have just left him in the prison and gone out and had a pint with the SAS veterans (and Clive Owen, who was great in this film).

Some of the scenes in this film are very good. And, some of the action sequences, taken in a vacuum, are also very good. However, action and scenery do not make a good film, and "The Killer Elite" is, sadly, another example of the principle.

The screenwriters not sticking to the original story from Sir Ranaulph's novel was the death blow to "The Killer Elite." So, if you are in the mood for yet another Hollywood, watered-down, politically correct, "action" film, this one is for you. If not, I would still recommend reading the book and then renting this film just to see how bad Hollywood was to the original story.

Two stars (although, I have no doubt, this could have been a four-star quality film).
