With a cast made of people such as Stallone, Tom Berenger, Kris Kristofferson, and Charles S. Dutton, this could have been a good movie.  Unfortunately it wasn't.
(Possible Spoilers)
Stallone is a Federal Agent tracking a cop killer.  Naturally the killer goes after Stallone's girlfriend and Stallone goes off the deep end.  Finally his partner convinces him to enter a detox center for police officers.  Unfortunately it seems the killer has tracked him there.
The movie could have been good.  Stallone has the hangdog character down perfect at this point in his career and there are some very good supporting actors backing him up.  My biggest problem involved the usage of the villain.  The movie kind of dropped us right in the middle of the opening case and didn't explain any motivation on the background of the killer.  There was no proper antagonist really thrown into this movie and the character seemed more a throw away than anything else.  It's a shame really because there were some tense moments but with nothing to really play against, the movie ultimately fell flat.
