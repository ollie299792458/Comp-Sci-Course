Valentine ( Irene Jacob ), a Swiss model, runs over a dog and haps on the owner ( Jean-Louis Trintignant ), who is an old judge. Although the judge begins talking about his past, what he says also depicts Valentine's future. There's the linkage between his past and her destiny! On the other hand, Auguste ( Jean-Pierre Lorit ) is preparing for the exam to be a judge...
 Red implies passion, but also means fraternity. This motion picture depicts cyclical destiny and human spirit.
Jacob, the star of "Double life of Veronique," is vivid in Kieslowski's movie. Trintignant expresses the old judge who is revived by Valentine well. Lorit's silent performance is notable.
 Director Kieslowski is good at depicting two things at the same time. In Red, he expresses the linkage between the past of the old judge and heroine's destiny. Kieslowski uses unique, artistic, and abstract expression. He effectively uses silence, unique behavior, metaphor, minimum speech, and beautiful music. In addition, he represents the characters of the hero and heroines of The Three Colors Trilogy ( Blue, White, Red )by contrasting the each reaction toward an old lady through three stories. Also, it is interesting that 3 stories are intertwined.
 The three colors trilogy consists of 3 films ( Blue, White, Red ) . The colors of French flag means liberty, equality, fraternity. Director Kieslowski expressed these themes through the movies. Compared to "Blue" and "White," "Red" gives us the impression of the hopeful future. Also, this film was nominated for the Academy Award in 1994. Many viewers have praised this film. I recommend watching all three motion pictures.
