Having missed Sunshine Cleaning at the movies, I have been anxiously awaiting its release on Blu-ray. What a disappointment. It just hasn't lived up to its promise. I can only blame the scriptwriter for having squandered a wonderful opportunity. Sunshine Cleaning should have had everything going for it. A great idea for the story and a fabulous cast were simply let down by a mediocre script. It was if the film began with several story lines, but then half of them had to be abandoned because of time constraints (perhaps they're on the cutting room floor and we'll have to wait for the extended version to be released).

This surely has to be the only possible reason for the under-utilised peripheral cast members. What did the one-armed shopkeeper (Clifton Collins Jr) add to the story. Just when it appeared that he was about to contribute some warmth, closeness and genuine friendship to Rose's life - he just disappears. The father (Alan Arkin) who absolutely shone in Little Miss Sunshine, was barely to be seen. The character of Lynn (Mary Lynn Rajskub) who comes in offering so much potential in her connection with Norah - just walks out, never to be seen again. Surely, it would have contributed to the story had she and Norah reconnected. Perhaps they could have done the road trip together.

The film's resolution, with father selling the house etc. looked like a formula approach borrowed from a dozen other films from the past. Sorry folks! the script just didn't do it for me. All I can say is thank goodness for Amy Adams and Emily Blunt. Without their wonderful performances, this film would have sunk without a trace.

I notice that Anchor Bay has included trailers for Last Chance Harvey and The Visitor. Both are top films that generate truckloads of empathy. Perhaps the writer of Sunshine Cleaning should take a look.
