Sorry, but this movie just isn't very good.  This may have scared people back in it's day (now I respect that and like many old scary movies that are today considered tame) but it's predictable and dumb.  I'm sorry to offend any "Classic!" criers out there but it's true.  There is a good premise here, and yes it was well filmed, lighted and edited.  Acting was good on the parts of principle charecters.  But overall this movie really lacks.  For as much as a ghost movie that people claim this too be, it really isn't.  And I almost kicked my Television when I saw a charecter at the end proclaim "Now there are more ghosts to join the other seven." Puh-Leeze!  As if those other seven even made a cameo appearence!  The remake is bad too, but at least it's one up on this movie by offering one or two eerie shots and scenes.
Bottom line, not worth the price or even the almost hour and half it takes to watch it....wait a tick!  There is another hard to find good point for this film...it's SHORT!
