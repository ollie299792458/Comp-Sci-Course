Having read about 60 of the reviews for this film, I can't believe no-one has offered the opinion that this film is basically a religious allegory - a sinner, whose disdain for other people shows in his attitude to his ex-wife, and brother - has taken away from him all that he possesses (or is possessed by). He is restored, redeemed if you will, by the mysterious operations of CRS. It seems fairly obvious.
Looked at like this, the plot and the ending (which seem to have outraged so many of the reviewers) don't call so much for a suspension of disbelief as a willingness to participate in the symbolic coherence of the allegory. I'm not a Christian, but I can admire the courage of a film that dares to push the narrative so far, and in such a direction.
Douglas is excellent as the central character hardly trying at all not to repeat the "fall" of his father (until CRS comes along), while Penn, to his enormous credit, makes a credible brother. Unger I like to think of as the presiding angel of the film, one who appears as a nuisance to Douglas, but leads him eventually through the shadows - and she does very well too.
One other thing - the score, by Howard Shore, is terrifically simple, plangent and tense by turns; the film would not please so much without it.
