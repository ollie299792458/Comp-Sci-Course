I thought I was a fan of the Coen brothers, but after this movie I am reconsidering ... this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Was it some sort of childhood payback that led them to make this movie about growing up Jewish and dysfunctional? If there was a plot, it may (?) have had something to do with the meaning of life being buried in a Jefferson Airplane song, but it was impossible to tell. I tend to think that its whole purpose was little more than an indulgent piece of throwaway art. Though the acting was good, the talents of those involved were wasted on slow, boring dialogue that tries to generate sympathy for the tortured hero at the center of the film. Sadly, it never quite got there for me or those with whom I watched it.  It ended with us scratching our heads and wondering how it got made. As a final note, I found this film insulting to Jews and "Goys" alike (mostly goys) sterotyping both in the most negative manner. Not a single laugh, and not even close to the Coen brothers that I thought I knew.
