Not since Heero have I seen such an overrated movie, just like that movie I am dumbfounded to talk to people who actually liked this movie.  And not just Liberals who have a blind admiration for this film due to its political message but some right wingers too.

This film was over-acted, over dramatized and under written.  The story line is full of holes and where it is not full of holes it tries way too hard to make connections between the present and the events of the past, and the connections which all of our characters seem to have falls into that forced category.

The dialogue is drawn out and tries to come across as artistic, many times I found myself zoning out long after the point was made in these pretentious conversations.

The fight scenes are nothing revolutionary or exciting, its the same familiar fight scene you see in all "over-hollywooded" movies.

This film also perpetuates the growing anti-Christian movement by using a red, modified cross as the Evil State's symbol.  On the surface this film tries to preach against hate with the over-played anti-gay thing, in reality it promotes more hatred, bigotry and fascism than Mien Kompf.  If there is any political future that this film alludes to it is one of a new wave of hatred against the majority of Americans.
