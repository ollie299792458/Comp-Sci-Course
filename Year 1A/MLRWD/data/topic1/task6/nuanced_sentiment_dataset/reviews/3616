Here he is at his best (worst)--Ed Wood: the notorious man for being hailed as the worst director of all time.  And in Plan 9 From Outer Space, we get to see Ed's ability to create the worst movies that can possibly be made.  Everyone has their favorite parts about the ineptitude of this movie.  My particular favorite is Ed's inability to want to re-shoot scenes thus resulting on final film as the actors bumping into sets, and stumbling around.  Another favorite is the fact of putting Bela Lugosi's name on the credits where all we see of him is a matter of moments in the beginning--and then a caped hidden mad that is supposed to be Bela (which was Ed's wifes chiropracter; who had no acting skill beforehand and was just chosen at random.  When one looks at this movie the list is endless of things that make it the worst movie of all time.  However, I do give it 3 stars for providing an extremely entertaining show for everyone.  It is sad to believe that Ed intended upon this being a great movie, and that everyone today has loved it for its ability to show how bad a film really can be.  Sorry Ed, but we cant help but laugh at your attempt.  Enjoy the worst movie of all time that turned out to be an extreme mockery of the movie industry.
