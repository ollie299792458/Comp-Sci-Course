If Alfred Hitchcock had never existed and Gus Van Sant had assembled this cast to make a new film called "Psycho", I'd probably give this tape 4 stars, perhaps 5. But the fact is that Hitchcock did direct this  film first, and had far greater insights into what he was doing than Van  Sant did when he attempted this almost shot-for-shot remake.
But let's  start with the premise that the original "Psycho" is a five-star  movie, and work from there. Toss out one star for Van Sant's inferior and  slavish duplication of Hitchcock's work, instead of finding his own voice  and infusing the movie with a new viewpoint. Throw another down the tubes  for the horrible mistake of casting Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. Although  Vaughn is a fine, enjoyable young actor who does the best he can, Norman  has to seem like the sort of man-child who wouldn't hurt a fly. Vaughn is  too hunky, too hulking, for anyone to believe that he would never harm  anyone. That leaves three stars for this otherwise good but useless  effort.
The rest of the cast is fine at what they do and recreate the  original performances of their 1960 counterparts perfectly. But they, in  particular William H. Macy and Julianne Moore, must have been frustrated at  not being able to leave their own noticeable mark on the movie.
It was  fun, though, seeing the close resemblance between the policemen in both  versions of the movie; I could swear they were identical twins, 28 years  apart. But other than that, this version of "Psycho" has no real  reason to exist. I don't know why Van Sant even bothered, and just hope he  won't continue this trend by remaking "Psycho 2".
