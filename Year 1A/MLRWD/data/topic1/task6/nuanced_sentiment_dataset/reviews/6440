Before there was a blockbuster, before there was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECAD0">Close Encounters of the Third Kind (30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition)</a>, there ws The Sugarland Express.  Spielberg's first full-length motion feature.  He previously directed the TV movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063UR5">Duel (Collector's Edition)</a> and few TV show episodes, but this is what really got him attention.  He showed that he could develop and direct a full-length motion picture.

The movie itself is and uproarious hoot.  Goldie Hawn stars in this true story about a women who breaks her husband out of jail to get their son back.  It is one of the best technical low budget movies and such a sincere and fun movie.  One of Spielberg's highly underrated and best.

The DVD doesn't feature much in the way of extra features but the movie on DVD is enough.

Highly recommended.
