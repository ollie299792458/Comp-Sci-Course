I have seen "Intolerance", since the early 1970s, over eight times, and the more I watch it the more amazed I am with this silent classic. For years I considered it the number one of the greatest movie ever made. In it you have social criticism, history, romance, comedy, tragedy [and plenty!] and action. Four different stories are tangled in one another with an recurrent motive of time [the mother with the cradle played by legendary Lillian Gish] goes by. D W Griffith "Intolerance" will influence the cinema in ways he never imagined. Alexander Korda [yes, who produced those British classics like "The Private Lives of Henry VIII" with Charles Laughton in 1933 and "Things to Come" of 1935, plus others] admired this movie and gave him the inspiration to make his own. The same said by Sergei Eisenstein ["Potemkin Battleships" and "Alexander Nevski"] the soviet film director. Also Alfred Hitchcock, DeMille and Michael Curtis never hide their admiration for this classic. With, besides Gish, Mae Marsh, Sheena Owen, Miriam Cooper and Walter Long, plus others, one can call "Intolerance" the "mother" of all movies. And one final comment: before Hitchcock did his many famous cameo roles in his movies [like catching the bus and failing in "North by Northwest"], Griffith did his own as the drunkard being robbed in "The Modern Story".
