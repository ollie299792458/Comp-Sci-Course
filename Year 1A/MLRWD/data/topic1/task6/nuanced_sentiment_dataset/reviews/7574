Touching the Void is an amazing portrayal of a true story of one mans courage to survive. A documentary, but unlike any other I have ever seen, this movie is absolutely brilliant.

The story begins when 2 mountain climbers decide to tackle one of the most difficult peaks in Peru. When Joe slides from a dangerous cliff and is left dangling from the support of his partner climber, Simon is faced with the decision to cut the rope (and lose his friend), or they would both die. Simon's choice leads to Joe's drop down a deep crevace where his leg is broken.

The documentary that follows describes in detail the thought processes between each character. With no special effects, you get the impression that this is not acting - but a camera was there during the actual event. The acting is incredible - and the makeup entirely believable. An amazing portayal of the actual events that happened, Touching the Void manages to capture the heart of human spirit, and the selfishness of survival.

Touching the Void made me laugh, cry, gasp in fear, shake my head in amazement, and mostly realize what it means to be a survivor. I absolutely recommend this movie - it is a completely original documentary, and fantastic to see no Hollywood special effects, beautiful characters and predictable mind sets. Touching the Void is raw, with ragged edges - and exposes parts deep within the human psyche that you must experience for yourself.
