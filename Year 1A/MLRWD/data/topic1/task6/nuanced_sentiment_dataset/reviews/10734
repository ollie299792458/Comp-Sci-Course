This is one of those films where if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.  No suprises, no twists.  Here's the rundown: Girl [Sophie] travels to Italy with her fiancee (who looks eerily like Balki Bartagamousse from the '80's sitcom Perfect Strangers)completely ignores her beause he is obsessed with finding the best wine/cheese/truffles for use in his soon-to-be-opened NYC restaurant.  Girl finds a letter to Juliet written 50 years ago, and commits to helping it's author [Claire, played by Vanessa Redgrave] find her long-lost love (which she does).  Girl fights with Claire's J. Crew modelesque grandson/chaueffer, which means (of course) that the two will fall in love by the film's end (which they do).  There - I just saved you ten bucks.

For a "romantic comedy", it sure was lacking both "comedy" and "romance".  Oddly enough, the older couple [Claire and her reunited love, Lorenzo] had more sizzle than the younger people in the film, who had so little chemistry that you can't even tell that they're falling "in love" (aside from a random kiss in the middle of the flick) until they verbally declare it out of nowhere in the last 10 minutes of the movie.  It's all very predictable and harmless, and I've seen worse films, but this one's nothing to write home about.  It's hard to know who to blame here:  The writers?  Director? Actors?  Maybe a little of each?  In any case, the result is about as exciting as a stale corn tortilla.

I give it two stars because the sceneary [Italian countryside] is absolutely stunning, and having visited Italy, it brought back memories of how beautiful a place it is.  So I guess if you just want a vacation for the eyes, you can watch this film on mute.
