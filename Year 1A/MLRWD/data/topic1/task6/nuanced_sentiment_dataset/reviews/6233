This movie is excellent.  It's insanely fun, funny, has a solid cast, original story and amazing visuals.  It is hard for me to believe I saw the same movie as the critics who mindlessly panned this incredible picture.

First, so Jim Carrey isn't in the movie?  I don't care.  It's time for someone new.  Jamie Kennedy puts in a very good performance as a reluctant dad losing his mind and Alan Cumming is hilarious as Loki, lord of pranks and mischief.  Add to that dead pan artists Steven Wright and Ben Stein.  Thank you for getting those two comics in the same picture.  And the dog in the mask is the funniest dog character I have seen in a movie maybe ever.

Second, in addition to dad in the mask, the dog in the mask and Loki, the baby's stunts in "mask mode" are mind blowingly cool.  Amusing in ways you'd never expect.  And the baby character doesn't fall into the trap of being too cute.  It's like a little demon (mask) baby.  Funny smaller reaction shots mixed in with outrageous, cartoony stunts at the right times.

Third, the story is completely original.  It is not at all a sequel and should not be judged that way.  It stands on its own, but it captures the wild Mask sensibilty wonderfully.  And the struggles between the reluctant dad and baby, the baby and the dog, Loki and Odin all play out like live action cartoons and play off the family theme nicely.

Well worth seeing over and over again for the comedic scenes and awesome visuals.  Incredibly cool movie.  Highly recommend.
