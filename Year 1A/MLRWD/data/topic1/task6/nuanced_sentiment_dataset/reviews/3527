This "film" is a documentary about a recluse who, it was found after his death, wrote a 15,000 page tale, with illustrations. We, the audience, are lead to believe that this tale is a masterpiece, due to the fact that it was created over the course of a lifetime. But what we find is a disjointed, poorly written child's story that could have been less than 100 pages.

The novel was the only outlet for the author, a fanatically religious man with a terrible childhood. We learn throughout the documentary that the man, Darger, was a quiet man who took all his personal troubles throughout his days, and spilled them out onto the pages of his story at night. It works better as a personal journal into Darger's own mind than as a work of fiction. Many of the characters are named after people he had known (his impression of them is evident as to whether the character is good or bad), and some situations were directly related to his own quarrels with faith.

The only thing of true interest here is examining his illustrations, and Jessica Yu's animations (using the illustrations). I can say many things about his writing, but his paintings/sketches/cut and pastings are wonderful. The rest of the "importance" that this film claims to have is forced, to the point that I almost felt I was being preached to.
