This many-layered interpretation of Robin Hood is almost Shakespearean in presentation:  the fern-encrusted merry men are a treasure, as is Little John's wife.  Although Kevin Cosner is miscast as Robin Hood and Little John's performance is rather flat (the two from whom one might have expected the most magnetism), the other performances make this movie so worthwhile and, in a sense, innovative.  Azeem (Morgan Freeman) is a constructive element of expansion of the tale to a broader world-wide perspective (albeit anachronistically trite at times).  Strong and spunky Maid Marian (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) is a more real and believable character than in her traditional damsel-in-distress function.  The real gem here, though, is Alan Rickman's and the screenwriter's interpretation of the Sheriff of Nottingham as a tragic-comic villain.  It is worth purchasing the movie just for that.  And you can't miss Sean Connery as the returning King Richard.  This movie is too dark and violent for children (unlike other Robin Hood versions).
