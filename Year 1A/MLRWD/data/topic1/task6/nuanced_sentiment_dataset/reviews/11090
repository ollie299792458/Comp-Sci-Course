I was a bit skeptical when I rented this movie. I thought it might be another left-leaning, Hollywood preach-fest. Actually, it turned out to be better than that. But I thought I would take a chance because I really like Kevin Costner's movies.

Costner was good and Madeline Carroll (who plays the daughter) was terrific. Grammer and Hopper played dim-witted characters, but were good.  The implausible script even draws one in. The issues addressed in the film were pretty balanced and not too stereotypical of Democrats and Republicans.

Here's where I had a problem: the entire supporting cast who are playing themselves, as political pundits, were significant or well-known far left ideologues. None from the right. No balance, to really make the film take on added realism. The producer's and director's bias came through here. If you doubt this, consider the following appearances: Campbell Brown, Arianna Huffington, James Carville, and Larry King. And then there were Bill Maher and Chris Matthews, who had a running part throughout the movie as the person who brings the news to the audience. Wow, that's a stretch!

Anyway, rent it and be ready for a fun and escapist movie that starts to open up the sore that we call politics. It also has some good performances. But don't expect it to come off as something that really reflects middle America (except for the location).
