This is incredible! I know it may just be the child or age but my baby girl isn't even 2 yet and knows her numbers, all her alphabet and the letter sounds. I had purchased this video through scholastic few years back for my older sons one was having trouble reading in second grade, the other child I just wanted to get a bit of help through kindergarten. (He by the way is reading now and its the end of the year in K). Well, my daughter Lizzie found this (to me very boaring dvd)exciting and asked for it all day long!! She was so upset when I just couldn't tollerated it any more and turned it off. One day a week, maybe 2 after her first viewing of this DVD, I was reading my own book and she came up and sat by me and pointed to a word (in my book) and said "it" mama, that word is "it"! Sure enough after going through a few books, she was reading every word from the sight word DVD! Not only that she was trying (and sometimes succeding) at sounding out other words. I am so amazed! My baby is reading small beginner books and isn't even 2 till June 13th! I'm not a freak who spends all day with flash cards pushing this stuff on their kid, I am a regular average house, well stay at home mommy. I don't let my kid watch tv all day either I am choosie about what all my kids watch. Sometimes you do need to put them down in front of the set, when you have older kids its nearly unavoidable. If you have time to watch w them of course they love it, if not I just don't see the harm of this type of education.  My kid seems to like this dvd more than Dora and Pet pets (Wonder Pets). I am going to buy the other sight word Dvds today and give them to her for her birthday (if I can wait that long. I don't think I would have ever tried it on a child so young, but I am absolutely amazed!
