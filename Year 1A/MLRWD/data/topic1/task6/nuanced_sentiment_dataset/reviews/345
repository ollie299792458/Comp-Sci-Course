Charlie is depressed about how materialistic Christmas is. Lucy makes him the director of the play to cheer him up, but he is soon depressed that no one will listen to him because they are busy having fun and he isn't.  He proceeds to get a bad tree and then is depressed, and surprised for some reason, when no one likes it.  Linus tells everyone the real meaning of Christmas (only redeeming quality in the movie). Charlie goes home and tries to spruce up his tree but it doesn't work mainly because he doesn't really try very hard anyway.  Everyone uses Snoopy's decorations stripped from his doghouse, that he worked very hard on, to finally fix Charlie Brown's tree just to make him happy. The entire movie is about Charlie Brown putting forth this vibe that he is entitled to be happy, and everyone must fall over backwards to make his Christmas a happy one not caring who he steps on in order to get there.

Vince makes some great music though, and is the main reason for the second star.
