i rented this movie because we were bored. i read the list of cast members and should have known i wouldn't like it; all-star casts are usually not a good thing; they have too much attached to them already. anyway, the cast includes: jennifer jason leigh (co-writer, co-director), gwenyth paltrow, kevin kline, parker posey, jennifer beals, alan cumming (co-writer, co-director), and others. the fact the the writers/directers are also the main characters makes it entirely egocentric.  the plot is a little too woody allen-esque with all the rich actor/actress/painter/intellectual types who have mid-life problems and talk about it over white wine. the absolute worst part of the film was that midway through, everyone at the party drops a hit of Ecstacy (brought to the party by Gwenyth) and supposedly they are all "rolling". however, after about 2 minutes of the lovey-dovey-happy time generally associated with the drug, suddenly there are fights and tears and crying and lots of not-happy things that generally do not occur when people are rolling on ecstacy. people on E usually don't get angry and yell at their husbands, or feel jealousy and call their neighbor a whore. t hey also didn't portray  any of the obvious physical symptoms of people on E.  it was not realistic at all, and that element of the film should have just been taken out. i could see other elements of the film that were very good, brilliant moments, but the pace of the film, the amount of screaming  and overacting that j.j. leigh did, and the overall tone were just horrible. the characters were flat, and there were too many of them. there you go.
