On paper J-Day 2004 certainly looks like one of the weakest PPV's of the year but some of the matches were actually decent. But for all the positives about this event, there are thousands of negatives.

1. RVD & Rey Mysterio vs. Dudley Boyz...I love the Dudleyz new heel act. It works perfect for them. This match was great but RVD & Rey had to carry Bubba & D-Von to a good match. Match of the night. RVD & Rey win. 3/5

2. Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie...This was a joke. Why have Torrie defeat Dawn again? And the only real drama about this was Kurt Angle making a stipulation where if Torrie lost she would be fired. Torrie wins. 0/5

3. Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Mordecai...Worst match of the night. Mordecai has a good entrance but his ring skills are lacking. Scotty is completely worthless. Mordecai wins. 0/5

4. WWE Tag Team Championship: Billy Gunn & Hardcore Holly vs. Rico & Charlie Haas...Rico is a riot! This match didnt sell but the finish was hilarious. Rico & Charlie retain. 1.5/5

5. WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Jacqueline vs. Chavo Guerrero..."Chavo will have one arm tied behind him." What a joke. This one sucked to say the least. Chavo wins the title. 0/5

6. WWE United States Championship: John Cena vs. Rene Dupree...Best eight-minute match you'll ever see. Rene was looking a little green in this match. Cena retains. 2/5

7. Undertaker vs. Booker T...This match stunk up the joint. Booker came out looking very bad as did Taker. Taker wins. 0.5/5

8. WWE Championship: John Bradshaw Layfield vs. Eddie Guerrero...Pretty good considering who was in it. The sick blade job by Eddie is the worst I've ever seen. That JBL chair shot was the hardest I think in a long while. JBL wins by DQ. 1.5/5

Overall I'm giving this event 1/5 stars. Thanks mainly to the opener, Cena-Dupree and Eddie efforts in his match. The blade job gets 0.25 stars.
