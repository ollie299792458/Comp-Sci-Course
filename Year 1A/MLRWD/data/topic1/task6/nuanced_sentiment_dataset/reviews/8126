I was a fan of the original TV series when the A&amp;E network aired it back in the early 1990's.  I waited with much anticapation when I started to see photos of the film.  Then came the trailer.  WOW!  I couldn't wait  to see the film.  But to find out that the folks at Warner Bros. didn't let  advanced sneak peek for critics to see this, you knew something was wrong.  So there I was waiting to see this and found out how horrible the reviews  were.  When I finally saw the movie I thought scenes were missing.  What  does this mean?  We were jipped!  False advertising from the WB!  The  movie to my mind is OK, but all the missing scenes were in the darn  trailer!  There were really absurd moments (the Teddy Bears were the  funniest to the audience at the theater).  I thought the worst was the lack  of explanation for Bad Emma.  How did she come to be?  The original Steed,  Patrick Macnee reduced to being invisible?  It'd been great to see the two  Steeds side by side.  Uma was OK but sure looked uncomfortable doing a  British accent.  She looked great in the leather outfit though!  Ralph as  Steed I thought was the best acting in film.  Seemed a more silent, maybe  dark Steed?  Connery as the villain was OK but his objections should've  been more realistic.  The Alice character seemed to me the highlight of  this film for something that worked.  The movie did seem to be a combined  mixture of a couple Avenger episodes. But to adapt it as the 1960's was  wrong. They should've put it into the 1990's.  The movie is OK and for that  it ain't so bad.  The missing scenes are needed.  Mrs Peel, we're needed to  find the complete film print edition!
