In tribute to how bad this movie was, I didn't laugh for the first half hour. In another tribute to how bad this movie was, not even the outtakes were funny. In traditional style Jim Carry parades across the screen with his brand of humor. What's intriguing about this movie is how his character and natural ability would bring out the humor when combined with the power of God. Yes, it's an indulgence surely common to all humans. That 'WhatIf' of life, what if I had the power to do this, to create that... and on a level Bruce Almighty suceeds in that arena, succesfully drawing on some emotion and creating the conundrum in that simply being endowed with power in and of itself does not connote wisdom or the ability to solve the problems of the world. This is illustrated well in the movie and comes off only slightly preachy, which I don't mind considering the heady material being covered anytime one approaches a subject like what is it to be God. But that's where this movie gets you; it doesn't know whether to be a drama or a comedy. Uncomfortably tense moments only midly soothed by comedic highlights and the worst part is that the funniest bits of this movie only occur because of the God power, not because of any great part of Jim Carry or the horrible writing behind this script. It's almost as if every gag has to be followed up be outrageous humor in order to 'make' the gag itself funny. Potentially a great movie, it is marred by a bad script, a lack of focus and direction, and a lack of the genuine touch of the 'divine spark'.
