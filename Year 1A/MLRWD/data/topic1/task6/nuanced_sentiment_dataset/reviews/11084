This title has so many problems I really marvel at it.  The Firm usually puts out very high quality videos, but what were they thinking with this one?  The first thing you will notice is that the instructor is actually nervous.  Her introduction is awkward and stiff, and she maintains that for most of the video.  Second, why oh why does the camera not just stay in front of the group so that you can see what everyone is doing the whole time??!!  You will see the beginner modifier so often you'll want to throw a shoe at your tv.  And the camera will cut away from the instructor at the WORST times...she'll say (for the nth time) "Beginners follow Sue Mi", the camera will cut to the other girl, and then the instructor will call out a modifier for the advanced folks.  Guess where the camera stays!  On Sue Mi.  And there are many times that moves are switched up and they are only showing the top half of the instructor.  Very frustrating.  Also, the workout is divided into sections in a way that is just dumb.  The sections are labeled "Cardio" or "Plyo", etc. but it is essentially the same stuff over and over again.  I mean, when you see a title "Plyometrics 1" you expect to do some heart pumping jumping around.  But no.  And the music?  It couldn't get more uninspiring.  Even given all of that, I would keep this workout if it were even remotely fun.  But it isn't.  It's boring.  I couldn't get all the way through it.  So really all my review needs to say is this:  Poorly made and boring.
