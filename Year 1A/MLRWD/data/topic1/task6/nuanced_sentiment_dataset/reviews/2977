I Respect Will Smith&He is a Money Machine in HollyWood with His Overall Track-Record.but Muhammad Ali is something Special to Me that you gotta bring so much to.I Knew a Film that only captured 10 years couldn't possbily be able to fully tell.I think Spike Lee would have done wonders for this film.this film was long&Boring in many spots.too slick for it's own good.Will Smith did a Technical  good Job but The RawNess&Soul were missing&it hurts his overall presentation to me.we needed more Flaw&Edge&it wasn't there.thinking back to last September&the Oscars if Will&Mann had have truly captured this film right then they would have canceled Denzel&Russell out at the Oscars.because Muhammad Ali is more than a Sports Figure: He also Represents the Power of America&Strength to Transcend so Much.And Ali dealt with alot&it wasn't so not long ago He was Hated.this film made Jamie Foxx seem like a Alright Actor.and that takes alot of Work.Jon Vought didn't measure up to me as Howard Cosell.ALI to Me deserves a Week Long Mini-Series.there is alot of Bases to Cover.and only 10 years&side stepping over things doesn't do it full Justice.Will&Mann should have taken a Cue from Spike Lee when he did Malcolm X: Spike got it Right.
