On the positive side, the color and clarity of the movie are good for a older movie, almost not seeming old at all in that way. Ava Gardner looks gorgeous.

I read all the glowing reviews of this movie here before buying it, but I was dissappointed in it. I was bored by the predictable arc of the story, the cartoonish stereotypical characters (the evil abusive millionaire, the sweaty faced agent), and the long drawn out conversations which could have been edited down 80% without losing much. The entire story is improbable and not in any way adequately developed - a bar dancer suddenly becoming a huge star, yet we never see her dance in the bar, and never see her act in her "movie".

Garnder is not convincing in her role at all, especially with the fake spanish accent. She is beautiful but she lacks the pizaz and confidence of a Monroe, Taylor, or Bardot. I am no fan of Bogart but he comes across as decent uncle-like figure - which Ava ascertains by talking to him for 60 seconds after he barges into her room as a stranger. But he is so terribly miscast as a filmmaker, that I could never really even accept it. The big scene with the agent on the phone is such an obvious acting job of the actor yelling to the audience its painful to watch. There is nothing genuine in any way about this movie's story or the characters playing it.

To me the only value in it, is in a specimen of early 50's Hollywood. If you like old movies then fine. But this is not up to snuff by modern standards at all. I find myself wondering why there are shadows on every wall in an interior room and hair always lit (due to the multiple stage lights used for filming). Its also amusing to see the subtle sexism (e.g. the ease in which men put their hands on Gardner and talk to her like a child). The only curiosity is the strangely anti-mother twist to it. By the way what is a "bent kopec"?
