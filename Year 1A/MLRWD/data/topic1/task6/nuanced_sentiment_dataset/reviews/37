Amazon's editorial review as well as the 25 reviews attached to this product are about Jonathan Miller's 1966 version of Alice.
Regrettably Jonathan Miller's Alice is not even included in this DVD set.
The Amazon ad also indicated that there are 2 pieces.  There are not - there is only one disc (the DVD packaging says "2-Disc Collection (1 Dual-Layer DVD)"  Not cool.

About the product you actually get:
The 52 minute silent film is a good addition to your collection if you must have all things Alice.  It is well done, for a 1915 silent film, and manages to covey enough of the book to not disappoint.

The 2 10 minute cartoons have nothing to do with Alice In Wonderland.  They just happen to have a character named Alice.

Same with the 50 minute cartoon.  (Spoilers ahead) A girl named Alice happens to mention Alice in Wonderland, a mouse shrinks her and they go to Paris.  There are mouse stories and 2 Madeleine stories.  But no Alice in Wonderland.

The final item really is the 1972 Fiona Fulleton version of Alice.  Unfortunately the quality is terrible.  As though it was recorded from an analog TV signal to a VHS tape and then dubbed to a DVD.  If you liked that version, buy the solo DVD that Amazon sells.  I bought it at Amazon and it is a much better quality (and a good film).

So buy this DVD if $10 for a 52 minute silent film is a worthwhile purchase.  Otherwise give this a pass.
