Catch .44 is a crime film about three women sent to a diner to intercept a drug deal. However, it doesn't work out as planned, to say the least. The movie is shot in a very similar way to Reservoir Dogs, with the present chaos taking place amidst a series of flashbacks leading up to it. It's clear that the writer and director Aaron Harvey took a very large cue from Quentin Tarantino, from the aforementioned shooting style to the stories and jokes that the characters tell, to the way the characters are introduced (actually a little more like Guy Ritchie, with freezing the shot to spell the characters' names). Unfortunately the movie is not as entertaining as the films that either of those directors tend to make. The dialogue, while it tries to be clever, tends to fall flat and isn't as funny as it's trying to be. It's an admirable effort, but isn't convincing and the opening diner dialogue in particular not only doesn't really make much sense, but is not helped by the terrible acting in it. The acting is better elsewhere in the film, but not so much here. The cast is good and it's a shame that it's spoiled on fairly lackluster material. Forest Whitaker in particular is pretty good, mainly because he changes accents pretty much every scene and keeps throwing you off guard. Since the movie only takes place in like 4-5 different places, the production costs were probably pretty low, though the violence is well done if that's what you're hoping for. The music is one of the best parts, and is used primarily as source cues such that the music is supposed to be playing in the scene itself, not just overlaid over everything else. All in all the movie is entertaining, but fairly predictable because we kind of start to expect as the movie goes on that not everybody will be making it out alive. Worth watching if you see it on Netflix or something.
