Where to begin?  Either it was awful editing or Fuller chose not to hire a script supervisor.  The poor cuts distract the viewer--choosing great performance over continuity can work once or twice, but throughout the entire film?  Not deriding the interesting characters, the narrative is just ridiculous.  Why would the case matter so much for one journalist to loose his marbles--for the Pulitzer Prize?  The premise is a joke.  And it has nothing to do with the film being dated.  Even when it was first released it must have been greeted with sardonic chuckles.  The first time I watched this film, I was really impressed with it, but after watching it a second, third time, I don't know what it was that made me like the film in the first place.  If you recommend "Shock Corridor" to a friend, you can bet he or she won't like it.  "Shock Corridor" is a film that finds you and not the other way around.  I happened to come across it channel surfing.  Sam Fuller is a little bit overrated.  "House of Bamboo," "Pickup on South Street" and "Steel Helmet" are your best Fuller films.  "Big Red One" is not too bad, either.  The rest are boring.
