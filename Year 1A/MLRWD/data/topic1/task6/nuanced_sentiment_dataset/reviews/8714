Malick knows how to make a great movie.  One step, a wonderful script with an interesting, likable, or hateable (likable) character.  His script is fantastic and this leads to a smart, almost surreal look into the lives of two young lovers, ten years separating them on the run.  Second step, present a fantastic and beautiful visual world--Malick is the best at. BADLANDS, is a psychological journey into the mind of an unknown sociopath played perfectly by Martin Sheen--man could he act.  Malick of course, in all of his movies never makes judgements against Kit but he does introduce voice over or dialogue where Kit makes a few judgements of himself.  I think one of the best moments of the whole movie is at the end when Kit looks over at Holly lovingly and says, "I'm sorry about your dad."  This is where it all began and has ended with the same sentiment.  What a gift of storytelling from one of the greatest directors of all time.
BADLANDS, similar to Kazan's A FACE IN THE CROWD deals with the bizarre concept of the celebrity which is maybe a reason why Malick is so recluse.  Here's to Terrence Malick, a scholar, a storyteller, and a visionary.
