If ever a DVD needed the painstaking care of a Criterion Collection-style makeover, then this classic Selznick production is it. The combination of Ben Hecht's verbal zingers, William Wellman's visual gags, and Oscar Levant's majestic score demand a better airing than the abominably scratchy public-domain copies now available from many independent distributors.

As to the film itself, "Nothing Sacred" is a marvellous newspaper satire that skewers every golden idol in the books. Carole Lombard stars as Hazel Flagg, the "doomed heroine" who fakes radium poisoning and takes the citizens of 1937 New York for a ride. Fredric March plays the ace reporter who socks her in the jaw before being smitten himself. The supporting cast is a Who's Who of the screwball-comedy genre: Walter Connolly appears as newspaper editor Oliver Stone, Charles Winnegar is Hazel's dipso father, and in a surprisingly humorous cameo, Margaret Hamilton steals one scene by simply rocking back and forth in an old chair, barking "Yep" or "Nope."

Critics used to label such films as hard-boiled. But by today's standards, there's heavy armor surrounding that yolk -- a reporter's leg is bitten by a growling boy on all fours, a newspaper containing sentimental poetry is used to wrap fish, and a mournful photo of the poisoning victim is displayed over a deli sign advertising "all kinds of cheese and bologna." Will someone please re-master this gem?
