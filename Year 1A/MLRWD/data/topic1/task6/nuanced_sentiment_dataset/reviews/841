Honestly I should have known better than to watch this movie.

The two leading actors (Jack Black and Michael Cera) seem to act the same in every movie. Don't get me wrong if you are good at something and your fans love it then by all means keep at it. The only thing about their acting is its the same every time, one movie after another. The saying too much of a good thing holds true. I mean, when you eat a handful of BBQ chips they are great, but when you are eating one after another they start to taste a bit weird and not so appetizing.

With Black we got to see something different back in 2005 and it was great but then he went right back into his typecast characters and hasn't let up yet. Even when voice acting in kids movies he give a similar performance.

I can sum this movie up with a few words: farts, innuendo, talentless.

I'm only giving this movie two stars because there are a couple of actors that give a decent performance. Overall though this movie should be buried and never viewed again.
