On Sunday 9/2/12 I went to see the much talked about movie 2016 Obama's America. It was not a bad film, but D'Souza dwelt far too much on his Indian heritage, anti-colonialism and a loose tie to Obama sending the Churchill bust back to Britain! The big C we need to be concerned about is NOT Colonialism but Communism!I would give D'Souza an "A" for overall production however, a C- for any content that would reveal who Obama really is and the true Nature of his agenda. The one message the film did get right was the ending of a destroyed America.

I just watched the DVD Dreams From My Real Father Directed by Joel Gilbert. I give the film an "A+" for content! Only one word separates the Gilbert film from the most explosive truth imaginable -- "Unknown" -- the alleged father identity on Obama's supposed Hawaiian birth certificate. This would answer the much discussed question of concealment and the reason for the fake certificate issued on the White House website. Believe me, Dreams From My Real Father pulls ALL the dots together with only this one last dot to bring down the whole house of cards. THIS is the film that points the way, and if that dot is found -- Game Over!
