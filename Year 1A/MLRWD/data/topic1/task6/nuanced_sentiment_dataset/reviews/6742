This starts out as a cool little movie well acted well scripted with something eccentric on the periferies.
I say its dangerous because it turns ethical behaviour on its head and sets it on a tight-rope .If its good if its bad. Does it allow for neither if people are more complex than they appear.? Seeing as there are a whole load of people without a lot of intellectual equipment out there its the kind of film that would set them on the slippery slope of ethical unhingement. ?Luckily this is an unusual film  and its dangerous slippery subtlety is a one-off.

Its up there as a five star film but two stars for condoning animal abuse in Nate and for an irresponsible take on wether its right for the abused to turn abuser with Erica This lack of ethics seems exploitive on part of the film makers

People seem cool and ikeable and like themselves. Hell we like em too. Terrifying what they don't see about themselves and before sayiing its justified revenge at the end don't forget he missed the inside story on venereal disease.
