I have been searching nearly 25 years for a copy of The Trial of Billy Jack. So, I immediately purchased this collection the moment I saw it.  As soon as it arrived, I put The Trial of Billy Jack in my DVD player and sat for nearly three hours in front of my T.V.  When it was over, I nearly cried.  The movie that I had spent a big part of my life waiting in anticipation to watch was a piece of garbage.  First, it is way too long.  It should have been cut down to about a two hour run time.  It is overly preachy.  I became very agitated with Delores Taylor's constant sermoninzing about society's ills.  But, my biggest complaint is Billy Jack's journey into the Cave of the Dead.  Billy Jack meets his spirit guide, who looks like a member of the Blue Man Group.  The film Billy Jack, in my opinion, is a 70's masterpiece.  How Tom Laughlin and Delores Taylor dropped the ball with this sequel will remain a great mystery to me.  My only other complaint about this collection is the audio.  They have remastered it for 5.1 surround and it is an atrocious mix.  Most of the dialogue is inaudible, but the music and sound effects are so loud they nearly bust your speakers.
