I can say that the movie focuses more on plot and details then it does scariness, but don't get me wrong, this movie had one point where it startled my mom who has been watching horror movies since she was young and never got startled like that in the past 10 years (the only other thing that scared her was "The Shining" when she was young).  The movie itself had a plot that branched out from the original, but still retained the original content to an extent.  I can say that if it wasn't for plot and details, they could have added in more scary moments, more thrills and still keep it to where the characters would just so that the audience can pick and choose their favorites.  The scary moments are really scary when it comes down to it, but I wasn't expecting that much gore from a movie that's more about scary than gory.  The ending was extremely predictable so I wasn't really expecting too much from the ending (There generally are 1-2 survivors in American remakes, whereas Japanese horror there's no stopping the force and therefore generally no survivors).  Other then that the movie was pretty good.  The only reason I emphasis the plot and details is because the movie has basically 8-12 scary moments, which is good for a movie, but left me and anyone else I was watching it with crave for more.  Just as a quick summary of what I said; Originals = Good, Remakes = not as good; too much plot and details to be perfectly scary, but is still pretty scary when looking at the whole thing; too typical of a movie ending (survivors, but only to an extent do they survive) to give 5/5 stars, but is too good for a 3/5 stars.
