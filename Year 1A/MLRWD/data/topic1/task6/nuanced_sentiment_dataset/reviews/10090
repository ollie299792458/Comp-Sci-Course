At one point in this film, an heiress to the A & P grocery store fortune discusses what she wants to do with her life. She mentions that she would like to give her money to the homeless. Then she laughs. Funny joke. This seems to be the tenor of the film, whether or not it means to be. Most of these rich kids seem to see life as an attempt to find a diversion. Career? Not if I can't go out at night. Marriage? Only if I can find someone to sign a prenup. Certainly, a couple of the interviewees elicit a genuine pathos, especially the one who, after discussing his work in an oil field, talks about deriving meaning in his life from work (gasp!) However, since the filmmaker is himself an heir to the Johnson and Johnson fortune, it is hard to get outside of the ulra-rich milieu. He tries to do so, but his subjects won't allow him to go far. What makes the film so annoying is that these rich kids can't see their difficulties as human difficulties which every person encounters: what do I do with my life? how do I give it meaning? Instead, they see their difficulties as especially taxing because they are so rare. They seem to be saying, "Nobody realizes how hard it is being rich." Sure, I understand money doesn't solve problems. In fact, often mo money = mo problems. But too many of these people have no insight to the struggles of the unwashed masses, and we ultimately end up resenting these rich kids who live up to the stereotype of oblivious, arrogant children of privilege.
