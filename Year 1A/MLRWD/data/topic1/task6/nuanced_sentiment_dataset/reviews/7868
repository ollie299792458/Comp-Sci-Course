The Decoy Bride stars Kelly MacDonald and David Tennant and they are far more talented than this trite little film allows them to be. First the script, which, according to the "Making Of" had been around for a few years before it finally was green lighted for production. Sadly, it seems as if no one had bothered to read, revise or edit the script so the continuity was lacking, as was character development and in a movie where characters are the key, that is crucial.At 89 minutes, it felt hacked in the editing which may have been necessary to cut out the worst parts. As in all Brit-Com Rom-com movies the hero,or heroine in this case, goes through trying situations that bring clarity and relief when the right people get together. In The Decoy Bride, the relief comes when the end credits roll. True, MacDonald and Tennant do show show some truly funny bits, but you can see them all in the trailer. In watching the "Making Of" it looked more like these fine actors did the film out of a sense of obligation to past due debts. The show must go on, and all that. Sadly the material was not up to it. I can hardly wait to see them in a real movie.
