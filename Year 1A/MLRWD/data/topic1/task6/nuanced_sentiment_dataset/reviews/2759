What a waste of my $1.99!  I went to blockbuster to rent this flick, hoping that it would fill my horror expectations.  After watching it, I am in complete shock that this film has received so many recommendations from horror movie fans, I'm not longer going to rely on online reviews to help me decide which movies to watch.  Firstly, it's not even biographical.  The real Henry met Otis in a Florida soup kitchen where they both worked...among other things.  
I don't really mind the inaccuracy of the film as long as the film itself is unique and presents a solid story.  Actually, I did not expect the film to be in-line with the real Henry, based on what I've read about the flick.  The movie itself contains no originality, nothing innovative.  It's like watching a bland 80's home video of Homeless looking people.  This film could have been made by anyone.  The writing is poor, the acting is moderate on a B movie level, and the general meaning of it is unoriginal.  Some of the things that people like about this film are so easy to think of, the backdrops of Chicago's slum filled streets for example.
The only reason the makers of the film named the movie "Henry" and used other elements that are similar to the real life Henry lee lucas and Co., is to sell a few more copies of the film.  Without the Henry Lucas connection(if you can even find much of a connection aside from the names of the characters)no one would even be talking about this flick.
