The first season of Glee is one of those wonderful discoveries: a show that cleverly written and produced, that showcases some really great talent.

My rating loses a star not for the show, but for Fox's Blu-ray mastering. The Blu-ray discs take an unreasonable amount of time to load -- about 2 minutes on my player -- and selecting each show or bonus feature brings an additional wait time of about 30 seconds before the presentation begins. I have some slow-loading Blu-rays in my collection, but this one is excruciatingly painful to wait for.

The bonus features are interesting, but somewhat anemic. Many of them have been available on the Internet previous to the video release, and the ones that are new are fairly short and don't provide much detail. Strangely, Matthew Morrison, who plays the lead character of Will Schuester, doesn't appear in any of the bonus material. More information about the show's origins and the actors' CVs would have been nice, considering the size and scope of the Blu-ray set.

Get Glee on video, but my recommendation is that you save yourself the money and aggravation and buy the DVD set.
