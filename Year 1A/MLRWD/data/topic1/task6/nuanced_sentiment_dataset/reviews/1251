Like others here, I was disappointed to find that neither film was presented in the letterbox format despite the claim on the box, so I sent an e-mail to WHV to complain about it. I was told that they would replace what I had with two DVDs covering the individual titles once they received it from me in the mail. I thanked them and suggested they keep the product off the market since the letterboxing mentioned on the cover was incredibly misleading. Shortly after I received the two DVDs, I discovered that "The Secret Garden" and "A Little Princess" had been available in a similar double-feature set but presented on TWO discs instead of one. Apparently some genius in Warner's marketing department came up with the idea of saving money by reducing the two DVDs down to one but neglecting to take into consideration that a format would have to be sacrificed in the process. They just kept the text from the original set's packaging, which is pretty damn lame if you ask me. And to make matters worse, I still see this thing being sold in large quantities at Safeway and Target stores as well as here on Amazon even though WHV obviously know they've got what I consider to be unmarketable merchandise on their hands. At least Amazon lets you know that you're getting the fullscreen format with this one.
