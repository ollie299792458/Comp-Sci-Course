Ginger Snaps isn't the typical werewolf film, and it avoids the usual teen girl and werewolf movie cliches. The movie for the most part is excellent, though towards the end of the film when they were getting tight on time and budget scenes tend to jump around a bit. If you're just looking for straight up horror Ginger Snaps might not be the right film for you, it focuses more on the human side of werewolves and entertains more than it shocks. The story and the two lead actresses (Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins) are what make this movie great.

The US release of the DVD is pretty bare bones and only comes with the trailer as a special feature, but the Canadian edition has a commentary track and a ton of deleted scenes. One complaint I've noticed a few reviews is that the movie has a constant orange tint to it, they blamed it on the use of an orange lens in the camera that was used to film the movie... having seen the movie a few times on TV (IFC) I have to debunk this, the version played on television has absolutely no orange tint and the colors are great. I'm assuming that the orange tint must be due to a poor transfer or something, I own both the American re-release and the Canadian box set and the orange tint is way worse on the American release.
