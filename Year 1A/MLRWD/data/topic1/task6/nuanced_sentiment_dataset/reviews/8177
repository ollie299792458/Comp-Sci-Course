Are you looking for a hilarious movie? Slapstick comedy at every turn? Do you want to die on the floor laughing so hard? If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, let me tell you... this isn't that movie. The same type of jokes are repeated throughout the whole movie, and they weren't even funny the first time. The acting was horrible. The plot? A young black man gets injured on an airplane during his flight and is awarded $100,000,000, so he starts his own airline called... Soul Plane. The rest of the movie is just guys looking at girls' butts, hitting on them. It almost resembles a rap video, but take a three minute video and turn it into an hour and a half. There is the loud music club scene throughout the whole movie (yes, there is a CLUB on the plane) and, of course, a LOT of shapely girls " shakin' their thang" right in front of the camera. There are the drug use references, mostly done by Snoop Dogg, which got tiresome after the FIRST fifteen times he made them. Honestly, 'Soul Plane' should have never taken off.
