I loved this movie when I saw it in the theatures.  In fact, I saw it more than once I enjoyed it so much. I even bought the music CD right after I saw the movie.
The performances by both Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are multilayered, the support cast is superb and the characters are written so that the actors have substance to build their own characterizations.  Exceedingly rich exchange of emotions as the two actresses "make the switch"... I found myself loving BOTH of them and completely believing their performances from start to finish.
Mark Harmon plays "The Almost-Step-Dad" role perfectly as well: very realistic and human, not sappy at all.
If you are purchasing the DVD strictly for the movie, by all means.... Do so and love the movie.  I was disappointed in the bonuses, however.  When I enjoy a movie this much, especially because my children and I could enjoy it equally, I really look forward to the bonuses.  They were, in my estimation, worthy of about a two star rating.
Get the CD and watch the movie itself.  Briefly check out the Bonuses and see if you make them to be worth more than two stars.
