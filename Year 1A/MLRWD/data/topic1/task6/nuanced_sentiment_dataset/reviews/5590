In my opinion, I believe that First Contact has by far been one of the BEST Trek flicks to date, from the beginning as the camera zoomed out of Picard's eye to show the vast Borg cube he was in when he was assimilated, to the end where the Vulcan got spooked by "Ooby Dooby." It has a serious tone, but we also get a glimpse at the past, to see what made the Star Trek universe what it is now (in the 24th century that is).
Even though the mood was dark, enhanced by great music conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, and also some from his son Joel, it had its elements of humor as well.
By far, the best scene in the entire movie would have to be where Riker finds Troi totally wasted at the bar: "Timeline? This is no time to argue about time, we don't have the time! *long pause* What was I saying?" and after Riker confronted her, she was adamant. "I'm not drunk! It's a primitive culture...I am just trying to *blend in.*" Riker's reply and Troi passing out at the table...I fall out of my chair laughing every time I watch it...sometimes I pop in the DVD just to watch that one scene, its that good!
I do have to admit, I did not really like to see Cochrane portrayed as a drunk...but then if he did not do all that drinking, we would have missed Geordi's response to his "I have got to take a leak." Another great scene!
All in all, a great flick, and I also love the fact I get to see the trailers for the movie again...they give me goose bumps. Though I found it real funny in the theatrical trailer, they had quick clips from the last TNG episode "All Good Things...", "Best of Both Worlds", Star Trek: Generations, and there is even a snippet of VOYAGER firing phasers at a Borg cube!!! What was up with that one? *shrug* Oh well.  Its worth the money for any die-hard fan.
