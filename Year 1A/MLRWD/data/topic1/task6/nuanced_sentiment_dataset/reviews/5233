The story shows the conflict Christians college students often face- how to respond to those who think Christians reject science and just blindly believe the "fairy tale" story of the creation in the book of Genesis.  The conflict is real, many assumptions about Christians are not.  There is an attempted scientific (very long) explanation given in the film as to how both the idea of creation involving evolution and millions of years can be reconciled with a six day belief in creation.  Just use time dialation and, voila, everyone now agrees, the students and teachers are now reconciled in belief, and everyone is happy.  The problem is that in reality that explanation can't resolve the conflict. There are bigger issues than just the time it took for the world we know to come about.  According to the Bible, death and evil entered the world as a consequence of Adam and Eve's sin against God.  That is the whole point of the Bible message of God providing a saviour.  If, as the movie's explanation says, evolution was true, then death entered before Adam and Eve showed up and therefore wasn't a consequence of sin and thus there's no need for a saviour to conquer sin and death.  There are several inconsistencies of thought elsewhere throughout the film.  There were a few insightful elements in the film that demonstrate the nature of mankind.  The film was valuable as a discussion of logical thought processes and how they are often violated. I do appreciate though the attempt to portray Christians as thoughtful, intelligent people.  There really are excellent Christian scientists.
