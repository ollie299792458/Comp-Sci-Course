I don't usually do reviews since I'm not into writing soliloquies, but I feel I must say a few words about this DVD for those who have not seen this movie and are considering purchasing it.
Yes it is a good horror film in terms of lots of action, blood, and a good pace, although no surprise that Hannibal is going to get the bad guy (pretty gruesomly) in the end.  But the movie is so preoccupied with shocking you that is distracts itself from any meaninful plot/character development.  I bought this movie because I wanted to know more about Clarice and Hannibal and what I got was just gore.  In the original, the violence had a purpose but this sequel's purpose appears to really just be trying to one-up the shock value of blood &amp; guts in the original.
I actually felt ill after watching this movie, and I am not at all the squeamish type (I watch thriller/horror movies all the time).  To many, my saying that will just make them want to go out and watch/buy it.  Which is fine for people who want this kind of entertainment.  Myself, I go more for the thriller/mystery type and love how the original challenged our views of what we think of as "barbaric" and "civilized" in our society.  Violence is okay if it has a purpose in driving the story.
If you're looking for more of the movie I was, you will NOT like this movie.
