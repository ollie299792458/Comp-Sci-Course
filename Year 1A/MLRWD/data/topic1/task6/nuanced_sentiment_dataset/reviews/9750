This movie was really eye opening about the realities of the human slave trade which is a real evil that exists in today's world.  It makes you feel compassion towards those who are caught up in this as slaves, and anger for the injustices of those who are motivated by greed to sell another human life which they have no right to do.  I pray for these people caught in this evil industry to be set free.. for God to raise up men and women to stand up for righteousness, speaking out against these atrocities, and those with the power to do so, to put a stop to these wicked crimes... for corrupt people in government to be cast out of government for not ending this... and those in high places who really care to be protected and guided... this is a horrible thing, i wish more people cared and were made aware that this is one of the many evils taking place in this world, so we can unite to fight against this, and not tolerate such evil in this one world we share... every person should be free to make their own choices, no one should ever be a forced to have sex against their will, especially little children, may the people who pay for such services be stopped, All who participate in these things will be judged by God, don't think you will get away with what you are doing
