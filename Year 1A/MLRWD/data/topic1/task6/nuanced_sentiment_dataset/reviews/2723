U-571, although entertaining suffers from the usual Hollywood inaccuracies.  One reviewer here stated that "Johnathon Mostow was very concerned about the accuracy of this film. I don't see how anyone can call it inaccurate, it isn't."  Apparently people  now consider Hollywood producers and directors historians.  Sigh.  Statements like this demonstrate how Hollywood gets away with making second rate movies like this one.
The movie is mildly entertaining--although the characters are one-dimensional and the story is pretty predictable--some of the underwater scenes are well done.  But, for accuracy, I'll watch Das Boot which is a pretty accurate respresentation of submariners (if you subtract the ficticous use of red battle lights--it isn't as if a sub has windows people).
I think the movie would have played better if it was at least about a British sub crew (FYI I'm a "yank") and have given more credit to the fact that the Brits were the ones who captured the Enigma.  Other reviewers have made good points about how we ripped off the Brits and didn't give them enough credit in the movie--I have to agree with this.  
Hopefully our cousins over in Europe will understand that this is a Hollywood movie and, as a result, many of me and my fellow Yanks recognize to whom the real credit should go.
