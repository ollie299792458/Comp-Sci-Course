I was thoroughly enjoying the Master of Horror stories when I hit this clunker. Some eps were better than others surely but this one was just awful. I suppose if your views are more left than right, you'll find this fun in its fashionable depiction of the current administration - and an over the top extreme, better looking Anne Coulter character. I am an independent and really have my problems with both the Repugnantcans and the Devilcrats. However, the leftist elite with their high brow satire and constant screaming is enough to push me to the right. Anyway, back to this incredible piece of trash called a horror movie. It was neither horror nor the least bit funny. Throw a couple of zombies in with a conscience that fits your liberalism and I guess those who think as you do will be quite pleased. As for me, I'd buy most of the first season of the Masters of Horror series but this one isn't even close to meriting my coinage. Make a political statement elsewhere but please let's separate horror and state.
