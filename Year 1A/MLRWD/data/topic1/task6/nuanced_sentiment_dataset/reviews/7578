This is an unimpressive film about an unimpressive character who draws prodigiously and has unaccountably grown famous enough to create New Yorker covers.

The documentary probably gives an accurate assessment of Robert Crumb's life. But until Crumb graduated to New Yorker covers---a period not discussed here---neither his life nor his "art" were much to write home about.

As a former editor of Mother Jones put it, Crumb lives in an "arrested juvenile state," with an "arrested juvenile vision," as represented for example by his comic, Joe Blow, an "over the line satire," about a "1950s American family in denial," but simultaneously a "self indulgent fantasy," a descent into pornography, in which the imagined father commands his daughter to perform oral sex, while his wife dresses in a sadomasochistic costume, and whose "Leave it to Beaver" son tells Mom off. The deadbeat Dad ends up saying "we should spend more time with kids."

The film includes some real-people scenes of questionable taste; In one, Crumb joins a semi-naked lady in lewd positions. Then there are camera shots of Crumb's pornographic comics. How titillating (not).

Additionally, you've got the off-color comments of porno magazine editor Dian Hanson, on Crumb's personal sexual activity. How, pray tell, is this relevant to his art?

Crumb may have graduated to New Yorker covers. But I found watching this film, a story about an unaccountable sad sack, a waste of my time.
