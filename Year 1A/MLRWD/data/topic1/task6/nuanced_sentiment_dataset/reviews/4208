I had heard this movie was great.  Check out the other ratings... all good - right?  Even Robin Wright Penn, who I love, I had to tell my husband was too old for the part.  If she had been pregnant and 25, okay, I could believe the pining or attraction to the old lover she runs into.  At 40?  No way!  Personally, I know that by 40, if you're any kind of healthy, you must have gotten over crap from 10 years before, or, here we go - a depressing situation.  We spent half the movie arguing about which sex had written this depressing, poorly scripted piece of crap that gave no messages other than this:  with a high-profile cast, you can sell anything!  I figured it must be a man who wrote it, because who else would make women such victims!  My husband said, unequivocably, that a woman wrote it, because there is a disabled man in every vignette.  After about 7 vignettes, my husband was snoring away and I am sitting here warning anyone I can to only rent this movie if they specifically want to be sick to their stomachs or bored out of their minds watching celebrity talent flailing and gasping to death on this horrifyingly trite?  stupid? adolescent?  stupid did I say? confusing movie.  Luckily, I rented it from the library so I only wasted my date-night - still too high a price to pay.  I thought I was going to get an under-appreciated-but excellent indie gem, but I'm sitting here writing this review, fighting off the depression inspired by this crappy movie.  Excuse me, I have to go wake my husband, who gave up, admirable, after 70 minutes.  Skip this one.
