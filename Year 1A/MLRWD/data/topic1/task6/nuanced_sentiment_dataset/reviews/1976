Ever wondered why the films of Ingmar Bergman are often considered "arty" and don't achieve much mainstream success?  watch this and you'll know.  But do yourself a favour and read a couple of reviews as well - the ones in which it is hailed as a "gothic horror masterpiece" or, "hilarious".

I saw one in which it was called (with no irony) "semi-comic".  That means, to me, "not very funny."  And it isn't.  The jokes are very poor indeed and revolve around busty serving wenches and conjuring tricks gone wrong: imagine Tommy Cooper in a bad Carry On film.

The supposed "horror" is lamer than anything I have ever seen: just not even slightly horrific.  One review I read called it "genuinely gruesome".  Well, unless Amazon are posting out heavily-edited versions, then I can only conclude that the reviewer should get out more.  Or maybe a rubber hand being animated by an assistant out-of-frame really IS gruesome, and I'm the twisted one...

God, it's rubbish.  Bad dialogue, hammy acting, clunky editing, dated music, stupid implausible plot.  It looks nice, I'll give you that: the B&W is well-lit and atmospheric.  And one of the serving wenches is pretty.
