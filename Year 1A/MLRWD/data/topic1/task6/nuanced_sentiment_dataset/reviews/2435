This movie had everything it needed to be a great movie, except it just fell flat. I decided upon this film because of the story line of a 13 year old man and his friend who was a mentally challanged 41 year old janitor Papas played by Robin Williams. It was in my opinion  a great cast and a role suited for the talented Mr. Williams, but it was far from convincing and, altough a good character, maybe one of Robin's weakest performances. I am not sure if it was some uninspired acting or if the script didn't allow for a deeper performance or if my own expectations were to high.

Erykah Badu role as a prison inmate that gives young Tommy advice and an ear was spectacular and was clearly the highlight of this film.

Overall I liked the film, it just that I felt like with some expanded charecter development into the mind of Papas and maybe deeper explaining from Papas to Tommy why he stole the bike could have made this a 5 star film instead of a 3 start film.

This is a film that had great potential and does have some tender moments it just fell flat.
