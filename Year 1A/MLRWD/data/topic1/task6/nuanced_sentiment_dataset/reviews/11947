From Hell is an enjoyable, stylish retelling of the Jack the Ripper story.  The focus of the movie is not so much on Jack, though, as on the opium-addicted, absinthe-using Inspector Abberline, who pursues him.  The inspector is played by Johnny Depp, who continues to turn out one brilliant performance after another, even in not so great movies.
Not so great?  Well, yes: unfortunately, under all the (admittedly well done) suspense and atmospherics, From Hell is sadly lacking in emotional depth.  The Ripper's mounting body count doesn't seem to elicit the kind of real terror and paranoia that might be expected given the circumstances.  The relationship between Abberline and the prostitute Mary Kelly, played by Heather Graham, is unconvincing and lacks resonance.  This is partly due to "Roller Girl"'s limitations as an actress, but most of the blame belongs squarely to the script, which just doesn't do enough to develop the story to its fullest.
Having said that, there is a lot to like here.  Some of the supporting performances are excellent, notably Robbie Coltrane as a police sergeant and Ian Holm as a high-placed surgeon who helps Abberline grapple with the forensics of the murders.  There are also some nice touches relating to the rigid class divisions of Victorian England.  From Hell is basically an above average suspense thriller, a flawed effort, but more intelligent than most entries in the genre.
