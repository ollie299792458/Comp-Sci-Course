This just goes to prove that artists often are not the best judge of their art, as Terry Zwigoff, in his Director's Cut here, completely RUINS one of the finest comedies I've ever seen, a hilarious antidote for those who hate the holdays, a vulgar comedy with an angry spirit and an ultimately uplifting experience, has been transformed here (hard to believe this was the intended version) into a completely miserable film.
Gone is the voice-over in the opening bar scene; gone are many, many funny scenes; instead of being a 'dark comedy', as Badder Santa is (and likewise Bad Santa, both recommended over this swill), this movie here is simply dark. As in pretty darn depressing. The whole mood of the film is different. It's just not funny.
Even the ending is changed, something far less triumphant.

If you have never seen this movie, first off, it is NOT a "holiday film", as many mistake it for, and thus hate it; rather, it is indeed an antidote, for those of us who say, hate It's A Wonderful Life.

Secondly, if you are a BIG fan of Bad Santa, please DON'T be tempted by this; all you need is Badder Santa, that I would give five stars to easily.

It's a shame this version was ever released.

This DVD is a waste of time and money. Skip it.
