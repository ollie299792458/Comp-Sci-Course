3 and a half stars, actually.

Let me explain what I didn't like first: specifically, Hansi Kursch's performance. I don't know if he had some trouble with his voice, or if he just simply can't sing what he sings in the studio; lower notes he can reach, but the high pitched stuff he can not. After watching the second DVD I'm thinking that he had some trouble with his voice during the concert on the first DVD, since the four bonus songs sound perfect. With the exception of Hansi's voice, the rest of the band is perfect. Marcus Siepen guitar work is simply amazing, and Thomas Stauch is nothing short of an athlet and a very, very good drummer, and last but not least there's Andr&eacute; Olbrich, wich makes almost all the background guitars. The guest musicians, the keyboardist and bass player don't get much attention from the camera.

Some people mentioned BG's members as being very still...personally, I don't care about this, as I don't require the members of a band to be a Freddie Mercury or a Paul Stanley, but...it's true: man, they are *stiffs* onstage!

Some minor glitches: at some points the camera shifts views a lot, with pointless views, by the way, and the guest musicians don't get much camera attention.

Now, the things I like:

As I wrote above, band performance. The set list: covering most of BG's albums, there's a song for almost every fan; hell, even "And then, there was silence" is played complete (well, Hansi forgets to sing a line from the song heheh, but that's *one error* in a 14 minute song!). The extras are very good, specially the four bonus songs (I was going to be very angry if I didn't get to see "Into the storm", heheh). Did I mention the crowd? hearing all of 'em singing the chorus of the songs it's wonderful! I'm not going to delve into sound and video quality: they're both acceptable, nothing exceptional here.

Last but not least, packaging is very good looking.

Overall, a pretty good DVD from BG.
