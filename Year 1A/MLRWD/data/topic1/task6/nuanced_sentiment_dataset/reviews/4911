There is absolutely nothing that makes Ron Howard's newest film, "The Missing" stand out from other films. The story is okay. The characters are okay. The dialouge is okay. In fact, not only is the story okay, you've heard it a million times before. Okay, here it goes: A parent (in this case, Tommy Lee Jones) goes back to his adult child (Cate Blanchett) whom he deserted when she was little and tries to make up for it. And wouldn't you know it? Right after they reunite (and she kicks him out of her house) HER daughter is kidnapped! Well, now Cate HAS to bond with her father because he's the only one who can help get her daughter back. How's that for a coinsedence?
  After that set-up (that takes way too long to get off the ground), the rest of the movie is about 2 MORE HOURS of Cate, Tommy, and Cate's other daughter riding through the desert on horseback trying to find the band of Indians that have taken all the local girls to sell in Mexico. Since it's so long, the movie gets very boring near the end. Oh, not that they don't try to make it exciting. Rattlesnakes, floods, Indian curses, they throw it all in. Actually, the Indian curse scene is in a way the climax of the movie...yawn. It's all very predictable and WAY too long. Though "The Missing" is well made, it just doesn't quite work.
