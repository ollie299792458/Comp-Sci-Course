I was excited to see this film.  I loved Vin Diesel in Fast and The Furious, and I thought it would be more speed, more cars, more stunts.  I guess in some way the movie did meet these expectations - there were tons of jaw dropping stunts, fast moving snow boarders, and cool stuff in general.  Does that equal a good film?  NO.
In fact, this is one of the worst movies I've seen to date.  The acting is lifeless, the plot is a joke, and it caters to a viewer who enjoys watching the previews more than the movie.  Now normally I might let a movie like this slide, if it had some degree of self-awareness.  If it recognized the cheesy flash-bang approach it had chosen to take - but all these characters took themselves seriously.  They didn't get that they were in a stupid movie - they thought they were in a high class bond film.
...So if you're just into big explosions, mumbled lines, and stupidity, go see this film.  However, if your IQ is greater than that of a small monkey, it would be in your best interest to avoid it...
