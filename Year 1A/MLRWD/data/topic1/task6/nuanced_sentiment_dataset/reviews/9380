This is the 3rd in the great sereies ( trilogy ) and it shows... it's good, but not near as good as Scream 1 or 2. This is the long awaited for END, and it does good. But some of it could have been better.
Sydney is living on her own as a womans crisis counciler, and the 3rd STAB movie is coming out ( what happened to #2? )And she can't be found by her killer ( or so she thought ) and back on the stage of STAB 3, the bodies pile up of the CAST of STAB 3 but none  of SCREAM. SO they are being killed in the order they die in the movie ( STAB ) and police believe that it is by someone on the crew. Adn questions come up when they read about  3 different scripts to keep the ending from getting on the internet. SO they don't know which one the killer read, and so goes the story and it is greatly combined with Sydney's long lost brother, who wanted to get back at her for the life she stole from him...so the story goes....
This one was packed with comedy, which I greatly enjoyed. It made me laugh out loud. The only problem is they did not kill off cast from the origional SCREAM. I was thinking, what a great twist if Gale or Dewy, heck even Sydney, gets offed in this one. That would have been fun! But it was still good. I reccomend eithe fo the first 2 before this. But it does do justice to a great series!
