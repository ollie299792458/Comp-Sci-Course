The Matt Smith episodes I have so far seen, I found to be disappointingly shallow. They seem to have tossed out most of what made the reincarnation of the Dr. Who series so exceptional, for the sake of being "edgy".

They also virtually threw away some wonderful story lines - the Tardis becoming human for example -, but would dwell for multiple episodes on "action" stories.  Additionally, Who's new companion, Amy, shows a very limited range, and for the first time since I began following this series, I found myself fast forwarding thru scenes, out of boredom.

The things that are still exceptional: guest appearances by  wonderful veteran British actors, and, the always surprising delightfully creative story lines. Matt Smith, is indeed a quality Actor, but not enough to save this season.

I purchased all of the previous seasons with Christopher Eggalson and David Tennet. They were great! Perfect balance of everything, to appeal to all age groups. However this new Who, does the opposite. I wont bother with this series again until they (hopefully) get some new direction and editing.
