Terribly Happy entertained me throughout the whole film. From the peculiar characters to the peculiar town, I was interested in how this film would unwind. Like others have mentioned, the feel of the film reminded me of a Coen brothers movie, and certain parts of the movie were reminiscent of Fargo.

The character of Robert was very intriguing. As I watched him trying to adapt in this little town, I wanted to know more about him. I wanted to know his back story and about his daughter. Fortunately, as the movie progresses, you learn bits and pieces of his character.

The town is not just a simple small town where nothing happens, as suggested in the beginning of the film. The town is full of mystery, and it pretty much has it's own well-established government that controls everything that happens there.

I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it to anybody that wants to watch an interesting and intriguing film. I also really like the dvd cover design.
