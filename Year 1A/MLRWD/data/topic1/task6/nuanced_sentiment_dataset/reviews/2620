THE MOVIE

I haven't watched a movie this tediously boring since Spiderman 3. I rented this because the reviews promised comedy greatness and video transfer greatness. My wife and I found Playtime plotless, magicless, comedyless. We almost couldn't finish it. Obviously many people love this film, but it's just not an experience to my taste. In the end, am I glad that I at least gave it a chance? No. I wish I could go back in time, read my own review, and then netflix something else.

THE BLU-RAY

It's a 40 year old french film shot on 70mm. Maybe this is what a "5-star" transfer of a really old movie looks like, but it only looks average compared to a 5-star transfer of a modern movie on blu-ray. The video quality doesn't even come close to The Dark Knight imax sequences or something like Baraka, which was also 70mm but fantastically impressive. This might be the best this movie has ever looked, but it doesn't have any wow-factor. Any good dvd, upscaled to 1080p, looks equal to and sometimes better than this blu-ray did on my 50" plasma.
