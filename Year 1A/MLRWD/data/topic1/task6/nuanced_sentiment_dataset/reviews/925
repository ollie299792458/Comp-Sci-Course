Anyone who has seen Tori live knows she's incredible. It's a given, whether she's touring alone or with the band it's always a great show. This tour was good although if you're expecting a show anything like the plugged tour you're not going to get it. This is more low key - more "adult contemporary" (and i use that phrase loosely as Tori is not contemporary). Tori didn't talk much during the show which was odd and while watching it I had two questions. First question: what happened to her guitar player? Cornflake Girl just isn't the same song without him. Second question: Why was Professional Widow censored? It seems like a crime to ever censor Tori but to censor her during the most passionate performance of the show? Someone should be slapped for that one. She didn't play one song from From the Choirgirl Hotel which is in my personal opinion her best album and that was disappointing. Now to the good. Tori played this incredible remake of Crucify that was better than the original. She played Take to the Sky which I've never seen or heard her do live and it was great (at the end she breaks out into Muhammed my Friend and starts a Phish like jam session on the piano and vocals). It was hot. She closes with the dakota remix of Hey Jupiter. the whole show was good again nothing like the Plugged tour which was amazing to see and she should have released a show from that tour on DVD. Haven't watched the interview yet but if you're a Tori fan this is a must have.
