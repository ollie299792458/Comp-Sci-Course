I never write review here but I had to point something out. I am a fan of Audrey Hepburn but there are many reasons why I think that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" was a poor movie. Some of which is that a bad story line is made beautiful by use of the perfect music, perfect lighting, perfect camera filters, perfect actors, etc. Hollywood has perfected the art of emotion manipulation and this movie would be the pinnacle of the art.

 But the main reason that pushed me to write an review was that Mickey Rooney portrays an Asian landlord as buck-toothed, near-sighted minstrel. Do we still laugh at African Americans depicted in blackface minstrel in anyother classics? But yet most current audience / reviewers still think Mr. Rooney's depiction of Asian character was hilarious (please read other's reviews). How is this possible?

 I don't blame Audrey Hepburn, Mickey Rooney or even the director as racists. They would have to have been an very advanced social thinker to notice the offensiveness of their portrayal in their time. But I do blame the current audience for not finding it offensive now. Ask yourself if you are an intelligent thinking person but still find Mickey Rooney's character funny and why.

 I am force to post this review in the future to point this issue out. This isn't to hit you over the head with my point. But old reviews get buried over with newer reviews and this is an issue that should not be buried.

 Go see "Roman Holiday" with Audrey Hepburn if you really want to see a great romantic movie.
