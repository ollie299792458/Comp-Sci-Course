My son and his wife had lost their twins, and I was very upset, since I and everyone else had prayed so hard and so long for a miracle.  God did not give us that miracle.  I hated God.  I was told to get this book and read it.  I regret that very much.  It lets God off the hook, saying He has no control over what happens on Earth, and He is just as sad about the twins dying as we are.  Prayer changes nothing it says, just helps us deal with it as humans helping humans.  It takes away the "miracles" possibilities and makes God more human than devine.  If He is the ultimate power in the universe, then why can't he perform miracles?  Why were we taught that it only takes the faith of a mustard seed for God to move a mountain.  This book was very disheartening.  According to this book God is not as powerful as we are led to believe.  I have not been to church but twice since I read it.  Only because it was a funeral or wedding.  I listen to the Word of God and think it is all phoney now.  I hate this book, it took away my faith in a kind loving all powerful God.
