This is the best "Jason" Friday The 13th flick. The continuity from part one to part 2 was great. Jason is gown up and what I would expect how Jason would look according to the legend. Jason is human, he is clumsy, and not very smart in this movie. I think those elements make him that much more scary. The sack on his head adds to the fright as one hole is cut in the bag to expose his only good eye.
Even though this movie had it's fair share of cuts, the gore is still there and the kills are still quite brutal. The cuts added to the suspense, leaving the kills to your imagination. The hero/heroine tandem of Amy Steel and John Furey is hands down the best of any Friday The 13th movie.
Steve Dash played Jason top notch

This is the best 'Jason Voorhees' Friday The 13th movie, this movie brought Jason Voorhees to be a household name. The characters in the movie were so easy to like and the movie was set in the perfect spot for a sequel to Friday The 13th. Paul, Ginny and Ted (the survivors) were some of the best characters in the entire franchise. I think they set the movie apart, and really made you root for them.

[my rating]
I give this movie 3.5 out of 5 for blood and gore.
4.5 out of 5 for the plot.
5 out of 5 for characters.
4.5 out of 5 overall.
