This is definitely one of the most ambitious and original works that I have seen from the nineties, a time when film (especially horror) was slipping into a trend of over-hyped sensationalism. Out of the mass of special effects ridden blockbusters came a gritty, odd film in black and white. This is a western in the style of Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time In the West." Slow-moving and with surprisingly little dialogue, with chartacters that are so utterly believable and flawed, it captivates the viewer from the very beginning. The film moves like a dream, with slow fades that separate each scene, and a musical score from Neil Young that is driving and apocalyptic. The acting is extremely good from even the most menial roles to those of Depp and Farmer. The plot seems intentionally thin, leaving time and room for the viewer to think about what he or she is seeing (I'm going to spare you my thoughts on the symbolism and meanings and let you draw your own conclusions). The camera work is also stunning, probably more effective in stark black-and white. What results is a very effective, thought-provoking and excellent film.
