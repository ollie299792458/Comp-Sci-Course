The model for a generation of "white suburban punks" REPO MAN stands out an absolute classic piece of filmmaking, and one of my all-time  favourite films.  For those of you that can share my fondness for the film  and the memories it evokes, you might also share my disappointment that the  Special Edition - DVD does NOT include the deleted scenes found in the  "Directors Cut" of the film.  
Thankfully, I still have a VHS  copy of the REPO MAN "Directors Cut" that I taped when it was  shown on A&amp;E about 6 years ago.  Still, it saddens me that the Special  Edition - DVD does not contain J. Frank Parnell's hysterical description of  the qualities of vending machine food or the details of the  "project" in which he was involved. Also, I must say that  Amazon.com, to some extent, misleads the consumer into thinking that this  is in fact the "Driector's Cut" of the film.  You'll see Amazon's  misinformation if you've read through the quotes &amp; trivia section for  REPO MAN. In that section there is a description of a scene where -  "Bud gives an irate car owner a business card and tells him to call  his boss "I.G. Farbin", a reference to Farben, the German company  that produced poison gas during World War II." 
This scene only  exisits in the Directors cut and is NOT included in the Special Edition -  DVD.  
That minor disappointment aside, REPO MAN is a brilliant piece of  satirical comedy and well worth the purchase price.  5 STARS -
