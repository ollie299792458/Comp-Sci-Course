I signed up for the Showtime channel specifically for this series and I have yet to be dissapointed. I love all the characters. Brian is so deliciously nasty you have to love him and Justin is such a little cutie. Emmett is a riot all the time. He reminds me so much of a lot of my friends. Some people complain that he is a stereotypical sissy, but so many of my friends are just like him. He is fun and energetic, definitely what being Gay is all about. The show is sexy and smart. The writers and directors are right on the money with the storylines. Debbie is the perfect mother that every gay man wants and fears at the same time. Some of the episodes have made me roll with laughter and some have almost broke my heart. I can't wait for the second season to be released on DVD as well. Everyone Gay man in the world should own this series. 
Sure the sex is gratuitous sometimes, but hey we deserve to see some great Gay sex scenes on TV. The world of straight sex is pushed down our throats everyday in so many shows. It's time we got some equal screen time. 
For those negative ones that love to write nasty and bashing reviews of the show, I would ask you this: Are you actually Gay? If so lighten up and live a little. 
Queer As Folk is the screenplay of my life and so many others that I know. It's fun, engaging, moving and completely additive televison. Treat yourself to something different from anything else on TV.
