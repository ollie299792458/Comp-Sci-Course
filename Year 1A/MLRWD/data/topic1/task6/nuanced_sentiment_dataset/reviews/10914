After "The Marine," which really didn't strike the right note with me, I was iffy about watching another Cena action vehicle.  However, this one was significantly more entertaining than that unremarkable bore.  They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; if that's the case, Bruce Willis and Jeremy Irons should take this film as a compliment.  It's obvious that this movie is very similar to "Die Hard with a Vengeance," but if the filmmakers were going to copy something, at least they picked a stellar action movie to mimic.  The plot concerns a brilliant sociopath seeking revenge on a New Orleans police officer by leading him on a deadly game of puzzles and traps around the city.  Like its spiritual predecessor, "12 Rounds" has some spectacular scenes of action and destruction.  Stuff goes boom, guns are fired, vehicles chase each other while narrowly avoiding horrific crashes, and sometimes all three happen simultaneously.  If you're a fan of slam-bang action movies, check it out.
