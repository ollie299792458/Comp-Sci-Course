Therese was a 15-year-old French girl who entered the convent and died in her 20's from TB.  She became a saint after she wrote a journal about her life, her calling as a nun, and how she found God.  These journals were published initially for novices (nuns) and then the general public, and became immensely popular for her "little ways" to serve God, something people thought was a valuable insight on how an ordinary person could become more Godly.  The book is still widely sold today and worth reading, and the monastery where she died is the number two location in France for religious tourists.
The movie, however, concentrates on her upper-class childhood with servants and a doting father, and the father's role in bringing up his girls so they could all go to the monastery is too inflated, in my view.  Perhaps the actor needed more screen time to get him to agree to the picture.  I would have liked to have seen a lot more of the film devoted to Therese's "little ways."  The aspect of her actually writing her famous book as she lay dying of TB was glossed over in the film with a few quick shots of her writing in a journal, and I think some people not not realize that the book she wrote was her major contribution to this world.  I waited for the scene where she gets the old, ulgy, broken water pitcher and tries to love it because it also serves God's purpose - and it wasn't there.  So little of her book's message was skipped.  The agony of her dying lasted over-long, and was so immensely sad I don't think I'd ever watch the DVD again.
The film is in English, the actress playing Therese has a really sweet smile, and the costumes are wonderful.  Being a fan of her book, I guess I had to watch the film at least once.
