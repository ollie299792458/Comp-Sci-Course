Buy this DVD is you like cheese.  Oh my gosh this DVD is so bad.  Denise has a great personality, but boy is she just white-bread and cheese.  (Well, she does have a nice body too.)

I actually found myself laughing at her while doing this workout!

Just imagine for a moment the cheesiest sounding "woo!" "yeah!" that you could ever make and make the face to go along with it (like a cheerleader on crack) and you have Denise Austin's Burn Fat Fast workout dvd.

If you are used to The Firm or any other type of intermediate to advanced workout, do not buy this cd.  Just buy another Firm dvd -- it really is the best DVD workout around according to my personal trainer friends.  The only reason I bought it anyway was that it was a quick workout of only 25 minutes.

If you are a super-beginner, or like doing the same move the entire time (but you could get on a treadmill or elliptical for that matter and actually watch tv that's interesting) - then you might like this DVD.

But seriously, it is super-cheesy.  Woo! Yeah!.
