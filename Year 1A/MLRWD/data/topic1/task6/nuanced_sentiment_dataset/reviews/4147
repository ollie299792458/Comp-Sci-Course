I saw Cannery Row when it was in theaters and have had a copy of the film first on VHS and now on DVD.  The screen play adapts two of John Steinbeck's books: Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday.  Although connected the mood of the novels is quite different with Cannery Row being grittier and realistic and Sweet Thursday more sentimental. Both books make great reading.  The film picks up more from Sweet Thursday and the character of Doc (based on marine biologist Ed Ricketts) has nothing to do with baseball in the novels.  It goes without saying that the character of the Seer, the injured baseball player, fits the screen play and not the novel.

That said, Cannery Row is a nice romantic comedy and the story is brought to life by the supporting cast as much as the leading actors Nick Nolte (as Doc) and Deborah Winger (as Suzy).  M. Emmet Walsh plays Mack, the leader of "the boys," to perfection and the slow witted but physically strong Hazel (one of the boys) is marvelously played by Frank McRae. Audra Lindley plays Fauna, proprietor of the Bear Claw Hotel, otherwise known as the local house of ill-repute.  John Huston lends his distinctive voice to the narration.

Cannery Row is a feel good film with comic and heartbreaking moments that are the hallmarks of a great film.  The sets are good and the atmosphere of Monterey Bay is nicely captured on film.
