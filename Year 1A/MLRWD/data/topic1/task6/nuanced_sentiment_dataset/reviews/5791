OK, my kids saw Van Helsing (dumb movie) at a sleepover last weekend and got into the whole Dracula thing so I sat down and did my research. In the last week I watched all the greats again, Murneau's Nosferatu and then Herzog's version. Today I watched Browning's and Coppola's Dracula and I watched Morrisey's last week (yuk!). I must say the German versions are far scarier and more realistic. Max Von Shrek is truly repulsive while Lugosi seems stiff and almost comical at times. Klaus Kinski nails the role while Oldman (maybe it was Coppola's fault) is more like "Count Liberace". As far as supporting roles go, if you look at the actors playing Lucy, Renfield and Harker there is no comparison, Murneau and Herzog have stronger casting. I probably shouldn't have watched the films in this order because I used to love the original Dracula and I dig Tod Browning and "Freaks" and all (check out Herzog's ode to Browning entitled "Even Dwarfs Started Small") but from the script to lighting to props (i.e., the bats in Browning's Dracula suck and Coppola's are overblown), the "Nosferatu's" are superior. I'm gonna have to see every flick about "Drac" ever made in the next few months (can't wait for the 70's trash pics) to give a fair comparison but for now, this is my two cents.  You should watch every film ever made by Werner Herzog.
