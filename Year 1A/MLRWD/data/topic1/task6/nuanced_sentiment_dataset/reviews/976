Some negative reviews here but perhaps you are comparing (too much) Camelot to
HBOs 'Thrones' which yes better acting & writing but I found Camelot to be great fun- I agree
With some that Arthur was a casting mistake- he is a good young  actor but just doesn't 'fit' what
We think Arthur should be like- a bit more like THOR's Chris H- if you're going the blonde route
Would have been a better choice-Joe Fiennes talents were poorly misused - he is a superb actor and
Should have had more meat in his roll- yes weak writing to blame in all counts but I wasn't comparing it to
Game-which is superior in a lot of areas-- I was just enjoying the show and having fun watching as not
Many chances( for those of us who enjoy King Arthur period shows ) to have a series to indulge in.

Have to say- the opening sequence-credits is one of THE most BEAUTIFUL show openings I've seen
In ages and the MUSIC is breathtakingly gorgeous - treat yourself to the iTunes score/soundtrack!!

I look forward to next season....warts and all :) Perhaps STARZ will indulge in some new writers
For the sophomore season - give the actors a better chance to shine! Its a good show, don't toss in the towel yet!!
