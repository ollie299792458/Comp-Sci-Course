I love this film.  It is dark, creepy, and the characters are so believable especially the side characters, like the Head of the Organ making company and the doctor.  These people didn't look like actors, they looked like average, ordinary people.  I truly cannot say enough good things about this film, except that I consider it a masterpiece.  I own this film about 3 times over on various DVD packs.  This particular one I have rented but I don't own.  Dispite what traditionalist may say, I like the optional color, just to see what it looks like, but the black and white is far more beautiful.  This is not only a erie, creepy film, it is beautiful.  Also the star of the film, supposedly dissappeard after this film was made and never made another movie.  I don't know if this is true, but the myth just adds to the mystique of this film.  THIS FILM IS A MUST HAVE IN YOUR HORROR MOVIE COLLECITON, any version you can get.  I sure would love to watch this film with commentary

I would put this movie up with any modern day horror film or any film period.  This film should be studied in film school along with the short films of Maya Deren.
