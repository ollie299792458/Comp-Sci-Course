While I'm all for the collector tin sets to be continued, and have been a fan of the wealth of classic, never before released, historical films on them, it seems this one fell victim to the money hungry management and bean counters at Disney. The quality of these DVD's makes you think that the management that ran Disneyland into the ground for the last 10 years by not spending any money on paint or maintenance, has now been put in charge of the DVD releases.  What happened to Disney digitally remastering and making "perfect" all their releases onto DVD? The quality on the shorts are all washed out, grainy, scratched, and some are even in the wrong aspect ratio! What intern did you let put this together? The money that is being made off of these collector sets should be more than enough to pay for someone to restore these films and bring the quality back to par with the previously released Walt Disney Treasures.

Disney management needs to stop being so cheap. They also need to stop thinking that the "audience is ignorant" and will not notice if we don't restore the films or spend any money on quality; after all their just dumb consumers, they'll buy it anyway since it has the Disney name on it.

Here's the hint -- we're not stupid, and we DID notice it! Now how about fixing it and releasing what you promised?
