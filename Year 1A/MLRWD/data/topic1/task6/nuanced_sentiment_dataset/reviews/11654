This is not just the Romanian film on abortion.

4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days is the story of two girls and their attempt to solve the problem of having an abortion in a totalitarian state where aborition was prohibited. The reason abortion was illegal, and people went to prison for attempting it, is because Ceausescu thought that Romania needed a bigger population because he gathered that a bigger population meant a more powerful state. Therefore, there was no contraception available and people had to make do with what they could.

Now, what 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days shows, in a shockingly honest way, is that humanity can endure even the most degrading and inhuman of situations. Ironically, what this film is about is survival. The girls simply need to get on with their lives and survive. And you, the viewer, will witness their every thought and emotion etched on their faces. You will witness their struggles and decision-making moments.

It's an inspiring piece, a visionary attempt. You cannot not be affected by watching it and hopefully, hopefully you will come out a better person for it.
