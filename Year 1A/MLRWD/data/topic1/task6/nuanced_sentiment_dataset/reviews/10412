Well, I saw and read the hype, read the reviews, and listened to the critics on their Friday morning radio rounds. The unanimous opinion was that this was one funny movie. Other comments read that there would be many lines that would make it into the popular culture. So last night we stayed up late and sat in a packed theater and.....left mostly disappointed. Now mind you, it wasn't bad, but like Click, there just wasn't much comedy on display. The story itself was very dumb, the laughs were very few and far between. At my showing, the ONLY laugh out loud moment was when Ricky Bobbys friends were trying to extract a knife that he had stabbed himself with. Other then that, seeing a grown man run around in his briefs, and some fixation with overtly gay men were the heights of comedy. There were NO lines spoken in the movie that would cross over to popular culture. "Shake and Bake" are already out there, and "If you're not first then you're last" was "The dumbest thing I ever heard" said the speaker of the line.

  Some of the special effects were impressive but except for that I would wait for this to hit TNT.
