This flick still packs a wallop for me, quite suspenseful, exciting, and tons of fun too. I have not seen The Poseidon Adventure since one of the initial television airings in the 70's and I was super surprised at how much I still enjoy it.  I just love the look and feel of this film.....real sets, real effects (all that fire!), and actors that do not look like they just stepped from the casting agent's idea of human perfection and/or the gym!  The scene that still upsets me the most is when they have to swim under water to reach the engine room. Just the thought of holding my breath for almost a minute, swimming in all that filthy water with my eyes wide open still creeps me out the most. The character actors are all terrific, with special mention to Borgnine, Stevens, Hackman, and of course the great Shelly Winters. I forgot, also, just how powerful John William's score is....music of a subtle pulsating, suspenseful, throbbing sound that adds quite a bit to the overall effect of the film.  The extras on disc 2 are also quite a bit of fun and will interest anyone who admires this suspenseful, marvelous movie.  Luigi ~ NYC
