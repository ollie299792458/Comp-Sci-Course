The first half of this film is compelling, well acted and well scripted, all with some first class production design to really bring alive 1970s New York. Kirsten Dunst was exceptional in her role in the movie and brings warmth and depth to the love story and some subtleties to explain why the relationship fails.

Unfortunately, once she leaves the story, it falls apart dramatically. Ryan Gosling's character - the protagonist until the mid-point - quickly becomes unlikable and fairly boring. The film then starts to focus on his involvement with a second-tier character that overshadows the real questions raised in the first half. And then there's a really dull trial that provides an excuse for voice-over at the beginning but becomes the focal point at the end.

Ultimately the story offers no real insights or answers about a man who destroys the lives of so many around him. It might have been better to drop the "inspired by true events" title card in favor of some creative license to offer the audience some sort of satisfaction in the way the events play out. Still, this is not a bad film by any means but by the end it feels like a missed opportunity.
