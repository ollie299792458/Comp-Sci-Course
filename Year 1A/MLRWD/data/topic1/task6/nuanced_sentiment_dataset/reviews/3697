This is my very first workout DVD.  I bought it because I do not own any workout equipment, and this DVD came with the only equipment you need.

I like the way she teaches the routines one step at a time... even an exercise ignoramus like me can do most of it.  I have been doing this for three weeks now and I can almost keep up with it. I think if I could do it all the first time, I would be bored by now!  My only problem with the cardio section is that the music is not loud enough.  I work out better to a strong beat (plus it would help to drown out Denise's slightly annoying voice)

The resistance band is not that annoying to me.  It is a little difficult to get the ends wrapped around my hands quickly enough for the kickboxing moves but I am getting better at it every day.  I also have not been using it the way they do in the video... they fold it in half for more resistance, but I leave it full length (for now) because I have my hands full learning the steps.  Once I can do all the steps I will work on using the band right.

The toning segments really work!  I now have muscle aches in places I didn't even know I had muscles!  I can't do a lot of the ab section, but I have been trying and even that is making my abs a lot stronger.

Overall, I think this is a great workout... maybe not the best for beginners, especially if you're easily discouraged, but if you're in decent shape (or an optimist like me) it's definitely worth the money.
