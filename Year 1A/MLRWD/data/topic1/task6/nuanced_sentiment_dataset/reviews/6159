Primal Fear is one of those movies you must see regardless whether or not you are a Richard Gere fan. Why? Simply because of Edward Norton's character. Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a big shot attorney who defends Norton for free just so he can get some big time public recognition even though he already has it. Laura Linney is the prosecutor who also happens to be Vail's ex-girlfriend. Despite the story being interesting from start to finish, there is a big twist in the end due to the talented acting by Edward Norton. Now onto the DVD... Though the film is presented in widescreen, the bottom portion of the picture is cropped. This is not a huge problem if you have a widescreen TV yet is still very noticable. Aside from that, there are no special features (I don't consider theatrical trailers to be a special feature). I would have very much liked to have seen interviews with Richard Gere, Laura Linney, and of course Edward Norton. If you have a VHS, don't bother replacing it with the DVD unless it is completely worn out.
