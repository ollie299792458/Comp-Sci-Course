I am really shocked at all the positive reviews that this worthless piece of crap is getting. The leather jacket slipcase is awesome, the new special features are great, but nevertheless I am reselling my copy (having only seen it once) because I cannot stand this new, remastered soundtrack.

This seems to be a new trend with some studios, where they make a new soundtrack that makes the film completely unwatchable. If I have to stay with VHS or Laserdisc to have Grease with its original soundtrack, then so be it. But I will be damned if I sit through an American cinematic classic listening to this awful, echoey, added sound garbage Paramount wants to call "remastered".

Shame on everyone involved with the release of this DVD. At the very least, they could have offered the *option* of the ORIGINAL soundtrack.

The movie rates 5 stars, the special features rate a good strong 4. The soundtrack ruins this release and therefore this particular edition is rated a 1.
