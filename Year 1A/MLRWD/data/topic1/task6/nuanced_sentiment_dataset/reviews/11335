I have loved ZZ Top for many years, back to the vinyl days.  This Blu-Ray, like others have said, has superb audio and video with many close-ups, so technically it gets nothing but praise from me.  I can't give the DVD the full 5 stars however, because I just don't think these re-imaginings of the songs done at slower tempos are better than the original versions.  Billy Gibbons is obviously a virtuoso guitarist, worthy of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, etc., but I don't love the way he has simplified some of the solos here.  Not only is Pearl Necklace slowed down to almost half speed, but the guitar solo is also dumbed down and I missed the shredding of the original.  I prefer that bands do alter the songs somewhat when performing them live - The Deep Purple Made In Japan album is the paradigm I would look at for an example where the original songs are improved in the live concert setting by adding extended solos and so forth - but ZZ Top has turned the songs into something different here, and some people may like this type of change but I wasn't crazy about it.

The quality of picture and sound is incredible, and the concert is enjoyable, so this is still a must have for ZZ Top fans.  Just beware that the songs are noticeably plodding compared to the original versions.
