I have been a shetland sheepdog furmommy for most of my life. Currently - my "newest" one is a bi/black - first time I ever had a sheltie like this one. Mine is a girl - and is small purbred - but everyone who ever seen her - or sees us walk  - LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG distance with me - on a daily basis - jokes with me - and asumes she's a mini - border colie. Truth - she's so similar to a mini-border collie - it's the first time I ever had to hire a professional dog trainer so that we could live in good and safe life - the same  as I always had been - with all my "past" female mini purbred shelties. Long story over now - but truth!!! I recommend!!! this movie to any dog lover - not just my "addicted":-)) breed. I thank my dear friend sooooooooooooo much for buying this FANTASTIC "gift and movie" as a Chanukah gift for me and my family!! But just KNOW this movie has no relation attachment to any religion!!! - but for me it was our BEST gift!! And I will see it over and over again - as will the rest of our family and MANY of our friends!!
Don't miss this movie - I am sure you will all LOVE IT!!!
