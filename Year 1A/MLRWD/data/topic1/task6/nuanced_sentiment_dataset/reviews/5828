Loved the series, thought the movie was fairly predictable. (Caution - spoilers ahead!)  When the big wedding/big dress came, I thought "wow, that's generally the climatic ending" and so was not totally unsurprised that Big choked.  Anyhoo ... everybody has loads of money and can fly around the world at the drop of a hat (or the jilting of a bride.)  That's nice ... and totally unbelievable.  When Charlotte had her "accident" in Mexico, even my husband commented "laughing at that is just mean"; I wouldn't want my friends laughing at me for something so deeply humiliating.  Carrie was just as good as deflecting blame away from herself as ever; when Miranda finally tells her she told Big they were crazy to get married, Carrie acts like THAT was the reason he didn't show up for the wedding.  I REALLY didn't like her character much after that.  But in the end, everybody lives happily ever after and/or reverts back to type: Carrie & Big are together, Miranda & Steve reconcile; Charlotte finally has a biological child; and Samantha is happily on her own.  I'm not sorry I saw this movie, but I doubt I'd watch another sequel.
