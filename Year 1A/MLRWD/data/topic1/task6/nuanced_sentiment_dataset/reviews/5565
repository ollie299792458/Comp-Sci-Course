Without a doubt, the very best performance of her career, stunning and power packed with emotion. The mood swings are like an emotional rollercoaster ride. Her highs are quite high, and the lows, well, watch the film. The director's commentary is well worth watching and provided some insight into many of the scenes and the set-ups and so forth. The thing that makes this movie awesome is that the live music was performed live, in front of various live audiences. Hats off to members of Alice Cooper's backup band at the time for kicking butt as Rose's band! Stellar performances. Apparently, the directors told people to "show up just like it was the 60s again" and they did! Midler has some pretty salty and memorible lines in this film...she can be wonderfully crass, yet we feel for her, pity her, and route for her throughout the story. That's called good filmmaking folks, and great acting. I disagree with the reviewer who said the film drags....no way. We are treated to long takes on single cameras. Even the live shots are not all choppy like an MTV video, thank goodness! This move was ground-breaking for it's time (1979) due to certain adult themes and language, it was very powerful and hard hitting and remains so. I saw this in NYC at the Ziegfield on opening week. The sound in the theatre was full-on concert mode! Perfectly clear and loud. If you've only ever seen this on "VH-1 Movies that rock" or regular TV, you are really missing alot of the fantastic dialogue. This easily gets 5 full big stars from me. Enjoy it!!
