Fallen Angels is one of the greatest movies I have seen in a long time.  Every thing from its choice of colors, camera shots, and characterization are completely unique, innovative, and quite refreshing compared to all the [junk] Hollywood pumps out year after year.  Fallen Angels speaks with a subtle, uniquely touching tone.  Like all the voices of its characters(the assasin, the agent, the mute, and the blond) the movie is very gentle, whimsical, and poetic in its approach.  Because there isn't a lot of dialogue you get lost and enveloped in the trippy image of the film, yet the characters' voices are filled with such gentle and subtle nuance that you can't help but feel the heartbreak and loneliness they all go through. Fallen Angels does not have much of a developing plot which gives off a breathy, drifting, feeling- like all its characters.  The soundtrack is also amazing.  All the songs fully capture the emotions the movie portrays.  By the movie's end when the final song plays, you can't help but feel euphoric as one of the characters (the agent) thinks to her self, strapped on a speeding motor-cycle with the mute. "I know the road home isn't very long and I'll be getting off soon.  But at this moment I'm feeling such lovely warmth."
