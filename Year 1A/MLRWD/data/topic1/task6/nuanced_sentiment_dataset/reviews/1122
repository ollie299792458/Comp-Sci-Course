When I first went to see the Mummy, I was expecting a horror flick a la the 1933 Universal version. Instead I was disappointed to find an Indianna Jones-esque adventure. So I revise my expectations with the Mummy Returns, but instead of pulp adventure, I am disappointed again to find I am watching a screen version of what was obviously intended to be a computer role playing game. And so I come to the Scorpion King. I expected it to be [junk] going in, and for once I am NOT disappointed! It is [junk]! The Rock obviously learned the fine and subtle craft of acting in the WWF ring. This guy is the next Arnold? Well, it's possible. After all, Arnold was pretty bad too when he started out. (Check out Hercules In New York)Someone was obviously trying to save money on the special effects, they're that bad. I won't even mention the plot. I can't. There wasn't one. The fight scenes were okay if you A) like them every five minutes, or B) think WWF wrestling doesn't look fakey. This movie didn't really offend me. But then again, someone else paid for my ticket...
