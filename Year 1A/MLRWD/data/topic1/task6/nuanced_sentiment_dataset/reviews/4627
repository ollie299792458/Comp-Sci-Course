I loved this movie, if nothing else because it is one of the few times that Ralph Fiennes leaves behind the glacial, remote,untouchable persona of so many of his roles.  Yeah,he's kind of greasy at first, but by the end, his eyes are so soft,his face so emotive with love for his friend and desperation to do the right thing.

Plus, this was- at the time, the only modern movie where a beautiful White man, realizes he loves a beautiful Black woman-  a woman he respects and has always been his friend. No skanky sex shenanigans here (at least not between these two- Juliette takes care of that part!)!

There was so much hoopla about Y2K-  people really thought there would be riots, and such. I stayed home, and they had the entire police force out on 6th street in Austin, for fear of trouble! So, it fit the time as pop entertainment.

 Now, well, it's kind of tired, but Ralph is still so tender and tormented, a regular kind of screwed up guy- I watch it again, and again just to see him.
