Storyline:
A seasoned team of bank robbers, including Gordon Jennings (Idris Elba), John Rahway (Paul Walker), A.J. (Hayden Christensen), and brothers Jake (Michael Ealy) and Jesse (Chris Brown) Attica successfully complete their latest heist and lead a life of luxury while planning their next job. When Ghost (Tip T.I. Harris), a former member of their team, is released from prison he convinces the group to strike an armored car carrying $20 million. As the "takers" carefully plot their strategy and draw nearer to exacting the grand heist, a reckless police officer (Matt Dillon) inches closer to apprehending the criminals.

This movie isn't too original and has been done many times but you know what? I DO NOT CARE....I was just content watching a cast of Good-Looking Men, but of course if you aren't into just enjoying that, than maybe you be bored with this movie. Acting is alright, The camera angles were odd at points, it seemed like they spent more on the rides, the clothes and on the pay for the actors than the budget for the movie like effects and such lol. Not much action for an "action flick". Not really knowing the characters didn't really bother me, but a little history, at least how they started working together would have been alright.....To me it seems like the cops were just seriously guessing and not really knowing what was going on and wasn't close to apprehending the "takers" AT ALL! In fact Matt Dillion just got lucky to get that close to them at the end lol

Points I enjoyed:
*Umm yea hellllo the men!
*Hayden C AKA A.J. kicking some butt
*Chase scene with the cops and Chris B. AKA Jesse (he was like a monkey!)
*The shooting scene between our "takers" and the russians
*Their RIDES!

Points I didn't really like or was WTF about:
*When Hayden's character dies...its sad!
*Gordon's sister....she just drove me up a wall, didn't care for her at all
*When Jake found his gf dead....i'm guessing T.I. kills her.....but why?!?!
*The whole Matt Dillion & Jay Hernaandez 's scenes....I didn't really care what they were doing and those were the most boring parts!
*I wanted Paul Walker to just kill Matt Dillion for positivity he wont be after them...cuz at the end you really don't know if he survives. If he does you better believe he would come after and find them cuz duh he knows what they look like and all that.

Not an Oscar or Academy award winning or anything. Just an Ok movie to pass the time, to forget daily things, to not really think at all, just sit and watch.....maybe to be seen once in awhile or at least once...
