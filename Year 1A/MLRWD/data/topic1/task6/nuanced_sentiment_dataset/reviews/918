There is no way this movie should receive over three stars. And the only reason I grant the extra star is because I understand and respect the amount of work it took to create the visual effects in the movie. The storyline was extremely poor. There was absolutely no chemistry between the married couple. Where in the world did Alex's accent go? He had an English accent as a little boy and now he sounds like he is from Brooklyn.

I am one of the biggest fans of the previous two movies. I even liked part two where people were ready to string the director up by his toenails for releasing such a thing. But this one?...oh my. Horrible! I really thought that Jet Li would ruin the flick but he was very good. It was the main actors that ruined it. They really needed to fire the replacement actress and beg Rachel to come back to play Eve.

But still after saying all that, I feel obligated to end the trilogy by purchasing this. I want to complete the set nothing more nothing less.
