The movie opens with a farmer whose barn is being burned because the area is going to have a train run through it and someone wants his land.  This is followed by a stage coach robbery with Russell Crowe as the leader of the gang. Everyone looks suitably dirty and Crowe gets to wear the "black outfit complete with hat."  Move to a saloon where Crowe is talking to the lady bartender. She doesn't fit into this movie since she obviously has escaped from a Vogue photoshot so she disappears. Crowe is captured.  The farmer is asked to take Crowe to the train so that he can be held for trial. Crowe's fellow bandits follow them (Indians appear and disappear for no reason since this is not about fighting Indians). The farmer is left alone with Crowe and his gang (who are present to save Crowe)waiting for the train. There is a marshall with the farmer but he leaves because he says he is frightened. Crowe (after finding out the farmer is trying to impress his son) shoots all of his gang so they can't save him.  The farmer is shot to death.  Crowe then gets on the train, whistles for his horse and the train pulls out with his horse running along side. Peter Fonda is in the movie but only for a short time since he falls off the side of a mountain.  I don't remember why.

The movie does not flow.  It hops from one scene to another which completely destroys the interaction between the farmer, his son and the robber.  There are too many things added which have no bearing on the story (Indians, surgery on a man who appears to have plastic intestines, and a lady barkeeper). Overall, the movie is a waste of time.  Surely, they can do better than this.
