While Denzel turns in a decent performance as always it is far short of his best work. If you have seen man on fire or deja-vu, this will seem down right tepid. Likewise Willem Dafoe a sometimes brilliant actor ie (apocalypse now, boondock saints) also seems to be sleeping through his performance. Jodie Foster is a pleasure as an icy cool hard as nails *itch. A departure for her that Im sure she enjoyed. Clive owen is absolutely brilliant as the mastermind and never loses control of his performance. With all this talent, this film has the potential to be great, but in fact falls so short that I really have no need to watch it again. Hostage with Bruce Willis or firewall with Harrison Ford were far better movies of this sort. And Spike Lee's need to bring racial undercurrents to every movie he makes, shows that racism doesnt belong to any one race and gets tiresome quickly. I am a man of mixed racial heritage who grew up in Detroit and has lived in Boston and New York City and my world bears little resemblance to the one Spike seems to think he lives in. In the end its a good rental just to see Clive Owen and Jodie Foster but certainly not worth buying.
