This motion picture is a realistic look at the way things were.  Gunfights were not fast draw contests out in the street at high noon.  The classic response, when told he had shot an unarmed man, "Well, he should have armed himself," is close to the reality of the situation.  The motion picture has excellent acting and deserved academy awards.

The motion picture deals with the question of white slavery, i.e., holding women in bondage as prostitutes.  This practice continued into the 20th century.  Their pimp questions how they obtained money to hire gunmen, who are brought in to take vengence on two men they hold responsible for disfiguring one of the women (note that no punishment was meted out to the men, other then making them reimburse the pimp for the value of the woman - an indication of the prevailing attitude).

The gunmen are two paid assassins, coming out of retirement to earn some much needed money, plus a young man thinking to make a name for himself.  The story deals with tracking down their assigned targets, executing them (don't expect a fair fight, one gets whacked while sitting in an outhouse), and the aftermath.  Life will not be the same for the survivors, and the Eastwood character rides off into the sunset and back into obscurity.

Anyone wanting to study the real west, rather than the make believe usually presented, should watch this motion picture.  It is intended for mature audiences, so I would rate it PG-13.
