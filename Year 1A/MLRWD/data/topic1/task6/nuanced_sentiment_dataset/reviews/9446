Williams is one of those actors that seems to be able to play any part in any movie - comedy, drama, you name it.  I wonder sometimes why he says yes to some movie roles, as it does not seem to matter.
I did not know what to expect from One Hour Photo, it continued to remind me of "Falling Down" with Michael Douglas.  A down and out lonely man searching for some meaning in life through other peoples pain and loneliness.  Without giving away the best parts of the movie, I thought the second half was much better than the first as it always seemed to start then stop in terms of a fever pitch.  Finally once Williams is ousted as the photo guy at the local savmart does the movie really begin to pick up steam.  A twist here, a turn there, and undoubtedly Williams plays the part to its fullest.
Its a see, not a must see, and will probably do well in rental more so than in theaters.  Another Robin Williams movie that is so-so, not phenominal, but in the absence of a better movie to see, it beats watching a bad football game on TV.
