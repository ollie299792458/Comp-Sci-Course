I happen to like Sammo and Donnie.  They typically make great martial arts films.  The choreography here is no different.  The action scenes are one-of-a-kind.  Unfortunately, that's not enough to make a great movie.

Let me first say that I like the premise, it's the details that don't make sense.  You have multidimensional characters.  All have flaws.  You soon find that the good guys aren't really that good and the bad guys (although despicable) have some redeeming qualities.  Sammo is the baddy this time, in a role reversal from the norm.  Donnie is a good guy, replacing a dying, bulldog detective who has dedicated his life to destroying the big bad boss (Sammo).  The cops are a little dirty, but for understandable, possibly noble reasons.  Sammo is bad, but cares about his family.

So the problem is that the legal issues just don't add up.  We've all watched enough Law and Order or CSI to know that you don't have to be the one pulling the trigger to be persecuted for murder.  And here lies the critical flaw.  The entire plot pivots on a murder (of one of the cops), ordered by Sammo but they can't bring him in.  So the cops cheat and try to frame Sammo.  Everything goes to crap over this majorly flawed plot device.

This confusing mess of a film almost has what it takes.  Almost.  Even the ending has an interesting twist, but I didn't care because the lead in didn't make logical sense.  A good film should suspend disbelief.  This one encouraged it.  I bought it and I'll watch it again, but only for the fight scenes.  It reminds me of "The Game of Death".  I love the fights, but hate the rest.  I spend my time skipping to the good stuff.  I'm betting you'll do the same with this action crime thriller, that's heavy on the action, nonsense on the crime, and hardly a thriller.
