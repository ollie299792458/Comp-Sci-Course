The cast in this movie was extremely well chosen, and they all acted very well.  Sean is a reckless, charming, somewhat troubled teenager, but he doesn't come across as stupid and careless--despite his angst and frequent bungles, he is immediately likable.  When a car race with a peer at his school results in two wrecked cars and extensive damage to a local construction site, the only alternative he has to jail is to move to Tokyo and live with a relative (his father, I thought, but maybe his uncle...).

In Tokyo, Sean quickly discovers the racing scene.  After trashing a race car, he has no choice but to work for Han, the car's owner, as compensation.  Han is by far the best character in this movie, to the point that he seems out of place--you just don't expect a character THAT good in this sort of action flick.  Han is a whimsical, philosophical and intense character.  He completely upstages Sean and almost from the first moment you see him, calmly eating his chips while he watches Sean destroy his expensive race car, you want to see more of him.

Much of the movie's impetus comes from D.K. and Neela.  D.K., short for "Drift King," is the top racer in the area and the nephew of a local yakuza boss.  He's partners with Han and is obsessed with Neela, a peer of Sean's at school.  D.K. dislikes Sean immediately, noting Sean's interest in Neela and tensions between the two of them escalate throughout the movie, leading to the "climax" which is a night race down an extremely windy road out in the middle of nowhere.  The races in general are pretty entertaining and are a good length, time-wise.

This was a good flick with a few really excellent qualities.  The plot was a little hazy but there was one, and the characters were very well developed.  Just the Han character made it worth seeing, for me.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys action movies.  It was at last as good as the previous two movies in the series.
