Presently mired in infantile dreck like "Sydney White", the hugely talented Amanda Bynes must be counting down the days to 2011, when she will receive her first of two Oscars for Best Actress. Gazing in my crystal ball here, I see that in 2010 Amanda will have a small role in a Woody Allen film that consists of little more than Woody's inane musings. Her role, however however minuscule, prompts studios other than Disney to start taking her seriously, and she is offered a lead role opposite Jude Law in a gripping, heart-wrenching drama. The following February, she is standing onstage at the Kodak Theatre, having beat out Keira Knightley, Cate Blanchett, Judi Dench and Mary-Kate Olsen (don't ask). Until that glorious day, however, we are forced to watch our favourite actress attempting to slog through poorly-written, cliche-laden nonsense like "Sydney White." Although our Amanda gives it her usual 110%, the premise and script are so poor she might as well not have bothered. Seeing her in this film is like watching somebody attempt to go off-roading in a Rolls-Royce. A horrible, jaw-clenching waste. So in short, if you're an Amanda fan, skip this one, if you're Amanda, when Woody calls, pick up the phone on the first ring.
