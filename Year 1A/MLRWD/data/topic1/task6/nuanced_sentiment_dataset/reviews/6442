To begin with, I think it's important to say that I'm a huge Street Fighter II fan -- I have been for years.  Recently I acquired the Street Fighter Alpha movie from this website, and as a fan of Street Fighter II, was somewhat shocked.
The storyline is plain at best.  Ken meets up with Ryu in Japan, only to discover their former master has been killed.  Suddenly this kid shows up, tells Ryu he's his younger brother, and that they're from Brazil (yes, even though Ryu is Asian, he's in fact Brazilian).  Meanwhile, the "dark hadou" has been haunting him for months, and it will soon overcome him...
In comparison to the Street Fighter II series, this movie is garbage.  The animation isn't even that great -- again, I preferred that of Street Fighter II.  No, I don't buy that Ken's a blond, although it's interesting how in Alpha he suddenly turns into a pervert.  So, the storyline gets 2/5 stars, 'cause I'm a nice guy.
The one thing I didn't mind was the voice acting.  Ryu's and Ken's voice actors both do a terrific job, and everyone else is also very good.  Ken's voice actor, Steven Blum, plays Dhalsim in the original Street Fighter II, but he definitely grows as an actor between II and Alpha.  4/5 for the voice acting.
Despite the voice work, however, Street Fighter Alpha is not a movie that even the most zealous Street Fighter fan should bother with.  I was actually embarrassed to have watched it.  Save your money.
