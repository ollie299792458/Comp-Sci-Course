You could only expect to be entertained at a basic level by this wave of insipid, 13 year old girl-geared, teenybopper movies, and this one is no excetion. Pathetic acting from people who were only hired for looks, a plot full of huge holes, and too much eye candy abound. BUT, I have to admit it, on a purely campy, male-fantasy level, this is worth watching. Leave your analytical mind at the door, and just watch this for the sets, the clothes, the money, and the paraphernalia.  The set designer deserves most of the credit-the dramatic Skull sets are worth watching, along with the toney, spacious dorm rooms(they're ridiculously large and overly-furnished-ask any college kid). A particularly pleasing set is Caleb's bachelor pad-esque room, furnished to the nines beyond what any kid could afford. Of course, all of the sabbath-like rituals are undeniably appealing,the same goes for the GQ fashion and the extraneous skull props. So moviegoers, don't think at all on this one, it will just give you a headache, rather just watch it to imagine a life almost nobody can have.
