I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I love comedy, romance and action and this film delivers on all fronts in a light-hearted way. A good combination of a "not so bad guy", the "real" bad guy, the bumbling FBI agent and romance. For those of us who like action but not the blood and the gore this was great. The comedy bits as Pierce Brosnan plays off against Woody Harlson were hilarious, as was Woody's performance. Pierce Brosnan's dry wit and humour was great.  Underlying it all was romance and sensuality. I've read reviews which complained the film had too much sex.....The main characters are lovers in "retirement" living in paradise and planning to get married....that's a recipe for a lot of lovemaking. When two people are in love they make love....a lot, and it was clear that Brosnan and Selma had great on screen chemistry. The love scenes were tasteful, sensual with a touch of humour at times. It was enjoyable seeing the on screen love between the too main characters come out right through the movie.

I bought the movie on DVD and enjoyed all the great extras.  For those of you who like the special features on the DVD this DVD is chock full of them. The bloopers and gags are hilarious.
