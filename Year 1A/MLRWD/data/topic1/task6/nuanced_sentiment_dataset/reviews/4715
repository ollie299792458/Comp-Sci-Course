I sought out this movie based on a poster in a Quentin Tarantino film. I like things involving Native American culture and I like 70's flicks too, so I thought: "What a great combination?!" Unfortunately I got what I wished for. Don't get me wrong, this movie works in many ways for itself...I don't know really...I think what most got on my nerves was the campyness of it. Candice Bergen, although looking surprisingly sexy throughout, was REALLY annoying to me. -Her being so sassy for 90% of the film was one of the things that didn't work for me and the male lead was made to look like a complete pussy; another thing that didn't appeal to me.

Anyway, let me get down to what I did like: the score, cinematography, the excessive violence, and again; just the idea of this movie was good I thought. Again, Candice was looking smoking throughout.

Perfect if you wanted to do a tough chick cinema night w/ 'Coffy'.

The picture and sound of the DVD was awesome. No extras from what I remember. Not worth buying in my opinion but if you can rent it, I'd say it's worth it.
