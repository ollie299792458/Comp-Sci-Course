I've been waiting for this type of DVD to be released (c'mon, we all knew it was going to happen). My obsession with Glee is based 80% on the musical numbers and only 20% on the inane plot lines, so I really welcome the opportunity to pop a DVD in the player and watch nothing but singing/dancing. Since this has been my sole desire all along, I've refrained from buying the seasons, so, yes, I will probably purchase this item.

However, my big complaint is similar to the others I've read here - the producers of this DVD failed to select many of the musical numbers that *I* most wish to watch. How could they possibly overlook Neil Patrick Harris belting out Aerosmith's "Dream On"? Or a field of uniformed football jocks dancing along with "Single Ladies"?

In my opinion, the best part of the Glee merchandising mega-franchise are the CD recordings that allow us to hear the actors singing the FULL song versions, rather than the edited down bits and pieces that are necessary in order to cram 5 or 6 numbers into a 42 minute time slot. I would really love to see a DVD that features new and complete music videos, but I suppose the overworked and sore-footed cast has no time for this. They should put one out anyway, and just price the DVD at $100 to make up for the trouble. People would buy still buy it. Whiny pre-teens can be very persuasive.
