Yeah, the first season of MKR.  This is the first CLAMP series I watched, but not the first one I heard about (X1999).
Of course it IS different from the Manga, which partially makes me angry, but it still is similar enough for me to love it enough.  ^-^
This BoxSet layout kinda "bites." The box is cheap looking, but that really doesn't matter to me.  The DVD setup is hard to figure out for my computer's DVD drive.  The voice tracks won't change easily since they left subtitles on the Japanese opening--at least on the first disk; I just wanted to hear the Jap voices of Hikaru, Umi, Fuu, and Clef.
Overall, the series is good and I don't care about the content as much as I do the story. ^-^
My MK Rayearth rankings:
1: MKR Magna (Direct from CLAMP's minds, of course.)
2: MKR TV Season 1 (Yeah...it's BASED on the Manga by CLAMP)
3: Rayearth OVA (Screwed up; twisted revamp of the story.  Still cool.)
4: MKR TV Season 2 (Yet again BASED on the Magna; THEY CHANGED IT TOO MUCH FROM THE MANGA!)
