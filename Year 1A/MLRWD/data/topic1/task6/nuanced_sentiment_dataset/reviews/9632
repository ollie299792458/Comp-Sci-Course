Now, unlike most people, I don't consider this a romantic comedy, yes, there is a love story, but it's all about laughs. The story is about Ted, a guy who was in love with this girl Mary in high school. Mary asked Ted to the prom, but they couldn't make it, because Ted had some problems with his zipper. 13 years later, Ted still can't stop thinking about Mary, so he hires a private eye to spy on Mary. When the private eye first sees Mary, he falls in love with her, so when he reports back to Ted to tell him what he found out about Mary, he lies and says Mary is a whale in a wheel chair with 4 children. The detective then begins dating Mary, but Ted discovers that Mary is actually more beautiful than in high school. Mary discovers that the private eye is actually a murderer, so when she meets up with Ted she agrees to go out with him, and they begin spending alot of time together, until someone tells Mary that Ted hired a private eye to spy on her. This is a very funny movie, but some scenes were to over the top, such as the hair gel scene. But that scene aside, this is a great comedy.
