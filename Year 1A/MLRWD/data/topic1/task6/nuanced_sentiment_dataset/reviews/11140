The Mystery Science Theater 3000 TV series was one of the few truly unique (if not original) concepts to be brought to screen.  As a Minnesotan, I had the pleasure of enjoying the birth of the show when it aired on local television a few years before it was picked up by Comedy Central.  I loved it, and at the time, I loved the intro and skits that would bookmark and intermiss the movie.  I think it was a necessary part of introducing what was then a completely revolutionary form of entertainment.  The premise of a man stuck in space with robots forced to watch bad movies was wacky, but was cogesive enough to give the movie riffing a purpose.  It let us know who these people were and what they ere doing in the corner of my TV set.

However, as MST3K wore on, the skits became more of a distraction.  An awkward novelty like Michael Jordan playing baseball - not bad, but not what I came to see.  The skits were no longer relevent which made their increasing wackiness annoying and boring.  But the mold had been set and who wants to mess with a winning formula?

Which brings me to The Film Crew.  Following the same recipie, the guys stumble through a thin premise (fat, male Charlie's Angels - mission: movie riff) chock full of bad puns and worse acting.  I wish the Film Crew was a group of normal couch potato dudes being their funny selves.  Why the need for the zany misadventures of "characters" we don't know or care about.  MSTies already care about Mike, Kevin, and Bill just as they are - I wish that is what they gave us.

The riffing itself on this episode is juvenille and ininspired.  I have seen other Film Crew episodes that were very funny, but this one fell flat.  I purchased it sight unseen in good faith, but I was disappointed.
