It is hard to imagine a more square, less "on-the-bus" narrative of Kesey & the Pranksters than this film. It is as if it were produced by Nancy Reagan.

Kesey, Cassidy, the Pranksters, even Allen Ginsberg are all painted in a condescending light as a bunch of drug addicts and losers.

The footage of Neal Cassidy (which is one of the only reasons to watch this film) is almost all sped up so we rarely get to see him as he was. We only hear about him being a speed freak and then watch sped up footage of him acting accordingly.

The sad-sack lame light that Kesey is put in for not completing a third Great American Novel is ludicrous. How many people write one novel on the level of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"?

The movie barely gives any context to the trip the Pranksters took.  And if you are looking for a modicum of intelligent thought on the use of psychedelics then you should read Robert Anton Wilson and let this movie rot in the Netflix trash heap.
