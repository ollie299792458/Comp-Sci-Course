The other day I watched part of "Lake Placid II" on the Sci-Fi network and it was really bad. Well, probably much worse than that.  Actually it was unwatchable.
The killer croc storyline's been done many times but only once or twice decently.  If you know anything about croc movies than you realize I'm referring to the fabulous "Alligator" and the above average "Lake Placid".
Part of the problem with Primevil is that there's too much going on, diverges in too many directions, and often leaves viewers somewhat lost. The film takes itself rather seriously and suffers from  a lack of consistent tone,  humour, & focus.  On the upside the violence when it presents itself is often extremely brutal and unrelentling & the CGI, above average in most scenes, manages to convey the "monster" to good effect. I still wasn't able to discern if this was a monster flick, a war thriller, or a statement film proselytizing on the politics of Africa?  It's a little hard to follow frankly but I guess that's not of huge importance since I found myself shamelessly enjoying the film. Remember the movie Anaconda?  Well if you're reading this review then of course you do.  At any rate  I pretty much hated that film but found this to be interesting & kind of weird where Anaconda was just derivative & cheesy.  For fans of  "Jaws", Primevil ain't a bad popcorn event.  For fans of "Tentacles" (yes, with Shelley Winters) this will be an almost memorable way to spend two hours.
