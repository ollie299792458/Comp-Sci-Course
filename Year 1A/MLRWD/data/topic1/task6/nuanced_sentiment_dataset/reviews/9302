I really wanted to like this collection.  I've been a Hornblower fan since the 70's when I stayed up late to watch the original movie.  I have read and re-read every Hornblower story, including the unfinished novel.  This collection, I regret to say, is not Hornblower.  I fully expect changes to the story for a film version (even C.S.Forester approved of the 1951 movie), but the character of Midshipman Hornblower is wrong.  In Even Chance, Hornblower risks his life on the spin of a coin. Life or death, an empty or loaded gun.  This sets the tone of the Hornblower character: calculated risk.  In this collection, his second knocks him on the head and takes his place!  This is only the beginning of the "Hollywood" Hornblower.  I won't bore you with nit-picking the stories; suffices to say, if you love Hornblower, don't watch this collection.  Read the books again and re-watch the 1951 movie.  If you've never encountered Hornblower before, you may enjoy the visual aspects and high seas adventure of the films, but even a landlubber knows you don't stand behind a cannon when it's fired!
