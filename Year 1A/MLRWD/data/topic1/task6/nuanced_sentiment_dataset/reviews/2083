To be pleased by this film would mean that you never saw the first 8 and know nothing about Jason Voorhees. Here are the biggest fumbles of the film (possible spoilers):

1. They never explain how he got back to the Jason we all know and love or how he got back to Camp Crystal Lake (if you remember in part 8 he was turned back into a child by a wave of toxic waste in a New York City sewer). In the first 8 installments of the series they always explain how he came back to life, no matter how ridiculous and implausible the circumstances were.

2. Jason now has a sister, even though in the first film his mother says he was an only child.

3. We learn that Jason can only be killed or reborn by the hands of a Voorhees woman. In part 4 Tommy Jarvis kills jason and in part 6 Tommy Jarvis accidently brings him back to life.

Not only does this film ignore every other installment, but it doesn't even deliver on the Jason front. There's maybe 10 minutes of classic hockey mask wearing Jason action, the rest he's inhabiting the bodies of others and it just doesn't work.

Any good in this movie? Yes. KNB FX did a great job on the gore. I'd go so far as saying it's some of the best looking gore in the entire series. Also, watch out for references to other horror films including Evil Dead, Creepshow, and A Nightmare On Elm St.
