Kevin Costner plays a divorced father who is now living with his two children in a lovely old house with spacious grounds. On the grounds is a large mound which turns out to have great significance for this family as it had for the previous owners.
  I liked this movie for the same reason that some did not. It builds very carefully to the horrifying end. If you have ever been truely horrified at something, you know that at first your mind rejects what is happening. Costner gradually becomes more and more alarmed as the evidence of something very bad builds-especially as it affects his children, particularly his young teen aged daughter.
  I have never seen Costner play a freightened character before and he was absolutely terrific as he tries to cope and keep a handle on mundane reality while becoming more and more terrified.
  For me the movie succeeds on its own terms. In other words it does not presume to be great "art". It is intended as an absorbing horror mystery and succeeds as quite good entertainment.
