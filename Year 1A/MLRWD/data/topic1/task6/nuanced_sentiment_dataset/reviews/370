I love John Cusack and was excited when I found this movie. Somehow I missed it when it came out(I think I know why now though).

It tries to be a prequel to Grosse Pointe Blank but fails miserably.

The film's direction is absolutely unbearable. You go here and there and all as fast as possible but without reason. Every line is some kind of political jab that is as obvious as what you expect from a high school student's creative writing paper.

There are moments when the satire does come through but the sloppiness of the writing ruins the film. I will be honest, I did not watch the whole movie. Ten minutes in I was checking my watch. Thirty minutes in I started using fast forward to jump ahead. Finally the nightmare was over and I could take it out of the dvd player.

I do not see how anyone could sit through this whole movie. The actors are good, I have no problem with political satire when done well but it is the writing that is horrible. It's a poorly executed mess. That's probably why it was shelved for several years before finally seeing a small theatrical release and why I never heard of it during that time and recently discovering it. Someone looked at the shelf and decided they spent a lot of money on it, no one remembered it so maybe they should see if they could put JC's photo on the front and sell some to get their money back. A very American problem is shown here, get it out the door and who cares how good it is. If this is the best job the editors could do with it then I would hate to see what the original few cuts looked like. Because this is awful.

I loved Grosse Point Blank. Do not waste your time with War Inc and watch GPB instead.
