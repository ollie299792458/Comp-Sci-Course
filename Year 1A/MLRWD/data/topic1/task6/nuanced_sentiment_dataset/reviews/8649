If you've only heard about FUNNY FACE, you really owe yourself to SEE it with your own eyes for the first time - and now that you can buy the DVD at Target for like $5 clams, why not?  There are many great old-school "Golden Age" musical numbers on display here, from THINK PINK to BONJOURS PARIS (filmed in various locales around the City of Lights, sorta like a fashion-magazine inversion of ON THE TOWN), and especially the cool-cat beatnik dance number Hepburn does in the bohemian bar - *you'll note that THE GAP recently used clips from this celebrated sequence in their "Skinny Black Pant" ads set to, of all things, Back in Black by AC/DC! - but here is the original, and it's sublime - you are amazed how expertly Audrey hoofs it up in gay Paris!  The direction is flawless, especially several auteur touches, like the stop-motion photographer during the Givenchy outdoor photoshoot, and the one dance sequence in Astair-cum-Avedon's photo darkroom only lit by one tiny red bulb...now that's TECHNICOLOR! While the films' gender politics have dated, this was filmed in a different era and much more conversative sensibility, so cut the movie some slack. This is a gorgeous, timeless musical that could use a contemporary update by a major studio - hello?!
