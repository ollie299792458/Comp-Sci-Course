My husband I ordered this movie based on all the glowing reviews here. We quickly instituted the 20-minute rule for this one. Which means that if a movie isn't going anywhere or getting any better after 20 minutes, it generally never will. Any time I've flouted this rule, I've found myself wasting two hours of my life.

From the outset we couldn't hear 80 percent of what the actors said. As another reviewer noted, it's not the accents, it's just really poor sound quality. We had the volume turned up all the way and maybe caught every fifth word or so. We generally had no clue as to what was transpiring on an auditory level. That was frustrating enough, but even the visuals were bewildering - the chaotic scenes and jerking camera got tiring quickly. It's like a homemade video by an overeager, drunken Uncle Bob trying out his new recorder.

I am honestly perplexed by the the endless rave reviews here, but to each their own. Hopefully our local library will be as glad to get this donation as we are to get rid of it.
