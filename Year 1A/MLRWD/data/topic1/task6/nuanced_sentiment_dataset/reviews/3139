A.I was a film that Spielberg never meant to make
But the fact that he did is not a mistake
It was the film Stanley Kubrick had running in his veins
(Kubrick made 2001 and in his Shining Jack Nicholson went insane)
But Kubrick died before realizing his vision
Of the android boy with a seemingly real emotion
Let me just say, this film is impressive
In scope, in vision, Spielberg is not submissive
To the aspects of this story that run beyond his realm
And could have been excised with this man at the helm
But this film is made with integrity and wonder
And an appetite of the imagination that never comes asunder.
The boy is a construct in a future where the oceans have risen
Populations must be limited, one must be approved to have children
Androids are functional, filling gaps for the lonely and rich
They can look like humans or a teddy bear that knows how to stitch
But they are only as real as the programming within
Until David is built and so an incredible journey begins
The story comments on this future, it questions its morality
And explores the human fear if this were a reality
The look of the film is dark and possible
Rich with both colorless and colorful
The effects are sweeping, an achievement of our day
But not overwhelming  to disenchant or dismay
They are elements of the story but not pillars of it
And provide the real sense of one future unfit.
Haley Joel Osment is no less than outstanding
Such talent so young, it is rich and rewarding
This film relies on the character being more than assembled parts
But less than real, making us question the instinct of our hearts
It as a pleasure to witness and experience his portrayal
Of a machine searching for answers to a cruel betrayal
That asked him to be real and punished him for failing
And we are witness to the quest of the boy, assailing
A path both fantastical and beyond imagination
Helped by friends of earlier creation.
It must be said that this movie is truly bold
Spielberg is faithful to the way Kubrick would have told
This surprising tale of something as innocent as love
But becomes a story, skillfully rising above
Clich&eacute;s and clumsy tokens of tired stories
Mired in character shells and general inability's
To be original, sharp and honest with intent
To be just a story with greatness inherent
A.I marches beyond most movies in the last ten years
And when they come, they are most definitely real tears.
