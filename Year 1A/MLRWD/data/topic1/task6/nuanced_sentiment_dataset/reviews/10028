"State of Play" is an especially good movie.  Kevin McDonald ("Last King of Scotland") directs a tale of intrigue, excitement and suspense set in Washington D.C.  This is a tale of power and corruption that involves mega corporations, government employees,  and members of Congress.

Veteran journalist Cal McAffrey (brilliantly played by Russell Crowe) stumbles onto a story that involves his former college roommate and now U. S. Congressman Stephen Collins (played by Ben Affleck).  McAffrey fights constant pressure from his editor
Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren) who is trying to save her newspaper from bankruptcy,

As Cal begins to investigate,  cub reporter Della Frye (Rachael McAdams) harasses him for information she needs for a different scoop that may involve his Congressman friend.  Della, the newspapers blogger, has Cameron Lynne's support.  Should Cal trust Della to avoid Tattler tactics and emphasize factual reporting instead?

"State of Play", while enticing us with political and corporate greed and corruption, baits us with subplots detailing the threat to traditional newspapers, and the sexual gamesmanship of congressional power brokers.  Who can Cal trust when seeking the  truth?  Will Cal threaten his long friendship with Congressman Collins while digging for details involving the death of the Congressman's aide?  Can the newspaper survive against corporate pressure to put profits ahead of impartial reporting?

This film presents a realistic political plot with great acting and superior settings.  "State of Play" is such a masterful mystery, it becomes a film one would enjoy viewing several times. I highly recommend "State of Play".
