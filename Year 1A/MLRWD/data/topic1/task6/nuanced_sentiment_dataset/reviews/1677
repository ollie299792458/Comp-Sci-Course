The british comedian Sacha baron cohen disguises as three different  tv reporters , a hip hop reporter Ali G , a reporter from Kazakhstan Borat and a fashion reporter from Austria Bruno , and interviews people . taking advantage of their hospitality and good will by acting silly and stupid infront of them ,to see how far would they tolerate him . Ali G asks stupid questions from a gangsta point of view , Borat questions comes from an extreme consevative and right wing point of veiw and Bruno is left with gay jokes .

Some times it's funny , some times smart , but most of the time it's just being rude . Sacha never gets out of his disguise at all , which takes away the fun from his  different version of candid camera . You end up feeling sorry for the people he interviews instead of laughing at them , and at the same time respecting them for tolerating Mr. Cohen and not kicking him out of the room . what shocked me the most is that he thinks the reason for their tolerance is their disregard for todays youth , as he said in the commentary for the first episode . by the way  , it's a commentary for one episode only , the first one  , and no more.

A set of four cd's , three episode each , plus extra footage from season one and two .

And yes , Borat is the favorite character .
