Following the death of her husband, Corrine takes her children to her childhood home and locks her children in an upstairs room while trying to win back her father's love and to get back into his will after marrying a man who was her own half uncle. She tells the children it won't be for long but it ended up being several years. Four siblings are forced to share a bedroom and attic that becomes their playground. The Grandmother, knowing about the children, keeps the secret from her husband as well but is cold towards them, often hoping to find them in committing some sort of sinful act. She calls the children demon spawns being that they are the product of an uncle and niece. The children however and not evil but normal children trying to get along and survive on their own.

This is a very poor adaptation of the book but it may be up to the individual to decide if they like the movie or not. I can say for myself that I do not like it all that much but will watch it on occasion if I find it on tv. The movie is loosely based on the book and some parts simply don't match up, especially the ending which makes it seem like the three remaining siblings walk out the front door and live happily ever after once their mother dies. In the book they sneak out and their mother is quite alive until the third book.
