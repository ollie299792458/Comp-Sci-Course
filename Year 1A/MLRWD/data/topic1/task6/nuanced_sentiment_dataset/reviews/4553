First off i like the "deep" "art like" type movies just like the next guy but this movie just had me wishing it would end. The plot and characters were like.... annoying...i think thats the best word to use. I GAVE my DVD copy away to someone as soon as it ended (i had to talk them into it mind you). This is just another example of Holloywood falling in love with a movie/director/actor  and no matter what junk they make, its always "thumps up". Lets not mention how the heck did DelTorro get the best supporting actor award?...did my copy have like 20 or 30 minutes of some outstanding performance footage that was missing on it? Hey i even like the guy but he was in the movie only for some short time and his performance was like anyone elses in the movie...average at best. Someone tell me at what part in the movie did he perform such a powerful scene that you were left with your mouth open?...can someone tell me?. Well i guess this was just one  of those "overated movies of 2000." it seems to me none of the movies that were up for "Best Movie of the Year" deserved to be there. Hollywood is just running out of ideas.
