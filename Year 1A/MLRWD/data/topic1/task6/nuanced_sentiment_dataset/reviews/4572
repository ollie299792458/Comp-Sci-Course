I really like Kate Winslet. I mean, I really, really like her. She's got charisma, depth, a 'feel' for her roles, and great timing and delivery. I rented this movie because she was in it. With all that said, we, my wife and I, gave up after 42 minutes. Her performance *was* excellent, but it couldn't overshadow the director's trudging portrayal of the obnoxious and darker side of human nature.

This movie just did absolutely nothing through 40 minutes except set the stage for an obvious upcoming affair between Winslet and her male interest. Whatever else follows--who cares? The characters have so few redeeming qualities, the only reason to see the film was to study the talent of the performers; and that wasn't enough reason for us. While I'm *sure* there are lots of folks out there who behave and think as portrayed by these drones, there's no reason to study them. The "Frontline" narrative did absolutely nothing; someone said it was a ploy of genius, enabling the filmmaker to detach the viewer from sloppy emotional portrayals. We only felt that the narrative was redundant; its' monotone may have quelled emotion for some, but for us, all it did was add an element of extraneous background chatter. If a film about the nuances of daily suburban life can be called "entertainment" then the morbid curiousity fulfilled by divulged details in newspaper reports of accidents, suicides, infidelity, murders, et. al. will qualify as well, and waste less time while at least maintaining *some* small sense of relevance to the 'life's reality' because at least they're factual incidents, too.
