In the fight scene between him and Borgnine in the alley did they use real switchblades? Method actors insist on doing the real thing so much while making movies it's hard to say. If it did the scene the scene takes on a real life significance in a bad way. Also, did Clift really dig that hole himself that his Pruitt character is forced to dig as punishment? And what about Clift's violent fight scene with John Dennis? The real thing again? If so boy are most method actors crazy.

As for the rest of the film well it is believable enough. Some vagueness here and there. Is that really his captain/her husband

Lancaster sees coming while him and Kerr are listening to the excellent Hawaiin band? We aren't sure. It could just be a guy that looks like her husband. I love Donna Reed especially in this movie. Her dance hall girl character is sexy and appealing. I love the Pearl Harbor attack. Very believable in the way it is handled. Lancaster is brilliant to watch as always.
