I first saw this movie on AMC about a 1/4 of the way through and next thing I know was ordering it from Amazon. As other reviewers have said the movie moves slow and for good reason. Not only do we get to know the characters but it also captures the mood of the old west and makes you feel as though you are on those long and lonesome cattle drives.
The scenery is beautiful and the performances are all superb. Costner is excellent as the strong, silent cowboy and Duvall excellent(as usual) as the weathered cattle boss (has there ever been a better cowboy? with apologies to the Duke and Clint)
Briefly, Open Range tells the story of a free grazing cattleman(Duvall) and his hands, who run afoul of a corrupt local land owner(another great performance by Michael Gambon) who fences in the land and decides the best fate for the free grazers is death and the stealing of their herd.
When two of the hands are attacked they decide to take a stand and fight.
The film ends with hands down the best and most realistic gun-fight ever filmed. All in all a top notch western and well worth watching.
