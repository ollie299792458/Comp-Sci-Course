The onslaught of defensive comments about the movie brought my reviewing score down. That's okay.  I still stand by my commentary. Blood and guts don't a movie make. A brilliant story-line does.

Have all your buddies make comments and lower my reviewer reliability score - or - hey - make a better film next time. Brilliant.

OK, at first I thought this was a slapstick type comedy, so I was not sure what to expect.  At least - I thought - it would be in the same category as The Full Monty - English humor and great, authentic acting.

But, it looks like the Hollywood influence kept this movie from being as funny and and as entertaining as it could have been.  The acting was okay, but the story should have been the strongest feature.

Instead the producers made it all about the blood and the violence.  And I am not sure if I do not "get" the British humor in it, but I think that it could have been funny and witty without all the violence that went on and on and on.....

Again, maybe I just did not "get it" but I left the film feeling like it was a bloodgasm - rather than a real film. Have the English stooped that low - to compete with Hollywood?

Because of the responses, I must update my review.  The film was not funny or meaningful.  Period.  It was not the Full Monty and never will be.  Defend it if you may - if you are a self appointed film critic or cop tough guy.  The film was not good.  It sucked bad.  Very bad.
