But that was unavoidable regardless of how many actors they decided to cram into the cast. Aside from the desperate cast and severely underwhelming plot, a few trivial details caught my eye, like Julia Roberts wearing earrings in ACUs. I'm a civilian and even I know that's incorrect. Then there's the fact that almost all of the "main" actresses are beautiful and non-Black women with big lips, like they thought that would make up for the overall lameness. Seriously, look at the actresses: there's Julia and her niece Emma(not so much her though), Jessica Alba, Jennifer Garner, Anne Hathaway.... I half expected Scarlett and Angelina to have a small cameo just to show off their physical anomalies. Also, I already knew Taylor Swift would annoy me yet I was surprised to find that witnessing her attempt to act was like nails on a chalk board. While watching this movie I unfortunately developed an acute case of ADHD and could hear and see everything around me except the tv...soooo I missed the surely sappy and irritating ending. I just should have heeded my intuition.
