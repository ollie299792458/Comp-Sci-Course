I just purchased the DVD tonight after looking for it for some time. It was well worth the money. While I can't say anything at all for the black and white version I can say that the colorized one was very good - next to excellent.
I did however review the black and white promo for the film and it was very bad - sad. I wonder if the black and white film was as bad as someone had mentioned? He should get a better DVD player or just watch it in color and stop crying like a baby... get REAL!
The color in a few situations (times) did seem to flutter some
but when you consider the age of the film and all who can truly complain? Its sad that films with this heart and true feeling aren't made anymore. The demand is still there but Hollywood has forgotten what it means to take the time to make a lasting film that will stand the tests of time as this one has....
All actors were surperb in their unique roles. I espcially enjoyed the antics of the Grandfather and his gruff ways and the befuddled expressions on the butler Arthur Treacher...  the old woman that overlooked the care of the young girl was a true classic too.
Does she need a girls night out or what? Talk about your biddies!
I can't help but wonder.... was this Arthur Treacher guy anyway associated with a fast food (seafood) place of the same name?
I guess maybe its just my wild imagination running loose again....
