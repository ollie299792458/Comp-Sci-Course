You can find some of this from other sources, but Fawn Brodie's (a former history professor from UCLA) Jefferson biography "Jefferson, an intimate history" is so well-researched, you should start there.

First, Sally Hemings was Jefferson's wife's half-sister. Knowing that, I think every question about the Hemings/Jefferson relationship is resolved.

Sally Hemings and Martha Jefferson had the same father....John Wayles.

The excerpt below is from the National First Ladies' Library website:
When Martha Eppes married John Wayles, she brought with her, as part of her dowry, an African slave woman and the woman's half-black, half-white daughter. The woman, enslaved in Africa, sailed to Virginia on a slave ship commanded by an English sea captain with the last name Hemings. Captain Hemings impregnated the slave who gave birth to a daughter she named Betty. The slave and her daughter were sold to Francis and Frances Eppes, and they gave the young enslaved "Betty Hemings" to their daughter Martha Eppes family. When Captain Hemings learned that the newly married Wayles had inherited his concubine and their daughter Betty, he offered to buy the pair. Wayles refused to sell them. He would eventually have six children by her.

One of those children was Sally Hemings, the 1/4 black, 3/4 white, half-sister of Thomas Jefferson's much-loved and long-dead wife, Martha, to whom he had promised never to remarry.

Second, Jefferson's mentor George Wythe was murdered by a grand-nephew (arsenic poisoning) when he learned that Wythe's will gave the housekeeper, a slave who Wythe had freed, and Michael Brown (their child?) a large part of his estate. It is suggested that the public uproar (more over their relationship than his murder) was an influence on how Jefferson dealt with his own situation at Monticello.

The fact that Burns chose to exclude these events and relationships, it was a disappointment.
