"Beyond Borders" is one of my favorite movie of all time. I also love Kingdom of Heaven, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean or Munich.

But this movie has something. I borrowed it almost one/two year ago from Blockbuster (and now I own it on DVD). I saw King Arthur and felt in love with Clive Owen. So I wanted to watch more movies with him.

This movie is absolutly amazing. It shows you the poorness in other countries. Next to it, there is a wonderful love story. But the love story is not overdone. It has the right touch for the movie.

The acting is breathtaking. Clive Owen cries a few times in this movie - an actor who can crie (it is unusual). I completly felt in love with his character Nick - the second he appeared on screen. Also Angelina is amazing.

It is sad that this movie did not get much attention in theater. I missed the movie in theater, because I did not knew of this movie.

I would give Clive, Angelina and the movie an Oscar.

I think it is a must see movie. Watch it. It is breathtaking.
