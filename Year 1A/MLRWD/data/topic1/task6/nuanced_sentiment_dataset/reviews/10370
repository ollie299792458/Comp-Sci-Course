I welcomed this film with open arms and an open mind.  The Western is a fading genre, and I hadn't seen a good modern example of one since Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven."  The actors in The Missing are talented and respected by many.  Tommy Lee Jones fits perfectly in a Western film, and Cate Blanchett really surprised me.  She played the part of a strong, single frontier mother quite well.  The storyline is intriguing:  A brutal, psychotic Native man and his band are kidnapping young women and selling them in Mexico.  Cate Blanchett's character loses one of her daughters, and her estranged father (Tommy Lee Jones) offers to help track the girl down.

The setting is beautiful.  The action is thrilling, and frequent.  The first hour is engrossing and had me glued to my chair.  Then, the plot begins to stutter.  The two main characters abandon their initial plan of attack in favor of a string of ill-conceived ones.  And find themselves in a battle with black magic hocus-pocus.  After this plunge into the ridiculous, director/producer Ron Howard is unable to bring the film back up into believability.  He made the mistake of many first-time Western producers.  He abandoned raw simplicity for gimmickry.  That said, I hope he tries again.  Howard's next Western could be great.
