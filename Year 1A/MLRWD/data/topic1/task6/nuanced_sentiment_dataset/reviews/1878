To truly appreciate this film, which is really a great sci-fi classic, one MUST see it in 3D.  Given the new technologies available, and the fact that the film was shot in a 3D process using side by side cameras, there's no reason why Universal cannot make this available on DVD in 3D.  The film is often an allegory for the political issues of the time it was made.  The creature lurking below could be seen as a symbol of 'the invisible enemy' that confronted America, namely Communism.  Many films of the time, especially science fiction films, reflected the nervousness, even paranoia that affected the general public about the red menace.  It can also be scene as a classic re-invention of Beauty and the Beast, which is really my favorite interpretation of the story, but of course, this one contains a strong sexual element not present in the original.  Everyone wants Julie Adams!  But it's the creature who grabs for her, and carries her away.  I first saw this as a kid when it was first released, and all these years later, it still has the power to thrill me.
