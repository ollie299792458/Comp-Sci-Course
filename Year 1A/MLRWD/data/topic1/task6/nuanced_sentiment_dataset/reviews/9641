This movie was a pointless waste of film stock. I had heard many great things about this movie, and expected to rent it and be faced with an intelligent, provocative portrait of humanity. I got soft-core Mexican porn with no story.
Every character in this movie irritated me. Both the boys were immature, hypocritical and annoying. I hated them both. Also, that is not how seventeen year old boys act, no matter what their nationality. Luisa was a sad degenerate who was just as pathetic as anybody else in the film. Well, that's just my opinion.
I didn't mind the sex, but after a while it got incredibly predictable, and very annoying. For a film, the sex was very natural, but it never added anything to develop characters or bring the story along.
What bothered me most about this mess of a movie was the lack of plot. Nothing really happened. The film skips from sex scene to sex scene on a web of juvenile jokes and mindless exposition. These are occasionally mixed with totally pointless gross-out scenes, like when both boys "help themselves" on diving boards over a pool. Character developement? Not here. When a revelation finally comes, you already guessed it twenty minutes ago and you don't care.
By far the best part of this movie was the narrator. The crystal-clear lucidity he brought to moments in the film was beautiful, especially in the end. His omniscient commentary almost makes the movie worth watching, but there just isn't enough of it. Before the narrator speaks, the sound cuts out abruptly, jarring the viewer out of the flow of the film. The first time it happened I thought there was something wrong with my DVD player.
Overall, a very bad and over-hyped movie. Don't waste your time or money.
