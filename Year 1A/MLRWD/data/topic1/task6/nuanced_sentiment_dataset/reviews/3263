Really the main matches to watch are

1.Goldberg vs. Chris Jericho-Overall its a pretty slow match but there are so high spots like where goldberg spears threw the baracade.

2.Shawn Micheals vs. Ric Flair-This match was actually better than i thought once again having some high spots like the splash through the table to ric flair for the top rope but the ending was gay when orton hit micheals with the chair will the referee is out i think it should have been a better ending.

3.HELL IN A CELL HHH VS. KEVIN NASH-In my opionion one of the best hell in a cells in my book it could have been better like if they had of got out of the cell and used a annoucers table or used a table in the cell but anyways they used a lot of weapons like barbedwire baseball bat, steps, chair, sledgehammer,a wooden crat,a screwdriver, the cell and a shot from a hammer that questions if nash used blading during the match it is sick and its good how mick foley gets involved during the match. Overall, the match i would give it a 9/10

The whole paper view i give a 7.5/10 really the last three matches is the only thing to watch unless u get bored
