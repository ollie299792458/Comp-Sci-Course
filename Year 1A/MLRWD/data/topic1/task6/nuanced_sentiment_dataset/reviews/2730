Actually, don't let my two-star rating mislead you: The acting is very
strong in this film, but the story and plot are so utterly and
atrociously defective, misguided and self-gratifying as to render the
entire exercise pointless and the viewer wholly unfulfilled.

When you begin to wish death on the leading character within 20 minutes
of the film's exposition, you become aware that you're consumed not
with the story, but the protagonist's (read: antagonist's) immediate
and violent demise.

When I saw Page in "Juno" I thought she acted too old for the
character's age; too self-assured and mature. In this case (now playing
a 14-year-old) the disparity between age and behavior/language is even
greater.

And when this little 14-year-old behaves as if the likelihood of her
being caught is a patent impossibility (as if instructed by the script)
and is always--and without exception--a step ahead of a seemingly
cautious and highly intelligent adult, one can only question the
scriptwriter.

This film disallows suspension of disbelief. A colossal and unmitigated
failure of film-making.

***SPOILER ALERT***

1. How does she find the man in an otherwise anonymous
chat room in the first place?

2. How does she move his limp body, not
just onto a chair, but onto a table? Let alone hanging from a cross
beam? Beyond absurd.

3. How does she not electrocute herself with the stun gun if both are
covered in water from the shower?

4. Where did she learn to handle a
gun so deftly (you can read about gun skills on the web all you want,
but actually holding and operating a heavy pistol is another matter)?

5. Do you think a pedophile would be stupid enough to "hide" a safe in
his coffee table and be such an insufferable fool as to use his chat
room handle as the code?

Brian Nelson (the screenwriter): SHUT UP.
