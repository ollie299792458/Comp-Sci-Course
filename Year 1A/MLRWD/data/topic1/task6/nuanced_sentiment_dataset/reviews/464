Some times you pick a great movie, a lot of times you pick a good movie and sometimes you pick a movie that turns your stomach and makes you determined never to do something again (in this time go to the hospital for a routine procedure).

On the back of this DVD box is a quote "Reminiscent of a really great Twilight Zone". Now I love The Twilight Zone and there were many great ones...this doesn't even come close, nor should it be counted in the same ballpark, it is an insult to Rod Serling. I politely suggest that Pete Hammond of Maxim go back and watch some Twilight Zones...

This movie starts on in a somewhat mundane fashion...the main character wakes up just before hitting the ground in a falling dream. It is his 40th birthday and we are told by his loving wife that the procedure the next day is routine and he shouldn't worry. They allude to this dreaded procedure several times before we learn it is a colonoscopy.

He has the procedure, but when he wakes up we are lost trying to figure out what has happened and is happening to poor George Grieves...This movie is not for those with a weak stomach (I finally left the room and told my husband I had had enough). I did come back for the end. While I am now terrified of having a routine procedure done in the hospital (in spite of 5 surgeries in the last 13 years that went well), this movie is best forgotten in my humble opinion.

I put it out here for two reasons though:

1. Just in case your curiosity is peaked and you want to know what grosses me out.

2. In case you were thinking about renting it, buying it, watching it and are now grateful that you know enough to stay the heck away;)
