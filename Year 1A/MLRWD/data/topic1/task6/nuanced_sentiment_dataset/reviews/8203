Chinese Americans often object to the Charlie Chan movies, but i think the early ones can be defended. Warner Oland looked a bit Chinese & had spent much of his career playing Oriental characters. He hardly required any make-up at all. The crafty Chinese detective was the hero. Keye Luke, who played #1 son Lee was Chinese.

But, with the Fox-produced Sidney Toler Chan movies (which begin on DVD with this collection), the complaints really gain substance. Toler didn't look remotely Chinese & a lot of make-up was required. Jimmy Chan, #2 son (played by a young Chinese actor) is an annoying, bumbling fool whom Charlie Chan often treats with contempt. Fox studios never even considered casting a Chinese actor as Charlie Chan. Toler was a very fine actor, but his portrayal of Charlie Chan was based on the Warner Oland character, more than the original Charlie Chan character of the books. Toler's Chan doesn't have a gun and seems to often shrink from physical violence or even physical contact.

I MUCH prefer the Oland films!

However, on the "up" side: the production values in these films is better than the earlier ones, the writing is good, the acting is good. For some "Charlie Chan at Treasure Island" (included here) is considered a high point in the entire Chan series.
