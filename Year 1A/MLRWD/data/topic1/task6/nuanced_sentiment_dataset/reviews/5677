I really had been looking forward to this movie, and expected a lot better of it. Yes, the acting was passable, and the writing was interesting- but it made for interesting historical fiction. It was certainly based on the lives of real people, but the comparison with reality ended there. It became more a propagandistic whitewash of true events, not corresponding to historical criticism, the Qur'an, or the Hadith. For an interesting story, it's OK. But for a movie that claims to be history it falls far short.

There are glaring omissions throughout the movie- such as the wives and concubines of Mohammed (pbuh), Mohammed's (pbuh) raids during the months of truce, and the raids he initiated on caravans throughout the year, the Battle of the Trench, and the presence of strong Jewish tribes in Yathrib (later Medina). Often issues that would not paint a sympathetic view of Mohammed (pbuh) were obscured or left out. The movie suggests that the followers of Mohammed (pbuh) would not initiate attacks and tried to avoid fighting- but this directly contradicts the historical record, the Qur'an, and the Hadith! Indeed, the Muslims became strong through the acquiring of wealth from raids, an accepted practice of the time, as long as it did not occur during the months of truce. The movie portrays his followers as going so far as to say that they are men of peace. At the same time the attacks on Mohammed's (pbuh) followers in Mecca are greatly exaggerated, as there is little evidence of real physical persecution. In the movie Mohammed (pbuh) is seen immediately as the leader of all of Medina, with all Medinans immediately submitting to Islam. But the town was called Yathrib, a Jewish name, for a reason- the Jewish tribes remained there until they were expelled much later by the Muslims. And Mohammed (pbuh) was seen as the leader of his followers only and as an unbiased arbitrator within Yathrib for a long time, as first among chiefs rather than ruler, gaining true civil authority only towards the end of his life.

Lastly the act of not showing the image or displaying the voice of Mohammed (pbuh) greatly detracts from the artistic merit of the movie, making many scenes confusing and frankly silly, as everyone looks in the direction of the camera for the unseen audience to respond. The end result is ironically to create an almost god-like portrayal of Mohammed (pbuh) as he is an unseen powerful presence throughout the movie.

If you are looking to spend an evening viewing fiction and only have to spend a couple bucks, this movie is OK. But if you want to truly understand Islam, I'd recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0940368323">the Qur'an</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1930943024">the Hadith</a>, and Montgomery Watt's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198810784">Mohammed</a>.
