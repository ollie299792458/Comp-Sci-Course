OK...what can I say that hasn't been covered in the 600 other reviews of this movie??  I found it to be very funny...Cohen skewers anybody and everybody...he is an equal opportunity offender....there is no political bias here as some have claimed...only a "stupid" bias...If you're stupid and ignorant he is going to make fun of you...
The movie is a well done mix of both actual candid moments and staged moments and you often ask yourself---"Was that real or staged??"  It is sometimes hard to tell...though I suspect more of it was staged than most people realize it is still realistic enough to make me want to hide behind my couch for eye-gougingly embarassing moments that his actions cause...I am shocked he didn't get beaten up or worse....It takes either great courage or great insanity to pull off what he did here and though you won't be watching this movie over and over for its nuances, editing, and storywriting, its club you over the head, "I can't believe they are showing/doing that" humor is certainly worth watching at least once...
