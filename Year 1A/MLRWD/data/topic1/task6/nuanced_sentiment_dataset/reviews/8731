First off, I'm not going to give you a detailed synopsis of the movie because I hate it when people tell you the entire movie and don't leave much to a review...
I had sent away for this movie after hearing these reviews.  All I really wanted to see was this "disturbing ending."  While watching the movie, I wasn't sure how the ending would make up for the laughable acting in the movie.  The opening sequence is decent (speedboad accident, killing Angela's Father and "brother"), yet the acting, from the two teens in the boat, is funny.  8 years later, Angela goes to camp with her foul mouthed cousin Ricky.  She now lives with her cousin and Aunt.  Her acting is quite questionable.  Since Angela is quiet, the kids pick on her only to be offed by a mysterious killer.  The killings are pretty good.  Since it's the '80's there aren't the quick "MTV" cuts and jumps that horror movies have now, but they're not bad.  I was especially impressed by the makeup in the movie.  You can tell the budget is low and they worked well with what they had, better than most movies that have bigger budgets.  This movie does not hold off, in children/teen/preteen deaths.  Almost all the people killed are in their early teens and some are younger.  Now to the ending.  I will, of course, not tell you what happens because that should be your main point in seeing this movie.  It does come out of left field and takes you by surprise.  It's quite nasty and a little disturbing.  You'll think about it after the movie is over, filling in the loop holes with the answer given at the end.  I recommend this film mainly for the ending.  Don't find out what it is, the movie will not be the same...
