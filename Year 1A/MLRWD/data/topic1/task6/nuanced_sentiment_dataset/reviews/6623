First off I always thinks it's funny when people write reviews and talk about the camera work, and realism, O.K stop there this is a movie plan and simple, were not paid to Monday quarterback movie reviews. Hell half those people should be fired for the movies they endorse and condemn, and they get paid for it.

Now for my action junky brethren out there if you haven't seen Hitman just buy it, you will love it. Now if you have played the video game like I have and haven't seen the movie do your self a favor and buy it you will not go wrong. This has to be like a previous reviewer said the closest to a video game you can get so far. I go to the movies first and foremost to be entertained.

This movie is an action thrill ride. I don't think they could have pick a better person than Timothy Olyphant to play agent 47. Vin Diesel was originally suppose to do Hitman, I enjoy Diesel's movies but Olyphant is an untapped talent and he shows it in Hitman or if your familiar with Deadwood the HBO series he played the Seth Bullock the sheriff. Now if you're not familiar with the video game you might scratch your head a little. They didn't do as much background info for those who are  familiar with the popular video game, but none the less, the move is awesome.

But with the stylized action and the latest bond girl to star in the bond film Quatum of Solace and one of the hottest models out of the Ukraine Olga Kurylenko, who by the way does shed the threads how can you go wrong. All I can say is where and when is Hitman 2.
