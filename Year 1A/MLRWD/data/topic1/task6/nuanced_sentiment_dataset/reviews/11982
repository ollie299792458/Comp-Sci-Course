If blood pumps through your veins, you probably do not need to read this review....who hasn't seen the Indy movies?! Now that a fourth is underway, it is the perfect time to do as i did and catch back up with the first 3. Guess what? They hold up perfectly and get even better with age. Unlike Star Wars, Lucas left these alone and managed not to irritate the public with them, so they stay fresh and classy. Raiders is by far the best, a standard setter in every way. The plot is ominous, the characters wonderful. Temple Of Doom while being the redheaded stepchild of the bunch, is still a stand up and cheer popcorn flick - it ruled my world when i was 6. It definitely sets Indy up as the action hero. The third has a maturity about it - less gruesome effects and underhanded moves by Indy (stabbing a lady with a dinner fork?!) plus his Dad make this the most family friendly of the group, but all 3 are timeless classics. The extra disc is way cool and is a must have for fans. Do yourself a favor!!
