I read the books when I was younger, though I haven't kept up on the more recent releases, so I was excited when I found they were actually making a movie from the first three books in the series.  The trailers looked promising, though some things were clearly added or removed. The reviews were mainly favorable, so I bought the DVD, hoping for something that at least resembled the characters and events I'd read as a child.

No such luck.  The story was warped horribly - even though I can't remember details clearly from the books, I'm pretty sure St. Aggie's was not founded by Metal Beak.  Kludd certainly didn't fall out if the nest, nor would Soren have been showing off like that.  The flecks were shown as some sort of electrical magic...something, and even the main characters were turned into horrible caricatures that are almost nothing like their originals; Twilight, Digger, Otulissa...even Skench and Spoorn.

But alas, even if you ignore the books and let it stand on its own, it still wasn't worth it.  They kept just enough elements of the book to ruin the story it might have been had it been made independently.  Its character development was poor, the story was weak and predictable even if you don't know the books.  The movie feels rushed, yet never seems to go anywhere.

I wanted so badly for this movie to be enjoyable, but in the end, the only thing I can say for it is that it was beautiful.  Its incredibly well done animation is the only thing holding it up from a one rating, though I'd never recommend it to anyone.  Don't waste your time or money.  This movie isn't worth it.
