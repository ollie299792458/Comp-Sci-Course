this is an absolutely wonderful anime! if you liked saber marionette J, J again, or J to X than you will absolutely love this anime! the animation is very nice, and i would give it a 4 out of 5.  the story is based on a young man named Kazuya, who is trying to create and artificially intelligant robot (looks like a squid, quite cute)  then, without giving away too much of the story, he ends up with cute little may, a cyber doll that was delivered to his door, and is just like a human, only she is a 1/6 scale model ^_^ sooo she is a little short.  and it ends up that kazuya will have 4 cyber dolls, that look and act just like humans, living with him (may eventually gets upgraded to normal size)
but buyer beware, this anime contains quite a bit of nudity, clevage, and other stuff like that.  so if you are looking for an anime to buy your 10 or 11 year old, i would recomend Saber Marionette J instead, because it is very similar, but more audience friendly ^_^
if your not looking to buy for an 11 or 10 year old, and don't mind the nudity and stuff, than by all means, buy this!
