The Dark Crystal is one of those rare, fantastic, intelligent films that takes full advantage of the power of imagination.  So few films immerse you in a completely other world so well.  It is a classical tale of good and  evil.  This story sees Jen and Kira, last of the elf-like Gelfling race, on  a journey to the Palace of the grotesquely evil  Skeksis in order to heal  the fractured Dark Crystal.  It is a simple enough story for young chidren  to grasp, yet pertinent enough to engross adults.
This is not your  typical Jim Henson fare.  Incredibly real and life-like, every creature in  the film was brought to life by puppeteers.  Some of the creatures and  situations are rather frightening and could give a young child nightmares.  Giant, black, crab-like soldiers called Garthim are shown breaking suddenly  into peaceful areas and causing panic and destruction.  There are scenes of  evil, vulture-like Skeksis torturing defenseless Podlings (little gnome-ish  people).  The Skeksis also have sharp, jagged teeth and some make menacing  noises.  I watched this film countless times as a young child, and while  the creatures were frightening, I don't remember ever being afraid to watch  the film.  This is a film which does not underestimate the viewer's ability  to think and wonder.
The wise, peaceful, four-armed Mystics are as  fascinating a film creature as any I've ever seen.  The lush, other-worldly  settings and beings of The Dark Crystal will continue to fascinate me as  they have done all my life.
The DVD version is in widescreen (thank  god!).  What an incredible difference!  Twice as full of life and mystery.
