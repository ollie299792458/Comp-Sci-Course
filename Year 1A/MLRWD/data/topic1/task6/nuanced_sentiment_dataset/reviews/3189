I have been a Godzilla fan since the age of 4. I am now 18. I have seen every one of the Godzilla films ever released and I must say that I have loved almost every single one (besides Godzilla's Revenge).

When I first heard about this movie in 2003... I was excited beyond belief. A big BANG for Godzilla to end on... or atleast to end on until they start the series back up again.

But I just finished watching the DVD... and I must say... I was not impressed with this film. The newer films feel less and less like Godzilla films and more like films with Godzilla as an afterthought. I was disappointed to see the Big G head out with such a film.

If you're looking for a good film, you should buy this movie. If you're looking for a great send-off movie for Godzilla, DO NOT BUY this movie.

In my opinion, GMK should have been the film to see Godzilla off, and is possibly my favorite Godzilla movie of all time.

In closing, this movie was pretty good and interesting, but I did not see it as a good ending for the series.
