This movie will make you take back the words "too bad they don't make them like that anymore."
If you've never heard of Patrick O'Brian's novels about Captain Jack Aubrey, a British naval captain of the Napoleonic era, and his ship's surgeon and friend Stephen Maturin, it will matter not one whit; Peter Weir has managed to make one of the most exciting movies of the year and surely one of the greatest "adventure" movies you'll ever see.  Aubrey's ship the "HMS Surprise" chases the enemy (French) ship Acheron around Cape Horn into the Pacific in hopes of capturing her.  Battles, chases, storms, strategy, tragic losses, medical miracles, and more battles ensue.  Although the movie is well over 2 hours long, there is not one soft spot in the narrative, it is a thrill from end to end.
Fans of the Aubrey/Maturin novels may have had a bit of the same anxiety as fans of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings:  what if the moviemakers wreck our beloved books?  Never fear; all positive expectations have been exceeded.  The crowd, the noise, the old scared able seamen and the boy midshipmen, the turbulence and fear, and the thrill of the novels are perfectly conveyed.  
As Jack Aubrey, beefy, aggressive, Russell Crowe will surely never find a part for which he is better suited. Aubrey is an intuitive and brilliant captain.  Paul Bettany's Stephen Maturin is the perfect counterpoint:  thin and reserved, his caution serves as a natural restraint on Aubrey's recklessness.  Maturin is so disciplined a character that at one point he performs abdominal surgery on himSELF.
Some parents may feel it is a bit gory and glorifying for pre-teens, but for everyone else who loves adventure, this is the year's best ticket. (And now go read the books - you'll love them too!)
