What this film lacks in suspense during the first half, it makes up for in the last 30 minutes.  The lens of cameraman Joseph LaShelle coupled with the expertise of Otto Preminger's direction makes for a visually intriguing film -- easy on the eye and darkly atmospheric.  The nice surprise is the performance of Alice Faye.  Although her character seems to be robbed of screen time in the early portions, once the action moves to San Francisco, Faye's complexity and motivation makes for one of her best performances.  I've read where Faye claims that many of her scenes were deleted to build up Linda Darnell's part.  This may explain the film's slow start.  Darnell establishes her one-dimensional character with relish and does well, but her scenes seem repititious after awhile.  Dana Andrews' role suffers from focusing too much on his repellent nature and not enough on his inner conflicts.  Overemphasis on Darnell and Andrews' relationship is the film's one drawback.  This effects the tempo of the overall production.  Still, it is great to see this overlooked noir get a second chance. (Scott O'Brien - author of "Kay Francis - I Can't Wait to be Forgotten")
