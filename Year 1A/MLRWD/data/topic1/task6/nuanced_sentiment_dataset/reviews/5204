This movie failed on a number of levels.  First, from a Jackie Chan movie you expect at least some good martial arts scenes.  There were none here.  In fact, the fight scenes were rather boring.  The acting was terrible.  Sure, Chan is not first an actor but he has improved over time and is always at least passable.  When the main character's acting is passable it needs to be boosted by legitimate acting professionals.  So what did the producers do?  They get George Lopez and Billy Ray Cyrus to play besides Chan.  What a disaster they are.  The kid actors, well, you can't put too much blame on them but they were also hard to take.  Their lines were overdone.  I suppose they did the best they could.  When your own kids are laughing at the child actors, you know there's a problem.  Perhaps the worst part of the movie was the actors pretending to be Russians.  These people probably had the worst collection of Russian accents ever.  Some of this may be acceptable in a comedy, to a degree, but in this was it was just pathetic.  The plot was unimaginative and predictable: nerdy guy in love with beautiful divorcee with kids tries to get the kids to like him.  You can see almost every scene coming.  One major movie mistake: the setting is very California suburbia but Chan and his babe go out on a date to a street that I swear was in the 50's in Manhattan.  Avoid disappointment and see some other Jackie Chan movie.
