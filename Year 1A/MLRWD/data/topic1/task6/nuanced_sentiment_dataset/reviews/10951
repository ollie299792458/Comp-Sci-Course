I've seen a few Catherine Breillat films now. I saw Romance when it originally came out in theaters and was a big controversy, NC-17, banned in U.S. theaters (the uncut version) due to graphic nudity. Well Anatomy of Hell has its share of graphic nudity which is typical in Breillat films. The problem with Breillat films; especially this one, is that she is fixated on the idea that men find certain aspects of female anatomy and physiology such as their menstrual cycle, unpleasant or distasteful and she keeps reiterating this theme over and over ad nauseam in each film she makes because apparently in her world (that is in her mind) this is the case. So she keeps trying to make a big feminist statement to enlighten the average primordial male as well as traditionally stigmatized women, that it is not this unclean curse to be feared and loathed but rather just nature and femininity and is not unpleasant but on the contrary; tasteful (no pun intended but if you chose to see this film you'll understand my choice of words) So the film is not as good as Romance because she goes too far to make a point which most people; both men and women already have a pretty good understanding of but Breillat thinks she's pioneering into some kind of untouched territory here. Well perhaps she is but maybe there are just some things that should remain more subtle and vague and do not need to be exploited. I think to some degree Breillat actually exploits women in her films while trying to liberate them.
