This is one of the many movies made about the earthly ministry of Jesus. There are many good elements to this film. The Scriptural accuracy is pretty good. There were some scenes that do not portray Jesus correctly. 
For example, Jesus visits Mary before going to Jerusalem here. He said he would mend the chair later and Mary said they chair will never be mended. The movie inadvertantly made Jesus a liar in that scene because he was either hiding the truth from Mary (not possible because she knew from the angel who foretold his birth that he would die for sins and because Christ himself repeatedly told those around him that he would die and rise again) or intentionally was trying to mislead her.
But these problems are forgiven given that the movie as a whole is (when it relates to Jesus) generally in harmony with Scripture. I just wish that there was a Jesus movie that portrays his betrayal by Judas according to Scriptural truth and not artistic monkeying.
A lot of time is spent on inventing a back story to Barabbas and his dealing with Judas and how he and Jesus cross paths now and then.
There are some historical inaccuracies here, too. In the movie Pilate is called the son in law to Tiberius. Not true. He was an equestrian rank who was recommended to the post by the Senator Sejanus who was later executed by Tiberius for treason and conspiracy.
The acting here is a little stilted. At times it seems they were more focused on creating an ethereal effect than on establishing human connection. It's an understandable mistake, but it detracts from the life of Jesus who was really a man (as regards to his earthly nature) who connected with people and yet was still God.
If you're debating on whether to get this movie, go ahead and get it. It's worth watching. I've watched it several times and own it. Just don't derive your theology from it.
