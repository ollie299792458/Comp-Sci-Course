What's happened to Paramount Pictures? And why do previews entice fans, make a movie look so entertaining you just have to see it?

If I'd known The Devil Inside wasn't a movie, but someone holding a camera, jerking, to boot, I'd never have rented it. Thankfully, it was only 1.00. 1.00 lost.

The errors!

In the beginning it's stated Maria killed three people. While Isabella, 'Maria's daughter' is telling the story, she says her mother killed two people.

I can't count the number of times the actors laughed during a serious scene. Probably didn't realized the 'one' camera was directed at them.
Their laughter was contagious..felt like I was watching Bloopers.

In one scene, Father David Keane is performing Baptism. In an earlier scene, he says he's in trouble with the church. Why then, would be be allowed to Baptize a baby???

Stupidity!

Father Keane cuts his wrist. There's blood everywhere. A second priest, Father Rawlings, has a baffled/dumb look on his face and mumbles, 'What should I do?'  Duh, call for an ambulance or get the *ell out!

The acting was awful and phony, the shaking camera gave me a headache, and the ending atrocious.

People who like Blair Witch or Paranormal Activity might enjoy this film? Documentary? Whatever!!! And/or people who aren't bothered by mistakes.

I'm actually happy I watched instead of buying the DVD. I'd really have a lot to complain about. Toni
