For those who have never seen a mecha anime and don't think you can get into the whole "Giant Robots Fighting" thing, let me tell you, I was the same way, before Tengenn Toppa Gurren Lagann I had never seen a mecha anime. A bunch of my friends wouold always recommend mecha and I would always turn it down saying, "I just don't like the idea of a mecha.". I wish I would have picked this one up way sooner. I loved this anime so much that I decided to pick up another mecha immediately afterward. The story revolves around a young boy named Simon who lives in an underground village. Simon's best friend Kamina, dreams of a world beyond the "surface" and wants him and Simon to leave the village and get to the top. When Simon one day finds a mysterious head when digging he informs the enthusiastic Kamina and together they use the head's over sized drill to reach the top, meeting the beautiful, sexy, red haired Yoko along the way. Once they reach the top they realize that life on the surface isn't what they had expected. to wrap this one up, if you've never seen a mecha before, I highly recommend grabbing this one as fast as possible.
