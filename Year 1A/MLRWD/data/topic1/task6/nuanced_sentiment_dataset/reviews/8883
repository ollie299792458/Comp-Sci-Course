Most of the reviews of this movie here are very positive....however I have to agree with the nay sayers...unless its a purely animated movie...such as 'Ice Age'...one of my favorites...I don't care for live action  films that personify animals like people...not a good message for  kids...as I had a couple of bad experiences with pets as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JL8E">The Adventures of Milo & Otis</a>child...before I knew better...I am not saying that animals where hurt or even killed in this movie....but just watch that scene where Milo is in the box going down the rapids...you can see the cat mewing in terrified distress...I have a female orange tabby that looks very much like Milo...if anyone treated her that way!...well, I would be very upset...
This film is not for kids at all!...however I do recommend it for adults to watch and see how animals can be mistreated...watch the movie carefully...and don't give in to the cuteness...better to just observe and love your own pets with your children
