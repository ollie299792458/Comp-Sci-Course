Don't believe the reviews here. The reviews have to be a scam to get you to watch because this movie is awful. Over-acted and over-wrought!  The movie's first half-hour showed promise but then the movie quickly fell apart once the mother and her sister visited a gay club.  The plot stalled and the story became predictable and dull. Once the sister gets made over in a bathroom by 2 drag queens, (while the mother inexplicably doesn't even seem fazed by her sister's prolonged absence in an unfamiliar place), I stopped watching. I have to comment on a glaring inconsistency.  In the beginning, there is a parade of different girls invited over to dinner, representing all the times that the mother and the aunt had tried in vain to do some match-making for the son (who was secretly gay). The clothing for the mother, aunt and the different girls always changes from one attempt to another. With each attempt, they show the son and his boyfriend seated at the table. However, in error, their clothing never changes. It should have. Speaking of changes, this film needed a much, much better production team!
