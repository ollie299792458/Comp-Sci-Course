I rarely review DVD's and I even more rarely review anything at 1 star. However this DVD was so bad I am doing both. I am someone who enjoys Robot Chicken, Family Guy, the Family Guy Star Wars spoofs, etc.... I didn't even think this DVD wouldn't be something right up my alley. Boy was I wrong.

The Cavalcade is similar to Robot Chicken in that everything is a series of shorts. Most attempt (and I stress attempt) to use vulgarity, sex, (you get the point) in order to get a quick laugh. The bad part is nothing is funny or well done. I'm ok with toilet humor, heck that is what I was hoping for in this DVD. What I got was the toilet without the humor. I can sum up most of the shorts as simply showing two animated characters having sex, something vulgar (but not funny) is said and then on to the next similar and still not funny short.

Since I like the majority of the stuff these guys put out, I cannot explain why they so badly missed on this but they did. Don't ignore the fact this is an overall 2 star review with the majority being 1 stars. It really is that bad.
