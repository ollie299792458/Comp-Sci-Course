Sadly, when it was released in January of 1998, Great Expectations failed to make a significant dent in the box office.  I suppose it was a case of poor timing. It came out in the wake of "Titanic," which was the love-story/date movie of the year.
This is most unfortunate, since this is one of the most beautifully filmed, richly detailed pieces of cinema to come along in quite a while.
Dickens fans, be warned! This is not at all a clear adaptation of the novel. Many liberties are taken and many of the the names are changed.  Perhaps this is why it works so well.
Director Alforso Cuaron uses the novel as merely a template, and then lets his imagination run wild.  Unlike Baz Luhrman's contrived and pretetious "Romeo and Juliet" just two years before, Cuaron does everything in his power to stress the fact that this is not "Charles Dickens Great Expectations," but rather a film that is inspired from one of the greatest works of English literature.  Sure, there are weaknesses in the adaptation, but the whole thing is so aesthetically appealing that it hardly matters.
The cast here is solid: Hawke, Paltrow (looking better than ever), Anne Bancroft, De Niro..There are also excellent supporting turns by the likes of Chris Cooper and Hank Azaria.  it also boasts a tuneful and fitting contemporary soundtrack.
The real star of this is Cuaron, though. It is amazing how a director can use various images and colors to convey such a wide range of emotions. Cuaron uses film like artists use canvas, and here it clearly works.
"Great Expectations" is not destined to become one of the greatest lovestories of all time, or  a film that college professors will show their students in a film appreciation course.  It is, however, a tremendously good looking, fashionable film that won't soon go out of style.
