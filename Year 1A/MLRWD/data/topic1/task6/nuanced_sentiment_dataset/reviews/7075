This is the first story I saw with Patrick Troughton as the Doctor (apart from the multiple Doctor stories), and it made me a big fan of this  specific TARDIS crew - Second Doctor, Jamie, and Zoe each complement the  others quite nicely.  But I can't help but feel that this story is at least  two episodes too long.  I really do like the first episode - Jamie and Zoe  seeing their homes on the TARDIS scanner, the TARDIS breaking up, etc.  But  I think the author attempted too much in the following episodes.  Gulliver,  Rapunzel, a Jamie with a different face, the Minotaur, etc. etc. all fly  past so quickly you don't really have time to absorb their presence on the  screen.  The story itself was fine - although somehow I expected some other  explanation for the Land of Fiction and its master.  I did have to smile at  the scene with the Doctor being pestered by all the taunting British  schoolchildren though.  It seems the BBC were trying to remake The  Celestial Toymaker from the Hartnell era (of which one episode exists on  the video The Hartnell Years).  All in all, The Mind Robber is not a  classic - but it does deserve a look.
