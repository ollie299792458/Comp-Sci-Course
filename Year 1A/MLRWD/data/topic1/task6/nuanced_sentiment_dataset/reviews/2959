It's surprising that the BBC (or is it ITV?) has not denounced these DVDs and demanded their destruction. The charm of the original made-for-TV films is utterly degraded by incompetent transfer from the originals by A&amp;E. It looks almost as if the master tape was played on a big-screen TV then recorded by a VHS tape recorder using a middling camera with lens lightly smeared with vaseline. One can't even read the text of labels into which the camera pans.
The fault for this travesty lies purely with the transcription - I own VHS tapes recorded in Europe from the telly which have comparatively superb resolution (but which, alas, can only be played on an European TV).
Buy these DVDs only if you are incurably devoted to Joan Dickson's superbly understated performances of Miss Marple's adventures, and are able to pretend you are myopic - or that you have removed your glasses if you already are. Otherwise, save up your money for something less frustrating. Take Sitar lessons, or buy a good book, or a CD of your favorite music. At least they will endure, and be worth revisiting.
