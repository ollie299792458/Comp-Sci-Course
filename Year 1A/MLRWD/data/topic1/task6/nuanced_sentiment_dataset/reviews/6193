A terribly grating production on the surface (there is only so many times you can listen to an eclectic group of 1980s stars sing `We are the world, we are the children' without wanting to smash this disc with a hammer), the additional footage that accompanies the original We Are The World film is incredibly revealing. Documenting a cluster of American hitmakers creating a pop single to help aid the African famine plight (Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie and Quincy Jones worked up the original demo after seeing the success of Band Aid's similar musical juggernaut), the greatest moments on this two disc set are the outtakes from two of the bigger rock stars involved in the recording of the 1985 hit. Bob Dylan is shown looking incredibly uneasy and unimpressed when an impromptu rendition of the Banana Boat Song breaks out amongst the gathered throng, while his solos show a man desperately unsure of his own ability until Quincy Jones reassures him. On the flipside of the coin Bruce Springsteen is seen on the extra footage giving a powerful first take of his lines, somehow balancing passion with anguish in a way the irksome Al Jarreau couldn't dream of. All up, this isn't as wearing as it could well have been. DVD extras include plenty of additional scenes plus a boring 10th Anniversary Special, performances of the song at the American Music Awards and Live Aid, a karaoke version of the track and plenty more to keep Kenny Loggins, Hall And Oates and Kim Carnes fans happy.
