I was expecting more from this movie.  Basically, it is the life of the 14th Dalai Lama from being a youngster and being discovered, to his leaving Tibet and exile into India.  It wasn't all that visual a film.  I expected more great cinematography.  It left me kinda confused about Tibet culture.  I think my favorite parts were the Dalai Lama's meetings with Chairman Mao.  You don't see much of that guy in films, yet he was such an interesting historical figure, in some ways, he kinda overshadows the Dalai Lama.  A far more interesting biographical film would have been about Mao Tse-Tung's life.  Seriously.  The movie falls flat trying to describe Buddhism, which is really a great way of understanding life.  Communism too, tries to explain life and that contrast would have been great but I think Disney was more interested in creating a movie that the Chinese communists would accept, than to really investigate these two great schools of thought, and how they compare and contrast.  In the end, I actually lost some respect for the Dalai Lama.  He abandonded his people.  A great charismatic Buddhist leader would not do this.
