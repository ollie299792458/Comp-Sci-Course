Even if you went out and bought the 8 tape VHS version of the anthology a few years ago, go out and this this DVD set. It is a MUST HAVE for Beatle people.
 Of course, the picture quality is great. This will be the very best copy of old concert footage you will find. However, the thing that really got to me was the sound. Hearing all those great songs remixed in 5.1 surround sound is out of this world! Take for example 'I Am The Walrus'. On the original recording, it switches to fake stereo half way through the song, due to recording limitations of the time. Now, in this anthology, the entire song is in fabulous 5.1! It is fantastic. Every song was obviously carefully remixed.
 The extras on the 5th disc are really good and interesting. The only thing I would have liked to have seen was extra concert footage (ex. the entire Shea Stadium or Washington concerts).
Still, seeing Paul, George, and Ringo playing together for the last time was very touching. Definately worth every penny.
