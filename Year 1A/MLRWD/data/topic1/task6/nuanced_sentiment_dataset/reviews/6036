What a joy to watch the remastered "Singin in the Rain"!  Though presented in its original 1:37 aspect ratio (this film predates widescreen motion pictures by a couple of years) you soon forget that "negative" and sit back to enjoy the incredibly singing, dancing, and dialog (favorite lines:  "Dignity, always dignity";  "Sheesh....what am I, dumb or something?"; and "Well, of course I can talk!").

Only when watching the added feature-ette (which does *not* include remastered clips from the film) can you have a true appreciation for the clarity and depth of color and definition in the Blu-ray edition.

Donald O'Connor's "Make 'em Laugh" is a tour de force, but what has always been startling to me is to the watch the side-by-side dancing of O'Connor and Gene Kelly (especially in the "Moses Supposes" number).  O'Connor was great -- no question.  Kelly -- well, of just a completely different (and higher) order.  He is the embodiment of the phrase "making it look easy."  And his singing wasn't half bad, either.

Just an outstanding film in a gorgeous remastering -- until you see it in Blu-ray, you haven't seen "Singin in the Rain."
