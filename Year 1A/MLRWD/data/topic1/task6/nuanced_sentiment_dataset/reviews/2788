This play was written in 1882 to put on display the irrational responses of the public masses. It can be viewed as a comic-drama because the subject matter is serious but the reaction by the people of the town is ridiculous. So the subject matter is interesting and timeless. But I have to disagree with other reviewers, and I have to say this is far from Steve McQueen's best acting. Watch: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O78L00">The Sand Pebbles (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008ENHUI">Papillon</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLV9G">The Reivers</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009HKH6Q">The Thomas Crown Affair - New Transfer</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001GF2EM">The Great Escape (2-Disc Collector's Set)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004WLVN">Love With The Proper Stranger (B&W) [VHS</a>] before you go out and buy this one. In fact it almost seems like he has the least amount of lines in this presentation, far fewer than some of the other characters. He certainly has the least interesting and least passionate ones. It's almost as if McQueen is always standing somewhere in the scene while other actors are doing all the talking and acting. In fact, I was more impressed with the supporting cast, in particular Charles Durning, who took the place of the actor who never showed up for the part of Peter Stockman, the town's Mayor. Durning, by the way, has a great biographical story that should be made into a film but I digress. McQueen wanted his wife, Ali McGraw, to take the part of his wife in the play also. Thank god she didn't. Bibi Andersson does a fine job as the concerned and worried doctor's wife.
 As far as McQueen's acting skills on display here, he seemed to deliver his lines without any intensity or passion. One example was when his family's house gets pelted with rocks. The windows get broken, his family is freezing and terrorized. What is his response? He goes around the house picking up the rocks from under the bed and other furniture and tells his wife to save them for his son as a reminder of this day. If Steve used this play to prove his acting ability to his friends, he certainly chose the wrong character to portray. He should have played the conniving town Mayor. Though it's an interesting play, after it is over you ask yourself where was Steve McQueen?
