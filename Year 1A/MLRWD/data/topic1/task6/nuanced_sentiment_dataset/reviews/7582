I guessed the ending about half way into the film, thus the remainder was not as enjoyable as it might have been. I did not find the movie at all spooky, for it to be spooky the characters would have to act like they were afraid and only John Hurt's character does that. Hudson's character is curious and fearless throughout - i would like to have heard more screams and seen more shaking in her - when she visits the attic for instance. Another dissapointing aspect is that the villains themselves are not evil enough to exude the kind of malevolence needed to affect strong feelings in the viewer, we can even sympathise with their motivations. I found the ending unsatisfactory, this is a fantasy/horror movie so there is no artistic urge for a realistic ending, there is no need to do THAT to the main character. I would have preferred to see her persevere in some way. Although in a sense it is fitting, a young woman who loves old people, old people wanting to be young.... It is a pity Hurt's character never speaks as he is the best acting talent the film had, bit of a waste really.
