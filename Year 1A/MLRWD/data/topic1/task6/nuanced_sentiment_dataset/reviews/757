Ok, if you don't own any DVD copy of Star Wars than these DVDs are worth something I guess. The problem is, that many people (including myself) will buy them for the original theatrical release versions on the bonus DVD. And the quality is abysmal.

These original theatrical transfers look as if they were re-recorded from filming a projector. No only that they are LETTERBOX versions. What! That is just plain addle brained in this day of HDTV and wide screen TVs. I don't expect detail where is did not exist but I do expect to be able to play the thing in the correct aspect ration and not have more than 1/3 of the DVD be wasted on coding black bars. Not only that, my DVD player can not even zoom in the correct aspect ration to eliminate the LETTERBOX. Even if have a setup that does this correctly, you will be zooming in on an already craptastic transfer.

For example, there is quite a bit of color-shifting throughout most of the movie which can be seen clearly through the flesh tones. It almost looks like they forgot to remove the macrovision copy protection and you have an illegal copy. The results are a muddy mess and there is no way that this is all they could do with the original release.

For those that are saying you got what "you asked for" read some of the earlier posts. There are tons of digital re-mastered version of old movies that look ten times better. What "we asked for" is the original movie content. We are not against digital repair of poor color, grain, jitter, etc.

Bottom line is, this is a horrendous transfer of the original movies. If you are buying it for these original versions you will probably be somewhat disappointed especially if you have a wide screen TV of any sort.

I am just sick of these crappy re-releases of the only good Star Wars films. I guess now they will re-re-re-release an better (but probably still messed up) version on HD-DVD in 2 years. Sadly, you should wait until then before you buy.
