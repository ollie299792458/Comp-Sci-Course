After viewing this movie I thought and thought about what it all meant.  Durring the beginning there is a scene of a very horrifying battle that leaves much of both sides dead.  The next scene is a group of lost Allied soldiers, which I thought died, taking over a haunted german trench.  The rest of the film is a psychological horror film where each cast member is killed by another cast member.  The scenes in the film are all shot with a very dark, rainy claustophobic look.  There is something in the trenches that plays on each soldiers worst fears and ends up making them go mad and kill each other.  I believe the Allied soldiers died in the beginning and the rest of the movie is them all living a nightmare in hell.  The movie has some pretty good supplemental stuff in the extras section.  There is not much gore.  There are plenty of frights thrown at you.  A very violent death scene with barbwire thrown in for utter chills.  I am an avid reader of WW1 and WW2 history and the film truly captures the trench warefare that made WW1 so terribley violent and horrible.  I would recommend a rent this instead of dishing out the $20 bucks for a copy.  Watch in a dark room with your mate and see and hear all the spooky stuff going on in the film.
