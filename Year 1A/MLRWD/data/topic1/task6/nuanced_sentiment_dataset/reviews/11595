I saw a BBC "Play for Today" production of this story in about 1969.  Sadly, in what I think was a criminal act, the BBC later re-used the tape...

I fell in love with the story and with the fabulous Anna Calder-Marshall who played Jennie.  I found the book, lent it, lost it, finally found it again years later (and NO ONE borrows this copy!).  It's one of the most haunting love stories ever written; it is just sheer beauty.

The 1948 film, in contrast, is a really bad B-movie.  It's slushy and over-romanticised.  (You don't NEED to romanticise this story -- it should be kept simple and stark.)  Jennifer Jones is far too old, even for Jennie at the end of the story.  And they changed the ending, which is utterly unforgivable, and renders the whole of the story meaningless.

Don't bother with this pretty dreadful film.  Read the novel and be uplifted, and cry, at the same time.  You'll meet your own Jennie that way.

"Where I come from nobody knows/And where I'm going everything goes/The wind blows, the sea flows/And nobody knows."

The BBC version caught the essence of the book beautifully.  If you can somehow turn back time, and recover that tape...
