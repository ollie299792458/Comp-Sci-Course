I have at least 6 of Leslie's Walk at Home DVD's and this is a nice change of pace from her usual routines. She's included some new foot moves, incorporated some Pilates techniques and changed up the music a little. I like the workouts with just Leslie because it's like having a personal trainer.

The aerobics part of the workout is approximately 45 minutes and unlike some of the other workouts, this one is best done all as the full workout. Even though it is divided into chapters, each builds on the others with the middle one being the most vigorous. The additional minutes of floor routine could stand alone as a short workout, or be added on to the end of the 45 minute walking routine.

One feature that I like is that you can do a music only version of the workout. So once you get to know the moves, you can turn off the talking and just work out to music. This is great if you get tired of hearing Leslie say the same thing every day. I also love the wall clock so that I know when each mile will be finished.

All in all, I think this is one of Leslie's best workouts.
