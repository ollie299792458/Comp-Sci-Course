Not half bad for a low budget DTV effort. I've seen worse (including the abysmal 'Deep Shock' also starring the wooden david keith) and of course, much better.

This one tells the tale of a massive structure rising from the bowels of the earth. It hovers in a desert where different groups vie to study its mysteries. Of course, theres the eternal man is to sick to live theme running through (ala The Day the Earth Stood Still and to a lesser extent 'The Abyss [extended version]). Still, Epoch is mildly enjoyable and I was thinking of what kind of movie this could have been with a more solid script and a bigger finacial backing. I think the devlin/emerich team behind Independence Day and Day After Tommorow could have made yet another end of the world hollywood pap trap with this material. Alas, there is no starpower or big studio to be found here. Instead the tale is brought to fruition by some outfit called UFO Films and features David Keith, the fallen Ryan O'Neil and an assortment of other B grade character actors (including Brian Thompson and his obligatory scenes of rage) I've seen elsewhere. The effects are steady but not spectacular. The storm scenes and sets were strong points whereas the rising of the monolith at the beggining of the film was an example of Godzilla like blue screen effort. In godzilla, its pricelss, here its not good.

The DVD itself is bare bones. No features other than a crappy trailer. The transfer is junk to with no clean up of the print and its not even displayed in its proper widescreen ratio. I just love when movies show us locations and time in the print at the bottom of the screen and the edges are chopped off.

Take Epoch for what it is and you may enjoy it. Go in looking for a big time hollywood effects blockbuster and be prepared to be let down.
