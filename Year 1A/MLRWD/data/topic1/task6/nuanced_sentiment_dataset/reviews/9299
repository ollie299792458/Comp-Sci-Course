The negative reviews below and at IMDB almost dissuaded me from seeing Book of Shadows, but my girlfriend overruled me.  I was therefore rather pleasantly surprised (if one can be about a horror movie) to find that it was a quite reasonable sequel to The Blair Witch Project.  Like the first movie, it was more creepy and unnerving than horrifying.  There was a bit more blood than in the first, but not much, and less profanity.  The soundtrack was good (if you're into harsh rock), as was the cinematography.
There were the usual problems with horror movies, like why are the characters so clueless, e.g. the psychic chick's ability was quite powerful when it didn't matter, and non-existent when it did.  The film also suffered from the usual hard-act-to-follow problem facing all sequels, but if it didn't offer anything new, neither did it fail to live up to the other's standards.  The characters were as ordinary as those in the first movie; on the one hand, you don't particularly care for them, but on the other, they're just normal screwed-up kids, and hardly deserve their sorry fate.
What I don't understand are other reviewers' complaints about the Wiccan chick's stilted dialogue (of course she was affected, that's expected for a wannabe Wiccan), and the film's initial statement of being a "reenactment" (that was just to distinguish it from the first movie, which was actually "real" footage).  On the other hand, some other reviewers have mentioned that the film had good special effects--like what, the makeup?  There were minimal special effects, but good cinematography, if the two can be separated.
Life being short, I would not put this movie on my must-see list, but I would say that most people who appreciate horror movies should appreciate this one.
