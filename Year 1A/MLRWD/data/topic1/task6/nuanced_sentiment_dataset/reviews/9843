I really love this film. For that reason I am so dissappointed with this blu ray edition. Great packaging, I love the digibook format, plenty of photos and information (some of them mislead, according to IMDB Harry Hamlin never was on Dragonslayer) but great anyway. But the important stuff, the film itself it's a little (so little) improvement over the grainy, blurry and fuzzy dvd edition. Better color and contrast and that's all.

This film deserves a full restoration, frame by frame. I've just seen the much older Hitchcock's masterpiece North by Northwest (also by Warner) and the matte paintings, picture composites and image tricks looked absolutely crisp and pristine. The Harryhausen fans also want this treatment.

The sneak peak of the remake looks quite good in general. I'm looking forward to watch it on the big screen. But I must say that not a million digital effects would improve the masterful craftmenship of the great Ray Harryhausen. And I also think that Sam Worthington doesn't have the charisma, stature, muscle and skin tone to play a Perseus like Harry Hamlin was. A perfect specimen of a men and a very good actor. Luckily, Liam Neeson looks quite amazing as the new Zeus. Not so much the new Kraken, I'm afraid.
