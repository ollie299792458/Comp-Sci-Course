This is not the first Bacon/Sedgwick film about a disturbing slice-of-life topic. Case in point - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PID84">The Woodsman</a>- where Bacon's leading role is that of a pedophile trying to re-enter society and Sedgwick as the woman in his life. Both Loverboy and The Woodsman give the audience much to ponder afterwards. Disturbing topics often overlooked.

While I admire Bacon's grit in showcasing hard-to-look-ats in society, I did not have an easy time with this film. Which I suppose is exactly the point.

Many times I found myself angry, even disgusted with Emily's smothering attempts to fill the voids in her childhood. I found myself alternating between cheering Paul's growth of independence and very definite spurts of outrage at Emily's behavior. Add to the mix the loneliness and ignored needs of the child Emily - my thoughts and feelings were all over the place. You must ask yourself - is this an accurate snapshot of how neglected children might parent their own?

Again, as in The Woodsman, one has to step back and remind themselves not to judge too harshly, asking "how would I have dealt with this if that were my story"?

Much to think about.
Anger, compassion, sadness, gladness - a curious, mixed reaction to a film that while I cannot say I enjoyed, I certainly could not walk away from.
