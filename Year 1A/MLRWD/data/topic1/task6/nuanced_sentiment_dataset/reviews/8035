Way back in 1986, HBO Films did a movie called "Sword of Gideon" that also dealt with the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, and its bloody aftermath. Sure, it was a made-for-cable TV movie, and they didn't have the big budget that Steven Spielberg had, but the movie was TEN TIMES BETTER than his!! Why? It simply told the truth about what happened!! (Now there's a concept!!)

Sadly, Spielberg didn't have the guts to tell the truth. Hell, he wouldn't touch it with a 10 ft. poll!! Instead, he chose to be politically correct, and kiss as much arse and he could get his lips on, so that everybody would like him. At the end of the day, though, the only thing that happened was that everybody just shook their heads in disgust. In short, if you want to purchase a movie that truthfully shows the events surrounding the 1972 massacre in Munich during the summer Olympics, steer clear of this disgusting embarassment and go for "Sword of Gideon".  It's cheaper, it ain't a bunch of lies, and the acting & writing are top notch.
