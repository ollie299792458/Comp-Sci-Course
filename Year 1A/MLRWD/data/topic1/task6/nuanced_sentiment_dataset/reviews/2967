This movie was an odd film mostly about dog poo and a funky invention that is supposed to make it dissapear and after 18 months it is on the shelves and sold in the stores.  Ben Stiller plays a business man who is doing well at work.  Jack Black plays this annoying man who follows Ben (forgot his name in the movie) and always has crazy and dumb ideas.  
After 8 minutes of the movie, Jack comes up with the idea of this dissapearing dog doo invention called "Vapoorize".  He is testing and tesing and testing until it gets within 13 minutes of the movie and the invention works.
This film gave me the inpression of a comedy that was using 4th grade jokes to get around it.  Thats why there was only a few things to laugh at with all of these jokes that make you wanna laugh at the writter and not the people.
It turns out that obviously, Jack gets this huge house and he has this horse and Ben kills it from being drunk on wine that Jack gave him, making this movie very predictable.
The only few things which I thought were pretty good were that the movie gave me a little bit of laughs and if Jack Black wasn't in it I probably wouldn't have seen it.  When I saw "School of Rock" that movie was cleaver, funny, and exallent.
"Envy" was neither of those it was "Kind of cleaver", had "corny jokes", and was a pretty good movie once you think about it.
I think you should see it to find out what you think.
