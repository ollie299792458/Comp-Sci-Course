This is another unfortunate example of better-than-average horror films being shunted off a theatrical release schedule, while we have to suffer through other films of a lesser quality. Amusement, while it was indeed sparingly advertised as a horror film, can be viewed more as a thriller than anything else. Presented as three connected shorts before merging into one story in the last act, the film tells the tale of a deeply disturbed villain unleashing a well-planned act of vengeance against three young women from his past.

The film is fun and has some surprisingly clever moments, but at the same time it does ask the viewer to put a lot of thought into the motivations of the villain. This is something that isn't common in slasher films (which Amusement does turn into towards the end, at least to a point), and as such unless you're prepared to wax philosophical after the credits finish rolling this may not be the right movie for you.

Aside from its quirks Amusement sports solid acting from most of its cast, in particular Kier O'Donnell who provides a chilling villain in The Laugh. One of the film's weakest points, however, happens to be what little gore is used in the film. For a movie that prides itself on atmosphere and set-pieces, the completely CGI gore scenes are jarring and quite honestly detract from the movie. Things would've been smoother had they taken the time to use old-school makeup effects to bring the violence to life.

Overall, despite the disjointed plot and over-reliance on CGI to provide the movie's scarce visceral shocks, Amusement stands as fun way to spend 85 min.
