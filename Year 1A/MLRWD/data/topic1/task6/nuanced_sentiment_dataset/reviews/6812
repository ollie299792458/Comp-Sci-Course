All right, we all know how great THE DIRTY DOZEN is... you've more than likely read all the previous reviews, most of them rightfully glowing.  HOWEVER, what almost ALL the previous reviewers neglect to mention is that the current DVD release of DOZEN is woefully atrocious both in sound and picture quality, at least by the standards that we've come to expect from current DVD technology.

Apparently, the official Warner Bros. release is essentially the same as the 1998 MGM release, with only minor variations on the cover art.  The picture quality is pretty much the same, which is to say:  Lousy.  It looks as though MGM/Warners were working from a beat-up, worn-out, 30+ year old print, rather than from any high-definition, digitally-remastered negative transfer.  THE DIRTY DOZEN more than likely needs some MAJOR restoration work before a proper release can be sold to the public.  Overall sound effects are okay, but certain sections of dialogue are muddied and hard-to-hear.  Worse, the picture/print has a a fading yellow layer (which renders almost everything with an unnatural pinkish hue) and is littered with scratches, dirt, dust, pops, etc., and overall picture detail is far from crystal-clear.  It's probably one of the worst-looking films I've ever watched on DVD.

Having said that, the film itself is still great and none of the defects really detract from the great story and acting, which still shine through regardless.  BUT... if you want your copy of DOZEN to be sparkling-new and spotless, I'd advise holding off on purchasing this DVD until a new, remastered Special Edition comes out... most likely around 2007, when DOZEN reaches its 40th Anniversary.  Until then, buyer beware.
