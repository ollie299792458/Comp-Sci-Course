It's somewhat ridiculous to think that the best movie to touch upon subjects and issues important today in the gay civil rights struggle was made over 20 years ago...but it's true.

In 'Torch Song Trilogy', Harvey Fierstein had the courage to not only tackle issues like homophobia and gay bashing, gay adoption and gay marriage but to tackle them through the eyes of a drag queen. I do not say that because I think drag queens should not be part of our movement but because there are people who feel they should be relegated to the background. It would have been easier for Mr. Fierstein then, and even now, to portray the character of Arnold as a "normal" guy (i.e. not in drag, and not flamboyant).

Mr. Fierstein's excellent writing and great performance, however, handled each of these subjects so well and gave his character so much pride and dignity and compassion that it would be hard for even the staunchest of gay conservatives to deny him and his movie a place at the top of gay-themed movies and performances.

'Torch Song Trilogy' was and still is ahead of its time...and I feel it has yet to be honored for the brilliant film that it is. The fact that this film from 1988 can still speak to us, especially today with the struggle for the recognition and respect of gay families, is reason enough to applaud the work of Mr. Fierstein.

It's been well over a decade since I first watched this film as a teenager and I remember thinking afterwards how no movie can ever touch on so much in such a great way ever again. Now, having reached my 30's, I still have that same thought.

Thank you Mr. Fierstein!
