TGTBATU is my favorite movie of all time - the original version, that is.  I have been trying to find a DVD of a version without the clumsy "new" scenes for ages.  I thought this DVD collection would offer the option of seeing TGTBATU without the new scenes, but it is the same as all of the other recent releases - the new scenes are mandatory viewing.  Clearly, the producers of the new version went to a great deal of trouble to record the dialogue for the new scenes, but the result is still a jarring, inconsistent viewing experience - the dialogue in the new scenes is much louder than the original soundtrack and the action in the scenes is irrelevant to the story, for the most part.  Even worse, the viewer cannot simply skip to the next original scene - the new material is integrated in such a way that one has to fast-forward through to the next original moment.  All in all, it makes for a very frustrating experience for those who love the brilliant, seamless original version.  Please, please, Amazon, offer the original version on DVD with clear indications that the new scenes are not included!
