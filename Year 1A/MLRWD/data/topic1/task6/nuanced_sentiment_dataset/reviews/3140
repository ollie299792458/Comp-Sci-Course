After eagerly awaiting the blu-ray release of this classic, I found myself thoroughly disappointed by Warner's incomplete restoration.

The first 1/3 of the film is covered in countless scratches, specks and nicks particularly in the first 20 minutes of the film. It is very distracting in high-def and on a large screen, and should have been cleaned up as part of the restoration. Surprisingly this film is clean in the second and third hour, as if the film went through a different process or standard. Also the sound is a simple mono track, unacceptable in the new era of Dolby True HD and DTS Master Audio. Some multi-track sound should have been a minimum.

Warner should have taken example of brilliant picture and sound restorations on other classics by other studios such as The Robe, Beckett and Sand Pebbles and even Warner's own Blade Runner.

Nevertheless, the image is bright and exhibiting the luxuriant, vibrant hues of three-strip Technicolor. It also displays a film-like feel, thanks to a grain structure that lends the picture texture and depth. However the picture clarity is soft but this is most likely due to the way the picture was originally lensed.

Unfortunately, Warner went only half way with this restoration. It could have been a great, as this wonderful picture deserves.
