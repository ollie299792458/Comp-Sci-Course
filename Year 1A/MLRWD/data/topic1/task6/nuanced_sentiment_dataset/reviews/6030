I have loved Styx ever since I saw the One With Everything video a few years ago. I am a child of the 60's, but never really knew much of this band except the top 40 songs. Once I saw the full range of these guys, I was awestruck and had to get my hands on more of their albums and videos. I must clarify by saying that I am in love with this present lineup, NOT with the previous band that included Dennis DeYoung. So, to have the chance to hear a concert of the old 70's albums Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight with my favorite lineup was a dream come true. I was blown away by the sound quality and the stage production. That just added to my rock fantasy. Seeing the songs that were not previously recorded live was an added treat and showed the talent and expertise of this team. I must say "team," because, thanks to the extras, I got to know some of the people who are behind the curtain but who do so much to make this a Grade A show. I love this DVD! If you love Styx that way I do, I'll bet you will too.
